We plan to release fiscal 2014 second quarter earnings and same-restaurant sales for fiscal September, October and November 2014 on Thursday, December 19, 2013, before the market opens with a conference call shortly after. We released first quarter earnings results this morning. These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. We recognize that most of you reviewed our first quarter results, so we won't take time to go through them in detail in an effort to provide more time for your questions. We will offer a line item summary of the P&L, discuss our financial outlook for fiscal 2014 and discuss our brand-by-brand operating performance summary. With that, let me turn it over to Clarence. Clarence Otis : Thank you, Matthew. From a same-restaurant sales prospective, this was a difficult quarter for the restaurant industry generally, in casual dining in particular, and obviously, was a difficult quarter for us. This summer's sharp spike down in comparable sales within casual dining follows, I think we all know, were some pronounced spikes up and down this past winter and spring. And so we've concluded that as the sluggish and uneven economic recovery we've been experiencing for some time now persists, we can expect appreciably greater sales volatility in our industry. And it's important for us to be appropriately prepared for that because with the changes that we're making at our 2 largest brands, that volatility is amplified here at Darden. And so as a result of that, we've taken steps that will reduce our operating support spending by $50 million a year on an ongoing basis beginning next year, or fiscal 2015. For this year, fiscal 2014, the reduction will be approximately $25 million, and that will be offset by approximately $10 million of upfront costs to implement the plan. And the plan does involve the elimination of a meaningful number of support positions, about 85. And out of respect for the people who are affected most directly, we won't get into a great deal of detail about what it entails. What's important is that these actions provide us with the financial flexibility in the face of heightened volatility to do 2 things we need to do to regain operating momentum : invest in providing affordability to those guests who need more affordability and invest in refining our offers in ways that are responsive to guests who are more focused on other attributes of their dining experiences. And with that, let me turn it over to Brad to provide some financial detail about the first quarter. C. Bradford Richmond : Thank you, Clarence, and good morning to everyone. Our first quarter financial results were clearly short of what we expected when we spoke to you in June, largely because same-restaurant sales and the guest counts were below our expectations. First quarter financial results were also adversely affected by 2 unusual items that, together, total approximately $0.03 EPS. First, there was a legal settlement related to a trademark issue that unfavorably impact net earnings, and the additional administrative costs associated with the reduction in our total unit growth that we had not factored in. Looking forward to the second quarter, I want to remind you that unlike last year, this year, the Thanksgiving holiday week, which is a soft week for us since we are closed on Thanksgiving, does not fall into the second quarter. Instead, it falls into our fiscal third quarter. We anticipate that the Thanksgiving holiday shift will benefit second quarter blended same-restaurant sales by approximately 100 basis points, and adversely affect third quarter blended same-restaurant sales by a similar amount. Additionally, the spending -- support spending actions that we announced today will adversely affect second quarter earnings. Although as Clarence said, there is a meaningful benefit for this fiscal year as a whole. In the second quarter, there will be an approximately $10 million upfront cost, offset by $3 million of savings in the quarter. The balance of the savings, about $22 million, will be spread pretty evenly across the third and fourth quarters. All of the costs incurred in the second quarter will be in the selling, general and administrative expense line. As we look ahead to the fiscal year, our outlook for total sales and earnings remains the same as it was when we spoke to you at the beginning of the first quarter. We still anticipate total sales growth in the range of 6% to 8%, and we expect blended same-restaurant sales for our larger brands to be flat, which is at the bottom of the 0% to 2% range we discussed in June. We also still anticipate that diluted net earnings per share will be down 3% to down 5%, with the combined benefit of our support spending reduction and the postponement of some of the provisions of the Affordable Health Care Act offsetting the softer-than-expected first quarter earnings. It is important to note that our blended same-restaurant sales expectations for our 3 large brands does assume that same-restaurant sales for the casual dining industry will rebound from what we saw in the first quarter, which, using our fiscal calendar, was the lowest quarterly results in over 3 years. Our outlook assumes that comparable sales for the industry are flat for the balance of the year. Turning more specifically to the first quarter, Darden's total sales from continuing operations increased 6.1% to $2.16 billion. On a blended same-restaurant sales basis, the results for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse declined 3.3% in the quarter, with strength at LongHorn Steakhouse offset by weakness at Olive Garden and Red Lobster. And we saw continued same-restaurant sales gains in our specialty restaurant group with 0.5% same-restaurant sales growth on a blended basis. Food and beverage expenses for the first quarter were approximately 10 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis. This unfavorability was driven by a higher land-based protein and dairy cost. For the first quarter, restaurant labor expenses were approximately 110 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to wage inflation, reduced productivity and sales deleverage at Olive Garden and Red Lobster. Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 140 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis because of the impact of adding Yard House. Since with their restaurant base that's 100% leased, it runs higher restaurant expense as a percentage of sales than our other brand. This represents about 1/4 of the increase on a year-over-year basis. And we had higher repair and maintenance cost across all brands, as well as the sales deleveraging impact at Olive Garden and Red Lobster. Selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat on a percentage of sales basis due to increase in media and media inflation, that was offset broadly by reduced spending. Depreciation expense in the quarter was approximately 35 basis points higher on a percentage of sales basis compared to last year because of the increase in new units and the remodel programs at our larger brands. Our tax rate this quarter was 20.8%, was about 330 basis points lower than the prior year, driven by increases in available tax credits and our tax planning initiatives. We continue to estimate that our annual effective tax rate will be approximately 20%, which is about 100 basis points lower than last year's effective tax rate. This annual effective tax rate though will vary from quarter-to-quarter. In the first quarter, reported total company operating profit margins fell by approximately 300 basis points compared to the prior year. Now turning to our commodity cost outlook. We have approximately 84% of our total food spend contracted through the second quarter of 2014, that's our fiscal year. And we have 38% of our total spend contracted to the end of the fiscal year. We have not fully covered our usage through the fiscal year because we believe that premiums for future contracts are simply too great given where we expect prices to be in the cash market as we look forward. Food inflation in the first quarter was approximately 2%, with beef and chicken inflation in the mid-single-digit range and dairy inflation in the low double-digit range. Seafood inflation was nominal, but we now expect double-digit inflation in the second, third and fourth quarters primarily related to the shrimp production [ph] issues in Asia. The source of the problem has been identified, but getting solutions in place is taking a little longer than we expected when we spoke to you in June. For the fiscal year, our current expectation is that our commodity baskets will see a net inflation in the range of 2.5% to 3%, which is about 50 basis points higher than we expected in June, again driven primarily by shrimp. Category by category, through the second quarter of fiscal 2014, seafood costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 100% of our usage covered; beef costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 75% of our usage covered; poultry costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with the 100% of our usage covered; wheat costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 65% of our usage covered; and dairy costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 55% of our usage covered. Our energy costs are expected to be slightly unfavorable [indiscernible] on a year-over-year basis and we have contracted majority of our natural gas and electricity usage in the deregulated markets in which we operate, through the second quarter of fiscal 2014. And now I'll turn it over to Drew to comment on Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, and then Gene will discuss the Specialty Restaurant Group. Andrew H. Madsen: Thank you, Brad. And as Brad just said this morning. I'm going to comment briefly on the fiscal 2014 first quarter results and key sales dynamics at each of our 3 large casual dining brands. Now as a reminder, on our June call, we outlined the 3 strategic priorities that each of our large brands was going to focus on this year to regain same-restaurant traffic momentum, which is our top priority. And those 3 are : first, delivering our current guest experiences at a competitively superior level more consistently across all our restaurants; improving affordability; and third, evolving the experiences that each of our brands offers so that they remain responsive to what our guests want beyond affordability. Now LongHorn has executed effectively against all 3 of these strategic priorities and that's reflected in their strong sales performance. Same-restaurant guest counts increased 1.4% during the first quarter and exceeded our industry estimate by approximately 490 basis points. Same-restaurant sales were 3.2% above prior year and exceeded our industry estimate by 520 basis points. All measures of operations execution and guests satisfaction continue to improve at our LongHorn, and most notably, their 2 key focus areas of server attentiveness and steaks grilled correctly. In addition, our focus on our lowest performing restaurants is paying off, where the pace of progress on steaks grilled correctly in the bottom quartile is nearly triple the system average. The first quarter was supported by 2 6-week promotions. The first promotion, Steaks that Sizzle, featured 3 new affordable steak dishes priced at $11.99. The second promotion, Fresh Favorites, did not have a price point and reinforced our fresh, never frozen steak, chicken and fish brand equity by featuring 3 core menu entrees, Outlaw Ribeye, Parmesan Crusted Chicken and LongHorn Salmon. Both of these promotions performed well. In addition, we introduced the first of 2 new core menu platforms designed to broaden brand relevance and appeal, especially for those guests who are looking for high-quality, on-trend and distinctive dishes. Peak Season is our platform to bring seasonal news to the appetizer, drink, dessert and side dish categories. Summer choices featured in the first quarter included a Parmesan-crusted asparagus appetizer, fire-grilled corn on the cob side dish and a ranch house cob salad. In addition, this month, we just launched Chef's Showcase, which offers our guests entr\u00e9es inspired by fine dining at casual dining prices. We're currently offering Porcini Portabella Ribeye and Pork Osso Buco.  Despite the strong sales performance, operating profit was below prior year because of our decision to price below elevated levels of beef inflation. Plus, there was 1 extra week of advertising support during the quarter. For the full year, we expect the weeks of advertising support to be the same as last year. Olive Garden same-restaurant guest counts declined 3.8% during the first quarter. This performance trailed our estimate for the industry by approximately 30 basis points. Same-restaurant sales declined 4% and trailed our industry estimate by approximately 200 basis points. Now we're certainly disappointed with our performance at Olive Garden during the first quarter, especially given the improving guest count momentum that was achieved during the fourth quarter last year. Now we have achieved significant progress at Olive Garden on the first strategic priority, to deliver our guest experiences at a competitively superior level, more consistently across all restaurants. In fact, all guest experience measures are well above prior year, especially food taste, value and affordability. And false weights have also been reduced to all-time lows. In addition, we're ahead of schedule with the initial phase of our culinary simplification plan, which we believe will enable more consistent guest experience delivery. We also experienced less check erosion during the first quarter this year compared to the fourth quarter last year, especially during July and August and we expect this trend to continue as we wrap on similar prior year promotion constructs. Our biggest challenge was obviously guests counts, due to weaker overall industry conditions and 1 promotion that did not perform as well as expected in July. More specifically, we exceeded our estimate for industry guest counts during June when we advertised 3-course Italian dinner for $12.95. But we trailed our industry estimate during July when we advertised 2 Italian dinners for $25, which we believe was primarily the result of this promotion not having enough news to wrap on its successful debut at the same time last year. And then, we exceeded the industry again during August behind Never Ending Pasta Bowl. We're also continuing to evolve the Olive Garden experience so that it responds to what guests want beyond affordability. During the first quarter, this included the introduction of a new small plates platform called Taste of Italy, which offers our guests a more flexible and affordable way to enjoy their Olive Garden experience. And shortly, we'll be expanding the small plates section. We plan to begin the expansion of our remodel program at Olive Garden for all non-Tuscan farmhouse restaurants during the second half of fiscal 2014. And we're planning to open 15 restaurants in fiscal 2014, a reduction from the 36 restaurants we opened in fiscal 2013, which will allow our restaurant and leadership teams more time to focus on existing guests while building a stronger foundation for pursuing new guests and new occasions. Red Lobster same-restaurant guest counts decreased 5.9% in the first quarter. This performance trailed our industry estimate by approximately 220 basis points. Same-restaurant sales declined 5.2% and trailed our industry estimate by approximately 320 basis points. So similar to Olive Garden, we're disappointed with this performance, especially following the improved traffic and sales results at Red Lobster during the fourth quarter last year. Guest satisfaction improved noticeably during the first quarter, especially value, server attentiveness and pace of meal, driven largely by a return to 3 table service stations at the end of last year. And after 3 consecutive quarters of decline, checks increased versus the first quarter last year by 70 basis points and improved sequentially by 170 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. But our first 2 promotions, Seaside Mix & Match plus Four Course Seafood Feast did not perform up to expectations during June and July when we trailed our industry estimate on guest counts. During August, we performed in line with our industry estimate for guest counts, supported by Endless Shrimp, which we increased $1 back to the historical price point of $15.99. Now looking forward, next month, we will launch an initiative led by our directors of operations who will spend considerably more of their time in our lower performing restaurants, working with the management teams in a very hands-on manner to help elevate execution to standard, particularly on controllable cost management and especially on labor. And in November, we'll focus on improving culinary execution through some reduction in core menu complexity and by optimizing our food preparation model to help better position all our restaurant teams for success. We're on pace to complete approximately 100 remodels in fiscal 2014, and we expect to end the year with over 90% of our restaurants completed. And now Gene will talk about the Specialty Restaurant Group. Eugene I. Lee: Thanks, Drew. The Specialty Restaurant Group delivered solid performance in the first quarter. Total sales for the quarter exceeded $281 million, which is 72.7% increase from the prior year. This growth was the result of our 65 net new restaurants across the group, which includes 46 Yard House restaurants and blended same-restaurant sales growth of 0.5. The Specialty Restaurant Group continues to deliver consistent sales growth with 14 consecutive quarters of blended same-restaurant sales growth. There was decline at Seasons and there are 2 issues contributing to this sales decline in Q1. First, we've made adjustments to the summer menu we believe will benefit us in the long term. However, these changes have resulted in a decline in check average. Second, there are 3 restaurants in a comparable base that significantly exceeded our expectations when they opened, but their sales have continued to decline well after the typical honeymoon period. However, their current performance is still well above our original expectations. The team is committed to improving the same-restaurant sales trends at Seasons 52 in the short-term while ensuring the brand remains healthy in the long term. In the first quarter, we opened an additional 6 restaurants over last year, and excluding opening expenses associated with these additional restaurants, the Specialty Restaurant Group grew operating profit year-over-year. Specialty Restaurant Group plans to 22 restaurants for the remainder of fiscal 2014 : 4 Capital Grilles, 1 Bahama Breeze, 8 Seasons 52s, 3 Eddie V's and 6 Yard Houses, for a total of 28 for the fiscal year. The group remains focused on improving operational execution, developing on-trend food and beverage offerings that drive sales and continuing to evolve the look and feel of our restaurants. We are on track with our phase integration of Yard House. In the first quarter, both the supply chain distribution network and point of sale systems were converted. In the third quarter, Yard House will transition to Darden's benefits and bonus plans. Integration has been, and will always be, a distraction to restaurant operations. As the integration continues to wind down, we expect to regain same-restaurant sales momentum as the team is able to focus more in the core business. In addition, we are on track to achieve our targeted synergies. As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2014, our fundamentals of the Specialty Restaurant Group remains strong. We're confident in our strategic priorities and are well-positioned to deliver our long-term growth commitments. And now, I'll turn it over back to Clarence. Clarence Otis : Thanks, Gene. Now with the difficult actions we announced today and the steps we're taking to build same-restaurant traffic and sales momentum at our 2 large brands to complement same-restaurant and new restaurant growth at LongHorn Steakhouse and the Specialty Restaurant Group, we continue to believe our near-term earnings targets are reasonable, despite a much more challenging environment than we anticipated back in June. As Brad said however, that does depend on some improvement from what were unusually weak industry conditions in the first quarter. What's most important, though, from our perspective is sustained success. And that is our focus. An intense focus on sustained success is what enabled us to help pioneer our industry, it's what has helped us significantly widen our competitive gap to others in the industry over the past 10 years when it comes to both absolute sales per year and absolute cash flow per year, and it's the driving force as we take the step that we're taking today; steps that we believe will enable us to maintain a strong leadership position in our industry for years to come. Two final comments. First, the action we announced today has been taken with considerable thought for our colleagues and friends who are moving on to other opportunities. We certainly wish them well. And given the company's long-standing values, we will support their transitions in a way that reflects their well-appreciated contributions to this organization. Second, we also announced that after a long and successful career at Darden that culminated in his serving as our President and Chief Operating Officer for the past 9 years, Drew has announced that he's retiring from the company. And what a 9 years it's been. While the past year has had its challenges, Drew has helped build Darden into the clear industry leader. Over those 9 years, we've increased our restaurant base by 71%, our revenues have grown 79%, our earnings per share have doubled, and our total shareholder return's been more than 110%. But I know that from Drew's perspective, what's most important is that he's help make Darden a special place to be, one that has consistently strong employee engagement. And strong engagement is what's enabled Darden to be named one of FORTUNE's 100 place -- best places to work for 3 consecutive years, and we appreciate what Drew has done to get the company to this point. With that, we'll take your questions. So let's get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division : Matthew DiFrisco at Lazard. My question's with respect to, I guess, just looking at the free cash flow. I might have missed this if you gave some guidance on that or updated the guidance on it. I heard you mentioned that in the second half of fiscal '14, you're going to resume the Olive Garden remodel, and that there's a 100 more remodels at Red Lobster. So can you give us an update as far as how that might affect your free cash flow and your CapEx budget in aggregate? C. Bradford Richmond : Yes, Matt, this is Brad. In the guidance we've given before in terms of our total cash flow, and our -- in this case CapEx, we'll incorporate that. We had some testing funds in for Red Lobster's -- or excuse me, for Olive Garden, so they will continue to that and Red Lobster will continue on their plan. So there's really no change in our overall cap expectations. We bounce a little bit around here and there, but no major changes there. Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division : And then I guess I had a question with respect to the specialties division. Gene, I think you mentioned that there was the Yard House -- some integration issues. I guess looking at the comp, was that primarily the reason for the comp going negative, or are there some regional things maybe specific to its Southern California regional exposure? Eugene I. Lee: I think the point we're trying to make, Matthew, is that every time we've done integration, we take the focus off of I think 100% on the guests onto implementing systems. So we've experienced that with LongHorn, we experienced with Eddie V's, and we think we're experiencing that somewhat in Yard House. We wouldn't say there's an issue with integration. We think integration is on track. But the point we're trying to make is that is a distraction. When you change every point of sale or POS terminal inside a restaurant, there is a distraction to every single employee. And until they become unconsciously confident with that, your service standards will drop a little bit. We think we're beyond that at this point in time, and we think that our restaurant operations are improving. And we would expect, if the conditions continues to stay the same or improve, we will see positive same-restaurant sales in Yard House in the next 6 to 12 months. C. Bradford Richmond : Matt, Brad here. Let me just add a little bit more on our free cash -- on our CapEx guidance we provided before. We're saying $600 million to $650 million really working towards the middle of that range and so the adjustments we've talked about here still keeps us in the middle of that range, hopefully, in the bottom half of that range, but clearly probably more in the middle of the range. Operator : For your next question, Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer & Co. Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. You talked about elevating your performance at your lowest performing units plus your brand... Clarence Otis : Brian, we can't hear you on this side. If you could get closer to your microphone. Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : For improvement. And then related to the spending cuts, can you talk about any opportunities beyond $1 million [ph] annually? It sort of seems like this is the tip of the iceberg. I just want... Matthew Stroud : Yes, Kathy, we can't hear him. Brian, can you either pick up your headset or requeue. Thanks. Operator : We'll go to the next question. Michael Kelter, Goldman Sachs. Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes, on the $50 million of cost cuts, you mentioned a reduction of 85 support positions. But you, also in the release, mentioned, beyond the workforce reductions, there were program spending cuts. To what were you referring when you said program spending cuts? And then could you help with the $50 million number overall? Are you confident that there's not more you could do? That that's all you can cut at the organization level? Clarence Otis : Yes, I would say on the program side, we are talking about a number of different initiatives across several functions that we think are value-added initiatives but lower priority than some of the other things that we need to focus on. And so that spans marketing and it also includes some of the things that we've been doing on the supply chain side. So it touches a lot of different places, but it adds up to a meaningful part of that total, that $50 million. I would say that with the cuts that we made, we're pretty comfortable that $50 million, on an ongoing basis, is a reduction. There is the possibility it could be somewhat higher than that, but that's the number we're comfortable with right now. And with that number, we still are able to make the investments that we need to make beyond affordability. And so we are investing in a number of things that we think we need to invest in to stay relevant to our guests as their lifestyles change. And so we're continuing to invest in making our technology platform more robust, for example, so we can better engage with our customers on a -- or from a digital perspective. It also sets up, we think, our opportunity to do a much more segmented, targeted, one-on-one marketing with our customers. And ultimately, hopefully, that will allow us to scale back our broadcast media spend. Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then separately, your free cash flow this quarter post dividend payment was firmly negative. Was there anything particular about the quarter? Or is this a dynamic we're going to have to expect until the business turns around? And given that dynamic, doesn't it make sense to cut CapEx further until the business stabilizes? C. Bradford Richmond : Yes, Michael, Brad here. There are some seasonality to our cash flows, particularly as we look for the year and features that we may run in the different brands during the time. So it is down, principally driven by the earnings that we reported. But in terms of the -- our annual expectations with the guidance we've given, we still feel comfortable with that range. And to the tune of CapEx and opportunities there, we continue to look at those. We're still seeing approximately 80 net new restaurants this year. That's still a pretty good number. If anything, we may be 1 or 2 shy of that versus 1 or 2 over that. But we continue to evaluate those opportunities as we go through the year. But we don't see what we're looking at any need to make more significant adjustments other than the adjustment that Clarence talked about earlier in terms of our support cost. Operator : Your next question, David Tarantino, Robert W. Baird. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And Drew, best of luck as you move towards retirement. And Gene, congratulations on your promotion. My question is for Gene. I was just wondering if you could share some initial thoughts on any changes that you might make in the strategic direction or any opportunities that you see that you might implement as you move into leading the entire Darden enterprise? Eugene I. Lee: I think that what we've outlined is the 2 issues or the 2 issues that need to be addressed. We have to address affordability. We also have to address the need of the consumer who can afford to spend more. And we need to make sure that we continue to improve that part of what we deliver to each and every guest. As far as saying anything more at this point in time, I think, would be irresponsible. What they say, a prescription without diagnosis is malpractice and I really would like to have some time to get to talk to the team in great detail, learn a little bit more about each of the businesses. But one thing I would say is that through my lens, I start from an operational perspective and I hope to bring a little bit more focus operationally to the businesses and that's just my roots. That's where I come from. So at this point, that's really all I want to say and I'll probably have more comments when we get together in December. Operator : The next question, Jason West, Deutsche Bank. Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just want to talk about some of the comments around the industry and the sales volatility, and you guys said some of the changes that you're making at Olive Garden and Red Lobster are somewhat exacerbating the volatility, which we certainly saw from the monthly trends. Just wondering if you could talk more about what's driving that volatility and then just the bigger picture of kind of driving positive comps that you need in the rest of the year to get to the guidance. Clarence Otis : Yes, I would say, as we look at the industry, it was a surprisingly weak summer, given the macro numbers, where we didn't see dramatic change in the economic macro numbers. I mean, still anemic growth, but nevertheless growth. Same thing at the beginning of the year from a macro perspective. But if you look back to the beginning of this calendar year, we've seen some pretty -- more pronounced volatility than we've been seeing before. So some pretty big downward spikes, February comes to mind, followed by some reasonably big up spikes and then we saw the down spike this summer. So as this sluggishness persists, we're getting amplified volatility and hard to say why. I mean, there's been a lot of speculation that consumers have deferred some big ticket expenditures on auto, on appliances, some other things. And as they are forced sort of 6, 7 years into this to replace those, with relatively flat budgets, they've got to do some more disciplined budgeting and dining out is one of the things that may be paying a price for that. We suspect there's some truth to that. And so all of that says that for a lot of consumers, I mean, we're on the right track and really trying to make sure that we provide them with the affordability that they need because they need affordability in order to dine out. We get a little bit more volatility because we're in the middle of change. I mean, we're transitioning and putting more affordability on the core menu than we've had in the past. Some of those things that we changed to, whether they're promotional or on the core menu work better than others. And so that's, I think, explaining our incremental volatility to the industry. Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And just the comments on the guidance, it implies comps will kind of turn positive here for the balance of the year. I mean, do you expect to see that in the near term? Or what gives you kind of confidence that you're going to outperform the industry with a positive comp in the next 3 quarters? Clarence Otis : Yes, I would say a couple of things about the future. I mean, from a industry perspective, this first quarter was really an outlier in terms of the spike down. And so we do hope and expect that that's the case, and that we would see it, as I think Brad said, bounce back from -- it looks a little bit more flat for the balance of the year. That would still mean, for our fiscal year, the industry's slightly down and that's 1 point, 1.5 points worse than we thought when the year started because we thought that this fiscal year would look a lot like last fiscal year from an industry perspective. In terms of our brands, really beginning next quarter. And so first quarter last year, we were pretty much on top of the industry on an overall basis. Red Lobster, a little bit behind, yet Olive Garden sort of [ph] right on top and a little bit ahead and LongHorn, well ahead. But beginning in the second quarter last year, we started to lag more dramatically the second and third quarter. And then we responded to that with a more intensive focus on affordability. So from a year-over-year perspective, we've got softer comps than the industry and that drives some of our expectation. Operator : Our next question, John Glass, Morgan Stanley. John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : First, if I could just ask about the guidance overall. And as I understand it, you've maintained your guidance for the year. I think it's fair to say you missed your first quarter expectations, but sort of correct me if this was in line maybe with yours even though it was out of line with ours. You've talked about 50 basis points more food cost pressure. That's like another $45 million. And now your comp guidance's at the very low end of your range and you're cutting -- your cost cutting, I think, is just $15 million net. So how do you square that with getting to your same old guidance? Is there some offset? And in answering that, could you address this compensation expense? I think it was $0.35 you talked about. Is that now being adjusted down because of the performance in the first quarter? Clarence Otis : Yes, I would -- I'll start and then hand it over to Brad. But clearly, your expectations for the first quarter are higher than ours. And so that means that your expectations for the balance of the year were lower than ours because you're sort of where we were for the entire year. And so there is some of that going on. We also, on the cost side, before the steps that we were taking as we outlined annual guidance, were pretty conservative. And so we had some places where we thought there was some opportunity to ratchet back spending beyond what we announced today. And that was in our guidance, and we're taking advantage of those opportunities. C. Bradford Richmond : I think broadly a couple of unique items is the Affordable Care Act. We anticipated about $0.06 implementation cost of that as we begin the year. It's probably going to be half that cost, maybe a smidgen less because there were some parts that deferred but not all of it. And so we have some costs but that's a little bit of a benefit to our numbers. And I think more broadly is, as you step back and look at this, if you look at the margin contraction on a year-over-year basis, it was really in the second quarter of our prior fiscal year when we got a little bit more aggressive on our promotional pricing and some of that. So there was meaningful margin compression last fiscal year for the second, third and fourth quarter, will now be wrapping on that this year so we don't have as much of that margin contraction. That kind of get to Clarence's earlier points about the quarterly spread that you had. And then also, you saw some areas on a year-over-year basis; LongHorn had a price point -- or a feature that wasn't price pointed. You saw Red Lobster this year in the shrimp, shrimp costs are up. But they price that at $1 higher than the prior year. And even August vis-\u00e0-vis the industry, the consumers recognized that still as a good value. So those type of adjustments that we have planned for the remainder of the year, we won't go into those details at this point. But those are the factors that really help us as we work through the math to say what's a good expectation for our sales and our earnings performance. There's a little less sales, so we're going to do a little bit better through [ph] some of the cost initiatives that we talked about to improve the margins from where they were before to stay in that same earnings range. John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And if I could follow up, just first if you can just maybe address the -- if the $0.35 compensation piece was adjusted or not? And then just wrap this in my second question as well, which is the volatility you're seeing in sales surprises me in that it's up and down versus the industry, so I understand you can't control the industry trends. Why do you think that volatility versus the industry exists? Is it because your own promotions continue to maybe not be as consistent -- it's an internal issue? Or are you continually being surprised by what the competition's coming out with and so you're reacting more or you are being hurt by those external forces and individual competitors moving the efficacy of one of your promotions around? Which do you think it is? Clarence Otis : I think, as we look at same-restaurant sales, obviously, marginal guests are critical, so every incremental guest. And a lot of those incremental guests are driven by price and affordability. Our brands are at the top of the range when you look at the check average continuum in casual dining. And so when you get sentiment swings that affect consumer spending and consumers get more cautious, we're going to feel that a little bit more regardless of what else is going on and that's just a reality but that same reality is why our operating cash flows are as high as they are. C. Bradford Richmond : And John, Brad here. On the comp part of your question, yes, I mean, we were below our expectations for the quarter. So we talked about approximately $0.35 year-over-year compensation headwinds. It's not that coming out now. We're not going to detail how much but it is less. But we built our expectations which is what that comp expense is built around. This quarter was not as strong as broadly the market was looking at that. So it was clearly a number of pennies [ph] that we had in the first quarter, but there's still a fair amount of that ahead of us in quarters 2 through 4. Operator : The next question, Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Drew and Gene, my best wishes and congratulations as well. I have a question based on the -- Drew's departure. Dave Pickens was promoted in July to a position that sounded like he may have been in line to succeed Drew. And of course, that was not the case. So can you talk a little bit about that, give us some perspective on Dave's role and kind of the driver of the decision to move Gene over into the COO role? Clarence Otis : That was not the intent when we made the move with Dave. We had a position that we feel is important, which is to have someone lead some important operations initiatives that cut across all the brands beyond what needs to get done day-to-day within each brand to support the business. And so we've got things, for example, like the Affordable Care Act rollout that cut across all the brands that requires senior leadership to really get developed and implemented appropriately. And so Dave is working on that. He's working on some other cross-brand operations initiatives that we've we don't want to talk about for competitive reasons. That's an important role and he'll continue to do that in support of Gene. I think as we looked at where to go when Drew announced his decision, we've got a lot of talented people. Gene has been in the restaurant business for 30 years. And he has seen a lot of different kinds of brands, mass market brands, specialty brands. He knows that broad range of customers. He has a terrific sort of intuitive feel for why people dine out, what they want out of restaurants, whether that restaurant's a diner or a fine dining restaurant. That intuitive feel, along with all the other things he learned over time, are important as we talk about refining the guest experiences that we provide to respond to guests' needs that are pretty dynamic. And so that operational background is very important. And Gene's also served as Chief Operating Officer of an enterprise, certainly not as big as Darden, but still, when you look at the restaurant business, a relatively large enterprise and that was rare, which was $1 billion plus in annualized revenues when we acquired it in 2007. Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then a question on the CapEx. Brad, you said you would hope to be around the midpoint of the $600 million $650 million range. Given the industry weakness, are you making adjustments at this point to fiscal '15? What are your thoughts on the sort of the CapEx trends in fiscal '15? C. Bradford Richmond : Yes, we -- Jo, we continue to look at that. Like I said earlier, it's more likely to drift down than up for sure. We continue to look at those opportunities. And we're just -- as we look into next fiscal year because particularly the new unit component of that investment, which is the biggest part of that, biggest single part, those are long lead decisions, 12 to 18 months. So further dramatic revisions in the current year, not likely. We'll continue as we move this year to make adjustments that we see appropriate as we look at fiscal '15. But more likely to be down, with the exception of the SRG brand. Strong business model, strong brands performing well. We'll continue to invest strongly there. Clarence Otis : And I would just add, Joe, when we talked a while ago, that as we look at '15, we're going to be pretty cautious, pretty focused on business trends as we think about Olive Garden. We're down the '15. And so we have the ability for sure to be flexible downward there and that's something that we preserve. And then even as we look at the brands that Brad mentioned growing more robustly, we're pretty focused on making sure that we don't get ahead of our sort of talent pipeline. And so this year, Gene talked about 8 restaurants at Seasons. That number is certainly not going to go up. And to the extent that it changes, it may go down slightly to make sure we don't get ahead of ourselves from a talent pipeline perspective. Operator : Next question, Jeff Bernstein, Barclays. Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Two questions. Just first, a follow-up from a comp perspective. It seems like you guys are happy with the most recent August trend perhaps running ahead of the industry. But broadly with that volatility increasing and it being accentuated at your brands, just wondering whether you see that as a driver of maybe increased promotional intensity or can you size up what you're seeing in terms of the industry as they're dealing with this volatility and perhaps how you would like to position yourself in terms of your response? And obviously, you're trying to balance promotions versus long-term brand building. But just trying to get your sense for how the industry is dealing with this volatility. Clarence Otis : Yes, I would say, Jeff, too early to tell. And so August was certainly better than July, which was really a tough month, down roughly 4% in the industry. But August was still a tough month, down about 1.7%, I think that's about right. A little too early to tell the industry response at this point. Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division : But I mean, just more broadly, you talked about calendar '13 being volatile in February and July. I'm just wondering what you're seeing across the industry as everyone is battling with this kind of consumer sentiment volatility being so enhanced. What are you seeing in terms of the competitive landscape? Clarence Otis : I think everyone's focused on their spending and their support platforms and making sure that they've got flexibility there. And so I don't think we are alone in that. Other people have more structural opportunities on the efficiency side than we might have in some areas that we've already addressed, so supply chain, for example, and some of the inter-restaurant systems. But the moves that we announced today really are enabled by some steps that we've taken in the last couple of years. So in marketing, for example, we've separated responsibility for current periods. So that tactic's from responsibility for multi-year evolution that allows us to be more efficient from a support staffing perspective actually and marketing and operations. We've got some -- a new multiunit leadership level that we feel enables us to have somewhat wider spans of control at the old leadership levels. On the support side, the technology work that we're doing further automates not just supply chain but a lot of the data collection, data mining, operational and financial reporting, and that allows for some efficiency from personnel perspective as well. Operator : Next question, Will Slabaugh, Stephens. Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Could you help us figure out what's going on relative to your intent of the lower entry price point promotions and then how you think those are being perceived by the guests and how that's mixing in the check? I guess, I'm just trying to get at the lack of traffic impact there from those promotions. Andrew H. Madsen: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the very last part of your question? Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Yes, just saying I'm trying to get to the lack of traffic impact from those lower price point promotions? Andrew H. Madsen: Yes, I think the biggest question there is making frameworks that we've got, like 2 for $25 or a 3-course meal, even more distinctive by each brand. So there's been a couple of questions about, do we need to increase our intensity promotionally? We don't think we do. We dialed that up last year already, and we'll be wrapping on that, as I think Brad mentioned earlier, over the next 3 quarters. So we don't think we need to dial it up. We think that we need to refine it in a way that does a better job of bringing in the incremental guests and not just trading existing guests to a somewhat lower priced dish, which is what happened with Red Lobster in particular in June. And you can see that way it's working at LongHorn and that's ultimately what we want to move towards. C. Bradford Richmond : Will, Brad. I think to only thing I'd add to Drew's comment is we talk more about same-restaurant sales, we also have additional insight of the traffic. We -- our 3 large brands have been above the industry on traffic. They were this most recent quarter, as well as the prior quarter. So building the traffic and keeping our brands in front of the consumers during this time. We're making good progress there. Obviously, we want to build the check as well but we can be patient and build the business for the longer term, more so than just the particular quarter that we're in. Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Got you. And as a quick follow-up there, it sounds like your plan for the year assumes some improvement in the restaurant macro environment, and correct me if I'm wrong there. But could you talk, just assuming that things don't improve, what that free cash flow generation outlook might be and what you would start to look to, either cut cutbacks or et cetera to preserve that dividend? C. Bradford Richmond : Yes, we have said on an annual basis, one point of same-restaurant sales for us is in the neighborhood of $0.15 EPS and so you can work that back into the cash flow. But even as you see a little bit in the first quarter, a company of our size, a large balance sheet like -- that we have, there are other opportunities that we're working on to enhance our cash flow opportunities. Some of those are the timing of certain events. We had some of those going against this in the first quarter around certain payments and things like that. So we can continue to manage through those throughout the year to help manage the overall operating cash flow that we have. So there's still opportunities there. We've talked about some CapEx, continuing to evaluate to make adjustments there. But by and large, we do look at our annual projection and we do need the industry to improve some back to that flattish level, if you will, for our fiscal year as part of our expectation. Clarence Otis : From a cash flow perspective though, we have talked about what that point of comps is worth and it's roughly $30 million on what is roughly $1 billion annual operating cash. And so it's not a dramatic -- as dramatic a move at the operating cash level as it is at the reported earnings level. Operator : Our last question, Andy Barish, Jefferies. Andrew M. Barish - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Two quick ones. On the promotional stuff, I guess, how is -- with the price points relatively similar, how are you kind of really getting at affordability? Is it through sort of electronic, digital stuff that we're not necessarily seeing on TV? Can you sort of address that? And then just as a follow-up on operating margin guidance, I think it was down 60 to 80 bps. Is that essentially the same? And with the 2Q so skinny, it implies kind of a -- almost a flattish back half operating margin. Is that kind of what you're thinking still? Clarence Otis : Yes, I would start on the first one and I'll hand it off to Drew but it's -- inside that price point, what's the quality of the particular product that you're offering? So consumers are very savvy. And so to the extent we have the same price but we have a better product, then that's going to put us in a better situation from an affordability perspective. Andrew H. Madsen: Yes, and that's largely what I meant by saying we've elevated our promotional intensity. The price points are going to vary by brand, but we want to make sure that what we're offering within those constructs is distinctive and differentiated and compelling and high quality. I mean, that's ultimately the way we're going to win with those. C. Bradford Richmond : And Andy, Brad here. On the margins, thanks for asking that. We are looking for roughly the same margin impact that we've talked about at 60 basis points, give or take a little bit, and maybe a little bit hard to see when you look at the first quarter. I'll go back to the comment I made earlier that our promotional approach that we had really took hold last year in our second fiscal quarter. And so the margin contraction that you've seen in the first quarter is not what you should be projecting for the remainder of the year. Your comment on doing the quick math is probably about right. The remainder of the year is -- may vary some by quarter, but roughly flat is what we're looking at because we're wrapping on a very similar comparison last year in our strategies. Matthew Stroud : We'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. We recognize there are still some of you in the queue who had questions. We'd certainly be happy to answer those, if you want to give us a call here in Orlando. Thank you very much for joining us, and we'll speak to you in 3 months. Operator : All right. Thanks for joining today's call. Just to remind you that the toll-free replay number for today's call is 1 (888) 568-0421 or 1 (203) 369-3921. This completes today's conference.

A copy of our press release announcing our earnings, the Form 8-K used to furnish the release to the Securities and Exchange Commission and any other financial and statistical information about the period covered in the conference call, including any information required by Regulation G, is available under the heading Investor Relations on our website at darden.com. We plan to release fiscal 2014 third quarter earnings and same-restaurant sales for fiscal December, January and February 2014 on Friday, March 21, 2014, before the market opens with a conference call shortly after. Additionally, we are planning to host our annual Analyst and Institutional Investor Meeting in New York City on Friday, March 28, 2014, beginning at 8 :30 a.m. Eastern Time. This meeting will also be webcast for those unable to attend. More details will be forthcoming shortly. We released second quarter earnings results this morning. These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. Because we have much to cover this morning, we'll briefly offer a line item summary of the P&L for the second quarter, discuss our financial outlook for fiscal 2014, briefly review our progress at Olive Garden and then review in detail the strategic action we announced this morning. We have a slide show presentation that you should be able to access through the webcast link at darden.com or videonewswire.com. After the presentation, we will take your questions until approximately 9 :45 a.m. Eastern Time. With that, let the turn it over to Clarence. Clarence Otis : Thank you, Matthew. Industry conditions this quarter are an affirmation that our industry is in a period of significant change. And to better address that change, this morning, we announced the comprehensive strategic action plan that includes spinning off Red Lobster, reducing new unit expansion, a more intensive focus on operating cost efficiency and refining our incentive compensation plan. The actions we're taking are clearly exciting steps forward for Darden, and we believe these actions enhance our ability to create compelling value for our shareholders. Let me touch briefly upon our sales results for this quarter. Once again, LongHorn had competitively strong same-restaurant sales results, and our Specialty Restaurant Group continued to maintain good momentum. Importantly, we also had good same-restaurant sales progress at Olive Garden, which had significant improvement compared to the first quarter and closed its gap to the industry benchmark by a considerable amount this quarter. And Gene is going to discuss Olive Garden's plan and progress against that plan in a little bit more detail in a moment. In contrast to the rest of the business, Red Lobster had significant deterioration this quarter. And we'll discuss our strategic action plan, as Matthew said, further shortly. But first, let me ask Brad to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Brad? C. Bradford Richmond : Thank you, Clarence, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter financial results was short of what we expected when we spoke with you in September largely because same-restaurant sales and guest counts were below our expectations. Second quarter financial results were also adversely affected by 2 unusual items that, together, totaled approximately $0.05 EPS. First, there were certain costs associated with the support expense reduction we announced in September. These adversely affected earnings by a net of the benefit by $0.02. Second, there were advisory and other costs associated with the completion of the strategic review that is the basis for the action plan announced today, including the plan to separate Red Lobster. These adversely affected earnings by approximately $0.03. As we look forward to the full fiscal year, our outlook for total sales and earnings has changed since we spoke with you at the beginning of the second quarter. Given the continued industry sales softness and trends at our brands, we now anticipate total sales growth in the range of 4% to 5%. This reflects our expectation that same-restaurant sales for the year will decline 4% to 5% at Red Lobster and 1% to 2% at Olive Garden and increase 2% to 3% at LongHorn Steakhouse. Our outlook assumes that comparable sales for the industry will be flat to down 1% this year, which is about 50 to 100 basis points lower than we had expected before. With our lower sales expectations, we anticipate that diluted net earnings per share will be down between 15% and 20%. The primary reason for this change since we last spoke to you is a downward adjustment in our expectation for Red Lobster for the year. That downward adjustment reflects Red Lobster's first half trend and the potential for some disruption there as we complete the spinoff. The earnings expectation for the year includes the onetime items we incurred in the second quarter but excludes incremental costs incurred during the balance of the year in connection with the strategic action announced today. Now turning more specifically to the second quarter. Darden's total sales from continuing operations increased 4.6% to $2.05 billion. On a blended same-restaurant sales basis, the results for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse declined 1.0% in the quarter, with strength at LongHorn Steakhouse offset primarily by weakness at Red Lobster. Olive Garden made good progress but not quite as much as we had anticipated. And we saw continued same-restaurant sales gains in each of our Specialty Restaurant brands with the group achieving a positive 4.1% same-restaurant sales growth on a blended basis. Food and beverage expenses for the quarter were approximately 35 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis. The unfavorable price increase was driven by higher shrimp and land-based protein costs. For the second quarter, restaurant labor expenses were approximately 65 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to wage inflation, reduced productivity and sales de-leverage at Red Lobster. Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 40 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis because of higher repairs and maintenance across all brands, higher workers' comp expense and the sales de-leverage at Red Lobster. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 25 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to decreased media expense at Red Lobster and Olive Garden. Depreciation expense in the quarter was approximately 20 basis points higher on a percentage of sales basis compared to last year because of the increase in new units and remodel programs at our larger brands. Our tax rate this quarter at a credit of 9.4% was approximately 30 percentage points lower than the prior year, driven by available tax credits and our tax planning initiatives. We now estimate that our annual effective rate will be approximately 17%, which is about 400 basis points lower than last year's annual effective tax rate. This annual effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter, though. In the second quarter, reported total company operating profit margins fell by approximately 140 basis points compared to the prior year. Our cash from operating activities increased -- excuse me, from operating activities increased by over $35 million through the second quarter of the fiscal year as changes in working capital declined as part of our ongoing supply chain optimization cost savings initiative. Now turning to our commodity cost outlook. We have approximately 53% of our total food spend contracted through the end of the fiscal year. That's roughly in line with the 60% we had last year at this time. We have not take -- fully covered our usage through the remainder of the fiscal year because we believe that premiums for future contracts are simply too great given where we expect prices to be in the cash markets as we look out. Food inflation in the second quarter was approximately 2.4%, with shrimp inflation in the high teens and land-based protein inflation in the mid single-digit range. Shrimp inflation is expected to increase in our third and fourth fiscal quarters, primarily related to production issues in Asia. We don't anticipate relief on shrimp until early in fiscal 2015. For the current fiscal year, our expectation is that our commodity basket will see net inflation in the range of 2.5% to 3%, which is about 50 basis points higher, primarily driven by shrimp, than we expected in June but is consistent with the expectation we talked about in September. Now category by category, through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, seafood costs are higher on a year-over-year basis with 75% of our usage coverage; beef costs are higher with 55% of our usage coverage; poultry costs are slightly higher with 40% of our usage covered; wheat costs are lower with 30% of our usage covered; and dairy costs are slightly higher on a year-over-year basis with 15% of our usage covered. Our energy costs are expected to be slightly unfavorable on a year-to-year basis, and we have contracted the majority of our natural gas and electricity usage in the deregulated markets in which we operate for the remainder of the fiscal year. And now let me turn it over to Gene to discuss Olive Garden's progress. Eugene I. Lee: Thank you, Brad, and good morning. Olive Garden continues to make progress towards our goal of renewed same-restaurant sales momentum. Same-restaurant sales results for the quarter trailed the industry modestly, and our same-restaurant guest count results were better than the industry. This represents an improving trend relative to the competition and reflects successful implementation of some early pieces of the brand renaissance plan that Dave George and his team put in place following Dave's appointment as President of the Olive Garden in January. The first phase of the plan involves simplifying operations, systems and processes. Dave and his team have redesigned kitchen processes to reduce complexity in food preparation and on the line. These changes have resulted in significant labor savings. And even more important, they've led to significant improvements in the food we're serving our guests. While some of the labor cost savings are flowing through to earnings, we're using some to fund other improvements in Olive Garden's guest experience with a particular emphasis on elevating the quality of our proteins. In the kitchen, we've also completed the rollout of our new Piaztra [ph] grills, which is a flattop surface grill. It's made our grilling simpler and significantly enhanced our grilling capabilities. Finally, we see a number of other opportunities to further simplify and enhance kitchen operations, and our culinary and operations teams are prioritizing these opportunities. As we work to reduce kitchen complexity, we're also simplifying the front-of-the-house operation. One example is our steps of service at lunch. We have revamped so that our guests can, if they chose to, have a much quicker lunch experience at Olive Garden. As a result of what we've already done to simplify what we do operationally, Olive Garden has seen great improvement in its overall guest satisfaction scores on both a quarterly sequential basis and compared to prior year. Beyond operational simplification, since Dave became President in January, the Olive Garden team has invested considerable time and resources in rethinking the core menu. That team includes Jim Nuetzi, who has been the Executive Chef at Olive Garden for the past year and was Executive Chef at The Capital Grille for the prior 11 years. We're addressing the need our more financially stretched guests have for everyday value by developing more innovative entry price offerings with a keen focus on making sure that these items have great quality and represent meaningful variety. In parallel, to increase our attractiveness to guests who are not financially constrained and want more differentiated Italian fare than we've been offering recently, we've been developing more culinary-forward offerings across a full range of price points but with particular focus on higher price points. From a promotional perspective, we expect to make these new compelling -- we expect to make these compelling new core menu items, both those that target financially constrained guests and that target more financially comfortable guests, the focal point of our promotions. In terms of timing, we have multiple tests of new core menu items and platforms in markets now, and we're very pleased with the initial reactions from our guests. We expect many of these items and platforms to be introduced nationally sometime this fiscal year. Remodels are important part of our future. Remodeling our approximately 400 non-Tuscan farmhouse restaurants is an important part of the brand renaissance plan for Olive Garden, and we have design options we're excited about. The design teams have been focused on expressing today's Italy in a casual dining environment. We'll complete testing over the next several months, and our goal is to remodel 50 to 70 restaurants over the next 12 months. For competitive reasons, I've intentionally been relatively high level about the various aspects of our brand renaissance plan. I can tell you, however, that I'm excited. I'm excited because we continue to make progress on the select few things that, together, will strengthen what, given Olive Garden's industry-leading restaurant level sales and returns, is already a strong brand. And we're confident that improving brand relevance will drive sustained same-restaurant guest counts and sales growth well into the future. What I will promise you is that I'll discuss these initiatives in quite a bit more detail at our Investor Conference in March. Now we'll turn it to Clarence to discuss our strategic action plan. Clarence Otis : Thanks, Gene. And as I said at the outset, we're very excited about the strategic action plan. It is a comprehensive plan to enhance shareholder value, and we appreciate this opportunity to review that plan with you. To help with that review, we've prepared a short slide presentation summarizing key elements of the plan. And I'll use that to help guide my remarks. Now Matthew has already referenced our disclosure around forward-looking statements, and so we can move right to Slide 3. Darden is a premiere full-service restaurant company with excellent brands and tremendous expertise in the areas that matter most to success in our industry. Following an extensive internal review, our board has approved a new direction forward that leverages our market position, our brands, our expertise and our other assets to better address some important changes in consumer demand and competitive dynamics in the restaurant industry. It's a plan that will help us most effectively increase long-term shareholder value. In developing this plan, we assessed a number of alternative ways to segment our portfolio of brands and leverage our other assets, including our real estate. We're excited about the path we've chosen because it enables us to continue to benefit from the complementary strengths of our brands. We'll be able to generate strong cash flows that support continuation of our current dividend on a combined basis post separation, as well as meaningful growth and return of capital at Darden post separation while funding expansion of the business at a rate that continues to build market share. The first element of the plan is the separation of Red Lobster. Although no final decision has been made on the form of separation, we do expect to execute this transaction as a tax-free spinoff to our shareholders that would close in early fiscal 2015. However, we may also consider a sale of Red Lobster as a potential alternative for maximizing shareholder value. The second element of the plan involves some changes in capital allocation. Now these include reducing capital expenditures through suspension of new unit growth at Olive Garden following completion of a few units that are well down the development and construction pipeline, more limited new unit growth at LongHorn and continuing new unit growth at the Specialty Restaurant Group at a pace that is modestly below this year's level. This will lower our ongoing capital expenditure requirement by approximately $100 million annually, freeing up cash to return to our shareholders. In addition, we're affirming our decision to forego additional acquisitions for the foreseeable future, and that will also help ensure more consistent return of capital to shareholders. The third element of the plan involves increased focus on operating support cost efficiency. The last quarter, we announced our intention to reduce operating support cost by $50 million annually. And since then, we've identified an additional $10 million in savings, bringing ongoing annual support cost savings to at least $60 million. In addition, and perhaps most importantly, we will focus much more intensively on operating support cost reduction as we complete the separation of Red Lobster and following the separation. And we'll do that in order to ensure that our cost structure is as lean and efficient as practical for the business. The fourth element of our plan involves changes in our management compensation incentive plans. Our board has decided to refine those plans, beginning with the performance plans for next fiscal year to more directly emphasize same-restaurant sales growth and free cash flow growth. This is a step that will better align management incentives with 2 performance measures that are even more important given the other changes we're making and that play a significant role in driving shareholder value creation in the restaurant business generally. Again, as we make these strategic changes, we expect that on a combined basis, the 2 companies will maintain Darden's current quarterly dividend level of $0.55 a share. The strategic action plan we're pursuing will significantly enhance shareholder value. By separating Red Lobster from the rest of the business, this plan better enables the management teams of the 2 companies to focus on what are increasingly divergent operating and strategic priorities and quite distinct value creation opportunities. Following the separation, Darden will also have a meaningfully stronger sales and earnings growth profile. And the other elements of the plan will support further return to capital to shareholders, which is going to be key strategic focus for both companies going forward. Slide 4 provides a summary of how we expect the spinoff transaction to work. Again, we anticipate that Red Lobster will be spun off as a separate publicly traded company sometime early fiscal 2015. Now this is all subject to regulatory and third-party approvals, as well as confirmation of tax-free treatment. Post spinoff, we expect the new Darden to use proceeds from new debt raised at the new Red Lobster to retire a portion of Darden's existing debt. This should result in a flat to modest overall improvement in Darden's leverage levels. We currently have an investment-grade credit rating. That rating is very important to us strategically, and we expect the new Darden to preserve it going forward. In addition, we expect new Darden to maintain an attractive, consistently growing dividend. And as earnings grow over time, we should be able to gradually reduce our dividend payout ratio even as our dividend also grows. Again, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase will also be a priority going forward, and we expect to be able to increase our repurchase level in the near term based on the steps we're taking and then over time as cash flow grows. The new Red Lobster will have a capital structure that's optimized to leverage the strong cash flow generation profile of that business. And we anticipate that this will result in a strong non-investment-grade credit rating. Significant return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase will also be a priority at the new Red Lobster, with a stronger bias toward dividends initially. Slide 5 provides an overview of the strategic rationale for the separation of Red Lobster. It's increasingly clear to us that Red Lobster's operating priorities are different in some very important ways from those of the rest of Darden. And these differences stem from the fact that the appropriate guest targets for the 2 parts of the business are increasingly divergent. Now all of our brands have been focused on 2 things : maintaining relevance to guests who fit their core profile; and increasing relevance in pockets of consumer strength that are outside their core. As we pursue these 2 objectives to a large extent, the brands benefit from shared marketing, culinary, digital and other resources. When we talk about pockets of consumer strength, one example is more financially secure consumers. Another is younger consumers given just the sheer size of that category. With the exception of Red Lobster, all of our brands are having success increasing their relevance to these various pockets of strength. At Olive Garden, for example, we had 11% more visits last year, fiscal 2013, from guests with household income over $100,000 than we did 5 years earlier in fiscal 2008. And for that same period, visits to LongHorn from those guests with income demographic increased by more than 50%. In contrast, Red Lobster traffic from this income demographic was flat in 2013 compared to 2008. And the results are similar when it comes to other efforts to broaden the guest base. As a result, we believe Red Lobster will benefit from sharper focus on its core. A separation will enable it to do just that while the rest of the business continues working to both retain their core and expand their customer base. Because of these differences in appropriate guest targets, Red Lobster and the rest of Darden have significantly different sales and earnings growth prospects. They have significantly different sales and earnings volatility and capital requirements. And ultimately, they have quite separate and distinct opportunities to drive long-term shareholder value. The spinoff will transform Darden into 2 new independent public companies that can each focus on their different opportunities. And finally, a spinoff, when combined with the other actions we're taking, will result in stronger alignment of management incentive compensation, increased financial transparency and improve our ability to serve differing shareholder investment objectives. The Slide 6 lays out the new unit cost management and return to capital direction for new Darden. As indicated, we expect the new Darden to be able to achieve higher same-restaurant sales growth, have more moderate new unit expansion and CapEx needs, have the benefit of greater than initially forecast cost savings and a much more intensive ongoing focus on cost reduction, all of which repositions the business for further enhanced return of capital to shareholders through both consistently growing dividends and consistent, meaningful and growing share repurchase. Going forward, there will be minimal new growth -- new unit growth at Olive Garden, and LongHorn's new unit openings will be reduced dramatically, going to 15 to 20 units annually from the 30 to 35 we've been targeting previously. This represents approximately 25 fewer units annually for Olive Garden and LongHorn. And in addition, new unit growth within our Specialty Restaurant Group will be reduced modestly by about 5 units annually to 20 to 25 new restaurants a year. Together, these changes will result in approximately $100 million less in new unit capital expenditures, reducing our current annual new unit capital expenditures to $200 million, down from about $300 million today. And again, we plan to redirect the improved cash flow from reduced CapEx and cost savings toward enhanced return of capital to shareholders primarily in the beginning in the form of additional share repurchase. As shown on Slide 7, both companies will be well positioned for continued success following the transition. New Darden's core strategic focus will be on retaining core customers and expanding our customer base. And while both of these things, expanding our customer base and new unit growth, will require selective investment, both will also support cash flow growth, enable us to consistently increase the amount of capital return to shareholders. New Red Lobster's focus will largely be on retaining its core customers and on using its strong and consistent cash flow generation to support what will be a more stable rather than growing return of capital to shareholders. As a financial metrics highlight, both new businesses will have the average unit volumes and the overall earnings and EBITDA scale to continue to be leaders in the full-service restaurant segment. However, each business will have its own distinct financial strategy, one that best serves its shareholders. While New Darden, as I said earlier, will have an investment-grade credit for profile and reduced overall debt load, new Red Lobster will operate as a strong non-investment-grade credit with leverage level that's supported by its strong free cash flow profile and that will be in line with other similarly cash flow oriented restaurant peers. In addition, we expect new Red Lobster to have a dividend payout ratio of approximately 75% on an ongoing basis, while New Darden will have an initial payout ratio that's between 70% and 75%. That ratio will be reduced over time as earnings growth exceeds overall dividend growth. Slide 8 provides a snapshot of the financial performance of both businesses over time. And as you can see, Darden, excluding Red Lobster, has grown sales robustly over the past few years. And while EBITDA has flattened recently, it's still well above where it was 3 years ago. Conversely, Red Lobster has had fairly consistent rather than growing sales, and its EBITDA has been pressured recently, largely by both increased promotional activity and elevated seafood costs. Red Lobster's management team will be working to develop stronger, more targeted plans to reinvigorate sales and stabilize cash flow going forward. Slide 9 gives you an overview of New Darden. As you can see, we will hold a balanced portfolio of best-in-class brands, a portfolio that combines proven brands that have leadership positions and strong cash flow, with others that are proven but earlier stage and have significant runway for additional unit expansion. We see an attractive sales and earnings profile for New Darden with mid- to high single-digit revenue growth and low- to mid-teen operating income growth. In terms of cash flows, reduced new unit capital expenditure, increased support cost efficiency and meaningful free cash flow growth over time will also allow for greater return of capital to shareholders. And with this financial profile, as well as the strong collective experience and expertise that's buttressed by improved incentive alignment and what will continue to be a winning culture, we believe New Darden will have much improved, long-term shareholder value creation prospects. Slide 10 provides key highlights about our portfolio of compelling brands. So Olive Garden is one of the largest full-service dining brands in the United States and is the #1 Italian full-service brand in the country. As a result of very strong average sales per restaurant and a superior business model, Olive Garden also has industry-leading unit-level and brand-level returns. And as Gene outlined earlier, Dave George and the team at Olive Garden are making good progress on a number of fronts that will enable the brand to stabilize and then return to industry leadership on same-restaurant sales and further improve on its industry-leading position overall. We look forward, as Gene said, to be able to share some details about Olive Garden's plan with you certainly at our investor meeting in March but also as we get further into the separation process. LongHorn is also a leading brand. And since we acquired the brand 7 years ago, LongHorn has been transformed and is now poised to become America's favorite steakhouse. LongHorn's trends from a unit economics perspective are attractive as well. And then finally, our Specialty Restaurant Group is organized to leverage experienced leadership cadre to drive the growth and success of 5 premiere high-volume, high-return brands that each have compelling and differentiated guest propositions. Now this morning, we have emphasized return of capital to shareholders because it will continue to be a key priority for both companies moving forward. And as shown on Slide 11, Darden has a long track record of returning capital to shareholders with almost $4 billion returned through share repurchase and dividends over the last decade. Slide 12 highlights what will remain the same and what will be some of the key differences for Darden post-separation. Darden will remain a leading multi-brand operator with a balanced portfolio of brands, and our commitment to quality and menu innovation will continue, as will our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We will continue to have a strong cash flow profile. We expect to retain our investment-grade credit profile, and our business will continue to be supported by an experienced management team that's passionate about its brands. So what's different? As I said earlier, we expect higher and more consistent sales and earnings growth driven by an expanding customer base and restaurant footprint. We'll also have a more balanced commodity purchasing profile, reduced quarterly sales and earnings volatility, more meaningful growth in free cash flow, improving credit metrics and an even sharper focus throughout the company on same-restaurant sales and free cash flow growth, which again are even more important given our new strategic direction. Now let me briefly highlight what new Red Lobster will look like post separation. The key strengths and opportunity for the business lie in its heritage as an iconic American brand that helped pioneer the casual dining sector, its strong and consistent annual free cash flow generation and the dedicated and highly experienced team that will lead the business. With the improved guest targeting that the spin will enable, Red Lobster will, we believe, more quickly and more sustainably achieve same-restaurant sales stability and margin improvement. And then looking out, we think that as a standalone company, Red Lobster can generate low-single digit revenue growth and mid- to high single-digit operating income growth. Given its core guest base and the nature of seafood, there will continue to be volatility in quarterly sales and earnings results. But in contrast, annual cash flows have been strong and consistent, and that's expected to continue. And Red Lobster's cash flows, the new Red Lobster, should support substantial and stable return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. We are truly excited about the quality of the management team we've assembled to lead Red Lobster following separation. Kim Lopdrup, who will serve as CEO, brings strong leadership capabilities, with extensive experience with Red Lobster and in the food service industry generally. Kim currently serves as President of the Specialty Restaurant Group and was President of Red Lobster from our fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2011. And during this time, he spearheaded the revitalization of the brand, a revitalization that resulted in strong sales and earnings growth. Kim is the right person to lead and deliver on the strategic objectives for the new Red Lobster. Kim will be supported by Salli Setta, who will continue in her role as President of the Red Lobster. And should, as expected, the separation take the form of a spinoff, Brad Richmond, who's been Darden's CFO for nearly 7 years, will be Chief Financial Officer of the new Red Lobster. Post separation, Red Lobster will continue to be an iconic American casual dining brand with a dominant position in the casual dining seafood special segment. The business will also continue to have a strong and steady cash flow profile aided by a leaner organizational structure, and the fact that following the Bar Harbor remodel program that's nearing completion, its repairs and maintenance CapEx requirements will be modest. So all in all, we're absolutely thrilled about the comprehensive strategic action plan that we've put in place. Now let me close by reiterating what Brad covered at the outset, which is our outlook for fiscal 2014. We now expect to open approximately 75 net new restaurants this year. That compares to our prior expectation of 80. Same-restaurant sales are expected to be down 1% to 2% for Olive Garden and up 2% to 3% for LongHorn, and that is down somewhat in each case from our earlier expectations since we now believe that for the full year, the industry will be softer than we previously anticipated. The biggest change, as Brad said, from previous expectations is in Red Lobster's same-restaurant sales, which we now expect to be down 4% to 5%. As Brad indicated, this reflects first half results at Red Lobster as well as the potential for some disruption as we work through the separation. Combined with our same-restaurant expectations for the Specialty Restaurant Group, all of this means that we now expect overall revenue growth of 4% to 5%, which is below our previous estimate of 6% to 8%. And with the sales shortfall and the second quarter costs associated with our new strategic direction, we now expect net diluted EPS for fiscal 2014, excluding any second half costs related to the strategic action plan, to decline 15% to 20%. Once again, as we look forward, we're very excited about our comprehensive action plan. This is a plan that reflects thoughtful discussions among our management team, our board, our shareholders and our advisers. And we're confident that this plan offers the most potential to enhance long-term shareholder value. As Slide 18 highlights, we have a significant amount of work to do in the coming months, but we promise to keep shareholders apprised of our progress as we make this exciting transition. That brings us to the end of our prepared remarks. And so now we'd like to open it up to questions and answers. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : So prior to an activist investor getting involved, I'm curious how many of the business model strategy shifts that you guys outlined this morning have you been considering, and that's specifically the idea of a standalone Red Lobster. Clarence Otis : Yes, we've actually -- we've been really reviewing the business pretty comprehensively for some time now. And it reflects what we've been seeing in the industry. And so last year was disappointingly -- our last fiscal year, from an industry perspective, disappointingly weak. So the same-restaurant results less than 1% coming after a year that was not particularly strong. We had anticipated something stronger than that. And we also, as we put our plan together for this year, assumed that this year would look like last year. So we did not assume improvement. We thought that was a relatively conservative assumption. And as the year unfolded, it's been even weaker than last year. And in the face of all of that, we've been looking pretty comprehensively at our plan. We've been talking to a lot of our long-term shareholders, and we've been thinking about various alternatives that might make sense in terms of adjustments to our plan. And Red Lobster's been part of that thinking. The separation Red Lobster has been part of it. Our new unit expansion pace has been part of that thinking, and support cost reduction has been part of that thinking. We got further along faster on the support cost reduction part, and so we announced that a little bit in advance of the rest of it. But we've been looking at it for a while. Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Just one other quick follow-up. Just looking at the numbers, it looks like the majority or at least the lion's share of that combined $60 million in cost management efforts will be at the corporate level. So I'm just curious why you have not been more aggressive or what theoretically is preventing you from being more aggressive at the restaurant level in terms of pursuing cost efforts across management within the restaurants themselves? Clarence Otis : Yes, and I think a couple of thoughts. One is Gene talked about some of the things that Olive Garden has done as it tries to simplify operations. And the goal is twofold. I mean, one is to improve execution. And we believe we're doing that based upon the consumer satisfaction feedback that we're getting. And the second is to be more cost efficient in the restaurant. And some of those cost efficiencies are flowing through. Some of them we're reinvesting in the guest experience. But Olive Garden, for example, had an operating profit increase this quarter despite same-restaurant sales are a little bit below what we had anticipated. And some of those in-restaurant cost savings are part of that. We are further along at Olive Garden on that score than we are at LongHorn, but that's certainly a focus at LongHorn as well. And it will be more of a focus at Red Lobster. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Co. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : On the business separation, you're separating a business in Red Lobster that has been a major headwind on your performance. But the decision to keep Olive Garden in this new DRI is a big decision because its performance was such a large sensitivity factor on the earnings profile of the new DRI, and it doesn't necessarily completely separate or allow the growth brands that are performing well to be in their own dynamic. It will likely still be a company that as Olive Garden goes, so goes the company. So the first question, I think, number one, and I'll have a follow-up after this, is why exactly do you want to keep Olive Garden in that portfolio and not separate it as well? Same-store sales were still negative this quarter against what were pretty easy comparisons. And I know traffic outperformed the industry, but we're still dealing with the negative comps there. Clarence Otis : Yes, I touched upon a little bit of it earlier. So I mean, the priorities really at Olive Garden away from unit growth are very similar to the priorities at the other brands. So we're trying to make sure we maintain relevance to our core consumers and that we broaden our reach to some other consumers that are in some pockets of strength. And we're seeing Olive Garden be able to do that. And so all the support that we have, the integrated support structure that works operationally for our other brands works operationally for Olive Garden. The other thing I would say is that Olive Garden has always been, and is today, a significant piece of the Darden story. So that doesn't change. Olive Garden's sales and earnings results, though, are much less volatile than Red Lobster's. And so we don't see the same volatility going forward. And the other thing is that Olive Garden's cash flow growth as we stabilize same-restaurant sales, even without unit sales, is significant. And it really benefits the rest of the brands to have not just that absolute cash flow generation but that growth in cash flow. And it benefits shareholders because it drives growth, meaningful growth, along with the new unit growth at the balance of the business and free cash flow. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. And what was impressive is under a slightly negative comp, not only was the operating profit margin was up at Olive Garden and the absolute profits were up. Is there any way you can comment on the magnitude that operating profits were up at Olive Garden in the quarter? Clarence Otis : Brad? C. Bradford Richmond : Yes. I think first off, that speaks to the part of the earlier question. There's cost savings occurring in the restaurant. A lot of that is being reinvested beyond the $60 million that we talked about. But I would say from a margin perspective, it was pretty significant both in terms of the basis points. We don't get to brand specifics, but it was meaningful for us. And obviously, with the new unit growth, which those [ph] new unit growth, they're profitable sales growth, the magnitude of the absolute profit was something that we're pleased with the progress. As Gene said, we're excited with where we are and where we can go forward from here. So I'm feeling much better about where the brand is. And as Clarence mentioned earlier, they're further along than LongHorn in making some of these moves that we've talked about. So we're pleased. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Great. And just lastly, do you know when we might get a full Red Lobster P&L? C. Bradford Richmond : No, that's something we're in the process of right now. So we need to get to the audited process to really share those given the nature of what we're talking about. So it will be probably a couple of months out, but as soon as we have those available, we will start the share those with the investment community. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer of RBC. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I have 3 super short questions, which I'll just rattle off to you guys. Darden owns, I believe, about 50% of the land, 85% of the buildings across the business. How is that different at Red Lobster? My sense is it might be higher than that. That's first. And second, can you spin off this Red Lobster business without overhead de-leverage to the remaining co.? And third, can you give a little bit more detail about the executive incentive structure and how that's changing? Clarence Otis : I'll start with the second and third and let Brad answer the first on real estate. And so there are -- there is some additional support cost that we would incur as a consequence of the separation. We are working to minimize those. So Red Lobster is going to be a lean organization as a standalone company. And Darden, excluding Red Lobster, would be a leaner organization beyond the cost savings that we've already announced. We're not in a position at this early stage really to give a sense of the magnitude of that. That is something that we will get into, though, as we get further along. But we feel confident that we can minimize those incremental support costs that come with having 2 companies. The third question was on incentives. So from an incentive perspective, right now, our incentives are driven by sales growth and earnings growth. So both our annual incentives and our multiyear performance stock units. And we would expect that same-restaurant sales would be part of the annual incentive as opposed to total sales. And then we are looking to have a measure of free cash flow growth for the multiyear, where we think that, that's appropriate as opposed to earnings per share. But there's still some work to do there from the board's perspective to settle on the specifics, and we'll update you on those as the board reaches some final conclusions. C. Bradford Richmond : Now on your first part of the question, we detailed some of that on Slide 7 of the presentation. So you can see, with where we are today of the 705 Red Lobsters, 473 of those would be where we own the real estate. So that's just a little under half of Darden today's owned property. So a lot of it will move to Red Lobster. The remainder of the Red Lobster units are virtually all land leased and that we own the building on those. Operator : Our next question comes from Todd Duvick of Wells Fargo Securities. Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : First of all, I appreciate your comments about the plans to pay down debt and maintain your investment-grade credit rating. And I guess just one question I have related to that, can you tell us if you've vetted this with the rating agencies? And if not, when do you plan to talk to them about your plan? Clarence Otis : Yes, we've been in dialogue with them. And so we've received some feedback. We're continuing to share information with them. Obviously, they're going to make their own determination. But we have a good track record from the past of working to take the actions that we think are necessary to preserve investment credit profile. We know it's very important from a strategic perspective. And so on the new Darden side, we will continue to work aggressively to ensure we retain that type of profile. Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just with respect to with respect to the Barrington proposal. They talked about the formation of a REIT for the real estate. Is that something that is in consideration of -- with Darden management currently? Clarence Otis : Well, as we conducted this review, one of the things we did was evaluate the potential for a REIT. And as we went through that evaluation, we believe that the value creation opportunity is limited. And we believe that, that's the case because the Darden REIT may trade at a lower multiple than others so the net lease REIT and the substantial debt breakage cost that are involved. And so that is not something that we think makes sense going forward. And we think the plan that we've outlined is a plan that best creates shareholder value. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs. Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes. I guess first question, you're halting all Olive Garden unit growth at this point. Is this, in your view, a temporary move given your current situation and you expect to grow units again in the future? Or have you come to a new conclusion about the brand's unit growth opportunity from here? Clarence Otis : No, I think it's really that we think the focus at Olive Garden needs to be on regaining same-restaurant momentum. And so this is a suspension really that would last the next 3 years at a minimum. So that's what we see. In terms of the ultimate unit potential, we think the ultimate unit potential is still much higher than where we are today. And the reason we think that is as we look at the units that Olive Garden's -- the new units that Olive Garden's opened over the last 4 years, they exceed -- despite the slump at the business overall in the last couple of years, those units still exceed our return hurdles from a return on capital investment perspective by a substantial amount. But the key priority right now is to make sure that the base business is as strong as possible. And we think that suspension of new unit growth is appropriate to do that. And we also think that it's appropriate because it boosts free cash flow and enables us to return more capital to shareholders near term and improve our credit metrics, both of which are very high priorities over the next several years. Eugene I. Lee: Mike, I would just add that this is about focus in Olive Garden right now, and this allows us to take some resources that we're spending time on opening 15 to 20-plus restaurants a year and put them on the this brand renaissance project, which we're -- again, as I said, we're very excited about. And so to me, it's really about just focusing on regaining same-restaurant sales momentum. And this is an important part of that effort. Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : The other question I had is you mentioned in your prepared remarks that SG&A was lower this quarter from reduced marketing expenses at Red Lobster and Olive Garden. Is that just the timing of initiatives or have you decided to reduce your annual budget for marketing for the brand more broadly? Clarence Otis : Yes. I would say it's 2 different answers. So for Olive Garden, that's just timing. For Red Lobster, we believe there's an opportunity to reduce marketing as a percent of sales. Over the last couple of years, it's floated up higher than is sustainable. And that's going to be a key focus area for the new Red Lobster going forward. Olive Garden marketing as a percent sales is in a place that makes sense for a national brand. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Buckley of Bank of America. Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : You had said in the presentation that you gave us that the key to whether this could create value or not is on those operating income growth numbers, low- to mid-teens at the new Darden and mid- to high-single digits at the new Red Lobster. Why are those credible given the track record? Clarence Otis : Well, we think that the key at the New Darden really is to stabilize same-restaurant sales growth at Olive garden. And we are confident in the plan we've got to do that. We also will get past some of the onetime headwinds that we've got that have depressed earnings such as some of the incentive resets that we've talked about in the past. But we think the key really is to stabilize sales at Olive Garden. We're seeing improvement relative to competition. And so as we said, we're closing that gap. We've got other things in the pipeline that Gene talked about that give us confidence we'll continue to close it. At Red Lobster, we believe that the focus that they will get on target guests, on core guests, as a result of the separation will make a significant difference that they have been, along with the other brands, really trying to broaden the reach that works for the other brands. It's been working. They are broadening their reach. Red Lobster has not had success there. And so additional focus on core guests and away from sort of trying to broaden reach, we think, will help Red Lobster significantly. Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So when you look at those 2 growth metrics, the ones at the New Darden and the ones at the new Red Lobster, what kind of Olive Garden same-store sales growth do you need to get to mid- to high-teens operating income growth? And what kind of Red Lobster same-store sales growth do you need to get to mid- to high single digits? Clarence Otis : I'd say in each case, 1% or 2%. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason West of Deutsche Bank. Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just a couple of modeling questions. I didn't quite see if you guys put it in the presentation. But how much of the dividend and the balance sheet debt will sort of get allocated to Red Lobster under the new structure? Clarence Otis : That is still to be determined. So until we are further along in the audit work, of course, we can't answer yet. But we will provide that information as soon as it's available. Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then I think there was $260 million EBITDA number for Red Lobster. I don't remember if that was LTM or if that was fiscal '13, but I'm assuming you guys are modeling that number quite a bit lower for fiscal '14. I mean, any sense of what that number is going to look like on a run rate basis for Red Lobster given the new guidance today? C. Bradford Richmond : Yes. What we're showing there, I should remind everyone, is unaudited financial results. So that's going to change some. But that's a good basis to work from. And as we talked about for the current year, the lower same-restaurant sales expectation of Red Lobster, there is about a flow-through that lowers sales expectations, 30% to 35%. And so to your point, it will be lower but not as dramatic lower as folks may think. And it tends to be an opinion of the impact of same-restaurant sales for Darden. 1% across all brands for an annual basis is about $32 million, $33 million in operating cash flow. So it is important to the health of the brand, but it's not as dramatic as its impact on the overall operating profit in the near term. So I'd just remind you that until we can get out and share more specific numbers on those measures. Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : That's helpful. And just one other quick one. Clarence, you mentioned the REIT structure and you looked at that and you said Darden, you think, would have a lower multiple than other REITs and there would be substantial debt breakage costs. Can you just talk a little bit more about those 2 factors and what that means in terms of why the REIT doesn't make sense exactly? Clarence Otis : Yes, we don't want to get into the analysis. But as we look at comparable REITs, certainly you have to discount for the fact that there's very little -- no diversification, really, in a Darden REIT, and the debt breakage costs are hundreds of millions of dollars. Operator : Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh of Stephens. Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division : I want to go back to the cost savings initiatives you have and how we should think about that $60 million number. And should we think about that as a maximum number of cost savings that you're willing to take out of the business before being concerned you would negatively impact the guest experience, I guess, is the first part of that. And secondly, can you address the additional field personnel that you explained the need for at the most recent Analyst Day and then how you're thinking about that right now? Clarence Otis : Yes, I would say a couple of things. One is that we don't think of it as a maximum, actually. We think there's opportunity. We'll be working hard against those opportunities through the separation process and afterwards. And it really is about being more cost efficient in the support areas that are not those areas where we're making -- we have made significant investments. So we have invested in some new capabilities in order to broaden our reach, digital capabilities, marketing capabilities. But the support cost away from that is where we're taking a very hard look and we think there's more opportunity. What I'd say just as a final piece is in terms of the new capabilities, we don't think that there is incremental investment that needs to be made. We've gotten where we need to be. And so at this point, it really is about getting the benefit of those additional capabilities. C. Bradford Richmond : Yes, and your question on the field capabilities we've added, we have relooked at that and continue to modify the operations structure to become a little bit more efficient. But we are pleased with where we are operationally at this point from a structure standpoint. Clarence Otis : And I would say the last thing is as we look out, some of the new marketing and digital capabilities that we've added, really our designed to enable us to have much more robust one-on-one conversations with guests. And as those scale up, we would expect our television marketing expenses to scale down dramatically. And so it is an upfront investment in really trying to meaningfully improve the business model down the road. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Hessler of Bank of America. Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I realize not everything is set in stone at this point. I mean, are there any sort of qualitative comments that you can offer on Red Lobster's going to be a high-yield, mature brand? What do you think is the appropriate amount of debt and leverage might be at that entity? I'm just trying to figure out how that entity might be capitalized once you execute on these plans? And then I have one follow-up. Clarence Otis : There's still a lot to be determined there as we work through this, but I would start with the new Darden piece. The importance of this investment-grade credit profile there, work very hard to maintain that and be in a position to continue that going forward. On the Red Lobster piece, as you've seen, barring a bit of near-term headwinds, its annual cash flows are quite substantial. They're pretty durable. And as we look at it, it's not going to have a need to fund growth. Its CapEx will be greatly reduced. And so it will have a debt load that probably positions it below investment-grade profile. So we're looking at it right now but not dramatically below that. And so still more to come on that. But that's how we view it as we look at it today. Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then have you thought at all about how you plan to sort of monetize that spinoff? I think Red Lobster's been in the portfolios for quite a long time, maybe since the '70s or so. So I would imagine that the tax basis there is relatively low. And in that case, if you want to monetize it, would you have to do something like a debt exchange? I mean, I'm not sure how much you guys have thought through the details there or what you're willing to share today, but I think a debt exchange often allows you to monetize the asset in excess of the basis. So any comments that you would have there? Clarence Otis : Yes, you're getting quite detailed and quite technical. But yes, we have reviewed those. We've been well advised, and we are looking at exploring those options to make sure that we maximize shareholder value through this transaction. I'd say just stepping back a little bit from some of the finer points is we do expect this to be a tax-free exchange transaction for our shareholders, and we will take advantage of whatever planning opportunities are there to minimize debt cost, debt load for Red Lobster and make sure that we get the greatest shareholder value out of the opportunity as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just a couple of questions as well. First, I'm just wondering, on the real estate side of things, you addressed the -- your concern around the REIT. I'm just wondering whether there was a sale leaseback considered at all or whether or not you can walk us through why might that not work. Separately, the second question, I was just wondering on Red Lobster -- or actually, Olive Garden as well, whether you consider holding Red Lobster and/or franchising either one of the brands. I know that's been talked about as maybe an option, especially for Red Lobster. It's such a mature brand and fundamentals have been slowing. And then lastly, I'm just wondering why maybe LongHorn unit growth is being slowed. It seems like we're only halfway their maturity and the performance is strong. Just wondering whether it's something to do with the real estate or what might keep you from -- or why slow down at LongHorn growth. Clarence Otis : Yes. And I'll start with the last 2. And so at LongHorn, it was very important for us to get to a scale where we could have national cable advertising, and we reached that scale. And to get to that scale, as you think about the balance between the pace of expansion and talent pipeline, we'll lean into expansion and take a little bit more risk on talent pipeline. Now that we're there, we feel like we don't have to take that risk on talent pipeline. So we want to be at a pace that really enables us to be pretty confident as we put the management teams in place, and we're there. In addition, as we said, we think that in the environment we're in, return of capital to shareholders is a more important value creation lever. And we like to improve our credit metrics, and slowing growth at LongHorn contributes to both of those. In terms of franchising, when we looked at the Olive Garden and the returns at Olive Garden, we like to own 100% of that return. I mean, it's the highest returning brand in our portfolio. Essentially, Olive Garden and Capital Grille, the 2 of them have the highest returns. And so we don't really see a whole lot of value creation in giving those returns to shareholders -- to franchisees. Red Lobster has a different return profile. It's got more variability in returns within its portfolio, and so franchising is something I'm sure that Brad and Kim will take a pretty hard look at. C. Bradford Richmond : Yes. And well, let me just add one comment to Clarence's on the LongHorn pace. You've heard us talk about reaching national cable media. This is the first year now that they have that through all of their promotional cycles. And so that's why the timing of this one works out where it does. Like you said, it's the balance that we need given where we are in terms of unit growth and talent pipelines. On the sale leaseback, as Clarence mentioned earlier on, we have an ongoing discipline of looking and reviewing for strategic opportunities. And we've always seen in the past that sale-leaseback opportunities, given where Darden was and our access to lower-costing public company debt given our credit profile, they just haven't made sense. As a part of this review, we went back and looked at that again. And really, it hasn't changed a lot, and so it still doesn't make sense for us at this point. Like I said, it's a new opportunity for Red Lobster. We're going to review that even more in depth down the road, but nothing I would expect immediately. And we didn't see things that made sense. So it's not something that's high on our list right now. But we're always out there looking. And if conditions were to change, we would not hesitate to look at that. Operator : Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays. Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I just wanted to go back to a comment you made around your overall leverage being flat to modestly improved at Darden. Just given sort of the shrinkage in the existing profile of new Darden, how much flexibility will you have to, let's say, actually decrease debt more if necessary, potentially flexing some of the share repurchase you're looking to do in order to maintain the rating? Clarence Otis : Yes. I would point to 2 things real quickly. And that is around the reduced CapEx. We talked about a range of $100 million, maybe even a little bit above that. And so that provides a fair amount of flexibility. And as you've seen in this year's financial results, the second quarter, the operating CapEx, even in a tough environment like this, continues to grow and improve above prior years. So we've seen a couple of big levers to continue to improve operating cash flows outside of -- or excuse me, total cash flow outside of just the straight operating performance that we have. Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then as we think about, I guess, just the Red Lobster piece, if we were to explore a sale, would sort of the use of proceeds, I guess, be consistent with some of your thoughts around separation? Clarence Otis : Yes. We would look at that, and you'd see that greatly go to reducing debt, as well as the balance of that as return to our shareholders. We don't know exactly what form that would take at this point in time, and there's more to be learned. But we do know we need to work on both sides of the debt profile but also maintain a strong return to equity holders as well. Matthew Stroud : That's all the time we have this morning for questions. We'd like to thank everybody for joining us. We recognize there's still some folks in queue. We'll be happy to try to answer your questions throughout the day here.

We plan to release fiscal 2014 fourth quarter earnings and same-restaurant sales for fiscal March, April and May 2014 on Friday, June 20, 2014, before the market opens with a conference call shortly after. We released third quarter earnings results this morning. These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. We'll review the P&L for the third quarter, discuss our financial outlook for fiscal 2014, and then we will take your questions until approximately 9 :30 Eastern Time. With that, let the turn it over to Brad. C. Bradford Richmond : Thank you, Matthew and good morning everyone. Our third quarter earnings were in-line with our expectations, excluding the impact of the more severe winter weather and the legal, financial advisory and other costs related to implementation of the strategic plan we announced in December of 2013. Together these unusual items totaled approximately $0.13 in earnings per share. We estimate that the severe winter weather adversely affected earnings by approximately $0.07 and that legal, financial advisory and other costs associated with the strategic plan adversely affected earnings by approximately $0.06.  Now focusing more specifically on the results for the quarter, Darden's total sales from continuing operations decreased 1.1% to $2.23 billion. On a blended same restaurant sales basis the results for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse declined 5.6% in the quarter, with strength at LongHorn Steakhouse offset by weakness at Olive Garden and Red Lobster. Same restaurant sales also declined 0.7% in our Specialty Restaurant Group.  Now looking at the larger brands individually, U.S. same-restaurant sales increased 0.3% at LongHorn Steakhouse and declined 5.4% at Olive Garden and 8.8% at Red Lobster. These results include the adverse effect of the more severe winter weather which was approximately 160 basis points and the adverse effect of the shift in Thanksgiving holiday week which was worth approximately 100 basis points.  Excluding these impacts same restaurant sales for the third quarter would have been, up approximately 2.9% at LongHorn Steakhouse, down approximately 2.8% at Olive Garden, down approximately 6.2% at Red Lobster and up approximately 1.9% at the Specialty Restaurant Group.  Food and beverage expenses for the third quarter were approximately 40 basis points higher than the last year on a percentage of sales basis. Then favorability was driven by higher shrimp and land based protein cost. Giving the pending separation of Red Lobster I will call out their results on each line item.  From a food and beverage perspective Red Lobster's expenses for the third quarter were approximately 110 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due primarily to very significant shrimp inflation. Restaurant labor expenses were approximately 10 basis points higher than last year for the third quarter on a percentage of sales basis. On this line we achieved productivity gains in most of the brands and combined with favorable Group insurance and unemployment taxes that mostly offset the effects of wage rate inflation and sales deleveraging.  At Red Lobster restaurant labor expenses for the third quarter were approximately 100 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to sales deleverage, wage rate inflation and some decrease in productivity. Restaurant expenses for the quarter were approximately 80 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis because of sales deleverage. At Red Lobster restaurant expenses for the third quarter were approximately 140 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to sales deleverage and increases in worker's compensation and public liability cost.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 50 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due entirely to cost associated with the implementation of the strategic plan. More specifically these costs which include legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, retention bonuses for Red Lobster managers and various other fees totaled over $13 million this quarter. At Red Lobster selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were approximately 120 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to our decision to reduce spending in December and January from what were elevated levels. Depreciation and amortization expenses in the quarter were approximately 40 basis points higher on a percentage of sales basis compared to last year because of the increase in new units and the remodel program at Red Lobster. Separately Red Lobster depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter were approximately 90 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to the remodel.  Our tax rate this quarter was 10% and was approximately 13 percentage points lower than the prior year primarily driven by lower earnings and because of tax benefits associate with one of the company's employee benefits plans. We now estimate our annual effective rate will be approximately 14%, which is about 700 basis points lower than last year's annual effective tax rate.  This annual effective tax rate will of course vary from quarter-to-quarter. In the third quarter total operating profit margin declined by approximately 220 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding Red Lobster and the cost associated with implementation of our strategic plan, operating profits would be 120 basis points better.  As we previously announced we are on track to realize $60 million of annual cost savings by the end of fiscal 2015 as a result of the actions we announced in September. In the third quarter we realized $2 million of cost savings from these actions and we should realize a similar amount in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2014 we are on track for approximately $28 million in gross savings that are offset by $11 million in upfront implementation cost for a net savings of approximately $17 million. In addition which we said previously with the Red Lobster's separation we are looking for additional cost savings opportunities and we retained Alvarez & Marsal to help with this effort and with identifying new revenue enhancement opportunities.  Now turning to our commodity cost outlook; we have approximately 74% of our total food spend contracted to the end of this fiscal year, a little less coverage than typical for us at this point in the cycle because we believe the premiums for future contracts are simply too great given where we expect prices to be in the cash market as we look forward.  Food inflation in the third quarter was approximately 3.1% with shrimp inflation in the 35% range and land-based protein inflation in the mid-single digit range. Shrimp inflation is expected to stay at this level in the fourth quarter because of production issues in Asia. We see signs of progress emerging but we don't anticipate relief on shrimp prices until early fiscal 2015. The fiscal year 2014 our current expectation is that our commodity basket will see net inflation in the range of 2.5% to 3% which is about 40 basis points higher than we expected when we began the year, again driven primarily by even higher shrimp and moderating but still higher beef cost.  Now category by category on the year-over-year basis through the fourth quarter fiscal 2014 shrimp cost are higher with 100% of our usage covered, beef costs are slightly higher with 75% of our usage covered, poultry costs are slightly higher with 40% of our usage covered, wheat costs are lower with 60% of our usage covered, dairy costs are slightly higher with 75% of our usage covered and our energy costs are expected to be slightly unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. We have contracted the majority of our natural gas and electricity usage in the deregulated markets in which we operate through the fiscal fourth quarter of this year.  Looking ahead fiscal 2015 we have approximately 25% our total food spend contracted to the end of the second fiscal quarter. Our outlook for food inflation at Darden, excluding Red Lobster is approximately 1% to 2%. We anticipate that most of the food inflation will come from proteins, particularly beef and seafood. We expect some favorability for chicken and wheat related products.  We expected diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2014 to decline between 15% and 20% compared to fiscal 2013. This reflects our projection that combined U.S. same restaurant sales growth for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and Long-Horn Steakhouse this fiscal year will be minus 2.5% to 3%. This is below the minus 1% to minus 2% we anticipated previously with a change in expectations due largely to meaningful downward adjustment and the forecast of same restaurant sales results at Red Lobster. Current earnings expectations for the year also reflect the opening of approximately 70 net new restaurants and the net impact of the September support expense reduction efforts as well as the legal finance advisory and other cost incurred in the second quarter in connection with our strategic review and related actions.  Earnings forecast for fiscal 2014 does not include costs we have incurred in the third quarter or are likely to incur in the fourth quarter in connection with the separation of Red Lobster and other strategic actions announced in December.  And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Gene for some comments. Eugene Lee :  Thanks Brad. I\u2019ll start this morning with a few comments about our third quarter sales, specifically about choices we made in December that affected Olive Garden and Red Lobster and then I will provide a high level update on the brands.  On absolute basis December is always a very strong month for both brands. In the planning process this year however we did make some very important adjustments to our promotion and advertising plans for the month. Last year both Olive Garden and Red Lobster featured discounted price point of promotions during December, which was a departure from our prior practice. This year we decided not to use this kind of price point promotions during this high volume period. Instead our advertising focused on the core equities of each brand, and in restaurant we emphasized the core menu.  We also reduced our media spending during this time period so Olive Garden was only on air three out of the five weeks this year versus four out of the five weeks last year and Red Lobster reduced the total rating points they purchased by 20%. Additionally we decreased the number of incentives in circulation compared to last year.  These significant changes in marketing tactics were made to return us to more sustainable and healthy management of our business. Beyond that, as we have been communicating the Olive Garden team is executing a brand renaissance plan. The plan includes a focus on a holistic core menu and promotional plans designed to deliver superior value, choice of variety and convenience. We implemented the most comprehensive menu change in the brand\u2019s history on February 24, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter. Execution of the new menu continues to improve every day and we\u2019re encouraged with the initial guest feedback we\u2019re receiving.  Another component of the plan is to re-image our non-Tuscan farmhouse restaurants. The first remodel is on track to be completed by the end of April and the second is starting soon. Red Lobster had a challenging quarter with sales impacted by weather, the reduced media waves, our promotional decisions and guest confusion that resulted from inaccurate press reports around the announcement of the separation. We are pleased however that guest satisfaction recovered to best-ever levels during the quarter, and sales trends improved as the quarter progressed, especially once Lobster Fest began. This year's Lobster Fest has more new items than in prior years and has been very well received.  LongHorn Steakhouse's same restaurant sale exceeded the industry benchmark for the fourth consecutive quarter. The team is focused on offering compelling promotions, supplemented by additional menu items in the Chef Showcase Selection. The operations team continued to improve results in two important focus areas; big [inaudible] correctly and server attendance, resulting in meaningful improvement in guest satisfaction scores.  LongHorn continues to benefit from multi-pronged brand refresh they began several years ago, that is similar in many respects to Olive Garden brand's renaissance plan, which strengthened the operation foundation, added superior value, choice and variety and convenience and updated the atmosphere to remain in sync with rising guest expectations.  The Capital Grille continues to have strong sales momentum and we\u2019ll open five new restaurants this fiscal year, four of which have already opened. This focus remains on creating exceptional dining experiences, through innovative coronary offerings and personalized service.  The Yard House integration is behind us. The team is focused on regaining same-restaurant sale momentum, mastering the new systems implemented and opening new restaurants. We recently opened a 22,000 square foot restaurant in Las Vegas in the new Linq entertainment district, adjacent to the 550 foot tall High Roller, the world\u2019s largest observation tower. This will be a flagship restaurant and create a lot of exposure for the brand. We\u2019ll open a total of eight restaurants this year.  Same restaurant sales at a few restaurants have been inconsistent at Seasons 52 over the last year. That should improve as we slow new restaurant growth from a percentage of the base perspective. This will enable us to ensure we have strong management at each restaurant that can consistently execute our culinary service standards at a high level.  During our recent growth period we have experimented with different types and sizes of buildings and now know which site characteristics make for the most successful Seasons 52. We have opened a few seasons in central business districts and in malls that don\u2019t permit us to show full branding. And some of these restaurants are performing well below system average. We will be focusing our future developments on the upscale suburban trade areas where the brand excels.  Bahama Breeze same-restaurant sales continue to exceed the industry benchmark. This sales strength has been driven by the significant changes we have made in the menu over the last two years and the very effective happy hour programs we implemented last year. Additionally in restaurant execution has meaningfully improved.  Eddie V's continues to perform well and the two new restaurants we have opened are performing above our expectations. Now I'll turn it over to Clarence. Clarence Otis, Jr.:  Good morning everyone and we do welcome this opportunity to speak with you and take your questions, but before turning to questions, I'd like to briefly address the consent solicitations underway to call a special meeting of Darden shareholders to consider a non-binding resolution prior to our annual meeting. Our Board is strongly committed to engagement. We value the views of our shareholders and as many of you know, we've had a robust investor relations efforts since becoming a public company nearly 19 years ago. We've consistently spent and we'll continue to spend an extensive amount of time talking directly with our shareholders and with the investment community. In terms of our more recent business circumstances and potential path forward we appreciate the input we've received and these insights are reflected in the plans that we have announced. Given the significance of the initiatives underway at Darden, we believe it's important that we continue engaging with our shareholders directly and individually so that we receive input in a productive and nuanced manner.  With respect to the consent solicitations shareholders should make their own determination. Given our extensive ongoing discussions with shareholders and the substantial value we have gleaned from those conversations we believe that shareholder should continue to engage directly with the company and should not view a special meeting as a substitute for that ongoing two way engagement. We look forward to continue to speak with our shareholders and with the investment community. And with that operator, we'll take some questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And we'll take our first question comes from David Palmer with RBC. You may ask your question. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Thanks, thanks guys. First really two part question, one on media weight. Could you just talk about what your strategy is there with media? There was a reduction in both brands, I believe you said that in the comments, particularly on Olive Garden, why that might be, perhaps you're saving that for the push behind this new menu and then that brings me to the second question how is that going? That new menu is a big event for that brand and obviously visibility on that would be helpful? Thanks. Clarence Otis, Jr.: Good morning, David. On the media weight on Olive Garden, first part of it was just the way the holiday schedule fell and so we always have a hiatus week after Thanksgiving and so that fell in to Q4 -- to Q3 this year instead of second quarter and we've always taken a hiatus week the week after Christmas. And so that really wasn't a huge departure on Olive Garden. On Red Lobster it was a conscious decision to pull back the total rating points by 20% as we -- that spending just got a little too high in that time period.  We are also trying to balance that very busy time that allows -- that we're -- we want to make sure that we are not over incenting -- putting too many incentives out, that displace guests who are willing to pay for our full price experience with guests who are using some sort of incentive to come in. So that was a big part of the decision. The second part of your question, new menu, new menu is doing well, as I said in the comments, it was a big change and so execution was what we thought it was going to be as we introduced it. We have been very pleased with how quickly our operations teams have picked up this new menu and we're seeing guest comments or complaints drops very, very quickly and actually getting -- receiving a lot of positive comments here over the last few days. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS. You may ask your question. Keith Siegner - UBS: Thank you very much. Gene, just some questions on Red Lobster considering that the shareholders do currently own it, if it was spun they would still own it and even if it was sold there would be some efforts to try to ascertain what the appropriate value was. I appreciate the resetting of the media weights and maybe some additions to the Lobster Fest menu but could you talk just little bit more about maybe some other efforts that are in place to help address those three months of double digit traffic decline. Thanks. Clarence Otis, Jr.: Again I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let Gene comment but I do think we do want to make sure that we have the right level of media, and so we feel like it had drifted up too far over time and we need to bring that back and we also feel like we need to have the right balance between discount offers and non-discount offers, and we think we've gotten out of balance in terms of having a few too many discounts because an important part of the Red Lobster brand is for a lot of guests it is a special occasion experience and we want to make sure that we continue to deliver on that and we aren\u2019t pushing those guests out with too much of a focus on the discounting side. And so we think that\u2019s getting the brand back to where it needs to be in terms of really what current users look to Red Lobster for.  And the other thing that the team is focused on really mirrors a little bit of what Dave -- George talked about at Olive Garden which is making sure that the foundation, so the in restaurant operating execution is stronger and we have seen some plateauing there, in a couple of different dimensions, some stepping back and so some intensified focus there. Gene? Eugene Lee :  The only thing I would add is that we thought that the promotion that we ran in December was going to be more effective than what it was. It tested very well and we were focusing on superior sea food. It really resonated with the consumers in test and then when we put it in market it did not perform at the level we thought it was going to perform at. So we did believe the plan that was in place was going to work better and we had a quantitative feedback from some testing that led us to believe that. It just didn't work out the way we thought it would. Keith Siegner - UBS: Thanks. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Hey, thank you. Two questions as well. First on the Olive Garden new menu, this is not mentioned on this call but I guess, when we spoke last week, is the new version of that planned for as early as May? Clarence Otis, Jr.: I think we\u2019ll probably have a menu change in May, which is very -- it is normal for us and that the adjustments will be more operational than menu change. There will be copy change, things that will help us execute better but there will be no significant change to the offerings at all. There maybe one or two products that aren\u2019t working the way we thought they would work and we may choose to remove those but the change will be more stylistic than anything else. Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay and then a question on Red Lobster, you are obviously lowering the same-store sales focus for the year and the performance is disappointing so far. How is this working to your personal evaluation of a standalone Red Lobster that you perceive with this spend? Clarence Otis, Jr.: I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll Brad comment further. We are not going to -- we don't think it\u2019s useful to get into some real detailed level of specificity given that we are engaged in an active sale process. But what we would say is that we think we have been appropriately conservative as we forecast out next year and the year after for Red Lobster, that accounts for current business trends and it also accounts for the level of effort that we think it\u2019s going to take to stabilize sales. C. Bradford Richmond : Joe, Brad here. The thing I would add is that there's been a conscious effort to reduce the amount of price point features and promotions there and while we have dialed back a little bit our top line expectations in terms of our earnings expectations they really haven\u2019t changed that much, other than obviously the severe winter weather impact, but as we look for the fiscal year for that brand that\u2019s stayed fairly stable. Clarence Otis, Jr.:  The only other thing I would add is that and Brad can put some dimension to this but as we look out -- as we look today we recognize that this year from a cash flow perspective Red Lobster's results have been depressed by this fairly significant spike in shrimp cost as a result of some of the issues, production issues in Asia, Brad talked about a 35% inflation in the third quarter. And so we do see that coming back the other way eventually and we've accounted for it coming back the other way, as Brad said sort of not in this quarter and there may still be some pressure in the first quarter of '15 but following that. C. Bradford Richmond :  Yeah on shrimp cost in particular, it's on annual basis for the Red Lobster brand it's approaching $30 million on year-over-year increase and as Clarence said it's going to be elevated for the rest of this fiscal year although we've seen the early indicators that we are looking for that the situation is improving. But we probably won't see cost relief on that until early in our new fiscal year, fiscal '15. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question. Sara Senatore - Sanford C Bernstein & Co LLC : Yes, thank you very much. I wanted to ask a question about some of the information that was discussed in Form-10, which has basically allowed us to look at the business ex-Red Lobster. And I guess I had a question about that in the sense that we saw fairly most of Darden's margin compression has come from Red Lobster but it's happened elsewhere too and I can see it looks like there is probably some mix going on in the food and beverage line but for comps that, with the exception of may be the last couple of quarters for Olive Garden, but for comps where ex-Red Lobster there have been ex -- sort of modestly negative to up depending on the brand, it's still seems like there's been lot of margin pressure over time. And I was hoping you could just comment on to what extent that's been mixed from these new brands and to what extent any of that is addressable, because again it does looks like the sales alone wouldn't necessarily dictate that. Clarence Otis, Jr.: I would just -- a couple of thoughts, one and then Brad can follow on. I mean clearly some of the sales deleverage at Olive Garden put some downward pressure. In addition to that we do have some fairly meaningful new unit expansion costs. And those costs, given the plans that we outlined to bring the unit expansion down by at least half are going to come out. But that is significant. It flows through a number of lines as we prepare management teams, managers and training all those sorts of things. And we are also in addition to those adjustments on the new unit side as we talked about before really adjusting our support cost to reflect the lower sales base. C. Bradford Richmond : And I guess the piece to add to that or clearly the same thing is that what the new unit growth premium is a fairly significant headwind. As you pointed out with Lobster, if you look even just at the most recent quarter its impact on Darden and obviously the strategic plan related costs are fairly significant. You take those out, it's a 120 basis points better than it is.  I think the other piece to add is some of our growth brands, obviously contribute to some of the headwind because of the growth premium we talked about as well as some of the SRG brands where there is a lot more lease facilities, you got that full rent cost above the line that's in there and so on EBIT you see that but if you go all the way down to on EAT basis and real cash flow we make that up there because you don\u2019t have those additional financing costs. Clarence Otis, Jr.: Then the final piece I would add is just as you look back over the last four years we've clearly invested in the LongHorn marketing function and in the SRG marketing platform. We've done that to improve the brand positioning and brand evolution capabilities to improve their go-to-market capabilities. And those investments are completed so we would expect going forward to begin to leverage those investments. And then the last piece is that we've also invested in Lobster aquaculture. And from an operating expense perspective, that\u2019s embedded there, it's not insignificant, and I don\u2019t know Brad if you want to talk about the size of that investment but\u2026? C. Bradford Richmond :  Yeah, on a year-over-year basis it's in the $12 million range of additional expense that we have there for a very promising opportunity that we have there, but it does obviously have costs that precede the benefit that we are going to derive from that. Clarence Otis, Jr.: And we do think it's something that creates significant value and that value as a go-forward, as we think about it and whether it makes sense to continue, that value will best be realized as we get closer to full scale commercialization. Sara Senatore - Sanford C Bernstein & Co LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. You may ask your question. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Great, thank you very much. Two questions as well, first specific to Olive Garden and the new menu, seems like that\u2019s your biggest opportunity to turnaround the core business, obviously ex-Red Lobster. It does seem like maybe it's in terms of more of a permanent reset of price value, and I know there a lot of value in that Cucina Mia and the small plates, just wondering how you think about the impact on that in terms of whether it be comp margin or ultimate brand possibility, as you now kind of reset down on the value side of things, and then I have a follow up. Eugene Lee : Jeff, this is Gene. I think that we\u2019ve gone both ways, we\u2019ve provided every day value with Cucina Mia and we\u2019ve done some other things at lunch that we think provide great value there. But we\u2019ve also gone all the way through the menu and we\u2019ve added price points at $14, $15 all the way to $18.99. And so as we look at it today, with the mix that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of margin compression with this menu.  We\u2019re seeing the consumer that we would hope would trade up to the [Fole] and the [Semolina Risoto] and dishes like that, that\u2019s happening and we\u2019re getting a good mix on that every day value but it's pretty much what we thought it was going to be at this point in time. And I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job managing the margins. That mix could continue to change overtime, but right now it's playing out pretty much like we thought it would. C. Bradford Richmond : Jeff, Brad here, I would just add to that and you\u2019re pretty familiar with how we talked about our P&L through restaurant earnings line and even at the gross margin lines. There is very little contraction in that margin in the quarter even as we look forward here. I think there is the opportunity as we move forward with the strategy to gain some of the traffic back to where Olive Garden has typically been and the leveraging that is in that model could actually provide margins that are well above what we\u2019ve been in the past couple of years.  So we\u2019re not giving much up with the guest we have today for that opportunity to bring more guests in to the future as we increase the appeal and the breath of their offerings. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Understood and then just a follow-up I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks there I guess $60 million annually in terms of cost savings starting in fiscal \u201915, wanted -- just wanted to see and that, I believe that obviously then includes some of Red Lobster savings just wondering if you could breakout that $60 million ex the Red Lobster if the spin or sales is successful. And do you see any optimism or further opportunity beyond that, I know you are embarking on that benchmarking study, where there any learnings there or where you might see some opportunity maybe where you\u2019re spending more than few years, or maybe that\u2019s just a distortion in the way you\u2019re reporting it, the mix look like that and it's not actually the case? C. Bradford Richmond : Yeah let me start out and Clarence can add on. We talked about the $60 million that has been a Darden number, we\u2019re well on that path. That has largely been support services that Darden provides to the restaurants and the brands.  So we would expect as we move forward to be pretty close to that $60 million but even as you mentioned, as we look forward and as a part of the separation, we see this as a great opportunity to reassess, reevaluate our support platform, starting there first, that I would expect as we continue to learn more and we\u2019re bringing in strong outside expertise to help us look at it differently than we have, that there is no reason that we shouldn\u2019t be at or above that $60 million on a support level basis. So, all those cost savings are coming at the G&A level and will also branch out in to the other areas.  So I feel pretty comfortable that, that number is what it is and we'll probably continue to grow even on a Darden basis ex the Red Lobster piece. Clarence Otis, Jr.: And I would just add that as we look at reported G&A we feel like we are in-line with competitors. The challenge of course with that number is that there is no industry convention regarding where some important cost items are included. So for example we include the cost of multi-unit operations leadership in G&A expense, some include that in restaurant level expenses. We also include certain food safety cost and G&A expense and some folks include that again in restaurant level expenses.  And so we felt it's very important to get someone like Alvarez & Marsal who has broad experience in the restaurant business to help us understand how we stack up, better understand how we stack up vis-\u00e0-vis competitors, when you look through all of those mismatches. And they are working with us on that. We think as we do that work we'll identify further opportunity. And we're also working with them to see are there cost reduction opportunities, four wall, sort of more direct operating cost opportunities beyond support cost. C. Bradford Richmond : I think one thing we're tapping into their experiences and expertize is on the revenue side as well, have a different perspective or fresh look at that. We'll get into that soon. We haven't started that part of the work yet but we look at that as a further opportunity for us as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Hassler with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Greg Hassler - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. A question I want to ask, there has been a lot of talk about the debt breakage cost, that you would incur if you were to go down the path that some of your shareholders have proposed. Can you highlight just sort of what specifically you are seeing in your bond and your debt covenants that would require you to make all the capital structure? Clarence Otis, Jr.: We think it's fairly clear in there that to the degree that we would need to pay off those bonds, there are certain provisions that those costs that we would have to incur. So we're fairly certain that those are there and those are obligations that we would need to fulfill. Greg Hassler - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay. And that's the language in the covenants you think, is it sort of all that substantially all or is it something else in the covenants? Clarence Otis, Jr.: It's pretty clear in our view if we have to refinance those, those are make-whole provisions that get those bond holders may hold given where those bonds trade relative to the current market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. John Glass - Morgan Stanley : Thanks very much. I wanted to ask what the cost savings that you are experiencing in Olive Garden right now. I think you said $19 million on an annualized basis, so that's 15 basis points I think if my math is correct. What do you think the total opportunity there is, is that a multiple of that, may be could you discuss the timing of that and I assume that is outside the $60 million. So it's $60 million plus whatever you achieve at Olive Garden. And could you also just talk about is that going to be gross savings, that you're going to talk about where we have to reinvest that money later on so we don\u2019t actually see it or it one we actually see in the P&L. C. Bradford Richmond : John as we described effort, Phase 1 was the $19 million in operating savings that we achieved. And we're entering in to Phase 2 and we haven't really scoped what the total opportunity is in Phase 2. We do think there is an opportunity. However we are working with A&M to allow us to, we want to make sure we get their perspective on what the opportunity might be also.  But we have not quantified this opportunity. We think there is opportunity there. But as you go into the second round of Phase 2 it won't be as easy as Phase 1 unless A&M comes up with something that we've just missed. Clarence Otis, Jr.: And I would say it is incremental to the $60 million that Brad was describing. John Glass - Morgan Stanley : Okay and it is not the kind of stuff you need to reinvest in say pricing or incremental marketing. You believe these are actually going to stay as visible margin gains? C. Bradford Richmond : I think this is actually net of some of the re-investment we've made. So we have re-invested some of the cost saves that we have got out of simplification effort. And the $19 is net of that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research. You may ask your question. Matthew DiFrisco - Buckingham Research :  Thank you. I just also want to follow up on that, and then I had a question. With respect to the savings, you keep saying support services. Is that clear then that there is no marketing when you talk about the 20 basis points shifting out, 20 rating points shifting out? Was that incorporated at all in the savings? C. Bradford Richmond : Yeah, in that $60 million, a portion of that is -- it's all within SG&A. A portion of that is within the marketing area, where we have made some investments in the past that didn't deliver sufficient returns that we want to keep that. And so the marketing portion will come down some and we highlight some of those. There is a little bit of pull back that we've done in the third quarter. But on a profitability basis I don't believe it had a meaningful impact to us. Matthew DiFrisco - Buckingham Research : So I guess, did you clarify when you were breaking out the Red Lobster, I appreciate that you were doing the COGS, labor, operating spend. Did you also break out Red Lobster as far as leverage on the G&A side? Was that also delevered or did you have an offset where you levered because there were some cost savings. C. Bradford Richmond :  Well for Red Lobster in this particular quarter their SG&A was actually better, I believe it's around the 100-120 basis points than the prior year. A portion of that was G&A savings within the brand, things that they had been working on. But a portion of that was the reduced marketing support, particularly in the December-January time frame. And so it did lead to a portion of our same restaurant sales decline. We had anticipated that but when we look at the cost of the media to attract those sales everything fell within our earnings expectations that we had going into the quarter. Matthew Stroud : Shirley, that's all the time we have this morning for Q&A. We'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call. We certainly are here to take your call if you have additional questions and we look forward to seeing many of you as we are out on the road visiting with our shareholders and others in the investment community. Thank you very much for joining us today and we will speak with you again in June. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

We plan to release fiscal 2015 first quarter earnings and same-restaurant sales for fiscal June, July and August 2015 on Friday, September 12, 2014 before the market opens with a conference call shortly after. We released fourth quarter earnings results this morning. These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. We have a slide to our presentation that you should be able to access through the webcast link at darden.com or videonewswire.com. After the presentation we will take you questions until approximately 9 :30 Eastern Time. With that, let me turn it over to Clarence. [ Author ID1 : at Mon Jun 23 16 :50:00 2014  ] Clarence Otis : Thank you, Matthew and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2014 was clearly obviously a year of significant transformation for us. And so we had a number of changes that complicate our financial reporting and we appreciate this opportunity to walk you through the numbers in some detail. The transformation also had many other very important dimensions and we appreciate the opportunity to discuss those with you as well. Ultimately, all the change that took place is done to do one thing and that\u2019s to better position us to create significant shareholder value. And so this year was one that was highlighted by a number of things, certainly the launch of a comprehensive brand renaissance plan to regain momentum at Olive Garden. It\u2019s highlighted by continued success at LongHorn Steakhouse where same restaurant sales exceeded the industry by nearly four percentage points and at our specialty restaurant group which has grown to $1.2 billion in sales. The year was also highlighted by the announcement of the sale of Red Lobster for $2.1 billion and our announcement in undertaking of significant cost restructuring. Cost restructuring which means that G&A as a percent of sales is expected to remain approximately 5% and that\u2019s because the cost savings achieved with assistance of Alvarez and Marsal more than offset by roughly $40 million, potential stranded costs related to the sale of Red Lobster that cost restructuring also means that in fiscal 2015 SG&A as a percent of sales is expected to be the lowest, since we became a public company in 1995. The year also included continued industry-leading return to capital and that return totals $1.2 billion now in the past three years. We distributed $288 million in dividends to shareholders and we recently announced an additional $500 million to $600 million of share repurchase for fiscal 2015 for a total share repurchase program for next year or this year that just started up to $700 million. In addition we strengthened our credit profile with our plans to retire approximately $1 billion of our existing debt and we made some refinements in our management compensation incentive programs to more directly emphasize same restaurant sales and free cash flow growth. And Brad is going to discuss our sales and earnings results both with and without Red Lobster, so Brad? Bradford Richmond : Thank you Clarence and good morning everybody. On this slide I\u2019ll be brief as a lot of its covered in our press release that went out this morning, but I would point out that combined sales reached $8.758 billion, that\u2019s up 2.4% to the prior year. I think more importantly is when you look at continuing operation sales, and that\u2019s excluding Red Lobster and the Red Lobster\u2019s consumer packaged goods products and international fees and royalties, sales were $6.286 billion, or up 6.2%; a significantly higher growth rate than the combined company enjoys. Now our brands are making strong progress or maintaining high levels of performance in the new fiscal year. And so we will touch more about the activities and initiatives that are driving that, but if you look over at the far right-hand column, you see same restaurant sales for the first three weeks of our new fiscal year. The brand renaissance at Olive Garden is clearly taking hold as you see improvement in their trend. Their same restaurant sales are flat which is above the Knapp-Track industry benchmark, and you see continued strong performance from LongHorn Steakhouse and the specialty restaurants.  Now, turning to next page, and talking about our earnings performance and how that\u2019s reported. Unfortunately, GAAP reporting is not always as intuitive as we'd like for it to be and that is the case with the separation of Red Lobster. So, on this slide I'll walk us through the geography of reported earnings to what we call performance view of our results; and if you start with reported combined fully diluted EPS, that\u2019s $2.15 for fiscal 2014. Now, in that number, we have the strategic action plan costs, and that\u2019s really to execute our plan that involves the real estate work, legal work, advisory fees, retention bonuses, and all of those costs, along with some related impairments to implement that plan. You'd have to add those back for $0.27. There's also some other impairment charges that we incurred to exit our restaurant lease in the future but before the original lease term expires and there is also some charges as we move forward with the new Olive Garden new model designs and previous charges that we needed to write-off. And that\u2019s a $0.05 charge. So, you need to add those two items back to get a performance view of Darden on a combined basis. And this is how we've been talking to you previously in terms of our guidance and expectations. So $2.47 earnings per share is that number. Now, with the announcement of the Red Lobster sales, all presented Red Lobster results for current and prior periods are moved to discontinued operations, but not all of the cost move when you make that type of reporting adjustment. So if you start again with reported fully diluted earnings per share of $2.15, to that you would exclude Red Lobster\u2019s results of operations which are $0.91 in fiscal 2014 you\u2019d add back strategic action plan cost and the related impairment charges that are within discontinued operations, that\u2019s $0.14. And so when you combine these, this results in a continuing operations reported number of $1.38. Now, to move from that reported continuing operations number to how have we performed, you have to add back shared support cost. In Darden we use a very extensive shared service platform for a number of our support services, but in the reporting those shared cost cannot be moved to discontinued operations. Now, after the sale obviously those costs will go away and be moved to Red Lobster, but for reporting purposes currently they aren\u2019t. And that represents $0.15 of impact that we've identified that it\u2019s virtually all headcount related and so we have a high certainty that those costs will move once the separation is effective. The remainder of the $0.27 in strategic action plan costs that are not included in discontinued operations, we add those back, that\u2019s $0.13. And there is other impairment charges that I mentioned earlier for lease exit and remodel cost at Olive Garden at $0.05. So when you combine those with a reported $1.38 from continuing operations, we get $1.71 of continuing operations performance view if you will, EPS; or down 11.4% to the prior year.  I know this is a little confusing at first, but it starts -- always start with reported results first and then for total operations and then we go to discontinuing operations, continued operations, so you can get a view of our true performance.  We'll come back to this approach as we build our detail, our expectations for fiscal 2015, that we felt that was helpful to lay this out with the full detail so you can better understand our performance. Clarence? Clarence Otis : Thank you, Brad. To frame our discussion about our strategic action plan and our outlook for fiscal 2015, we thought it made sense to provide some context, and that context in a sentence is that we\u2019re in a more mature yet more dynamic industry. Now that said, as industry growth slows with maturity, we believe there are attractive consumer segments and we think we've created a portfolio that\u2019s well positioned to succeed against those consumer segments going forward. So we think about the industry\u2019s maturation. There are a number of things that are driving that. Certainly slower growth in the (Bloomberg) [ph] population, aged 50 to 60 and that\u2019s where dining out frequency is the highest, has always been the highest, slower growth in household income overall, increased competition, not only within full-service dining but also with the emergence of attractive new segments, new dining segments like fast-casual and elevated innovation within traditional quick service.  As all that happens, some important demographic and economic dynamics and where the share growth opportunity is, and that is a significant increase in millennials, significant increase in multicultural households across all age and household income spectrums, there\u2019s increased spending power in generation X, and overarching dynamic, is that there is increased digital interconnectedness across all generations in all other demographics. Now, as we look at these dynamics, in order to create value we got some very clear priorities. And those priorities are for value creation, really are to separate Red Lobster (through the) [ph] sale, because we don\u2019t believe that Red Lobster is well-positioned as our other brands for the future that we see. And we sold Red Lobster, again for $2.1 billion to Goldengate Capital, and we're on track to close that sale in July. Execute the Olive Garden brand renaissance.  Gene is going to provide some more detail, but that\u2019s all about improved food, improved service, a stronger communications platform, continue to develop LongHorn into America\u2019s favorite Steakhouse. And LongHorn, as we've said; very successful, both with new restaurant expansion and with same restaurant sales growth; to grow our specialty restaurant sales by more than $1 billion is our target over the next five years and we\u2019re on track based on the performance in \u201914 and our outlook for \u201915. To do that, further optimize operating support and direct operating cost.  We've done a lot. We'll talk in detail about that. We've described some of it already. And then better align our management compensation systems to reflect a new reality and the new drivers really of value creation. And I'll get into more detail about that later. And then to make sure that we\u2019ve got appropriate capital allocation discipline. And certainly we believe that the reduced new unit growth that we've got going forward to commitment to hold acquisitions is consistent with that. Let me begin the more detailed discussion of these priorities by reviewing the Red Lobster sale. The net sale was a result of a very robust process that maximized value and minimized risk; total consideration $2.1 billion in cash, that represents a purchase multiple of nine times trailing 12 months EBITDA as of April. That process involved 70 financial and strategic buyers and another 25 real estate buyers. With the sale we expect our investment grade credit profile to remain intact indeed to improve somewhat; we expect to maintain our $2.20 per share annual dividend; the sale will be accretive to Darden\u2019s long term earnings growth rate, so we expect to have not only a higher earnings growth rate but higher sales growth rate and higher margins. With the sale we\u2019ll have less volatility in our quarterly sales and earnings, so sale that was unanimously approved by our Board and the $2.1 billion sale price is a premium multiple compared to comparable restaurant deals and we\u2019re able to secure that despite the fact that Red Lobster has some meaningfully declining operating trends and you can see that from a same restaurant sales perspective and an EBITDA perspective in the two charts at the bottom of this slide. With the sale we achieved the objectives that we previously communicated, those objectives are listed here, so I won\u2019t go through all of them in the interest of time. But as we look at Darden post sale, there are a number of things that are different. So Darden post sale is a leading multi-brand operator, again higher more consistent sales and earnings growth driven by stronger overall positioning with these consumer segments that are attractive given where the industry is and where it\u2019s headed and given its restaurant expansion footprint.  We\u2019re an operator with a commitment to quality and menu innovation and that also carries with it a more balanced commodity purchasing profile. We have a commitment to return the capital so stronger free cash flow again due to the reduced capital expenditures and that supports strong dividend and allows for increased share repurchase. We have stable and growing cash flow with reduced again quarterly sales and earnings volatility and as I said, a better credit profile. And then finally we have an experienced and quality management team and that team with certain refinements in our management incentive program has an even sharper focus on same restaurant sales and free cash flow growth. Now drilling down, this next chart shows just how much better positioned for growth Darden is post the Red Lobster sale. It shows our cumulative total sales growth from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2014 overall at 23%. And then if you exclude Red Lobster that cumulative number is 40%, it also shows the CAGRs and the CAGR excluding Red Lobster for that period is 2.5 points higher than it is including Red Lobster. Beyond the Red Lobster sale, a key component of our strategic action plan is of course regaining momentum at Olive Garden and Gene\u2019s going to update you on that, so Gene. Gene Lee : Good morning. I\u2019ll spend the majority of my time this morning talking about Olive Garden and then quickly discuss LongHorn and our Specialty Restaurants. Olive Garden provides a strong foundation for the overall Darden business. It\u2019s a premier brand in casual dining with average restaurant volumes of 4.4 million and industry leading returns. We are confident that the recently launched brand Renaissance plan is addressing erosion and visit frequency among our core guests. This plan also will enhance our solid position with millennial and multicultural households and is the platform for renewed same restaurant sales growth and margin expansion. While many of the elements have been underdevelopment during the past year, we\u2019re in the early stages of exposing guests to what we call our brand Renaissance plan. Our objective is to make certain that our guest enjoy differentiate experience of today\u2019s Italy where Olive Garden\u2019s warm hospitality and superior value bring people together.  In terms of food, quality, not surprisingly, is what guests want most. And freshness drives quality more than any other attribute. So we are emphasizing food prepared with the freshest ingredients presented simply with a sense of flair as very Italian. Our efforts are focused on making our service approachable and genuine, so guests can focus on sharing great food and conversation which is why they come to Olive Garden. Within our restaurants we want to make certain that our atmosphere is natural, clean and tasteful while its tone is warm, relaxed and engaging. At every turn we are looking to reinforce these aspects of the atmosphere within our restaurants. Lastly, although Olive Garden has a national presence of more than 800 restaurants, we are most relevant to our guests when we act and are viewed as a family of local restaurants making a positive difference in each community we operate. There are four key growth aspects of the plan; one, continuing to evolve the core menu to reinforce value, expand choice and variety and capitalize on the convenience trend; two, simplifying operations, improving food quality enhancing service; three, implementing a more integrated communications platform to enhance brand relevance; and four bringing the brand a life with every guest touch point. At the beginning of the fourth quarter we introduced new menus at lunch and dinner with significant changes designed to address the consumer needs for increased value and additional choice and variety and convenience. The dinner menu now has a $9.99 price point with the Cucina Mia section in the majority of our restaurants. We know at this price point and the customization this offer enables is very compelling for our guests, especially millennial and value conscious consumers. We also added a Tastes of Italy section which addresses the guest desire to sample different menu items served topping (ph) style. In addition, we have added seven new specialty items including four new lighter fare entr\u00e9es, buttressing areas of the menu where our guests are looking for more choice. To address convenience, we have successfully tested online ordering which will further strengthen our take-out business, which is approximately 8% of our sales but is currently growing 10%. During the testing phase, when orders were placed online the check average for those transactions were significantly higher than the orders placed over the phone. Take-out sales in the online restaurants are growing greater than 10%. At lunch, we introduced Tuscan Trio Combinations, nine new items at $2.99, which can be coupled with our soup, salad and bread sticks. These items create many new lunch possibilities at a price point that is very competitive with many casual dining brands and fast casual lunch offerings. Initial feedback from our guests has been favorable and they tell if these items are unique. They also help us enter into the emerging snack occasion. In terms of choice and variety at lunch, we\u2019ve added sandwich and flatbread combinations as well as mini pasta bowls and small plates. Given that many guests are time constrained at lunch time, we introduced the Pronto Lunch Menu that provides a full Olive Garden experience during the condensed timeframe. Looking at 2015, at dinner we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to improve the Cucina Mia platform and increase the number of entr\u00e9es under $15 to bolster our already strong appeal to younger and budget constrained guests. When you look at Olive Garden\u2019s price points, we have to keep in mind as our guests certainly do, at every meal we serve comes with unlimited salad or soup and bread sticks, thereby dramatically increasing the delivered value versus the competition. New better for you options will also be added to the menu as well as an upgrade of our classic Italian offerings which continue to represent a significant portion of our sales from our dinner menu. During the midst of rolling-out order to go online ordering system nationally, we expect to have this completed by the end of August. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re encouraged by the initial test results and believe this effort will accelerate the strong growth we\u2019re experiencing to go sales today. Olive Garden\u2019s absolute lunch business is very strong. However, lunch guest counts are declining approximately 80 basis points more than dinner. In order to reverse this trend, we will continue to focus on improving our competitiveness at lunch by expanding our Tuscan Trio Combinations as well as introducing new flatbreads, pizzas and Piadinas, which are Italian style sandwiches. Also in the works is a test of a lunch time guarantee to ensure our guest with a time constraint can turn to Olive Garden to provide a quick lunch experience. Olive Garden is a high volume, relatively complicated operation that overtime has become increasingly complex. In order to improve execution the team recognized the need to simplify. In fiscal 2014, we focused on simplifying recipes and reducing production pars. These steps led to an annualized savings of $20 million. We also simplified our take out procedures to improve our ability to deliver a better to bill experience. In terms of improving food and beverage quality, we have installed Piastra grills which improved the quality and consistency of our grilled items. We also improved the quality of our proteins, chicken, steak and salmon. Using higher quality proteins in our specialty dishes, it\u2019s key to ensuring we continue to deliver strong value in entr\u00e9e that appeal to all consumers but especially those consumer segments that provide attractive opportunities for growth. Additionally, we\u2019ve implemented enhanced service training to reemphasize and reinforce our traditional hospitality and our service culture. This year, we will continue to pursue our culinary simplification program on several fronts, including sauce consolidation and pasta preparation. As I stated earlier, we are aggressively rolling out our online to go ordering platform with the expectation of being completed in August. In terms of improving food and beverage quality, we will elevate and intensify our focus on alcohol beverage sales. We will narrow our focus to one and a few unique specialty cocktails. This is an effort underway to reenergize the wine sampling service step and to increase several wine training and knowledge through mobile apps which will help serve as recommend lines and be comfortable pairing wine with food.  While there is opportunity to elevate the guest experience throughout the entire system, we have some restaurants that underperformed the system on many performance metrics and these restaurants are significant drag on same restaurant sales. Senior operational leaders have been assigned to these underperforming restaurants and will be accountable to improve their performance. In addition, we are placing increased emphasis on ongoing training and development of all our team members through a recertification process. The objective of this is to ensure the training initiatives we started last year, are gaining traction. Lastly, we are partnering with Ziosk to introduce tabletop tablets to enhance the guest experience. This test is expected to begin in August. One of the key drivers of the Olive Garden renaissance plan is to develop a truly integrated communication platform to enhance brand relevance. During the past several years, nearly the entire casual dining segment of the restaurant industry has reverted to a nearly 100% reliance on price driven promotional advertising and while promotions are always an important piece of the marketing communications mix, they do not tell the whole story. Importantly, it is impossible to build and maintain a strong brand with only promotional messaging. In fiscal 2014, we begin to place greater emphasis on the brand building portion of our messaging. We developed new creative content to showcase new core menu items and reinforce our culinary credentials. We launched a new interactive Web site, implemented a social media engagement and service recovery program and launched a social media road show to introduce many of our new menu items. In terms of our promotional efforts, we place greater emphasis on a core menu items with a promotional messaging in order to minimize complexity and maximize appeal. The result has been increased guest preference of the promoted items with less strain upon the operating system to deliver them. We also began to use radio as part of the media mix to support promotions in select markets and we introduce more weekday promotions in order to drive traffic when the guest greatest capacity rather than offering discounts during a highest traffic periods which are on the weekends.  During fiscal 2015, a new Olive Garden advertising campaign will be unveiled, emphasizing our culinary credentials and the emotional connection that our guests seek when they come to Olive Garden. Creating an emotional connection with our guests help make Olive Garden a leader that it is today and we need to retune using this strategy with greater emphasis. We are increasing our investment in digital and social media tools to drive greater guest engagement and with these tools we will provide much more in the way of regional and personal messaging through customer relationships. In terms of our promotional messaging, we will continue inject new news in our existing promotions and look for innovative, new promotional constructs including the use of more seasonal and regional products as we will offer more targeted, relevant promotional incentives not always about low price to the use of CRM. All that said, while we intend to be much more effective and efficient in our promotional messaging, as stated above we will have a much better balance between our limited time offerings and our equity messaging. Finally, we are redesigning all of our in restaurant merchandising materials to reinforce Olive Garden\u2019s culinary expertise to elevate menu news and to enhance the ease of menu navigation so that our guest can quickly find their all favorites but also learn about exciting new offerings. The fourth and final driver of our brand renaissance plan is what we call the Olive Garden reimaging program which is intended to bring the renaissance plan to life at every guest touch point. In fiscal 2014, we reimage both the interior and exterior one of our RevItalia restaurants. The new design is natural, up-to date, comfortable and engaging. We also introduced new plateware to enhance the presentation of our food, contemporize the music and work with Lippincott a consulting firm specializing in logo evolution to develop a new logo and visual identity system. This is an extremely important opportunity because same restaurants sales of a 300 plus restaurants in need of a remodel, lag resulted our other restaurants by more than 2 percentage points. Initial sales results of the remodeled restaurant are very, very encouraging. The sales trends have improved mid-single digit since the completion of the remodel and the new signs were installed. When the RevItalia restaurants in the market have been updated, the Tuscan farmhouse restaurants in the market will also convert to the new logo signage and new plateware package. The Olive Garden brand renaissance is a large and complex initiative with many components. We have already made significant progress in many areas building a strong foundation in fiscal 2014 but most of the changes will to life for our guests in fiscal 2015 and beyond. Olive Garden is a large business with more than 800 restaurants and 8,000 employees, so we know that it will take time for the brand renaissance to be fully implemented but we are already seeing positive measurable results such as strong preference in menu satisfaction, our new menu items and improvement in our guest satisfaction scores. We are confident that the rate of progress will increase in the quarters ahead at the various aspects of the plan reinforce and build on one another. In fact, in June as we gotten pass some of the year-over-year promotional mismatch we have in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve already seen significant positive trend change compare to the fourth quarter from a same restaurant sales perspective. I\u2019ll conclude the Olive Garden session with a couple of quick quotes from guests. This quote is from a Yelp event we hosted recently. I\u2019m not usually the first one to say Olive Garden when someone wants the suggestion on where to eat, on Monday that all changed. This is a quick quote for some qualitative research we did after our remodel was complete. I didn\u2019t even know you had a bar before, and now I really want to go in there. Quickly, we\u2019ll just look at -- we\u2019ll talk about LongHorn. LongHorn has a clear vision as Clarence mentioned they want to be America\u2019s favorite steak house, this multiyear effort is strengthening the brands to create a strong sales momentum to focus on continually improving the menu and enhancing service execution and providing the guests with a great atmosphere, as all of our restaurants have been remodeled and looked and feel refreshed has been the driving force in LongHorn\u2019s out performance in the industry. As we look at the specialty restaurant group, I think we have strong differentiated well positioned brands and the teams are focused on reviewing same restaurant sales momentum both at Seasons and Yard House. I would just quickly say, I think the Yard House is very well positioned in the market place, as strong appeal the volume in Gen X households. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the restaurants and the real-estate pipeline is strong. Seasons 52 broadly appealing and particularly strong with higher end coming Gen X to improve our sales trends and reverse the trends that we have. The team is focused on elevating operational execution evolving the seasonal regional menu strategy and increasing brand awareness in new markets. And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Brad. Bradford Richmond : We\u2019ve continued to achieve more cost effective platform, transformative changes that we\u2019ve talked on the past in Darden\u2019s operations have significantly reduced costs by over a $150 million annually in selected areas, operating areas around our support including supply chain, facilities management, water and energy usage. During the past two year, these efforts have supplemented with broad based cost reduction initiatives due to more than anticipated alluded in sales growth recovery reduce of financial crisis in the economic downturn. Despite lower total revenues following the sales of Red Lobster, we expect general and administrative expenses to remain flat at 5% excluding strategic action plan cost. Now Alvarez & Marsal has continued to assist us with the efforts to identify additional operating support and direct operating cost opportunities, as well as potential revenue enhancement opportunities. And so we expect to further reduce G&A as a percent of sales as we get further into fiscal 2015. We will minimize the impact of continued commodity cost inflation through other select initiatives to achieve a net inflation, net cost pressures of 1.5% to 2.5% in fiscal 2015. Our $2.5 billion in product expand is now better diversified with less exposure to seafood inflation post the Red Lobster separation. The table in the left shows us in by major category, you can see the change from 2014 to what we anticipate in 2015 with the separation, particularly see a much less of our cost basket coming from seafood cost. On the right hand side, we outline our coverage of our main products that we purchase as we look through the new fiscal year or in particular June to November of fiscal '15, our first half of the year. The overall coverage at 52% is little wider than it typically is at this point in the cycle for us, given that we believe cost there will elevate it and we expect them to come down. We look at inflation in this area for fiscal 2015 in the 2% to 3% range probably the upper half of that range in the first half of the year. And the lower half of that range in the back half of the year. As Clarence mentioned earlier, we really increased our focus on driving higher semi front sales and stronger free cash to achieve higher shareholder returns. The annual incentive plan is now weighted 70% on achieving targeted EPS growth and the remaining 30% on targeted same restaurant sales growth. Our performance share units those are a three-year performance period is now based on 50% of achieving targeted total sales growth, 50% on free cash flow targets and a relative TSR performance to the S&P 500 total shareholder return. On a continuing ops basis, our business generates a substantial and durable operating cash flow. In fiscal 2015, we expect cash provided by operations to be between a $670 million and $730 million. We will pay down approximately $1 billion in debt. The debt leverage that we expect is going to be at the low end of our 55% to 65% and that\u2019s on an adjusted basis treating operating leases as debt equivalents.  Our debt coverage is unexpectedly above our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, but it then improves from the year just ended at 3.7 to 3.0 at the end of fiscal 2015. We will also allocate $500 million to an accelerated share repurchase program. And up to $200 million in additional open market repurchases, funded principally from the sale of Red Lobster. We are maintaining our current annual dividend of $2.20, and an approximate total payout of $275 million, and deployed $325 million to $350 million of capital expenditures. This really reflects lower new unit growth, offset slightly by the investment in the Olive Garden remodel program; and all this with the expectation of retaining an investment grade credit profile.  Turning to some of the more specifics of our outlook for 2015; on this slide we\u2019ve detailed our new unit growth and you can see that 37 net units, that\u2019s down fairly significantly from this year\u2019s 69 or a year before of over a 100 new restaurants. You can see that the growth is concentrated in LongHorn and our specialty restaurants. And there is also the concluding of Olive Garden sites that went well into the growth pipeline. From the same restaurant sales perspective, we look at Olive Garden to be flat to +1%, LongHorn of +1% to +2%, and our specialty restaurants at approximately 2%. All of these performances would be above the industry expectations. On the next slide, we outline our operating cash flow, and you can see, as I mentioned earlier, $670 million to $730 million there, obviously driven by earnings. This does include the portion of cash flow that is generated by Red Lobster, prior to the sale. You see our expectations for depreciation and amortization. Working capital, there is an improvement there, extra Red Lobster business, and we have reflected that. And the other cash items really highlight the progress that we have been making and continue to expect in better managing our balance sheet as well as the cash flow benefits of our tax planning initiatives. So the least cash available for dividends and share repurchases is at $320 million to $405 million. As I mentioned earlier, our capital expenditures are down, you can see the new units today as I outlined earlier, will result in about a $150 million of capital employed towards those. Remodels principally all related to Olive Garden as well there will be some CIP for that as we end the year to continue that program. And then we will continue to invest and maintain our restaurant standards and cooking equipment standards, and so maintenance CapEx will be in $125 million to $150 million. As I mentioned earlier, maintaining our dividend at $2.20 and share repurchases in total up to $700 million.  So, back to this page that I took us to, as we looked at fiscal 2014 to better understand and help you get your hands around our performance; and from an EPS perspective here, the prior year comparison is the performance EPS that I laid out earlier, of $1.71; we think it is the right benchmark. We expect to report $1.81 to $1.90 for a diluted EPS. Now, again we have to adjust the support cost for the period that Red Lobster is a part of Darden, though support cost which we know will go away are deductions to ours (ph) that\u2019s what we anticipate it on $0.02 that we need to add those back to the reported continuing operations number. And, as I mentioned earlier, we are paying down $1 billion of debt. There are some estimated debt breakage related to that of approximately $0.39. So that puts us at a continuing operations performance view, earning fully diluted EPS of $2.22 to $2.30. And that\u2019s a 30% to 35% increase above the prior year. But there are some clear and distinct drivers of that. Those are highlighted in the lower right-hand portion of that. The results that we expect from our core operating performance driven by the same restaurant sales and the cost initiatives should drive 10% to 15% EPS growth. We talked about the reduced interest expense related to that debt reduction that drives about 12% of EPS growth and the share count reduction from the share buyback that we talked about drives 5% growth, and just add a little bit more confusion to the work that we have to do next year will be a 53rd week for us, and so there is a 3% earnings growth related to sales from that extra week, so netting to a 30% to 35% increase and earnings per share. Now, I would point out that the share buyback really won\u2019t begin after the closing of the Red Lobster deal as well as the debt breakage. So you can see the annualized impact actually adds another 6% in EPS growth that will be realized in the first quarter of following fiscal year of fiscal year \u201916. So with that let me turn it back to Clarence for a few more comments. Clarence Otis : Thank you, Brad. And so we think that we have a very strong competitive position and that starts with a well positioned, much better positioned portfolio brand that can deliver balanced same restaurant, new restaurant sales growth which will leverage our operating support and restaurant support cost. We are committed to proactive, ongoing, cost optimization to amplify the leverage that we get from growing sales and ensure consistent margin expansion and earrings growth that will result in consistently strong cash flow growth to support meaningful ongoing return to capital shareholders again through dividends and share repurchase. And more than sufficient operating cash flow to address the emerging trends as they develop. With this competitive position, we are confident that we can return to industry leading financial performance with on a sustained basis mid-to-high single digit annual sales growth, low-to-mid teen annual operating income growth, and $350 million or more in annual return of capital to shareholders. So with that, we will open it up for your questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open. Joseph Buckley - Bank of America : Thank you. I\u2019d like to ask a few questions on Olive Garden, so the remodel information you shared with us, was that based on one restaurant or maybe more than that? And then you mentioned your underperformers kind of pulling down the brand performance, how many stores are in that underperformed group and what are the common characteristics of that underperformed group? And maybe just one more, in the same-store sales projections for this year while improved particularly at Olive Garden are pretty low and what happens to margins given those same-stores sale projections, I noticed the fourth quarter LongHorn\u2019s operating profit was down per year tax, do you need strong comps than that to get restaurant level margins healthier? Eugene Lee : The initial results I gave on the remodel were just the one restaurant we have up at Fort Walton Beach and it\u2019s obviously very-very early, but we can isolate that restaurant to see what happened, it will be a little bit more time before we have a good what I can say statistically significant sample. As far as the underperformers, you always have a bottom quartile. What we try to do is get to the bottom quintile and then subdivide that even more, get this down to like 50 restaurants that are really having a significant impact on the system. I would say they\u2019re between 7% and 10% below the system average. And the characteristics around them are; first, majority of them are older restaurants that haven\u2019t been renovated, we have probably weaker management teams there, our attributes, our ratings on prudent service aren\u2019t close to the system average. And it\u2019s really getting back to some really restaurant basics in there and ensuring that we\u2019re delivering the guest experience. Bradford Richmond : Yes, and on margins, we expect Olive Garden to expand at -- at Olive Garden not as much as the other businesses and to your point really driven by same restaurant sales, but they would still have margins that increase in the 20 to 25 basis point range. And even across Darden with the work that we\u2019ve done on the G&A cost the things that we\u2019ve talked about some in the marketing or selling area as well as what\u2019s driven by the same restaurants sales. And the cost environments were -- the cost pressures that I mentioned are not too severe. We were able to greatly mitigate those when you look even across Darden you\u2019re looking that operating profit margins will expand in that 20 to 50 basis points range depending on which end of the guidance that, that you look at. Operator :  Thank you, our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer and Company. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer and Company :  Thank you and good morning. First is a clarification question, did that operating cash flow guidance for 2015 include or exclude Red Lobster\u2019s earnings? Because I thought it\u2019s still -- I thought I saw it say includes Red Lobster\u2019s earnings? Bradford Richmond :  It includes it for the approximate period that we would own that business still, so you know that\u2019ll be just part of the first quarter. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer and Company :  Okay, so it\u2019s a question I have is really at almost based on the EPS guidance and you are kind of close to that 100% dividend payout ratio here. And when I look at the operating cash flow guidance you are assuming working capital inflows and some other inflows from non-cash items. And I guess, the question is how confident are you that you can really maintain the $2.20 dividend going forward and how much does it rely on continued influence from working capital in certain items like that. Bradford Richmond :  Obviously as we look to fiscal 2015 there is contributions in cash flows from these other items but also the reduction in CapEx that we\u2019ve done, leaves sufficient room for us to maintain our 2.20 targeted dividend. From there I think the platform that we\u2019ve laid out, the initiatives we have underway, earnings will grow and so the contributions from operating cash flow would grow and continue to allow us to have a $2.20 dividend and depending on the rate of those earnings growth the opportunity to modestly to start growing that dividend rate beyond 2015. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer and Company :  [Question Inaudible] Clarence Otis :  The new restaurant piece obviously of the capital budget is discretionary and we demonstrated that with the scale back that we accomplished in fiscal \u201914 on the new restaurant side. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer and Company :  I see, so if, you know we saw a scenario where earnings didn\u2019t grow as much as you expect in 2015, do you think there would be some [Indiscernible] on the CapEx to still be able to maintain that dividend. Bradford Richmond :  Yes, we see sufficient room to make the adjustments that we need to make to maintain the dividend to work at our debt metrics as well to have that investment\u2019s credit profile, so we see the ability to do both really. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer and Company :  Okay and then jus the second and final question is on LongHorn. Revenue growth was up double digits. And as Gene said, and you say in the press release that operating profit -- dollars actually declined year-over-year. Can you just walk through that a little bit more and the dynamics there? Bradford Richmond :  LongHorn profitability, I mean it continues to grow fuelled a lot by the unit growth, we do see the margins there expanding, their particular brand performance is a little bit muted by the elevated beef cost and we see those continuing but still good progress from that brand, new unit growth is profitable and when you have same restaurant sales growth as strong as they do well above industry average, we\u2019re able to leverage those as well. Clarence Otis :  And I would say also Brian, as we look into fiscal 2015, with the slowdown in unit growth at LongHorn and there are a lot of new restaurant opening expenses not just direct from the restaurant opening expenses but manager training, all those sorts of things, in the model that will be a lot lower in \u201915 than they were in \u201914 with the unit growth pace cut in half. Operator :  Thank you, and once again participants may I request everyone to please to limit yourself with one question and one follow up, our next question is coming from the line of Ms. Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein, Ma\u2019am your line\u2019s now open. Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein :  Thank you very much. I do have one follow up and one question. The follow up was just on the Olive Garden remodeling I think you said unremodeled restaurants lag by 2 percentage points and so it sounds like the core restaurants are still comping negatively and the remodeling isn\u2019t having as much of a lift as I would have thought, because I thought it\u2019s sort of 3% to 4%, so, if you could just clarify that and then the first question is, the real question is, can you talk about whether Alvarez and Marsal has identified any kind of unit level cost saves, I think you mentioned G&A savings, further G&A savings but it seems like if you\u2019re going to invest in improved food and service for the Olive Garden you probably need to fund that with maybe cost savings elsewhere, thank you. Clarence Otis :  I\u2019ll start, on the remodel side, I think what Gene was saying is that the restaurants that have not been remodeled are the ones that are in need of a remodel are lagging by about 2 points, now we\u2019ve had some remodels in the past that have had a lift of 3, 4 percentage points but we paused on them because we believe that they really didn\u2019t have the kind of shelf life going forward that we needed, that they didn\u2019t make dramatic enough change, and so we would hope that, this new remodel, and again it\u2019s too early to tell but at least 2% to 3% to 4% and perhaps more than that. And then on Alvarez and Marsal, they\u2019re working to identify four wall opportunities, but Dave George and the team at Olive Garden have been working on that as well. And so to some of the simplification work that they have done, they have taken out about $20 million of cost on an annualized basis and they\u2019ve reinvested a significant amount of that in food quality and some of the other things that Gene mentioned already. Eugene Lee : And I would add that on, from A&M\u2019s perspective where they really were able to help us is on the marketing side, help accelerate our attack on nonworking media cost, and so that\u2019s been a big help and we think there is big dollars there. And there is some other marketing ideas that they have that we\u2019re planning on implementing I think those are all going to be cost saves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Palmer from RBC. Sir, your line is now open. David Palmer - RBC: Thank you, good morning. You\u2019ve mentioned the June to-date sales for Olive Garden -- you understand that goes short-term influences on the sale like the promotion timing, the media wave better than us, can you evaluate that and perhaps just comment on what do you think that this June result is indicative or the kind of sales you\u2019ll see perhaps for the first half in fiscal \u201915 and why some of the -- why this is truly is a turning, what are the factors driving the turn specifically in terms of your initiative? Thanks. Clarence Otis : So, I will start. I would just say promotionally June lines up pretty well year-over-year and so we don\u2019t have a lot of promotional noise in the June to-date numbers, but June we might wind up. Bradford Richmond : David, I would say that we\u2019ve been working hard to gain guest count momentum. If you look back in the fourth quarter, guest counts in March were down 61 affected somewhat by weather April 35, May rolling down 17 and the majority of that was one week when we had some promotional transitional issues, but June\u2019s comes back and been pretty solid. We think it\u2019s just a result of the focused efforts that we put on this brand from an operational standpoint from food service. We think our advertises are getting a little sharper a little bit more focused again it just -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re on a straight line up to 3% to 4% comps, but I do think that we\u2019re putting in the effort and we\u2019re making some improvement and the guests are telling us that by coming to our restaurants more often. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. John Glass - Morgan Stanley : Thanks. Gene, if I could first ask you to clarify last comment? Your mix was down pretty substantially in May, so your traffic was better, but the mix was worse. So you traded -- it seems like you traded one for the others. Is that correct? Is that the way you would look at it going forward that you will take a lower check for the traffic? Or was that just a monthly? Eugene Lee : I think that was just a monthly skew where we were out there in May with our classic promotion at $10 and last year we had a different type of promotion that didn\u2019t impact check averages as much. I was pleased with May\u2019s results even though we did have a mix change. I thought getting our classics which represented close to 20% of the sales in the May into our guest, on the table for our guest was a really good thing to remind them about some of the reasons why they really love Olive Garden and I think that momentum is carrying on through June. John Glass - Morgan Stanley : And then on the SG&A or the G&A savings, where were you just up the benchmark -- where were you in G&A as percentage of sales in the fourth quarter after you\u2019ve striped out all of Red Lobster? What\u2019s the progression of events in \u201915? How quickly can you keep getting if there was -- it\u2019s above five materially ex-advertising how fast can you get it to five? Clarence Otis : Well, we\u2019ll get it to five in the fiscal year and I\u2019m looking up your question there, fourth quarter. Eugene Lee : Yes, we may have to get back to you with this John perhaps flipping through some pages, but we\u2019ll get back to you. I think for the full year it\u2019s 5%, so we expect to get to that level pretty quickly. Clarence Otis : The SAP costs that I\u2019ve laid out there are virtually\u2026 Eugene Lee : SAP, strategic action plans. Clarence Otis : In the G&A line there I think maybe to the heart what you giving as we look forward. We talk about a flat G&A at 5% with the opportunity in \u201915 as we get through more the A&M work and things we\u2019re doing to take that even lower. In the year, but at a flat 5%, that\u2019s implying an absolute reduction of well over a $100 million of G&As and granted there is about say 75 million of that, that is either allocated or directly within Red Lobster that goes away. There are some stranded G&As of about $20 million, which says we\u2019ve already got well over $50 million of G&A reductions that stays within the Darden continuing operations and more than offsets the stranded G&A cost over there. So we were really pleased with the progress and those plans are largely all in place and delivering the expected results. John Glass - Morgan Stanley : If I could just ask one final question. On the low to mid teen operating profit growth longer term, how do you -- in an industry that grows comps at a very low single digit rate, you\u2019re going to square footage at least this current year at a very low single digit rate. How do you get there? Or is it presumed that you are a unit grower -- a much more materially faster unit grower in the future again? Clarence Otis : Well let me start it out and then I will turn it over to Clarence. I think even if you look at the guidance that we have -- our expectations for fiscal 2015, on the composition of same restaurant sales growth that we have, a cost environment, where commodity costs are in that 2% to 3% range. Through all that we\u2019re still able to generate what I call a core operating profit growth of 10% to 15%. That\u2019s pretty significant. There is a little bit of unit growth but a much more moderated pace that we think is appropriate for our businesses and for a large chain. And then, with that there\u2019s strong cash flows that will allow us to begin growing the dividend and repurchase shares so that those repurchased shares also aid EPS growth as well as its how you get into that low double digit mid-teen range. Clarence Otis : And I would say the portfolio of new Darden, in an industry that\u2019s challenged is strongly positioned against the healthiest parts of the industry. So when you look at Olive garden and LongHorn, but also the specialty restaurants strongly positioned against the healthiest parts. The brands also have very strong -- in the new Darden X Red Lobster very strong, restaurant level returns and with the support cost activities that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re able to realize a lot of that restaurant level return. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. Ma\u2019am, your line is now open. Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays: One, just a point of clarification, that around the 3.7 times leverage that you mentioned for fiscal year \u201914, that includes $1 billion of notional debt reduction, correct? And then secondly, as you map to getting the three times leverage at the end of fiscal \u201915, a lot of it is predicated on you hitting that cooperating profit growth target, but what other levers could you pull, if for some reason you start to fall towards the lower end or below that? Thanks. Bradford Richmond : Well, first on the 3.7 times, that\u2019s adjusted debt-to-adjusted capital. So we\u2019re treating those operating leases as debt equivalents, which they are. That\u2019s the range of the end of fiscal \u201914. The outlook that we\u2019ve laid out here gets us to 3 times, 3.0 times into fiscal \u201915. And so that\u2019s our expectations there. Like so the other key thing is the cash flows and to a degree there\u2019s shortages on the operating cash flow as Clarence outlined earlier is that we\u2019ve clearly demonstrated our willingness and ability to work on the CapEx side, particularly around new unit growth. And so that would be obviously the first item that we would look to. Olive Garden remodeled CapEx. We know it was very important. That delivers results that we\u2019re anticipating. We would probably keep that in there. That would be hard to touch and obviously, maintenance CapEx. There\u2019s pretty significant operating cash flows. We want to protect that as well. So the real opportunity is around new unit CapEx and the others would be more difficult for us to change but if needed, we could. Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays: And just, I think you might have misunderstood the first question. The 3.7 times number, that you have at the end of fiscal \u201914, is that on a reported basis using your current debt or is that adjusting out the $1 billion of notional debt reduction you expect to occur as a result of the Red Lobster proceeds? Bradford Richmond : That includes the reduction of debt from the Red Lobster proceeds, I\u2019m sorry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jonathan Compt (ph). Bradford Richmond : Wait a second let me finish that question. I misunderstood, the 3.7 is the reported number at the end of fiscal year that does not include unit reduction. That\u2019s based on our reported numbers. Matthew Stroud : Sorry, that\u2019s the last question. We are out of time here today. We appreciate those of you joining us and listening in and those that asked questions. Of course we\u2019re here in Orlando if you have further questions and further follow ups. We look forward to talking to many of you in the near future. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

We plan to release fiscal 2015 second quarter earnings and same-restaurant sales for fiscal September, October and November 2015 on Friday, December 19, 2014, before the market opens, with a conference call shortly after. We released first quarter earnings this morning. These results were available on PR Newswire and other wire services. Brad will review the P&L in some detail and discuss our financial outlook for fiscal 2015, then Gene will discuss the operating performance, summary of the brands. And after Gene speaks, we'll take your questions. With that, let me turn it over to Brad. C. Bradford Richmond : Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter financial results were slightly ahead of what we expected when we released our quarterly guidance in August, largely because of the better same-restaurant sales performance at Olive Garden in the last 2 weeks of the fiscal month. As we reported this morning, our diluted net loss per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.14. On an adjusted basis, our diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal first quarter were $0.32. The adjusted results excluded approximately $0.02 of the Red Lobster-related shared support costs incurred in June and July that moved to Red Lobster with the sale of that business, approximately $0.03 of costs related to other aspects of the company's strategic action plan, approximately $0.04 related to restaurant impairment charges, and approximately $0.37 of debt breakage costs related to the planned retirement of $1 billion of the company's debt. Darden's first quarter sales from continuing operations increased 4.2% to $1.6 billion. On a same-restaurant sales basis, LongHorn Steakhouse increased 2.8%, while Olive Garden declined 1.3% for the quarter. And we saw continued same-restaurant sales gains in our Specialty Restaurant Group, with a 2.1% increase in same-restaurant sales on a blended basis. Food and beverage expenses for the first quarter were approximately 180 basis points higher than last year on a percentage of sales basis. This unfavorability, which we expect to largely subside as the fiscal year progresses, was driven by 3 factors : First, dairy, seafood and beef costs were sharply higher on a year-over-year basis. And we expect some of this to continue through the end of the calendar year. Second, year-over-year Olive Garden promotional margins were unfavorable. However we don't expect this to continue given our plans for the rest of the fiscal year. Third, while the core menu enhancement at Olive Garden that we made last February served to broaden its appeal, they do have a slightly unfavorable impact on cost of sales as a percentage of sales. For the first quarter, restaurant labor expenses were approximately 20 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to sales leveraging. Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 10 basis points lower than last year due to preopening and sales leveraging. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 80 basis points lower on a percentage of sales basis, due to sales leverage and the impact of our cost savings initiatives that we have undertaken in the past year. There are an additional 50 basis points of costs associated with the shared services that transferred to Red Lobster and the strategic action plan cost included in this line item. So excluding these items, SG&A expenses would have been 9.5% of sales in the first quarter. Depreciation expense in the quarter was approximately 10 basis points higher on a percentage of sales basis compared to last year, because of the increase in new units. Interest expense is 480 basis points higher than last year, as a result of breakage costs of approximately $80 million related to the retirement of $900 million of the company's debt. There will be an additional $100 million of debt retirement at the beginning of our fiscal second quarter, which will also have an incremental breakage cost of approximately $10 million. Now there are a number of moving parts of interest expense for this quarter. But as we look forward, we expect interest expense in the low-$20 million each quarter. Our tax rate this quarter was driven by earnings loss attributable to the aforementioned breakage costs -- or debt breakage cost. The Q1 tax rate was about 18% to 20% when you adjust for that -- adjust out that cost for the debt retirement. We now estimate that our annual effective tax rate will be approximately 10%. This annual effective rate will vary though from quarter-to-quarter, and as you look at our adjustments, I would mention that our marginal tax rate does remain at approximately 38% as we look forward. Now turning to our commodity cost outlook. We have approximately 74% of our total food spend contracted through the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and 38% of our total spend through the end of our fiscal year, which is about normal at this point in the cycle for us. We have not fully covered our usage through the fiscal year, because we believe the premiums for future contracts are too great given what we expect prices to be in the cash market as we look forward. Food cost inflation in the first quarter, net of cost savings, was approximately 3.9%, driven by the dairy and food -- seafood inflation in the high teens. For the fiscal year, our current expectation is that our commodity basket will see net inflation in the range of 2% to 2.5%, which is at the higher end of the range we anticipated in June. We anticipate that food cost inflation will moderate in calendar 2015. That's the second half of our fiscal year. Category-by-category, through the second quarter of fiscal 2015, beef costs are higher on a year-over-year basis with 55% of our usage covered. Seafood costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 92% of our usage covered. Poultry costs are lower on a year-over-year basis, with 95% of our usage covered. Wheat costs are lower on a year-over-year basis, with 100% of our usage covered now. And dairy costs are higher on a year-over-year basis, with 50% of our usage covered. Our energy costs are expected to be slightly unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. And we have contracted the majority of our natural gas and electricity usage in the deregulated markets in which we operate for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. As we look ahead to the fiscal year, our outlook for total sales and earnings remains the same as it was when we spoke to you at the beginning of the first quarter. We expect same-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden to be flat to plus 1%, LongHorn Steakhouse of plus 1% to plus 2%, and our Specialty Restaurants at approximately plus 2%. We anticipate diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.74 to $1.84 for fiscal 2015, consistent with our previous expectations that adjusted for the shared support costs included -- part of the sale of Red Lobster that moved with Red Lobster for the sale; the costs we'll continue to incur in connection with the implementation of our strategic action plan; asset impairment and the debt breakage costs incurred in the first quarter and some that occur in the second quarter. Adjusting for these items, we continue to anticipate diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.22 to $2.30 for the year, which excludes the costs I just mentioned. And now with that, I'll turn it over to Gene to comment on Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and the Specialty Restaurants. Eugene I. Lee: Thanks, Brad, and good morning. Let's start with Olive Garden's first quarter performance and our progress on the Brand Renaissance. First quarter total sales of $914 million were 0.5% below last year. Sales decline was driven by a same-restaurant sales decrease of 1.3% for the quarter, which was 70 basis points below the industry benchmark, but an improvement of 250 basis points versus the previous quarter's industry sales gap. Same-restaurant guest counts were down 2.4%, which was 40 basis points better than the industry benchmark and an improvement of 240 basis points versus the previous quarter's industry guest count gap. Same-restaurant sales and guest counts remain volatile week-to-week, as we continue to adjust the marketing calendar. One of our objectives is to realign the marketing calendar with the seasonality of the business. Over the past few years, for example, our Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion, which is most appropriate for the fall, which is seasonally slow, has drifted into August, a seasonally strong month. This year, we pushed the start of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl back into September. Overall, we're encouraged with the progress we're making with the Olive Garden Brand Renaissance. There are 4 key aspects of the plan : one, continue to evolve the core menu to reinforce value, expand choice and variety and capitalize on the convenience trend; two, simplifying operations, improving food quality and enhancing service; three, implementing a more integrated communication platform to enhance brand relevance; and four, bringing the brand to life with every touchpoint. We introduced new lunch and dinner menus 6 months ago with a goal of reinforcing value and expanding variety. As I've stated in the past, we believe adding a $9.99 Cucina Mia section to the menu was an important -- for Olive Garden to maintain its value leadership position. Preference for this section continues to grow and has doubled since its introduction. More importantly, we know through our transactional data that guests are returning and repurchasing this menu item and that it appeals to millennials. The new menu is also successfully delivering better value at the high end of the net -- menu, with higher-quality beef and seafood selections. Key attributes on taste, food quality and good value for the money continue to improve. Additionally, with this new menu and taking less price in the industry the last 2 years, we are seeing reduced price sensitivity from our guests. To-Go sales are exceeding expectations. We've strengthened our To-Go experience and completed online ordering ahead of schedule, which resulted in a 13% increase in To-Go sales versus last year. In recent weeks, To-Go sales have grown at approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see a 30% increase in check average when guests order online. Our operation team is focused on delivering consistently great experiences through an intensified emphasis on service and food quality. In the first quarter, the great food goal rally cry was launch, with the initial concentration on improving execution of our soup, salad and breadsticks. In the second quarter, the team will focus on continuing to deliver great pasta, prepared passionately and plated perfectly. Through the focus on Pronto Lunch, lunch dining times have improved for guests seeking a quicker experience. In addition, with better forecasting and scheduling, we've improved the wait times. We continue to make progress implementing a more integrated communication platform. We've broadened our reach by combining price point and promotions with new secondary television and digital equity messages that reinforce our culinary credentials. The promotional strategy continues to evolve, as we better leverage menu items from our core menu and offer compelling buy-up opportunities for our guests. And as I mentioned earlier, we will continue to realign the marketing calendar with the seasonality of the business. Additionally, the new social media team is actively engaged in realtime conversations with our guests, talking with them, not at them. Today's social-savvy consumer expects this type of interaction, and our social team is doing an outstanding job. The first 3 remodels, which also included the new logo, signage, menu and plateware, are generating excitement with our guests and team members. We're pleased with the initial guest count results, as these 3 restaurants are now trending greater than 10% above their prior trends. In addition to the guest count lift, we're also seeing an increase in alcoholic beverage sales. Our plan is to complete 75 remodels this fiscal year. And as a reminder, the 300 restaurants in need of a remodel lag our other restaurants by approximately 200 basis points in same-restaurant sales. The Ziosk test is now in 11 restaurants, and initial results are very positive. 80% of our guests are interacting with the device, and 60% of them are paying their check on the tablet. In addition we've seen an increase in add-on sales, e-CLUB sign up, guest survey response, and our server tip percentage has increased. We're developing a plan to implement the tablets in the rest of the system and plan to be completed by the end of the fiscal year. There are real signs of positive momentum with our operational leaders and team member engagement. We held our first national directors of operation meeting in 3 years and focused on driving sales growth through great dining experiences. We've also just completed our general manager conference, where the leadership team did an outstanding job communicating the opportunities for improvement, while energizing the group to improve overall operational execution. While we're pleased with the progress we've made to date with the Brand Renaissance, there's still work to do. This is a large and complex initiative with many components, and we're confident that the rate of progress will accelerate in the quarters ahead as various aspects of the plan reinforce and build on one another. The LongHorn Steakhouse had a strong first quarter with same-restaurant sales of 2.8%, exceeding the industry benchmark for the sixth consecutive quarter. Importantly, this top line performance was matched buy significantly higher operating profit and restaurant earnings versus the prior year. This balanced sales and earnings growth was achieved through a combination of operational execution and compelling marketing initiatives. Operationally, our restaurant teams continue to elevate the guest experience, as evidenced by higher scores on the key metrics of steaks cooked correctly and server attentiveness. Industry-leading low turnover and a slowdown on new restaurant growth has enabled our restaurant teams to focus even more than before on executing every shift flawlessly and ensuring service that over-delivers on our guests' expectations. Successful marketing strategies are also a key driver of maintaining top line momentum for LongHorn. The first quarter was supported by 2 very different promotions that both delivered competitively superior results. We began the quarter with our Grilled Taste of Summer promotion, which leveraged our Chef's Showcase platform we launched last year, featuring seasonally appropriate, unique new entr\u00e9es. This promotion included grilled lobster chops, fire-grilled Hawaiian ribeye, and brown butter-lemon tilapia and grilled shrimp. Our second promotion of the core, Steaks Across America, starting at $12.99, was a little closer to home, and it featured a Kansas City's barbecued sirloin, a Texas 3-chili ribeye and Manhattan Stuffed Mushroom Filet. Both of these promotions delivered same-restaurant performance significantly above the industry benchmark. Our culinary and operations teams also partnered to let [ph] some exciting menu enhancements in the first quarter. Bold Bites, LongHorn's version of small plates, and Happy Hour both launched in June. Guest response has exceeded our expectations and these menu enhancements are proving to be both guest satisfying and profit-driving platforms for LongHorn. We're confident that LongHorn is on the right path and well positioned to continue to deliver the industry-leading same-restaurant sales performance that it consistently achieved over the last 2 years. In addition to continuing the top line momentum at LongHorn, the team is focused on leveraging the top line growth to deliver strong earnings performance Specialty Restaurant Group had another good quarter, with same-restaurant sales growth of 2.1% and total sales growth of 14.5%. The capital growth continues to deliver strong same-restaurant sales growth and earnings performance, while capitalizing on the opportunities to add new restaurants. The team is committed to delivering a unique service experience, combined with an evolving culinary experience, rooted in traditional steakhouse style. The Yard House same-restaurant sales have improved, as the team moves past integration and focuses on operational improvement. The culinary team is refreshing the menu with new and exciting items and is also reenergizing their late night Happy Hour, which is an important daypart. Seasons 52's plan to regain momentum is on track. We're starting to see improved results as August same-restaurant sales increased 2.9%. With new restaurant growth slowing, the operations teams are focused on improving the entire guest experience. The team also has enhanced the menu with new unique flatbreads, appetizers, salads and entr\u00e9es, which have been well received by our guests. Bahama Breeze continues to perform well, with solid same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter. Same-restaurant sales growth did decelerate some this quarter as we adjusted our discounting strategy. Our earnings significantly improved year-over-year. Eddie V's continues to build momentum with solid same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter. The team continues to elevate its service levels and ensure culinary excellence. We will continue to look for the appropriate real estate to develop this brand. A lot of the initiatives I've touched upon this morning are things we've discussed for some time, but you need to know that much of that time line is involved in the development and testing. Now these initiatives are being experienced by our guests and they're moving the needle on guest satisfaction scores, and I'm confident that will continue. One reason I'm confident is that we have such skilled and committed people. They have embraced change with enthusiasm and I could not be more proud of them. Matthew now has some additional information to share before Q&A. Matthew V. Stroud: Thanks, Gene. Before we turn to the Q&A, I would like to briefly discuss Darden's upcoming 2014 Annual Meeting. We've been speaking, and will continue to speak, directly with many of Darden's shareholders to hear firsthand what they think about the future direction and leadership of the company, and about Starboard's efforts to take effective control of the company by replacing all 12 of Darden's directors with Starboard's own preferred nominees and having them influence Starboard's plans. We believe that while many shareholders believe in the importance of having a board and leadership team who have a deep understanding of the company and its strategic shifts over time, they also believe that Darden would benefit from new perspectives. We also believe that many Darden shareholders have concerns about the risks and destabilization that would result from full board turnover and giving control to a single shareholder's nominees. We believe these risks are particularly acute, given the positive momentum we are achieving across our brands, including at Olive Garden, and given the potential adverse effects of giving Starboard control would have on our ability to recruit the best person to serve as the company's next Chief Executive Officer. The Darden board is committed to looking at the company with a fresh perspective and recently announced a new slate that aligns with that priority. Darden's new slate includes 4 new, highly-qualified independent nominees, unaffiliated with the company or Starboard, who bring relevant industry business and CEO experience; 4 highly-qualified, continuing independent director nominees, who provide important and deep understanding of the company's operations and the shifts in the industry and consumer trends over time and who have a record of taking proactive, decisive action to best position Darden for continued improvement and success; and 4 seats to be filled by candidates proposed by Starboard, therefore providing Starboard with a meaningful opportunity to participate in the decisions regarding Darden's strategic direction, including the selection of the company's next Chief Executive Officer. Under this reconstituted board, 8 of Darden's 12 independent directors will be new to the board this year. We believe this is a balanced slate that serves the best interests of all Darden shareholders and is also designed to avoid what we believe are significant risks associated with a full board turnover that Starboard is seeking. We look forward to talking more about Darden's slate of directors, nominees and the board's recommendation for the annual meeting over the coming weeks. The purpose of today's call, however, is to discuss our earnings results. So we ask that you please keep your questions focused on that topic. We thank you for your cooperation in that regard. Now we'll open it up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Jeff Bernstein at Barclays. [Operator Instructions] Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Did have one question and one follow-up. First on the core savings side of things. There's been a lot of discussion about opportunities to further reduce your cost structure on a variety of lines, but I know you guys are giving guidance specific to G&A. I think for this year, you were initially talking about maybe $60 million and then talk about upside to that. Was wondering if you can give us kind of an update where you stand in terms of expectations, whether it's just in the different buckets. I know you've mentioned the operating overhead and optimization of support and direct costs. Just wondering when we should expect kind of an update on that. I know you have third parties working on it, so just wondering if we could get any preliminary feedback or takeaways from that thus far. C. Bradford Richmond : Yes, this -- Jeff, this is Brad. And I'll start with your question there. Yes, you're correct and our focus has principally been on our support structure to the restaurants, which appears on the G&A line. I think over time, if you look at some of the big initiatives, they've been fairly broad based around the whole supply chain, around direct labor optimizations. So we've touched the whole P&L. Those programs continue to move forward. But as you mentioned, we brought in outside expertise to help us look at the entire business. That engagement is ongoing. And so we do see future opportunity there to make progress. But most importantly, to make that progress without affecting the guest experience. It's very critical that we approach that delicately, but with some swiftness and with some certainty of the costs that we can get out of that. And so that work is ongoing. We continue to narrow that down. And as we completed the separation of Red Lobster, I would -- you should expect to see us moving more quickly on that front now. Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Got it. And then just the follow-up. I know you mentioned, essentially your fiscal '15 guidance is unchanged. I know back in August, you were doing something unusual for you guys in terms of giving us quarterly numbers, and at the time, essentially brought down early estimates for the year and, therefore, led to kind of a bump up in the back half. I'm just wondering if you could talk about that meaningful acceleration the rest of the year from here. I mean, how much of it is predicated on the Olive Garden turn versus maybe the incremental benefit from repo and lower interest going forward? Or are there other unusuals that we should know about that leads to the outsized earnings growth kind of in the back half, just give us a little bit more color on the seasonality of the trend. C. Bradford Richmond : Yes, I mean, there is progression throughout the year as you look at a quarterly basis. Some of that is fairly simple and straightforward. So let me deal with those first. There's the extra week, the 53rd week, that benefit all crews in the fourth quarter, so obviously a meaningful impact there. Our debt paydown, which reduces interest. We look at interest expense now being that low-$20 million range on a quarterly basis. We don't have that impact at all in the first quarter. We just paid that down near the end of the quarter, and then some that gets paid down actually, in our fiscal second quarter. So you'll see interest expense interest went down to the -- pretty significantly there. And then additional use of the proceeds from the share buyback. Because with all that's been going on, that program is just now starting to get in place and so the benefit of a reduced share count will accrue mainly to the back half our fiscal year. So that's the mechanical items, if you will. But I think that the key thing is the progress that we're seeing on our brand work, particularly with Olive Garden. If you look at it on a sequential basis, we continue to make an improvement. And so we do expect that to continue, and that's also a driver of the business. Along with the continued strong performance from LongHorn and our Specialty Restaurant Group. We expect that to continue near the levels it's currently at. Eugene I. Lee: And Jeff, I would just add that in the third and fourth quarter, we expect a little less pressure on inflation, as we get past seafood and dairy, which were big impacts in the first quarter and will run in the second quarter a little bit. C. Bradford Richmond : And obviously, the other key item I forgot was last year's pretty unusual winter weather. It affected principally our third quarter. And so I think that's kind of the top line color, if you will, on the quarterly progressions and the drivers of that. Operator : Our next question will be from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Gene, a question on the Olive Garden Renaissance plan and your efforts around the operations side. And just wondering if you could elaborate on your plan to improve the execution at the unit level? And then maybe secondarily, one of the ideas that's been floated is to simplify the menu and change some of your food prep processes. And I'm just wondering if you could comment on whether that's something that you'd be interested in looking at or not, as it relates to the unit level operations? Eugene I. Lee: Yes, as far -- so let's start with ops ex [ph] -- execution. It's my belief that we need to go back to basics operationally and ensure that we set the standards -- the standards appropriately and then we work against meeting those standards. As I said in my comments, we've been focusing the last month just on breadsticks and improving our processes around that, including how well do we cook the breadsticks, how long do we hold it, how many do we serve. And now we're moving to pasta this month, and we're just systematically going through and hitting the most important things in the operation and improving our execution. We're working on staffing and scheduling to ensure that we're properly staffed to be able to deliver the experiences that we want to deliver in Olive Garden and we're making some progress there. So to me it's about back to basics. And we just need to do the basic things right every single day, and we need to energize our operations people, energize them and then also enable them to have the time to spend on improving the basics. As far as process, we are analyzing all the options in the back of the house to improve the overall process. We're open to readjusting those processes. We want to ensure that as we look at them, not only do we maintain the quality of the food products that we prepare today, but also the pride factor in the restaurant. And one of the biggest things that I've learned over the years in this business is that, as you change processes in the back, the people that are most impacted by that sometimes are your service people. And we have to really be careful how we work our way through that. But the answer to your question is we are, as we sit here today, looking at all those processes. We are looking at the possibility of outsourcing some of our production work. And it's going to take us some time to make sure that we make the correct decisions. I expect that we'll have some tests going here in the next 3 to 6 months, but that is something that we are definitely open to and we are pursuing and have been pursuing in the last -- since the last 6 months. Operator : Will Slabaugh of Stephens, you may ask your question. Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division : I wanted to ask about the guidance for the year and the margin. So after 1Q, it looks like your margins at the restaurant level need to grow at least modestly on a year-over-year basis to hit that guidance number. Just wondering if you expect to see that restaurant level margin expansion for the remainder of the year after the compression we experienced in 1Q? C. Bradford Richmond : Yes, I think as we look to the quarter, and Gene touched on it some there, was the commodity cost pressures, the dairy had been pretty extreme. We're at record levels for the dairy. And so that will abate, particularly as we get towards the end of the calendar year. So that will enable restaurant margins to improve it. Principally, it's affecting Olive Garden. But as we look sequentially through the quarters, we see restaurant earnings at levels, on a percentage basis, above the prior year. We would expect that to continue. And so I think the progress that Gene was talking about driving at Olive Garden is real -- the driver behind that beyond the higher commodity costs we have in the first part of the year. I think one thing -- and I'll go back a little bit to Jeff's question as well. The progression during the year is the share buyback from when we talked in June was delayed some, so there is less benefit coming from the share buyback within this fiscal year. The ultimate benefit is, obviously, still the same. But we've been making that up with operating performance as well. And so we like what we're seeing developing in the operating front. Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Got you. And just a quick follow-up if we look at the pricing in terms of those levels at Olive Garden. Do you feel like the new core menu has established an effective everyday value platform that you can now utilize to drive traffic in its own right? Or do you think the customers are still looking for something, maybe at a lower price point, to get them in the door on a more frequent basis? Eugene I. Lee: I think -- well, I think it's a combination of both. We do believe having an everyday $9.99 price point will allow us over time, to be less aggressive with our promotional activity and also allow us to migrate away from the price certainty that we've had for the past couple of years with our promotions and more or less starting at price point, which we've utilized the last couple of windows. And so we actually -- we think this $9.99 price point plays a big, big role. Because as a consumer, if you know it's there, you can be brought in by a promotional activity but then you can default back to it, if that's the price that you want to be at. And so when I mentioned the price sensitivity in my comments, we think that, that having that $9.99 price point is enabling us to, in the future, maybe be able to take a little bit more price and hold that $9.99 price point for the consumer that want to trade down into that menu item. Operator : The next question is from David Palmer, RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : The high overhead, the high G&A and the low advertising spending effectiveness, that's already gotten some attention from Darden and the Street. But a more controversial point made by the activists in its presentation is that Darden, and Olive Garden specifically, is an under-earner at the restaurant level due to both food and labor, representing over $100 million in opportunity. Do you see a similar Olive Garden efficiency upside? And perhaps, net of that, do you believe that you might have to reinvest some of those savings to really establish long-term, sustained, same-store sales traction? Eugene I. Lee: David, it's Gene. I think we've been making these investments in the last couple of years. I think the $9.99 price point is an investment that we've made as we move forward. I don't think that we have to continue to make investments in our menu. I think the value proposition is as strong as it has been in the last 3 years. I think the upside will continue to come from culinary innovation. But operational execution, I think, as we continue to operate and improve our day-to-day operations and create great value visits, that we can grow the business without making further investments into cost of sales or labor. C. Bradford Richmond : Yes, I would just add to Gene's comment there. When you look at the Olive Garden's business model and its particular strengths, as Gene mentioned, we've made a lot of investments already into that business to drive the top line. It takes a while for that to get there, but we're seeing the signs of that, that we like. But we don't see the way to really drive shareholder value by taking tremendous cost from where we are today out of that business. We think where we are today, we can grow the top line, maintaining the percentages where they are growing, and some because of the natural leveraging that comes with that, but really drives total, absolute cash flow, which translates into shareholder value. So the success from where we are and the platform that we have now is largely about driving the top line now, not highly focused on taking food off the plate from the consumers or less labor in the restaurant. We just don't see that as the way to get there. That being said, there are ways that we continue to explore, to be smart about our seafood purchasing, to be smarter around direct labor and optimizing that. But this broadly taking cost out of there is something that we're very hesitant to do. We always look at it, but we're hesitant to act on many of those type of initiatives. Eugene I. Lee: David, I would just add that as operators, we're always trying to figure how to improve our margins. But when I look at the Olive Garden P&L, it's about an absolute EBITDA per restaurant that's exciting. And so we're talking -- we're starting with $4.4 million in average unit volumes, and I think that we got to protect that AUV and grow that AUV, and obviously try to improve margins, but there's a healthy cash flow per -- absolute cash flow per restaurant today. Operator : Next question is from Matt DiFrisco, Buckingham Research. Matthew J. DiFrisco - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Gene, I have a little bit of a follow-up on and I think one of the other things that a lot of other peers and concepts and some of the other investors have also suggested with respect to your portfolio, there's an opportunity, maybe, to trim the menu a little bit. And I was wondering if you could speak to that. I guess in your reference from being with something like a LongHorn back when it was rare and its evolution now, and Olive Garden also, with your tenure at Darden, do you -- is there a case to be said that maybe the menu has gotten too big, too complex and some of the labor savings that might come with that? Some of your smaller peers, like BJRI who, as an activist, is already trying to trim their menu a little bit. Have we -- is that an industry trend that you think you could capitalize on as well, where maybe the labor savings are more back-of-the-house facing and less customer-facing. And then the follow-up to that is, what do you have as far as -- that would refute that, that would say \"No, we would sacrifice the sales in that $4 million AUV that you spoke of because depend on the variety and that is where we score. We can't risk taking that menu down.\" Eugene I. Lee: No, I think what you're talking about is something that Dave George and Val Insignares and I talk about every single day is, how do we continue to simplify our menu offerings and maintain our high variety ratings. And we do not -- we want to continue to simplify. We don't want to add complexity to the menu. As we rolled out the menu in Olive Garden 6 months ago, we knew we had -- we got too broad. But it's tough to take -- in casual dining, it's tough to take items off the menu. Everybody has their favorite menu item, and so we have to be very strategic as we do that. And one of Dave's projects right now in Olive Garden is saying, \"How do I decrease this menu by 20%? How do I maximize my SKUs? How do I ensure that when I'm in a category, I don't have too many menu items doing the exact same thing?\" So how do I ensure I don't have too many pasta, cheese and red sauce, and so on and so forth? So you are right on there. That's something that we'll continue to work on, but we also know that when you start pulling back the number of menu items, especially when you get away from entr\u00e9es, it is has a direct correlation to sales. And when you have -- there's -- when you have 8 appetizers on a menu versus 6, you sell more appetizers with 8, even when those appetizers are still in the similar gap. And so there's a real balance here that we have to watch, but the ultimate objective is as you described. We need to continue to simplify our menus, simplify our processes in how we prepare the food, and then how we deliver it. And it is something that we talk about here every single day. C. Bradford Richmond : Matt, the thing that I would add to Gene's comment and having been there and seen a lot of these from the financial perspective is, you need to maximize each section of the menu, and you have to optimize the total menu because -- particularly in Olive Garden's case, when you have a brand that's $3.6 billion, $3.7 billion and driving AUVs of $4.4 billion, you have to be very broad and appealing. And so you have to have that array to do that. I think Gene said -- as he said, getting the right items for each [ph] section, clearly there's opportunity to continue to work on that. And guest taste, guest preference change and evolve over time, so you need to move with that pace to do that. And so for us, from a financial perspective, it's more about maximizing, getting the total dollars versus trying to scale it down, maybe get better percentages, but you've got a smaller business. And I think that's been the hallmark of Olive Garden for so long, is the absolute breadth of appeal of that brand and the absolute total dollars on a per unit or for the total brand that, that business can drive, provides a lot of earnings power, a lot of cash flow. Eugene I. Lee: Then Matt, I would just -- I would finish this comment with, when we look at LongHorn against its major competitor, even though we may have more menu items today, our variety scores are lower. And so strategically, we, in LongHorn, continue to try to increase our variety scores to make ourselves available for more occasions. Operator : Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, you may ask your question. Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : A couple of technical questions first. You mentioned, Brad, a 10% effective tax rate for the adjusted earnings. Is that what you're thinking for the full year? And could you elaborate again or maybe give us more detail on what the first quarter was? C. Bradford Richmond : Sure. So in the first quarter, if you were to take out all the adjustments, it's about an 18% effective tax rate. Obviously, you've got the debt breakage and there's different accounting treatment for that, but 18%. If you look out to the full year, our expectation is around 10%, when you consider these type of entries in there. I think the key thing, as you look forward and run with the margin rates, so what's the additional earnings or some of the adjustments, that continues to be at 38%. So if you're trying to build your models, different scenarios, those would be the rates that you'd want to use. Is that what you're looking for? Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So yes, right. So lowering that from 12% to 10% implies the operating income is lower than your original expectations, is that correct? C. Bradford Richmond : No, as I mentioned, operating earnings are actually higher than what we thought at the beginning of the year, but we had the delayed impact of the share repurchase. And on a GAAP-reported basis, we actually have more debt breakage cost. Now it's more economically feasible because we could optimize who you wanted to surrender their bonds, so the cash cost was less and we get better going forward interest expense out of it. But no, operating performance, from where we began the year, is better. It's these other items that are providing less lift to our guidance. Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, and then just one more. Gene, I think you mentioned matching the marketing cost with the seasonality of the business. So is that why this second quarter, the November quarter, EPS numbers look high relative to historical standards because the marketing spend will be down significantly year-over-year? Eugene I. Lee: No, the marketing spend will not be down significantly in Q2. I got some people checking numbers here, but I believe we're pretty flat year-over-year in OG. C. Bradford Richmond : That's correct. Eugene I. Lee: That's correct. I think the second quarter has more of a brand mix, right? C. Bradford Richmond : Yes, I mean, if you're looking on a year-over-year basis, pulling out the Red Lobster piece, it's a key driver ahead of seasonality with a much greater dip in the second quarter, a stronger third quarter. And so if you're looking at previous numbers, that drives part of it. I think when you look at the guidance, we'll have the full impact of the debt reduction while beginning to see the impact of the share buybacks that are there. But it's really more -- continued margin improvements largely than the G&A reductions on a year-over-year basis -- or SG&A reductions on a year-over-year basis. And then as we talked about a little bit earlier, the mitigation on the year-over-year basis of the commodity costs, getting more back to that 2% range versus nearly 4% in the current quarter. Operator : We have a question from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Great. Can you guys share your thoughts on the health, I guess, or the state of the new product pipeline in Olive Garden? I'm only asking because it looks like -- I think it was the new Alfredo 3-course promotion contributed to roughly a 4% traffic decline in July, lapping a pretty favorable 8% decline in the year-ago month. Eugene I. Lee: Yes, the product pipeline is robust right now. We actually have a lot of products sitting on the shelf that we can pull out. We went back in July to Alfredo because it's the item that guests like the most. Well, we went 3-course against 2-for-$25, which wasn't as strong. And so there's was a promotional mismatch in July. We also moved some media around, and on top of what was a really tough 3 weeks for the industry, we did not -- the end of -- the last week in June and the first 2 weeks in July, we did not perform well. But I don't believe that had a whole lot do with the strength on that 3-course. The 3-course performed fairly well compared against our 3-course in the past, and we used -- and using Alfredo really, really helped us. It hurt us from a profitability standpoint because of the dairy spike. If we had known that dairy was going to be the levels it was at, we wouldn't have done it at that time. But very, very popular promotion, high preference, high guest satisfaction. But I do feel as though our pipeline is in really good shape and that the promotional -- our promotional activity I think has been pretty effective. Jeffrey D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And then, just to follow up on that. And again, you've highlighted this a couple of times in the call. But Olive Garden's results, clearly volatile intra-quarter, do show that there's still significant month-to-month, again, volatility. Looks to me like driven by that promotional calendar based on what you just said. But what is the latest thinking or strategy around reducing some of that volatility? You mentioned Cucina Mia section of the menu. Stable, everyday value might be something that can help. But what's the longer-term game plan here in terms of really getting -- or meaningfully reducing that volatility month-to-month? Eugene I. Lee: I think the key is to get the promotions that we've historically run, which are still very popular, like Never Ending Pasta Bowl, back into periods where they make sense. So the Never Ending Pasta Bowl makes sense in September. Our volumes are a little bit lower than our average. There's capacity for us to handle the extra volume that the promotion drives. It didn't make sense to be doing it at the last 2 weeks of August, when our restaurants are fairly -- are really busy. And that really worked out well for us this year, both from a sales and profitability standpoint. So once we get the calendar back to where we want to -- and we believe by this time next year, we'll have the calendar aligned and matched up year-to-year, and we won't be moving it back and forth. And we won't be -- yes. C. Bradford Richmond : Jeff, I would just add, that's why we had that quarterly guidance that's out there, because some of this variability is driven by the changes that Gene has talked about -- in Olive Garden's case, moving Never Ending Pasta Bowl. It's clearly the right decision to do. It did create some variability around the menu mix and traffic, but net-net, we think it's a better place to be. And as we've said, the last 2 weeks of August, we were wrapping on the Never Ending Pasta Bowl last year. We're actually -- provided some upside to our expectations. So some of it what's going on in the industry, but some of this is volatility that we are introducing because it's the right thing to do. Operator : Next, we'll have Keith Siegner of UPS -- UBS. Keith Siegner - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Gene, if I could just follow up a little bit on some of that week-to-week volatility at Olive Garden. I mean, the delta from July's numbers to the back half of August is pretty meaningful. And I mean, was this really just the cadence of promos against promos? I mean, the back half of August this year had the return of the Buy One, Take One with the Redbox. It had some discounts for online orders. Is that really what was just going on there, more so than, say, a macro? And then second to follow that up, on the To-Go orders, it seems like there was a fairly meaningful promotional push in the back half of August to help highlight this during a busy period, get people focused on it. Do you think that helped to contribute to the success of the To-Go? Eugene I. Lee: Yes, I'll take the first -- the second question first and say, absolutely. We were promoting it, so that definitely has increased the activity with To-Go. And as I said in the comments, we're now over 20%, but we don't feel like the activity is overdone. We think we're just introducing people to something that they want. The consumer feedback is fabulous on the To-Go. People are thrilled with the process. So again, I think the question is -- the answer to your question is, yes. We promoted it in that -- but we've gone from 10% growth to over 20% growth with that, and I believe this is going to stick. I believe To-Go is going to stick and it's going to continue to grow. As far as volatility goes, a lot of the volatility really comes down to TRPs [ph] per week. And we know that when we back off our TRPs [ph] in Olive Garden, which we did the 2 weeks that were really negative in the month of July, especially around the Fourth of July week, we saw the sales decline. We know pretty much when we increase TRPs [ph], what we're going to get, and when we decrease TRPs [ph], what we're going to get. And so that was where the volatility really came from. It was also the industry, the week of the Fourth of July, was down mid-single digits. And we were down a little bit worse than that, but the industry dropped significantly, while we were backing off TRPs [ph] and switching promotions. And so I'm really not that concerned about it. When I looked at the quarter, I believe that we had a lot more better weeks than we had bad weeks. C. Bradford Richmond : I'll just add a little bit. If you look quarter-to-quarter for the industry, there wasn't any macro improvement in the industry. Clearly, there was from July to August, but in all those cases, Olive Garden outperformed the industry on those majors in terms of its improvements from quarter-to-quarter or months during the quarter. So we're pleased. I think there are some promotional activities that are helping enforcing it. But I think more fundamentally, what we see is the progress that Dave George and team are making there, are changing the base trends in the business. Operator : That will come from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Olive Garden's traffic, it has performed better relative to the industry than it has in the recent past, which I definitely appreciate. But it did remain negative through the quarter. So what I'm really focused here is what you guys are assuming traffic will be for the balance of the fiscal year in order to achieve this earnings guidance. I know your same-store sales for Olive Garden need to be up about 0.5% to 2% for the balance of the year to hit the sales numbers. But what are the traffic assumptions within that, given what you're assuming for average check? And just a quick follow-up will be, under this new model without Red Lobster, what is the sensitivity with Olive Garden sales? What is 100 basis points of same-store sales worth to EPS going forward? C. Bradford Richmond : We've talked about our general guidance for the year and some pricing in that. So what I would say is, we get to the year, on annual basis, we are looking at traffic that will decline at Olive Garden. But if we look at the back half of the year, the expectation is going to be roughly flat to maybe slightly positive. The second quarter will likely be negative, though we're pleased with how we came out of August, particularly not having the Never Ending Pasta Bowl. So on a broad basis there, it's improvement from the trend that's been on. It is clearly better than where we see the industry going from a traffic perspective as well. And I didn't write it down -- what was your second question? Unknown Executive : 100 basis points. C. Bradford Richmond : Oh, 100 basis points. Yes, let me -- so 100 basis of same-restaurant sales across Garden on an annual basis is still in that $0.11 to $0.14 range. If we look at quarters, remember, second quarter's still seasonally lower than the others, not to the magnitude it used to be on a post-Red Lobster basis though. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay, and that number that you gave for EPS, that was on the whole chain? Or was that just on Olive Garden same-store sales? C. Bradford Richmond : That's the whole business. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : So are you able to boil it down just what the sensitivity on the Olive Garden comps would be? C.

[Operator Instructions] And I will turn the meeting over to Mr. Rick Cardenas. Thank you. You may begin. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon. While I have had the privilege of speaking with many of you during the past several weeks, I wanted to take a brief moment to introduce myself. My name is Rick Cardenas, and I\u2019m the SVP of finance, strategy, and technology, and a large part of my role is leading our investor relations outreach. We welcome those of you joining us today by telephone or the internet, and I look forward to working with everyone in the analyst and investment community. With me today is Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s interim CEO, and Brad Richmond, Darden\u2019s CFO. Following prepared remarks from Gene and Brad, we will take your questions. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s earnings press release, which was distributed earlier today, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today\u2019s discussion and presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. A reconciliation of these measurements is in our press release. In addition, we have also posted a few slides on our website under the \u201cinvestors\u201d tab that provide an overview of our first half financial results, a reconciliation of adjustments to second quarter earnings, and our fiscal 2015 outlook. Now, I will turn the call over to Gene. Eugene Lee : Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report improved performance in our business in the second quarter. Brad will provide more financial details in a moment, but at a high level, total sales from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.56 billion, a 4.9% increase from the second quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, our earnings per share were $0.28, which represents a 133% increase year over year. Olive Garden had same restaurant sales of positive 0.5%, the first positive quarter for the brand since the quarter ended May 2013. Longhorn Steakhouse continued to deliver strong same restaurant sales growth with an increase of 2.6%. We also saw continued gains in our specialty restaurant group, which delivered a 3.2% increase in same restaurant sales on a blended basis. I want to take the time now to do two things : provide an update on our go-forward strategy and discuss key highlights from operating performance in the quarter. Let\u2019s start with an update on our strategy. First, we believe our future success needs to start with our ability to improve same restaurant sales, resulting in increased market share and achieving best-in-class profitability. In order to achieve these goals and win in the marketplace, we are getting back to basics by increasing our focus on the core operational fundamentals of the business. In particular, this means providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in great food, with terrific service, all delivered in an appealing atmosphere. We are working hard to improve excellence in each of these areas to provide an outstanding guest experience and once again achieve industry-leading and sustainable same restaurant sales growth. Winning in the restaurants must be supported by a guest focused support structure across our field leadership and our restaurant support center. As you know, we announced some difficult but necessary decisions last month that made our support structure more efficient, both in terms of cost and decision making. Beyond our organization structure, we are pursuing other significant non-consumer-facing cost savings initiatives. We have recently engaged with Boston Consulting Group to help with the process and are encouraged by the opportunities identified. We expect to see meaningful benefits in fiscal 2016 and will have more detail to share in the quarters ahead. In parallel, with our focus on operations, the board and the management team also have the responsibility to ensure we\u2019re maximizing every element of our business in order to drive shareholder value. Our initial focus will be exploring options for our real estate portfolio, which includes more than 1,200 owned or ground leased properties across the country. We want to be comprehensive and thoughtful in considering the options to ensure we\u2019re maximizing shareholder value while also maintaining the best structure for our ongoing business. There are a number of options. To assist us with this comprehensive analysis, we are engaging advisors with extensive expertise in these types of valuations, including JPMorgan, Moelis & Company, and Skadden & Arps. The board and management team will also continue to evaluate other strategies, including franchising and the composition of our brand portfolio. However, real estate will be the first area of focus. Of course, there are no assurances we\u2019ll ultimately pursue any of these options. While we do not have a set timeline or additional details to disclose now, we plan to provide updates if and when appropriate. Lastly, a clear priority for the board is the selection of our next CEO. The board is actively engaged in the search process. Now let\u2019s turn to some highlights on our performance in the quarter. At Olive Garden, we have now had four straight months of positive same restaurant sales, the first time this has happened since November of 2010. We believe these results are early signs that our brand renaissance plan is beginning to take hold. Key consumer metrics on overall experience, quality of food, taste, value, and attentive service continue to trend in the right direction. Olive Garden\u2019s to-go business continues to experience significant growth, with sales in the quarter up over 15% versus last year. As we have discussed before, this is driven in large part to our online ordering platform, which we launched in July. We experienced an additional increase following the introduction of mobile ordering on November 3, and we now have more than 30,000 online orders coming in every week. This growth is very important as the check average is 30% higher when guests order online. Takeout represents 8.6% of our total sales. Given the increasing trend for convenience, we believe we can drive takeout sales above 12% over time. We have now completed 13 remodels, all with various investment levels and the results so far have been encouraging. Before proceeding with a meaningful capital investment, we will continue to evaluate the performance of these locations over a longer period of time. We believe opportunity exists to optimize the investment level to improve our returns. Therefore, we are deferring additional remodels for the rest of the fiscal year as we continue to evaluate our options. The progress at Olive Garden is really beginning to show, not just in response from our guests, but also in the way our managers and team members have embraced the brand renaissance and are leading the charge in the field. While there is much more we have to do, we definitely feel that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. Longhorn Steakhouse\u2019s same restaurant sales increased 2.6% for the quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth and industry outperformance. The same restaurant sales growth this quarter was driven by check growth, due primarily to the launch of Bold Bites in June. Bold Bites are smaller, individually portioned appetizers designed to satisfy guests seeking more choice on portion and flavor. While our core focus is to continue to offer great steaks, we introduced a new menu this quarter that expanded our variety beyond steak. This menu received positive feedback from both our operators and our guests. At Longhorn, we\u2019re also focused on elevating our guest experience and improving service through more consistent execution of our current standards, and our guest satisfaction scores show that we\u2019re at all-time highs for numerous key attributes, including food taste, server attentiveness, server knowledge, and value for money. The combination of disciplined operational execution and compelling marketing has driven our growth at Longhorn, which we expect to continue on both the top and bottom line. The Capital Grille recorded its 19th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. The brand continues to outperform the competitive set and its operating profit was higher than last year, despite high beef inflation. In October, the Capital Grille will launch the iPad wine list systemwide. This change enhances the guest experience, captures incremental sales, and provides us with the flexibility to adjust offerings more frequently. The Yard House had same restaurant sales of 3.7%, which was 250 basis points above the industry average. Including the addition of eight new restaurants, total sales growth was 16.2% and total profits increased year over year. The Yard House accomplished a lot during the quarter. The brand launched a one-page all-day menu, along with an independent drink menu that is easier to navigate. These changes had a positive impact on sales and margins. The Yard House also expanded afternoon and late night happy hour beverage offerings to include all spirits, a strategy designed to broaden the appeal of these day parts. The Seasons 52 team is working hard on every area of the guest experience. Their brand returned a positive same-store sales this quarter. However, total profit was down on a year over year basis. This was due in large part to the underperformance in newer nontraditional restaurants such as those in central business districts. We have learned from these restaurants and are encouraged by the results of our most recent openings, which are in suburban locations where the brand continues to be successful. Same restaurant sales at Bahama Breeze were slightly negative, while profits were slightly positive. The team is working through several profitable sales driving strategies for the second half of the year. In Eddie V\u2019s, same restaurant sales exceeded the industry and operating profit was up versus last year. And we are very pleased with the results and progress. Now, Brad will provide us with more detail regarding our financials. Brad? C. Bradford Richmond : Thank you, Gene, and good afternoon everybody. As we reported earlier today, on an adjusted basis, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fiscal second quarter was $0.28, a 133% increase from the adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter last year. On a reported basis, our net loss per diluted share was $0.24. The adjusted results exclude approximately $0.52 per share, of which $0.33 were noncash items. The breakout of the $0.52 includes $0.16 related to asset impairments at eleven restaurants and lease buyouts of two properties, $0.16 of severance and other costs associated with the support expense reduction efforts announced in November, $0.08 of cost associated with the strategic action plan, $0.07 for the impairment and related tax effects of [unintelligible] agriculture investment, $0.05 of debt breakage costs related to the previously planned retirement of $100 million of the company\u2019s debt. Now, page five on our web-based presentation provides the impact of these adjustments on a P&L line item basis. We will continue to operate the impaired restaurants. We will evaluate any potential future closure to optimize the value-creating opportunity as it arises. Now, second quarter sales from continuing operations increased 4.9% to $1.56 billion, from blended same restaurant sales increase of 1.5% and the addition of 52 net new restaurants. Food and beverage expenses were approximately 100 basis points higher than last year. The unfavorable cost increase was driven entirely by higher beef and dairy cost on a year over year basis. The elevated dairy cost fully accounts for the decline in Olive Garden\u2019s quarterly profits. Restaurant labor expenses were approximately 60 basis points lower than last year on a percentage of sales basis due to direct labor hour management, sales leveraging, and lower year over year restaurant manager incentive compensation. Restaurant expenses in the quarter were approximately 20 basis points higher than last year, principally due to higher rent. Excluding the adjustments previously noted in both years, selling, general, and administrative expenses were approximately 140 basis points lower on a percentage of sales basis, due to the impact of the cost reduction initiatives we undertaken in the past year and leveraging of our sales increase. We anticipate the general and administrative portion of these expenses, as a percentage of sales, to be below 5% for the entire fiscal year now. And, in total, in spite of the significant commodity pressures, EBIT margins improved 80 basis points versus last year for the current quarter. We retired $100 million in debt in the second quarter, which brings our total debt reduction to $1 billion for the fiscal year. Our reduced debt levels contributed to lower interest expense of approximately $13 million in the second quarter and we expect a $30 million reduction for the current fiscal year. The annualized reduction we anticipate to be $49 million. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects a 19% rate on our continuing operations before adjustments. Because of the discrete accounting treatment of many of the adjustment items, our total tax rate on the reported quarter loss was 44%. Excluding the adjustments, our annual effective tax rate is expected to be closer to 20%. We estimate our annual effective tax rate on a reported basis will be a credit rate of approximately 5%, driven by the loss attributable to the earnings per share adjustments I previously detailed. During the second quarter, we took delivery of over 8.6 million shares of stock under our previously announced accelerated share repurchase authorization. This contributed $0.01 to second quarter EPS, which is consistent with our previous expectations and is expected to have a positive impact of $0.11 on the fiscal 2015 EPS. The annualized impact of the $500 million accelerated share repurchase is anticipated to be approximately $0.17. Now, turning to our commodity cost outlook, food cost inflation in the second quarter net of our cost savings efforts was approximately 4.3%, driven by beef and dairy inflation. In the fiscal year, our current expectation is that our commodity basket will see net inflation of approximately 3%, which is higher than the 2% to 2.5% we communicated in September. Now, with this, this implies a 2% to 2.5% inflation rate for the second half of our fiscal year. That\u2019s up from our previous expectation of approximately 1% for that same period. Looking at it category by category, for the remainder of fiscal 2015, beef costs are higher on a year over year basis, with 15% of our usage covered. [Seafood] costs are lower on a year over year basis, with 90% of our usage covered. Poultry costs are higher on a year over year basis, with 70% of our usage covered. Wheat costs are higher on a year over year basis, with two-thirds of our usage covered. And dairy costs are higher on a year over year basis, with approximately one-fourth of our usage covered. This is approximately the same total coverage that we had at this point last year, but with less coverage in beef and dairy, because we expect market prices to be lower than what we could have previously contracted for. Now let\u2019s turn to our guidance for the full fiscal year. We expect same restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden to be even to plus 1% to last year, Longhorn Steakhouse to be approximately 2% to 3% above last year, and our specialty restaurants also to be up approximately 2% to 3%. We continue to expect to open approximately 37 net new restaurants for the fiscal year. I should point out that there are some key drivers of the significant EPS growth that we have anticipated in the second half of the year, and they\u2019re detailed on the bottom of page six in our presentation, but I want to highlight that they really include the general business improvement that we\u2019re seeing, including the lap on last year\u2019s severe winter weather, the benefits of our debt reduction, the benefits of the accelerated share repurchase program, and the fact that this year contains an extra, or 53rd, week. We anticipate adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $2.25 and $2.30 for fiscal 2015. On an unadjusted basis, or reported basis, we anticipate net diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.30 to $1.35 for the year. Consistent with our commitment to maximize free cash flow, we are also lowering our projected fiscal 2015 capital expenditures. This reduction is from the plan to [unintelligible] evaluating the results and the spending level of the Olive Garden remodel program and more broadly, a greater focus on capital spending. We expect to finish the year a little over $300 million compared to the $325 million to $350 million previously communicated. In the second half of the year, we will continue our share repurchases of up to $200 million, funded with our free cash flow. Before we take your questions, Gene has a few closing comments. Gene? Eugene Lee : Thanks, Brad. Let me conclude our prepared remarks with a few additional thoughts about the past several months and the progress we have been making across our business. First, I\u2019d like to acknowledge that this is our first earnings call since the election of our new board of directors. Our board has been engaged in the business from day one, and the management team and the board are working well together in order to ensure we have the right strategy to drive long term value creation for our shareholders. This change has brought about a positive energy across the company that extends from our management team, all the way to our restaurants. Our teams are excited about our sharpened focus on restaurant operations, and we\u2019re all motivated to build on the momentum in the business both on the top and bottom line. Second, we are pleased with the early indicators that our strategic initiatives are driving improved operating performance. These initiatives are not a quick fix, but rather a journey designed to strengthen the most important elements of our business : improving the quality of our food and the service we provide to our guests. There\u2019s still a long way to go, and we are committed and excited to continue to drive toward reaching our full potential. We believe the strong foundation we have laid across all of our brands during the past year will help us to continue to improve sales and earnings growth during the back half of this fiscal year and into fiscal 2016. Finally, I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their dedication in providing a great experience for our guests. This has not been an ordinary year for Darden, yet despite all the noise and potential for distractions, our restaurant teams are as focused as I\u2019ve ever seen them. Their efforts are an integral part of our positive results this quarter and our employees should be very proud of the progress we\u2019ve achieved. With that, we\u2019ll open up the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from Mr. Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff Farmer : I recognize it\u2019s still very early, but just going back to some of the marketing and advertising savings that [unintelligible] had pointed to several months ago, I\u2019m just curious if the new board has had a chance to look at some of the media efficiencies, the effectiveness of the current game plan. I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any early updated thinking on potentially what a new marketing strategy would be moving forward. Eugene Lee : We continue to look at our marketing strategy and becoming as efficient as we possibly can. When we think about how we spend our marketing dollars, especially in the large brands, we look at Olive Garden, and as our primary message on television, our secondary message on television, and then our third, which is our lunch messaging on television. Then we have digital, and then we have some local messaging after that. Right now, what we\u2019re focused on is optimizing the right mix between promotional, secondary, which is more brand, and then lunch. And we\u2019ve moved to approximately 25% of our spend to be digital, and we believe that we\u2019ve been able to, and we will reduce some of our working media. But our real focus from a savings standpoint right now is to continue to reduce our non-working media. We have also engaged A&M to come in and work with the Olive Garden management team to do a comprehensive review of the go-to-market strategy, how we develop products, how we bring them to life, how we then advertise, and how we spend all our advertising dollars, and what is the right mix. And so this has been a project that we\u2019ve been working on for some time, and we continue to change the media mix each and every quarter to try to optimize it. We have some really good diagnostics that provide great analysis for us, and we think that we\u2019re doing a much better job with that over the last nine months or so. Operator : Next we have Mr. Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Gene, thinking about the broader industry, perhaps, just wondering if you can talk about your confidence about the most recent uptick, one, in the industry is sustainable and maybe the key drivers you think have led to that. And how do you decipher between the broader improvement in the macro relative to the Olive Garden\u2019s specific initiatives. Just seems like it would be difficult to decipher if your initiatives are actually working versus the macro. And just maybe as a follow up, if you could just prioritize what you think are Olive Garden\u2019s significant initiatives that you think would be the most compelling or effective that have driven the improvement. Eugene Lee : I think I\u2019d start with saying that Olive Garden\u2019s performance against the industry in November actually significantly improved, where we beat the industry both on guest count and on a sales basis. The comment that the overall industry has picked up, that\u2019s not what November Knapp-Track is saying. November Knapp-Track actually was weaker than October. We\u2019re actually seeing some deceleration in casual dining. And so I\u2019m very pleased that Olive Garden performed as well as it did, and moved ahead of the industry in November, with pretty much a straight-up comparison. It wasn\u2019t like the prior months, where we were moving Neverending Pasta Bowl. We slid that back, so that messed a little bit with the comparisons. So when I look at the improvement that I think we\u2019re seeing in Olive Garden, it has more to do with us gaining against the industry versus a situation where we have a rising tide and all boats are being lifted. Jeffrey Bernstein : And you think, if you prioritized those initiatives that you think Olive Garden\u2019s already put in place, is there a couple that you\u2019d say these are having an immediate impact, and that you think is a driver of that narrowing of the gap, or reversing of that gap? Eugene Lee : Yeah, I\u2019m going to point to two, I think, very important things. Number one was the commitment to put a 999 price point on the menu with everyday value. And so the preference on that item continues to grow. And what that is enabling Dave and the team to do is to pull back on the promotional intensity of their messaging and the pricing of those promotions. And we believe that is a real key to driving long term success. The second piece that I believe is really important in the Olive Garden momentum is to-go. To-go, we defined that as an important opportunity. We put resources behind it. Quickly enabled us to get to online ordering, and we\u2019re seeing that business grow at 15%. And this is driven by a consumer need state of convenience. Consumers want convenience. Olive Garden has great food that travels very, very well, and we believe we\u2019re delivering on that consumer need state extremely well, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re experiencing this kind of growth in takeout. So those two things, everyday value, not having to rely on our promotional activity, be such a deep discount, and then to-go, I think is really driving some positive momentum in the business. Operator : Next we have Mr. Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk Management. Howard Penney : My question is on the Olive Garden, and in the first quarter, you specifically called out how well the Olive Garden was doing in the press release. And then in the second quarter, you didn\u2019t, and you didn\u2019t mention the renaissance plan as well. And now the remodels don\u2019t sound like they\u2019re going too well and/or they might be too expensive. So without a remodel program, can you talk to the extent to which you can actually improve the Olive Garden and the renaissance plan without improving the asset base? Eugene Lee : Let me clarify a couple of thoughts around the remodel plan, and then I\u2019ll get back to the essence of your question. We are very pleased with the initial results of the remodels. What we\u2019re having difficulty reading is what level of investment is necessary to create the highest return on that invested capital. We know the key to remodeling an Olive Garden is for the team to figure out how to add between 20 and 28 seats in each of the buildings. That\u2019s an important part. And so that\u2019s kind of a given in a remodel package. From there, how do we best utilize the dollars that we have available and what\u2019s the right investment level? And that\u2019s why we\u2019re pausing, because we don\u2019t have a long enough time at this point in time to read the different investments that we have out there. But I do believe going forward as we move into \u201916, we will have to refresh some of these older buildings. On the overall confidence on the business, I believe that the four pillars that we\u2019ve been talking about are key. The first is around menu. We have to continue to deliver everyday value, choice and variety, and convenience. And I think we\u2019re doing a very good job on all three of those things, but there\u2019s still work to be done. We know that we have to simplify the menu to increase our speed of service, improve our quality. So although we\u2019ve made some very good first steps, work to be done. We know from an operations standpoint, we can improve our service. And if we can improve our service, we know we can improve the frequency of our guests. Third is communication. We have to improve how we communicate with our guests, with the voice in which we communicate. So we\u2019ve got to improve our television advertising, we think there\u2019s some things that we can do from a digital standpoint. And one of our big upsides with our very large database is to refine our customer relationship management and really work to develop the appropriate loyalty program that will make people choose Olive Garden over other competitors. The fourth piece of the pillar has been about the remodel and the touchpoints, and there are a lot of other things that we can do inside these restaurants to improve the overall atmosphere that don\u2019t mean changing the sticks and bricks. But there are things like uniforms, plate ware, flatware, music, things like that, that can really improve the overall atmosphere, that we\u2019re working on, we\u2019re implementing those changes. And we believe that if we combine all those together, that we\u2019ll have a business that has a compelling value proposition that will continue to grow over time. Operator : Our next question is from Mr. Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Brian Bittner : I have two questions. The first question is on the earnings outlook. Can you just walk us through what exactly drove the increase in the midpoint of the guide? I know it was a small increase, but it still, I think, highlights the confidence you guys have in the rest of the year. So are you more comfortable with just the cadence of comps, or is it being driven by what you\u2019re doing on the G&A line? If you could just first walk us through those dynamics, I\u2019d appreciate it. Bradford Richmond : We provided some supplemental information with our website, and we detail some of these key drivers for us. Many of those are in place. So the debt paydown has reduced interest impact. I think I said $30 million in my prepared comments for the year, I should have said $38 million. But you can see that that adds roughly $0.18 in EPS. You can look at the share repurchase program that we\u2019ve done. That\u2019s about $0.09 for us. Then with the 53rd week it\u2019s $0.05. So the remaining $0.22 to $0.27 is really driven by the business improvement, which is the same restaurant sales performance that we\u2019ve talked about, many of these cost initiatives. We ended the second quarter at the high end of what we had expected. We finished the first half of the year with a 26% increase in adjusted EPS to last year. Our guidance suggests a 34% to 38% increase in the back half of the year, and obviously that step up is driven by the larger impact from the debt paydown and share repurchase, and obviously all the 53rd week. But the core business itself is supported by the comp range that we\u2019ve been talking about for Olive Garden at flat to 1%, as well as the 2% to 3% for both the Longhorn and specialty restaurants. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve baked into that. I think a key assumption to point out is the impact of adverse weather mainly in the third quarter, first part of fourth quarter. And last year was a very severe impact to us, the geographical area hit us where we had the biggest concentration of restaurants and hit us more on the weekends. So we\u2019re obviously hoping that\u2019s not the case this year. Our guidance is built on what we call a normalized or rolling five-year average, and so we do expect some improvement from that, but we just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to predict that one, and we\u2019ll hope for the best weather, and if we can be on the good side of that, we\u2019ll have more earnings. If it turns out to be similar to last year, that will put downward pressure on us. But we believe, when you look in totality, all the moving parts, if you will, in building the estimate, that the range that we\u2019ve suggested gives us ample room to land somewhere in between there. Brian Bittner : When I look at the guidance for Olive Garden comps, it does imply about 1% to 2% in the second half, but obviously what jumps out, I think, to everyone, is the fact that you\u2019re facing comparisons there, weather-driven comparisons at Olive Garden this quarter, that are almost 500 basis points easier. And the industry obviously does face much easier comparisons as well. And again, I know you\u2019re impacted by weather, but how should we think about the cadence of these sales if weather is normalized? Can we think about two-year trends here holding? Is that too ambitious? Or under normalized weather, how can we think about that going forward over these next two quarters of really easy comparisons? Bradford Richmond : The best way I would define that is with the guidance of flat to 1% for the year, they need to be at about plus 0.5% to plus 1.5%. They\u2019re stepping out of the second quarter being up 0.5%, and so maintaining that run rate is what we have in there, and then a little bit of lift from the weather. If we make further progress in that business than what we\u2019re anticipating, we know how our business model reacts, and there\u2019s strong flow through on the incremental sales. So to the degree, to your point, if weather and other things work better, I\u2019m confident that our model will deliver high end of this range, and if the weather\u2019s really good, or we make further progress, potentially above it. But I don\u2019t think, where we are today, that that\u2019s the best communication we can say, that it\u2019s anything above or below that range. It\u2019s our best knowledge of all those pieces today. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research. Matt DiFrisco : I just wanted to switch gears a little bit on the assessment of the real estate portfolio and the stores of the Olive Garden brand. You guys were growing through the beginning of the recession, so if I look back sort of from - the Olive Garden brand has expanded almost 200 stores from 2007 to now. Are we completely done with the process of assessing potential closures of the stores? I know with the new board and everything, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of process going on as far as looking at the portfolio and the stores. Are there stores that might be underperforming that could be either relocated or closed down and benefit neighboring stores? I\u2019m just wondering, has there been a study as far as the saturation and the quality of the stores, if there\u2019s a benefit from closures. Bradford Richmond : We have a fairly robust and ongoing evaluation of our restaurant portfolio, and in particular with Olive Garden, it has expanded, as you mentioned, over time, but we look at that pretty carefully, and I know that Olive Garden hasn\u2019t performed as well as we would like for it to have performed recently. But what I would caution on is it started from very high absolute levels of performance and it\u2019s really lost momentum, is how I think of that business. So actually, the performance is quite strong, and the restaurants we have are providing sufficient cash flow for that investment. But every year, we look at that portfolio. There\u2019s two to three roughly in that brand that are relocated, are rebuilt, to sort of that same trade area. And so I would not expect any significant changes from that. We did a full review with some of the actions we\u2019ve taken this quarter to look at our overall portfolio, and I think honestly just addressed how strong that brand is and how strong those individual restaurants are performing. But we think there\u2019s a lot of upside for those restaurants and we like where they\u2019re positioned. Eugene Lee : I would just add that Olive Garden restaurants doing $3.5 million with the margin structure are still very, very productive. On the lower end, $3.5. We built a lot of restaurants in the last couple of years in green space. These restaurants, at $3.5 million, a million dollars below the system average, are still highly productive. Matt DiFrisco : With respect to gasoline prices, I guess the general consensus opinion is that it\u2019s a net positive for restaurants. Have you seen any beginning signs of regional weakness at all? Or is it too early to see, as far as those states that might be more energy influenced with jobs and the aspirational spender? Or has it so far been somewhat of a net positive in incremental dollars and more driving and more consumer dispersion that\u2019s been benefitting the restaurant space? Eugene Lee : I think that\u2019s a very good question. We have seen no weakness to date in what I would call the oil-dominant markets. We have seen, as I said earlier, Knapp-Track weaken starting with the switch in Halloween. That was a real weak comparison year over year, and then we haven\u2019t seen it get back in November to where it was in October. So we\u2019re on the lookout for signs, especially probably in Texas would be the place that we would get the first signal, that the current energy situation is having an effect on employment and attitude. But we haven\u2019t seen it yet. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Gene, first just sort of a broader picture question. Your new board was a big proponent, or there was a proposal for cutting a significant amount of costs in the business, and it sounds like you\u2019ve employed some consultants. So what\u2019s the timeframe where we might think we\u2019d get a more definitive answer, whether it\u2019s advertising or it\u2019s more overhead, or whether it\u2019s going to be some of the other things that are proposed, what\u2019s the timeframe to review that and get a more definitive answer? Eugene Lee : Right now, we have BCG in working on our indirect spend, which we define indirect spend as it\u2019s all spending that is not managed by purchasing. And our initial findings are very encouraging. We also have other cost savings initiatives going on, and we believe they\u2019ll have meaningful impact. I believe that we will have an update as we get into next quarter\u2019s call and start talking about fiscal 2016. We\u2019ll be able to, I really think, reveal a range that we think is possible for the company. I believe today it\u2019s just a little too early for me to put a number out there. If I put a number out there, I\u2019m not sure it would be too high or too low. And so we just need a little more time to do our due diligence. Again, we\u2019ve hired BCG, we\u2019ve got Alvarez and Marsal in here working on the marketing side, on Olive Garden, and we have multiple other cost initiatives. My commitment is that we are going to cut our costs moving forward, in all areas of the organization. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now, and it\u2019s just too early for me to give you a number. John Glass : And I wanted to just take one thing you mentioned, about the takeout business. It sounds like it grew 15%. I\u2019m not sure if that was this quarter or over a longer period of time. But that\u2019s 8% or 9% of sales, and it\u2019s growing 15% of sales, it\u2019s over a point of comp, I think. Is that the right way to think about it, that the takeout business has been the predominant driver of sales recently? Or am I mixing numbers up? Eugene Lee : No, you\u2019re absolutely correct. It\u2019s a predominant driver of sales, and the way I think about it is, some of that business, there\u2019s some trading there. And so we have some people that we\u2019re trading out of an in-restaurant experience to the to-go experience, but to maintain our growth, we\u2019re creating capacity and we\u2019re filling that capacity in the restaurants. So it\u2019s not like this is totally a negative trade for us. So your math is correct, and it\u2019s a big part of our strategy, is we\u2019ve identified convenience as a need state that we can meet for the consumer, because of the type of food that we serve. It\u2019s so well-served for takeout. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Joseph Buckley : I\u2019d like to ask the EPS revision question a little differently. You\u2019ve written off a lot of things this quarter. How much of that narrowing up of the range by $0.03 is, presumably that\u2019s appreciation on some of these things written off that has disappeared. Bradford Richmond : That\u2019s actually very little impact to the current year. I think more the raising of the range is the performance in the second quarter. We were at the high end of what we had previously expected, and we\u2019re further into the year, so we can refine our estimates a little bit. But the big impacts we talked about in November, when we announced the actions that we took then around reduction in force, and those have really been, in the current fiscal year, used also [unintelligible] this commodity inflation, which has gone up quite a bit from what we were previously thinking in the back half of the year. But we do see that rate of inflation coming down on a sequential basis, and so we would expect the actions we take in November and the other items here to make a meaningful impact to our 2016 earnings expectations. Joseph Buckley : And then you mentioned hiring several consultants and banking firms, A&M, BCG, JPMorgan. Are those costs going to be lumped in additional strategic costs? Are there more adjustments coming? And what do you think you\u2019re going to spend on the real estate studies, the marketing studies, and the cost study? Bradford Richmond : So, the cost for what BCG is doing will be netted against the benefit we derive. That\u2019s not really a callout item. The same with A&M. Now, obviously, something in the real estate area, that we do a transaction there, those costs will really be netted against that benefit at that particular time. And so if something\u2019s driving a benefit in the current year, the cost to implement that has to be offset against each other. Operator : And our next question comes from Mr. Chris O\u2019Cull of KeyBanc. Chris O\u2019Cull: Gene, you talked about some of the changes in strategic priorities, but would you help us with sequencing? Is the board working with management on developing an overall corporate strategy or a multiyear plan? Or is it waiting to complete the CEO search? And would it implement some of the changes to the real estate ownership before hiring a CEO? Just trying to understand the sequencing here. Eugene Lee : The management and the board are working together to really look at what all the alternatives are. And so as we think about it, real estate is the biggest opportunity and it\u2019s really not consumer-facing. I like to say that our guests don\u2019t walk into a restaurant and say, is this owned, or leased? And so it really doesn\u2019t interfere with our focus of creating great dining experiences. And so we believe we have a good strategy in place to grow shareholder value, and it\u2019s really starting at the focus on the core operational fundamentals of the business. Now, we\u2019re working closely with the board to look at all areas of improvement, and we believe starting with the real estate portfolio is the most important. So I see it as two paths. Operationally, we need to improve the overall day-to-day operations, and that\u2019s inclusive of a lot of things. That\u2019s inclusive of growing sales, managing costs, so on and so forth. On the other strategic side, trying to maximize shareholder value, we\u2019ve prioritized real estate as the key priority. And as we move forward, we\u2019ll take another look at some of the other alternatives that could be available to us. But prioritization is really important. How much the organization can handle at one time, I think, is a real key consideration. And so as I said in my prepared remarks, the board is very engaged. We think we have a plan that can be executed over the next six months, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at at this point in time. I think we\u2019ll come back after we move along in the real estate process and understand how that\u2019s going to play out, and at that time, we\u2019ll take a look at some other strategic alternatives to drive shareholder value. But most importantly, real great shareholder value is going to be created through improvement in our overall operations. We must drive profitable same restaurant sales. And so we\u2019re extremely focused organically on that right now. Chris O\u2019Cull : And I appreciate that, and my question really wasn\u2019t related to some of these tactical changes, even the sale of some real estate. What I\u2019m trying to understand, though, is Darden, in the future, going to be focused on managing brands that are more mature, that are great cash generators? Is it going to be focused on unit growth? Is it going to be focused on a combination of this? What\u2019s Darden Inc. going to look like in three years? Is the board working through that process? Eugene Lee : You\u2019re talking about a real comprehensive, longer-term strategy, and I do think that the board and the new CEO will have to work through that and will have to, after they make their decision, will have the right forum in which to inform the public of the long range plan. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Diane Geissler with CLSA. Diane Geissler : I just wanted to ask a followon question to that very topic, on the decision about remodels versus the reorg [state]. I appreciate that real estate is not a customer facing strategy, but to the extent that you\u2019re delaying remodeling of your portfolio, I\u2019m assuming, because you want to determine if you want to sell and lease back, or do some other kind of financial structuring, weren\u2019t the early indications on the remodeled units that the lift [did] change those sales with something like 600 basis points? Eugene Lee : Yeah, I think there are two distinct different issues. Finding a way to utilize our real estate to increase shareholder value is one. The decision to hold and slow down the remodels is really around this idea that we have, out of the 13 out there, we have five or six different investment levels. And the results, as you mentioned, have been very positive, but the performance between investment level A and investment level C is not that different. And that\u2019s causing us to pause and to say, what is the right investment level that we need to make and get the appropriate return on that investment to drive and refresh the Olive Garden business? And so I see this more as just being prudent, slowing down, and making sure that we\u2019re making the right investment. Half of these 13 restaurants have been done for less than 60 days. The initial read is very, very difficult. What we\u2019re trying to do here is really just be prudent and make sure that we measure twice and cut once. And that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing. Bradford Richmond : I would just emphasize the point that Gene is making, and it\u2019s around capital discipline. This was a significant capital investment, and so we want to have a thorough evaluation. I think the key that we\u2019re trying to determine right now is the durability of these results, and separating between the investment levels, so that we optimize the return that we can get on this investment. And then to the first part of your question, real estate opportunities that we may pursue are totally independent of the remodel choices that we have. And today, we operate a number of leased restaurants, and so we don\u2019t anticipate doing anything that would hamper our flexibility to operate these restaurants. So I would separate those two items as different decision points. Diane Geissler : So sale and lease [unintelligible] some restaurants wouldn\u2019t prevent you remodeling down the road? Bradford Richmond : Not anything that we\u2019re aware of. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein. Sara Senatore : Can I ask a question about a different piece of the business, that you\u2019ve also talked about from a strategic perspective, and that\u2019s the SRG? I think initially, I was under the impression that might be the easiest thing to do, which is to [unintelligible] that off into a separate company. But now it sounds like you\u2019re more focused on the real estate or refranchising. So can you talk about whether SRG, if that\u2019s still something that\u2019s on the docket? And how do you think about prioritizing that versus some of the other things? Eugene Lee : Everything is still on the table, and being analyzed. We believe, after working with the board and discussing what the options are, that addressing the real estate opportunity is the right decision. As we decide what the right brand portfolio is, what brands are in the Darden portfolio, if there is a spin, is something that the board wants to evaluate. However, I do think it\u2019s important for them to gain a better understanding of how all these businesses work before those types of decisions are made. And so everything is still absolutely on the table. There were hard choices that had to be made, and we thought that the real estate, at this point in time, was probably the least disruptive and the opportunity that hopefully could give us a chance to increase shareholder value. Sara Senatore : And if I just may ask about the real estate, is there any portion of the business that could not tolerate a sale lease back, where margins are slim enough that it really wouldn\u2019t make sense to then burden them with rent expense? Is there sort of a percentage of the store base where you just couldn\u2019t do that? Bradford Richmond : None that we\u2019re aware of. When you look at the strength of our individual restaurants\u2019 financial performance, nothing comes to our attention at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : I wanted to get back to the previous question about potential cost opportunities in 2016, and I think, Gene, you described it as the controllables are those costs that were not controlled by the purchasing department. And presumably, that means labor, and the cost per labor hour typically goes up - I guess it always goes up really in any economy. And so understanding that labor cost per hour is going to go up, how big of a restructuring might be possible on your labor line? And are you confident at this point that that can be done with not only no customer disruption, but actually customer benefit? Eugene Lee : I think you\u2019re referring to labor at the restaurant level, and the way I would talk about labor at the restaurant level is about developing a system that\u2019s as efficient as it possibly can be. I think it\u2019s the opportunity of all operations departments inside the restaurant industry to be rethinking how they deliver the guest experience inside their building. And as we move forward, it\u2019s going to be important for us to increase productivity of our operations, and that starts with how we build our menus, how we design our preparation procedures, how we design our cooking procedures, how we service the guest. And so there\u2019s going to be pressure on our ability to become more efficient. The methodology that I like to use in this business is how many labor hours do we need to use to create a guest? And we need to create more guests from every labor hour that we use. And so you are correct. There will be pressure on the labor line. We just can\u2019t continue to ask our people to work harder. We have to design more effective operations. And I firmly believe that starts with how you design your menus. We also need to use technology, and then we need to think about simplification. Simplification is something that a lot of restaurateurs are talking about today, but it\u2019s going to be an important part moving forward. How simple can you create an operation and still have the value proposition that you need to drive the business? Bradford Richmond : And I would just add one thing. If you look at our cost basket, food and beverage is about a third of it, and labor at the restaurant level is about another third of it. So those have a lot of opportunity outside of restaurant labor to pursue on top of how Gene was talking about we could go at restaurant labor itself. So we see a wide area of opportunity. First thing that we\u2019ve been talking about is the G&A, and we\u2019ve made tremendous progress in that area. You can look at our year over year performance has been pretty good. And the fact is, as we look forward, we see ourselves below 5% for G&A as a percentage of sales. John Ivankoe : Yes, and I certainly see that, but question was really at the store level, as Gene pointed out. And if I may continue on that theme, do you remember a couple of years ago, at one of your analyst meetings, I think it was Dave George that was talking about some kitchen simplicity and operation, the menu simplicity at Olive Garden, that he was beginning to work on and maybe paralleling some of the [BB] experience at Olive Garden that maybe would be an opportunity at Longhorn. So have these initiatives not yet been implemented, or are they just beginning to be implemented, or is there still a long runway to go in terms of the menu and kitchen simplicity that will presumably help on the cost side? Eugene Lee : When Dave got to Olive Garden, one of the first things he did was implement significant change to the kitchen operation, which created, I believe, approximately $20 million in cost savings. And so he\u2019s been developing what he would call phase two of kitchen simplification now, but a lot of that is going to come from how the menu evolved over time. We also are looking at ways to prepare our soups more efficiently. We\u2019re looking at ways to prepare our sauces more efficiently. And so there\u2019s some production opportunities available to us in Olive Garden. As far as Longhorn goes, the nature of a steakhouse business is that it\u2019s extremely simplistic. And that\u2019s why we create 2.7 guests for every labor hour we use in Longhorn, and we create 2.1 guests for every labor hour we use in Olive Garden. And so the opportunities for simplification in Longhorn, although they are there, are not as great as the opportunities for simplification in the Olive Garden operation. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Keith Siegner with UBS. Keith Siegner : Just two quick ones for me. To go back to the to-go business, the takeout business, and congratulations on such good success with that, as we think about that being a big part of the same-store sales, as you mentioned, how do we think about the margins on the to-go business versus the base business? If this business continues to have this kind of momentum, how do we think through that marginal margin? Eugene Lee : First of all, let me just reiterate that the check average is significantly higher with the online ordering, and when we move people away from ordering meals off the menu and move them to more of a bulk order, the margins improve. And so in other words, we get orders for trays of lasagna, family meals. They\u2019ve got meals that they\u2019re offering for four, for eight, for twelve, for sixteen. The next evolution now is to get more into this catering and delivery type business, which we think is a huge opportunity. So the answer to your question, margins do improve when we get to the bulk takeout orders. Obviously, the margins, when we\u2019re doing meals to go, are the same as they are as in the restaurant, except we lose the beverage occasion, which helps leverage our margins down in the restaurant. So we\u2019re relying on this bulk business to improve the overall takeout margins. Keith Siegner : And then another question, just to follow up, lunch specifically, there\u2019s a lot of competitive intensity in lunch, a lot of different concepts really trying to get creative and draw in that incremental traffic. Could you talk a little bit about the traffic trends at Olive Garden you\u2019re seeing at lunch? Maybe some of the specific programs you have in place there to address the increased competitive intensity? Eugene Lee : Lunch is definitely an opportunity at Olive Garden. We\u2019re feeling much more pressure with guest counts at lunch than we are at dinner. Lunch is based around the convenience for a lot of people. The interesting thing about the Olive Garden lunch experience is that we have multiple constituents at lunch. We have guests who are looking for convenience, that want to get in and out. We have guests that are looking for a business lunch that want to be in for an hour, hour and fifteen minutes. We have a lot of guests that come to lunch, this is their big day out and they\u2019re looking for a two-hour experience. And so we\u2019re trying to satisfy different constituencies and have offerings for all of them. We have what we believe is the ultimate fast casual lunch at Olive Garden, soup, salad, and breadsticks. It\u2019s the original fast casual offering, 30% of our guests buy that. We believe the key to reenergizing our lunch business is some sort of evolution of this product and this offering. It\u2019s been out there since 1981, it is a great, great product, as you would expect if 30% of the people who are coming in are buying it. But we need to continue to innovate around that product. We\u2019ve done some work with the salad toppers and some other menu items like the trios, and so we\u2019re making progress. We think lunch is really about fast, fresh, and value, and we think we have great food that can deliver on that. It\u2019s going to be price competitive. Lunch is very much about price, and we have to figure out how we create the appropriate value to reenergize lunch. We, on average, do 275 guests a day at lunch. I would put that up against any other casual dining restaurant operator out there. We start from a place of strength, and what we need to do is we need to continue to deliver on the consumer need states for that meal occasion. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Priya Ohri-Gupta: I was hoping you could provide maybe some initial thoughts about how you\u2019re thinking about your credit ratings, particularly with regard to the evaluation of your real estate portfolio and the opportunities that lie there. And specifically, whether, as you create shareholder value, there are also opportunities for that paydown in some capacity? Bradford Richmond : I think fundamental to all this, and we haven\u2019t said it in this call so far, is that we do understand and value the importance of our investment grade credit profile. And so a lot of our actions are geared towards that, and we would include that in the consideration set for any type of real estate opportunities should it come along. I think as we look ahead what we put out as our guidance and expectations for this year, along with the debt paydown that we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve talked about adjusted debt to adjusted capital of being in that 55% to 65% range. We see ourselves near the bottom of that range as we move through the year, so we\u2019re making progress there. And the coverage ratio with this type of earnings performance gets closer to our target and gets below three times. And so we\u2019re making progress there, I think Gene talked about earlier, the success that we have in running the business will help us make further progress here, and then we\u2019ll look at opportunities as they come along for any type of action on the real estate to consider that as well. And then one thing I wanted to follow up on is Joe, you\u2019d asked the question earlier about all the other activity adjustments that we made in the quarter, and what was their impact, and I said it was fairly minor. I actually had a chance to go back and look at those. It\u2019s about $0.01 of the impact on the annual EPS from those in the current year. So it does add a little bit, but maybe less than it seems like on the surface.] Operator : There are no further questions over the phone at this time. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, everybody, for your questions. We\u2019ll look forward to speaking to you soon. And again, appreciate all the questions you\u2019ve asked. Thank you.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode until the question and answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I'll turn the call over to your host, Mr. Rick Cardenas. Thank you, sir, and you may begin. Rick Cardenas - Executive Vice President Operations - LongHorn Steakhouse, Darden Restaurants, Inc.: Thank you, Marcella. Good morning, everyone. With me today is Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Brad Richmond, Darden's CFO. We welcome those of you joining us by telephone or the Internet. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's earnings press release, which was distributed earlier today, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's discussion and presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. A reconciliation of these measurements is in our press release. In addition, we are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call. We will post this presentation under the Investors tab on our website after the conclusion of the call. We plan to release fiscal 2015 fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, June 23, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. Following prepared remarks from Gene and Brad, we will take your questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Gene. Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me say I'm thrilled to have been chosen by the board to be the next CEO of Darden. The board and I've established a terrific relationship, and I'm excited to continue to work with them and the talented team members throughout this great company. This morning, I want to take time to discuss several things with you. First, I will outline the priorities that define our operating philosophy as we move forward. Second, I will provide an update on the early developments for our real estate portfolio and our continuing evolution. And, finally, I will share the details on what drove Olive Garden's solid performance during the third quarter and why we think, even though it's still early, the brand is building strong momentum. Brad will then provide more details on our financial results for the third quarter and an update on our expectations for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 as a whole. My philosophy on running a great restaurant business is rooted in the fact we must have incredible focus and intensity around driving strong operating fundamentals. I like to call this getting back to basics. This means we're focused on culinary innovation and execution inside each of our brands, delivering attentive service to each and every one of our guests, and creating an engaging atmosphere inside our restaurants. These priorities need to be supported by smart and relevant integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guests. By delivering on these operational and brand-building imperatives, we expect to increase our market share and deliver best-in-class profitability through same-store sales growth. Since our last call, we've further defined how the Darden support structure can enable our brands to achieve their ultimate potential. First, we will leverage our scale to drive competitive advantages in our supply chain and G&A support, both of which will improve the value equation for our guests. Next, we'll operationalize and apply the insights collected from our significant guest and transactional databases to enhance relationships with our guests, and identify new opportunities to drive sales growth. And finally, we will embrace the unique cultures and entrepreneurial spirit of our brands, while relentlessly driving for operating efficiencies and continuous improvement, operating with a sense of urgency and inspiring a performance-driven culture. We have made progress, as evidenced by this quarter's results, but our work is far from done. We must continue to improve in each of these areas in order to successfully move from an enterprise-centric organization to a nimble operations-focused restaurant company with benefits of scale and the spirit of a decentralized company. Driving strong operational performance is our top priority. We also have the responsibility to efficiently allocate our capital and utilize our valuable assets to drive shareholder value. To that end, we have been conducting a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of opportunities to create shareholder value with our real estate, while also fortifying our credit metrics. This is an exhaustive analysis and the effort will take some time, and will likely take place in stages. As a test case, a few weeks ago, we listed 16 properties for triple net sale-leaseback. These properties were chosen primarily because they could be sold on a very tax efficient basis. Otherwise, they were representative of Olive Garden and LongHorn locations generally. We saw great demand for the initial 16 properties and subsequently listed an additional 15 properties. To-date, we are extremely pleased with the success we have had securing letters of intent or contracts on the majority of the 31 properties at cap rates well below 6%. These properties will carry market appropriate rents and have favorable lease terms. As we continue to analyze our options for our real estate, it is encouraging to receive positive feedback from the market with qualified buyers who are very interested in purchasing our assets. These results from these transactions will inform other real estate strategies that we're evaluating and may pursue for our broader portfolio. We've also recently listed our corporate headquarters building to explore different structures, including a sale-leaseback, to create value for all our shareholders. We anticipate using the proceeds from these sales to repay debt, which is consistent with our intent to support the company's improving credit profile. We will continue to work with our advisers to carefully assess all ways to unlock value through our real estate portfolio, and look forward to discussing this further with you in the future when we have a more fully developed strategy. Now, let's turn to the results for the quarter. Our brands performed well, and we're pleased to report strength in business performance in the third quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.73 billion, a 6.9% increase from the third quarter last year, with blended same-restaurant sales for the company up 3.6%. Earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, were $0.99 in the quarter, which represents a 39% increase year-over-year. Brand by brand highlights were included in the press release this morning, and I want to spend this time discussing Olive Garden's performance in the third quarter, as well as how some of the operational and business improvements are starting to take hold. During the quarter, Olive Garden increased same-restaurant sales by 2.2%, the second consecutive quarter of positive sales results. This is the first time Olive Garden has had back-to-back quarters of positive same-restaurant sales since 2010. Olive Garden's restaurant level margins increased by 240 basis points versus the same timeframe last year. This significant improvement in profitability was the result of two primary drivers. First, labor. Olive Garden achieved its best direct labor efficiency in over a decade. This was due to actions we took to simplify operations to improve productivity, as well as better sales planning and scheduling by our management teams. Second, marketing. We reduced marketing spend compared to last year when we significantly over-invested to drive traffic. Additionally, we made a deliberate decision to have fewer weeks of price pointed promotions in the quarter. We expected this would have negative impact on same-restaurant guest counts, but would drive higher profitability, which you can see in our third quarter results. While cost of sales was slightly higher than last year, we did see improvement from the second quarter on a percentage of sales basis from improved cost management and moderating dairy inflation. These results are a product of the hard work Dave George and the team at Olive Garden have been doing over the past 18 months to improve every aspect of the business. Continued operational simplification, a focus on cost controls, new menu items, and smarter promotional investments are all pulling together to strengthen brand appeal for the consumers, and significantly improve Olive Garden's results. We are making operational decisions more quickly and have better lines of communication to our restaurant teams due to the reduction of leadership layers in the field, which occurred this past November. The addition of the Cucina Mia menu offering, which has an everyday price point offering point of $9.99 in most restaurants to the core menu in February last year, mitigates the need for constant price pointed promotions. Also, as our guests look for more convenience, Olive Garden is working to meet them wherever they are and provide them the different experiences they want, inside or outside of the restaurant. A strong example of this evolution is our to-go sales, which continues to show strong improvement year-over-year, with sales up 22% this quarter. Increases in large Parties To Go sales, this includes items like pans of lasagna and other large portions, increased our check average because we don't categorize these items into our guest counts. They accounted for 60 basis points of the 220 basis point increase and menu mix this quarter. As we look forward, we will continue to refresh the Olive Garden brand. Our recently remodeled restaurants are performing well, with mid to high single digit same-restaurant sales increases. We will remodel an additional six restaurants over the next several months, with further refined investment levels. We will continue to analyze the performance of our remodeled restaurants to develop a more individualized plan per restaurant and ensure the optimal investment levels going forward. I'm encouraged by the continued progress at Olive Garden and the $23 million increase in EBIT they delivered this quarter versus last year. With more than 800 restaurants and 90,000 team members, we knew that driving change would take time, and the results are starting to show. While we still have more work to do, we firmly believe that our focus on executing the brand renaissance will continue to enhance the guest experience and drive long-term, sustainable same-restaurant sales and profit growth. Now, I'll turn it over to Brad for a detailed margin analysis and expectations for the remainder of the year. C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Gene. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with the margin analysis of the quarter. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of sales this quarter were higher than last year, driven by continued elevated beef inflation. Dairy costs are also higher on a year-over-year basis, but have moderated significantly from the second quarter. The impact of this inflation was partially offset by improvements in food waste. Restaurant labor costs were approximately 50 basis points lower than last year, as a percentage of sales, due to sales leverage and improved hourly labor productivity at Olive Garden, that more than offset wage rate and benefit cost inflation. The overall improvement continued our positive performance from the second quarter. Restaurant expenses as a percentage of sales in the quarter were approximately 80 basis points lower than last year, due to sales leverage, expense management, and lower pre-opening expense of approximately 35 basis points, associated with seven fewer openings in the quarter this year, compared to last year. Excluding the adjustments noted in our press release for both this year and last year, general and administrative expenses were approximately 20 basis points lower as a percentage of sales from the impact of cost reduction initiatives we have undertaken over the past year, and from leveraging our sales growth. Marketing expense, as a percentage of sales, were 100 basis points lower than last year, principally from the lower media support at Olive Garden that Gene mentioned earlier, and improvements in our non-working or the non-media marketing expense we have previously discussed, and from leveraging our sales growth. Our income tax expense for the quarter reflects a 13% rate on continuing operations before adjustments. After the adjustments, our effective tax rate for the quarter increased to 19%. We estimate an annual effective tax rate on a reported basis to be a credit of approximately 7%, and after adjustments, to be an expense of approximately 16%. In summary, our third quarter financial results were better than our previous expectations, producing total EBIT margin that increased 200 basis points above last year on an adjusted basis. With only the fourth quarter remaining in the fiscal year, I will provide some quarterly expectations in addition to our annual expectations. First, we expect fourth quarter same-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden of plus 1.5% to 2.5%, Longhorn Steakhouse of plus 4% to 5%, and our Specialty Restaurants collectively at plus 2.5% to 3.5%. We also anticipate the addition of seven net new restaurants in the fourth quarter for a total of 34 net new restaurants for the full fiscal year. As we think about the strong growth in Q3 margins and our expectations for Q4, we expect to achieve similar year-over-year improvements again in fourth quarter margin growth. However, we do not expect to see the same absolute EBIT margin levels in Q4, due to the normal seasonality that exists, in particular, the strong Christmas, New Year's, Valentine's Day sale weeks drive a higher absolute margin in the third quarter. Said differently, we increased EBIT margins from last year by 200 basis points in Q3, and we expect a similar level of improvement in Q4 versus last year. This margin expansion combined with expected same-restaurant sales growth should deliver fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.91 to $0.94, an increase of 69% to 74% over last year. So as a result, our expectations for adjusted annual earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year is $2.45 to $2.48, an increase of 43% to 45% from fiscal 2014, which reflects the impact of higher share count prior to the accelerated share buyback program implemented in the fiscal year. In addition to our business improvements and the accelerated share buyback, other drivers of EPS growth include reduced interest expense from our debt reduction and the impact of the 53rd week. We're in the midst of a detailed and deliberate planning process and anticipate sharing our outlook for fiscal 2016 during our earnings call in June. As we continue to evaluate our real estate options, we are also evaluating the most appropriate way to deploy the expected proceeds from the real estate transaction that we may undertake, along with the $436 million of cash on our balance sheet today. We are focused on maximizing shareholder value, while also supporting our improving credit profile. We also continue to identify additional cost efficiencies. Since October, we have identified efficiencies that will lead to total annual savings and earnings improvements of $90 million to $100 million when fully implemented. Approximately half of these savings relate to SG&A, and the other half relate to savings in our supply chain and restaurant expenses. Our fiscal 2015 expectations assume we achieve $30 million of savings within this year, and we anticipate $40 to $50 million of additional savings in fiscal 2016. We expect to achieve the full annual savings target in fiscal 2017, plus any additional savings initiatives that we identify. And now, with that, I'll turn it back to Gene for some closing remarks. Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brad. And before we move to Q&A, I want to share a couple of final thoughts. As we disclosed this morning, Brad has agreed to stay on as our CFO through the end of July in order to ensure a smooth transition. I want to thank Brad for his flexibility and his significant contributions during this transition period. We've engaged Chris Kohler Associates (19:08) and the search for a new CFO is well under way. This comprehensive search will include both internal and external candidates. Finally, I want to recognize our team members that were an integral part of our performance this quarter. One of the key cultural shifts I set out to effect over a year ago was for our employees to put the guest first. I see this renewed enthusiasm and cultural shift taking hold, and I'm delighted to see this dramatic change throughout our restaurant teams and here at the support center. I am confident that we can return Darden to being the premiere full-service dining company, and for that, I want to sincerely thank all of our 150,000 plus team members for embracing what makes us special, our ability to impact the special moments and experiences our guests entrust to us. Thank you for your support and for your contribution to our results this quarter. Now let's open the mic for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. One moment for the first question. The first question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays. Jeff Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Just first from a fundamental perspective, and I guess I should start by saying, Gene, congratulations on the full-time promotion. My first question is specific to Olive Garden comps. It seems like there's some momentum building there. Needless to say, it seems like the industry is seeing some momentum as well. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the recent improvement in trend. I think you gave us some color on this last quarter as well, but how you kind of decipher what you think is Olive Garden's specific versus what you think is kind of more macro-driven. It seems like Olive Garden perhaps is still a little bit below the broader industry, but it just seems like a very difficult task to assess how much of it is your own internal decision-making versus the kind of broader macro trend and then I had one follow-up. Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, when I look at the quarter, I think there's a lot of positives in the Olive Garden performance. And I want to go back to what I was talking about in our prepared comments. And last year in this quarter, we over-invested in media and price pointed promotions, aggressively trying to drive traffic, and we came back this year with a much more balanced approach. And we brought our media spending back to the historical levels. We still had some price pointed promotions in the quarter, however, last year at this time, we had two in market the whole time, which drove some guests and some same-restaurant, not sales \u2013 I mean not same-restaurant sales growth, but drove guests. When I think about the quarter now, we underperformed the industry in December and January, but we outperformed the industry in February, and February is a very difficult month from a weather perspective. So I felt as though we built momentum through the quarter with this very balanced approach, where we were able to hang with the marketplace, the industry, but improve our margin structure and get it back to more of a historical norm. So when I think about the quarter, I think there are signs that we're really starting to make some improvement in Olive Garden. Jeff Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then the follow-up. I think, Brad, you did a good kind of recap of the different shareholder value initiatives. I know you're evaluating the real estate and the cost saving opportunity you gave us an update on. There was no mention of the Specialty Restaurant Group which trends seem to be doing quite well across most of the brands. I'm just wondering where we stand in terms of thoughts of spinning off those brands or whether perhaps there is a home for those brands still within the Darden portfolio? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, this is Gene. I'm going to take this question. As you did mention, all five of our brands in the SRG performed very well. We're very pleased with Yard House's performance, best quarter since joining Darden. Right now, our strategic focus is on two fronts. It's running our restaurants better, and second, it's the real estate. As I said last quarter, everything is still on the table. We will come back and analyze other strategic alternatives that are available to us but right now, we're focused on those two initiatives. And I also talked in the call about our Darden philosophy and how do we get back to using scale to be a competitive advantage and allow all our brands to have a advantage in the marketplace because they're part of Darden. And I think that's key to driving long-term shareholder value. Jeff Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll move on to Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Michael A. Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great, thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. As you've been doing your real estate analysis, what have you uncovered about a refranchising opportunity at Olive Garden? Specifically, if you're looking at Olive Garden's owned real estate, can that be accretive to earnings if there was a refranchising of that? Thank you. Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: At this point, we have done no work at all at looking at refranchising. I don't want to go back and keep reiterating the same point, but we're focused on the real estate \u2013 creating value from our real estate asset to this point in time. Once we understand and move forward with that plan, we'll come back and revisit the other strategic alternatives that are available to us. Michael A. Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities, your line is open. Matt J. DiFrisco - Guggenheim Partners : Thank you. Actually, I had a question similar to that as far as the first question by Jeff with respect to the Specialty brand. I'm just curious, advertising-wise, are any of those brands changed in your opinion as far as should we still look at them as a Specialties division independent from Olive Garden and LongHorn as far as not needing advertising support? I think previously it was always sort of the line drawn was the national brands that were casual dining that needed advertising versus the big box brands. In your opinion, as now the longer term, permanent CEO, any of those have the potential maybe to migrate over and be an approachable casual dining national brand more so than a big box guy that only has maybe the potential to do 200 restaurants or so? Specifically, I would think either Yard House or Seasons 52, or are we going to continue to see them in their current brand positioning and size of the format? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Matt, I think for the foreseeable future, we're going to see them as big box, high-volume restaurant operators. I think Yard House has a lot of runway when you look at our current footprint. Longer term, there could be an opportunity to use a smaller box to deliver that brand, similar to what I would call their most liked competitor out there that's working on that today. But I like these businesses because the P&L has less than 1% marketing expense in them, which allows us to really work the value equation from a different angle. And that's really around the food offering and the service we provide; and, to some extent, the atmosphere we create in these bigger boxes. And so, I see them as higher volume executions with the real value in the experience that we deliver in the restaurants, and using a little bit of marketing, but it's more of that CRM one-to-one type marketing versus a national advertising type campaign. Matt J. DiFrisco - Guggenheim Partners : Okay. And then just a follow-up question. You keep bringing us back to focus on the real estate. I'm curious can you give us more color on that as far as what we should expect over the next coming calls? As far as is this going to be updates on how you're approaching it now with 15 sale-leasebacks moving to 30 sale-leasebacks, or are we looking for one significant transaction which was discussed in prior quarters from various investor groups as far as something as a REIT structure and other formats, or are those things off the table and we're looking more so as far as monetization of a store-by-store basis or market-by-market basis? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, Matt. Everything is still on the table at this point in time. We're using these 31 properties that we've put out here really to inform our strategy going forward. What we do think is that this is going to be \u2013 there'll be multiple executions to maximize the value of the real estate. And so, we're not locked into one significant transaction, but we may end up doing one significant transaction. We are doing a very comprehensive review. We have great advisers that are helping us; and we're still evaluating our options very, very carefully. However, we're incredibly encouraged by the reaction in the marketplace for our properties. A well below 6% cap rate is pretty exciting. Matt J. DiFrisco - Guggenheim Partners : Great. Thank you. Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And we're doing that with market rents and favorable lease terms for OpCo. Operator : The next question is from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have two follow-ups, if I may. The first is on the real estate. In the past, I know \u2013 I recognize a lot has changed, but the view was that based on what your advisors had or investment banking advisors had suggested was that a real estate transaction may not be the most value creative in the sense that it was looked at as sort of a more expensive way to add leverage. And I guess my question is why is the analysis different now? Is it just because the cap rates are so much lower than what you had expected or what these advisors had suggested might be the case? And I guess, when I look at cap rates of 6% or even below 6%, it kind of looks similar to what kind of interest rates your debt's (30:24) carrying. So I'm just trying to figure out why the real estate makes so much more sense now than maybe it did before? So that's the first question. The second question is just a little bit diving into the marketing spend. I think Brad said 100 basis points tailwind. In dollar terms, is that down around 20%? Is that right? How would we think about it going forward? Thank you. Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sara, I'll take the real estate question and Brad's looking up the answer for the marketing spend. What's different is that we're just taking a fresh look at this and a comprehensive look with a new set of advisors and looking at the marketplace and seeing what's available to us. We're encouraged at this point in time. We're moving away \u2013 or moving towards more of a asset-light approach to the business, if it makes financial sense; and I think that's how we're thinking about it, and it's what's a little different. These cap rates that we're getting for our properties today are below or better than what we thought we would get when we originally did analysis of this 12 months to 18 months ago. And so, we're just taking a fresh look at what the possibilities are. C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. And on the marketing question, Sara, it's down around 20% or maybe just a tad north of there. I think more importantly, if you look historically over time for the third quarter, which is seasonally (32:06) our best quarter, we're getting back to a typical support level for marketing that we need for that quarter, and we like that. We think for that particular quarter, it's somewhere in \u2013 that's in the sustainable range. We've also talked in the past about some of our initiatives around the non-working or the non-media part of that expense, around the agencies and production cost and things like that. We started that initiative a few months ago. It continues to build. So that's also a part of the driver of that reduced expense. Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And we should continue to see some benefits there going forward as you focus on that? C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. We'd expect to see benefits there, particularly on the non-working part. That will continue, because a lot of those are long-dated contracts. That may take us a full year to realize that. But we will, each quarter, look at the business, the normal seasonality that we have there. Just like as we move to the fourth quarter, we know we have to advertise a little bit more to get the sales in. That's just kind of the cadence of the business. So on a sequential basis, it will move up some, but we're continuing to right-size that as we get into each new quarter. Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And congratulations, Gene. Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : John Glass of Morgan Stanley, your line is open. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks, good morning. I wanted to go back to the cost cuts. And Gene and Brad, you talked about $90 million to $100 million. That is less, though, than half of what your Chairman had originally proposed was probably available to the company. So, is that just the starting point, but you still think $200 million-plus is available to you? Is this more just a \u2013 more sober assessment now that you've had a chance to \u2013 cooler heads have prevailed and you've really looked at the business? How do you frame that versus what was proposed before? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, I would say that we're pleased with the progress we've made to identify these cost saves at $90 million to $100 million, but we're just starting. We think the next level of cost reductions are going to be more entailed around process improvement and changing the way we approach a lot of our work. We haven't really gone back and focused on trying to match up what was said by Starboard, and what we're doing today. We've just taken a fresh look at the business, and we're trying to get costs out. There's been an intense focus on areas that are non-consumer-facing, and that's what \u2013 that's where our focus has been through the last nine months is, how do we take costs out that will not affect the overall experience for the guest. And that's what I'm most pleased with, is that this $100 million is coming out of our business, and the guest will not feel any of it. And so once we \u2013 we will continue to look for additional cost saves, additional process improvement, and try to drive this number as high as we possibly can. It gets back to the Darden support philosophy : Scale is going to drive a competitive advantage for our brands. And how do we use that scale effectively every day to give our brand an advantage in the marketplace. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And if I could just follow up, a big piece of that was looking at advertising. I know Olive Garden's advertising is down, but I think it's now still at historical levels, which run well above industry levels. Maybe you could just clarify what those levels are. I think it's like in the 5% range, maybe versus industry norms of 3% to 4%. Is that something that's an opportunity or do you look at that and say that's really part of what the brand is and it's what got us here and we can't \u2013 that's not an opportunity? C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. This is Brad here, John. And we have lots of history here, and two things that we need to look at is, what is the level of media support that we need to effectively communicate our message. And the other part of that is the non-working piece. We believe, and we've talked about in the past, there's significant opportunity in the non-working piece of that. If you look at our total marketing expense, it's gone to that non-working being over 20%, we think the mid teens is a better place to be. That's spending at the right level. And then, as Gene talked about earlier, the media. What message are we supporting? Or in some cases, as we've done, we supported multiple messages. I think we've gone through that. We know we should be focusing on one primary message at the right level there. So that will continue to evolve, but it probably puts marketing in a low 4% range. And when you look at Olive Garden's particular model and the high AUVs that it drives, part of that is what the marketing does for that brand. And given their cost structure, it's well worth it to make those investments in marketing to improve the absolute dollars that they're generating in that business. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good, thank you. Operator : David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird, you may ask your question. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning. Gene, I wanted to come back to the strategy on Olive Garden, with respect to pulling back on the marketing, I know this has been covered in several questions. But I'm just curious to know your thoughts on the overall traffic decline that you saw in the quarter, and how much of that do you think was related to the decision to pull back on marketing? And is that going to be a theme as you move through the next several quarters, negative same-store traffic, or are you hoping to sort of turn the tide on traffic trends in the coming quarters and get back into positive territory? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Dave, I think there's going to be pressure on traffic for the next six months, as we were aggressively trying to grow traffic last year, and doing it in a way that wasn't good for the overall business. I'm pleased with the trend against the industry throughout the quarter, we're basically on the industry for traffic standpoint in February. The other thing, when you look at our traffic numbers, is you have to remember all this large party takeout food that we're selling, it's 60 basis points effect on the traffic number, because we're not counting those as entrees at all, so it's not in our traffic number and I expect that to continue to grow. I mean that's a part of the business we're putting a lot of pressure on but we're not giving ourselves any guest counts for that. And the reasons for that is it really would \u2013 the way we do our labor planning and the success that we're having with that right now, we think that changing the way we calculate our guest counts could have a negative impact in the short term on our execution. But back to your question, we know we've got to change the momentum in guest traffic as we move forward, but we're not going to do it at all costs. We have a wonderful P&L at Olive Garden, a wonderful business model and we need to keep it more in balance. And the one thing that we're seeing from the consumer today is we are seeing the consumer's willingness to buy less on deal and actually for the first time in a very long time, we're seeing alcoholic beverage sales growth, we are seeing add-on sales growth, we are seeing more dessert sales. All these dynamics are coming together at once, and is really helping the Olive Garden business model. So I'm putting a lot of pressure on the operating team and the marketing team to grow guest counts, but at the same time, we're going to focus on growing guest counts the right way. We're not going to over-invest like we did last year, as we move back to a much more balanced approach with historical media spends. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. That makes sense. And then one clarification on the real estate sales. I think you said that you're going to use some of the proceeds or all of the proceeds to pay down debt. And I guess maybe I'm missing something here, but it seems like even at a cap rate under 6%, a lot of your debt is actually at an interest rate below that. So how does it create value for shareholders to do the sale-leaseback and then to pay down the debt with that proceeds? C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : David, I think our plan is, first and foremost, is to improve our credit metrics to ensure that we maintain investment-grade credit profile. We will then use the proceeds and cash from operations to ensure we set up our balance sheet appropriately. We want to keep the capital structure in balance and over time, that should lift shareholder value. We see this as a bigger than just a treasury function. We see this is really moving to a more asset-light approach and setting up our capital structure in a way that we can get the greatest return for our shareholder. One thing that I want to keep coming back to is that these properties we're selling, we're selling them at market rents with strong lease terms for OpCo, so we think this is \u2013 again, we're using this just to inform us on a broader real estate strategy. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Will Slabaugh of Stephens, you may ask your question. Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, guys. Just a couple quick follow-ups. On the first one, could you quantify what you think the estimate for the weather impact was in January and February? C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, for the entire quarter for our large brands, it's approximately 100 basis points. And on a month by month basis, December was impacted by about 210 basis points, January was adversely impacted by 110 basis points. In February, it actually reversed on a year-over-year basis, and there was 30 basis points hurting us this year. So, just to repeat that, we were benefited by 210 basis points in December, 110 basis points in January but adversely affected by 30 points in February and the total adds up to about 100 basis points. Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Thank you for that detail. One more quick follow-up, Gene, to a question \u2013 or to a comment, rather, you made a minute ago. It sounds like you believe we're actually seeing an inflection in the health of the consumer here. Do you think that's the case? And is that going to change more materially how you market to them going forward? And do you think that's really going to be an inflection in profitability at your brand here? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, that's the point I was trying to make is that we are seeing a little bit healthier of a consumer. We're not seeing a direct impact on traffic, as you think back to discretionary income increasing, but we are seeing for the first time through Crest Data, through our own data, the guest is buying less on deal, and that's allowing us to grow our check average, and improve our overall profitability. We've been in this space for a long time. We've been trying to create value through deals for consumers to entice them to come see us and dine with us. I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing through what the consumer is purchasing on their visit. Some of it is that we're doing a better job giving them what they want through Bold Bites in LongHorn, some of the to-go activity in Olive Garden, we're doing a better job in Olive Garden with our wine tasting program. So I think it's a combination of better execution from our operational teams, but also the consumer today seems to be under a little less pressure and is willing to pay a little bit more for their product. And we're seeing it with our price pointed promotions. Our preference is down on our price pointed promotions compared to where they were even a year ago or two years ago. So people are buying less on deal. Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Joseph Buckley, Bank of America, your line is open, sir. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. I had a couple of clarification questions. Brad, I think when you were discussing SG&A, I think you were saying it was actually down 20 basis points year-over-year if you exclude adjustments, and I just wanted to verify that and find out what adjustments were in SG&A. C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. The G&A portion only was what I was talking about, that's 20 points better, and 100 basis points for the marketing, so that's what you should see on the slides. And I think -- and you asked what were the adjustments. Let me go to the press release there. They were around \u2013 for the quarter, we had some strategic action costs principally related to the real estate assistance that we're having there, and also as a part of our real estate move, we had some excess land that we impaired the value of those. And you can see those detailed further in the press release. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So some of the real estate \u2013 I think the impairment is a separate line, if I'm not mistaken, right? C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So if you still want to say, expiration work, some of that's in the G&A? C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. And that was approximately $0.01 for the quarter. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Okay. Just on the tax rate. You gave us tax rates for continuing operations of what you're expecting. Could you remind us why it's so low and what happens next year or the next couple of years on that tax rate? And are your existing REITs a big part of that lower tax rate? C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, first off, to this year and the tax rate that we expect, and we have been detailing those both on a GAAP reported basis and on a performance adjusted basis. And on the performance piece, I think, is really where you're going that we're looking at 16%. That is a little bit lower than where we see the tax rate. So at more normalized EBT levels, that's probably in the 20% to 25% range is where we would see. And I know over the years we've tried to communicate the advantages that our business model has, being all company-owned; and our scale gives us a lot of opportunities for tax planning, programs that we can implement, systems that we can build to make sure we capture those credits that makes it easier, non-intrusive to the operators. And so, things around food donation, things about employment credits. That being an all company-owned model, those all accrue to us. So when I do our work here doing long-term planning, I'm putting that, depending on the EBIT level, between a 20% and 25% effective tax rate. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just one more, if I could, for Gene. And, Gene, congratulations on getting the CEO position with the interim removed. You mentioned scale a couple of times in answers to different questions. Is that coloring the thinking around Specialty Restaurants? I mean that was always kind of the pro and con argument, was how much the profitability of the Specialty Restaurants was sort of feeding off the Darden G&A. So is doing something with the Specialty Restaurants less likely as maybe the new board understands the scale benefits? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I think, again, everything is still on the table and will be carefully evaluated. As we continue to move forward, we're going to have to look at the scale advantage that these restaurants in the Specialty brands do get from Darden. We have to look at the synergies that are created. We also have to look at the growth that the Specialty brands create for the overall Darden business. But, as I said, we are going to focus our strategic energies around capturing the value that's available to us in the real estate. And we will come back and fully analyze what is best for our shareholders, as it relates to what the brand portfolio mix is going forward. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Jason West of Credit Suisse, you may ask your question. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, thanks. I was wondering if you guys would be willing to share the proceeds that you got from the sale-leaseback that you did. And were those units, the 16 properties and then the other 15 properties, were those all fully-owned properties where you own the land or was there a mix of land lease \u2013 yeah, land lease and building owned (51:17) properties? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Those were all fully-owned properties, and we have not received any proceeds. We've got these under contract, but we have not closed on any of them yet. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, and would you expect any significant tax payments as part of these types of deals, or would they be pretty tax-free? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. These deals were all done in a very tax efficient way. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. And then just on the outlook on cash flow, you guys are sitting on a lot of cash on the balance sheet. Can you talk a little bit about what the plan is there, what the long-term run rate you need on the cash balance? And then, any early color on CapEx for next year would be really helpful. I know you're evaluating some Olive Garden remodels. I'm guessing that unit growth will be similar, if you could talk about that, would be helpful. C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : This is Brad. And what I would say is we think it's very important to get all this right. And so, we want to get further into our work on the real estate process, so we know the size and the form of what that activity may be before we look at deploying the $430-million odd that we have on our balance sheet. But what we are focused on is continuing to improve our credit profile; also, looking at all the options that we have around the real estate; and to utilize this cash to improve our shareholder value creation. And so, I think \u2013 I should just step back for a moment and just talk about the power generation of our business model continues to be strong. You can see with same-restaurant sales growth, growing the top line, the improvements that we have made in our margin, the model generates a lot of cash. And so, we need to get further in the real estate process, but the key focus is to continue to improve our credit profile and increase shareholder value. And we'll talk more about how we'll do that in June. I think part of your question was indications on CapEx for next year. It's really too early to say on that, but you have seen us over time moderating the CapEx for new restaurants and all that. That will continue to moderate some. But beyond that, we're still working through, as you mentioned, remodels. Might there be other opportunities that'd be very appropriate for us to pursue, we're leaving all those options on the table at this point. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then, just one quick follow-up, the cost savings, the $90 million to $100 million. Does that contemplate some significant divestitures of real estate and savings that would go along with that or if you guys end up to selling a lot of properties under leasebacks, would you have a lot of G&A and D&A savings that may go with those sales? C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. So the numbers I gave earlier are on a status quo basis, if you will. And so, those are, as we own and operate the business today, the actions that we're looking at, like you said in real estate, those will be all comprehensive. So we would look at the value they're going to create, which, like you said, if it's moving some of that out, there should be other reductions in the dollars we spend to support those activities. But those aren't encompassed in our savings. These are, I like to say, status quo, as we're operating the business today. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you. Operator : Howard Penney, Hedgeye Risk Management. You may ask your question. Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC : Thanks very much for taking my question. First, I just want to say it's a breath of fresh air to hear this company being managed very differently than it's been managed in the past, and a year makes a big difference. You were just actually asked about unit growth, and I was wondering if you could comment on unit growth; and was wondering if, I think, it was \u2013 34 would be \u2013 is that right \u2013 34 would be the high watermark for your tenure, Gene, in terms of unit growth, or whether you think you'll accelerate that or decelerate that? I'm just kind of curious in terms of your capital allocation. One of the things that I think was done in the past inappropriately was an aggressive \u2013 or unit openings were too high. And then, secondly, just on the shareholder value creation piece and the real estate. Two questions; one, if we look to the Starboard presentation as to what the value of the Olive Garden real estate, is that a good proxy for that? And then, secondly, I think you've been asked a couple times about effectively whether selling $500 million of real estate would be accretive or dilutive to earnings, and the math sort of suggests that it's dilutive, which actually is okay if it is dilutive because it's a part of a broader strategy to create shareholder value. So maybe if you could just confirm that? And then, lastly, when you speak again in terms of the next fiscal year, will you provide longer term targets for where you think this organization, this enterprise, can grow sales and earnings, and maybe where the margins can get to? Thanks very much. Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Good questions, Howard. Let me start with new unit growth. I think as we look to 2016, I would expect to see a few less units in 2016 than we built in 2015. Longer term, it's too early for me to comment on what do we see for unit growth long-term. I think we have to do the work on what's the appropriate brand portfolio, what kind of growth vehicles are in the portfolio, how our businesses are performing. We're going to be very diligent on return on invested capital and our approach to building new restaurants. If we have a portfolio of restaurants that can return well above our cost of capital, and we believe we're in good consumer segments, then we're going to build restaurants. But first and foremost, we're going to ensure that we're returning the right return on investment. As far as the value of the real estate and is the Starboard a proxy for that, my thought on that is that we're still evaluating carefully, and thoughtfully, and methodically what's available to us in the value creation that we have available to us. I would \u2013 I suggest that you wait to we come out with our plan, and hopefully, we will be able to get that done within the next quarter or two quarters. And at that point in time, we will define what value we expect to receive from the real estate, and whether that's one transaction, multiple transactions, is it a real estate plan over time. Let us come to you with our plan and that will inform what the ultimate value of the real estate is. As far as when we give guidance for 2016 in June, will we be in a position to give more of a longer term outlook for the organization. The short answer to that is, I'm not sure that we're going to be in a position at that time to have totally figured out directionally where we're going with all the strategic initiatives that are there in front of us. When that gets into brand portfolio, that gets in is there some franchising, is there some refranchising, how's international going to play in that. And so I think June is going to be a little bit early to really define a long-term outlook. However, I do believe that we'll be able to give you a glimpse into, directionally, where we think we're going at that time. Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC : Okay. Thank you. I was going to \u2013 that's fine. Thanks very much. Operator : Keith Siegner of UBS, your line is open. Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Just one quick one for me. There's been a lot of talk about maintaining the investment grade credit rating, and I just wanted to follow up a little bit on why so much attention here. We've got pretty low absolute levels of debt compared to a lot of other restaurants in this industry, got strong top line momentum, you've got significant cost saves plan, cash flow from ops should be improving improved nicely. I'm curious as to why the cash or maybe even some of the proceeds from sale-leasebacks would get put into debt. Won't you maintain or even improve your credit ratings just from that core improvement in the business? Help me understand why so much attention on the investment grade credit rating. C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Keith, Brad here. You're bringing in all the things that we're thinking about. We have a few others, but we do believe \u2013 I believe for some time and continue to believe, even with the extensive discussion about Darden and where we want to be and the things we think we can accomplish, that an investment grade credit profile, as we look at it today, is one of those key elements. To your point, improving base business helps the credit profile a lot, and so we continue to look at that. As we talk about the work we're doing in the real estate process, we want to make sure that as we do that, that it's consistent with that goal that we have. And so the real estate actions that we're talking about are not just for the credit profile. It's one of the requirements that we have on ourself, but we want to, as a part of that, ensure that our credit profile is moving in the direction that we think it should be. We have seen over time that the advantages that come with that, the access to capital at lower cost, is a competitive advantage for us, and we want to retain that with where we see ourself today. Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Question is from David Palmer of RBC. David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Congrats, Gene. Wanted to revisit Olive Garden. Aside from the economic factors, are there trends that are perhaps less obvious to us that are \u2013 and of course we're looking at traffic numbers \u2013 that speak to the brand health at Olive Garden, which presumably is making you more bullish as you look forward? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, David. A couple things that aren't visible. We think that one of the biggest moves that we've made to improve the operations at Olive Garden is to align our organizational structure with less layers. We are communicating, Dave and his team are much closer to the front line today. Communication has improved dramatically. We are seeing instantaneous movement in the focus areas of the operations teams. And that, to me, is one positive sign. The fact that we have this $9.99 price point on the menu every day, that defines everyday value, that was missing in Olive Garden. And we're seeing a clientele develop in that menu category that we actually weren't anticipating. And the customization of that product is something that the Millennials are really attracted to, and so we think that's a platform that we can continue to beef up. To-go is an exciting piece of the business, and I'm really excited about to-go, and we have got a product and a platform in Olive Garden that is meeting a huge need for the consumer, which is convenience. We've gone from this approach where we're trying to drive people into our restaurants and people today are less likely to, over time, want to come every single day to the restaurant, but they want to use your product. And we've been able to meet the consumer with this to-go program where the consumer wants to be met. And we originally thought this was, we could move takeout from 8% of sales to maybe 12% of sales. We're starting to think that this is a huge opportunity. And 20% of our sales could come from takeout in the future in Olive Garden. And the satisfaction level of the consumer that's using this product is really, really, really high. We are over delivering on takeout, and some of that is just that our product travels so well. But the last thing that I'd bring you back to is that Olive Garden will serve more guests this year than we've ever served in the history of the brand. And So some of that is coming from our new restaurant development over the years, but we continue to gain market share in all of casual dining and for me, that tells me the relevance of this brand. And the last thing I would leave you with on Olive Garden is, we are over-indexing with Millennials, and Millennials are really attracted to this brand, and we need to find ways to allow them to use the Olive Garden brand the way they see fit. David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Priya Ohri-Gupta, your line is open. Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. First off, congratulations, Gene, and thank you so much for all the comments on supporting the IG rating. Brad, I was hoping that we could dig in just a little bit into your comment around using some of the proceeds from your real estate transactions to pay down debt. It looks like your balance sheet doesn't show much in the way of short-term borrowing, so you would likely need to have to go after some of your long-term debt. Is that a fair assessment? And should we expect that sort of over the next quarter or two quarters? Thanks. C. Bradford Richmond - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think \u2013 when I look at the real estate and where we are in the process, it's hard to be definitive as to exactly what's going to come out of that. And so I'm trying to be cautious to talk about the investment-grade credit profile, which is high on our list of things that we want to accomplish. And we haven't really talked about the size of what the real estate deal will be. We'll do it to the point where it makes sense, and there's different forms that it could take. And so as we have more clarity with that information, I can probably answer your question a lot better other than knowing the priorities that we have in terms of increasing value to our shareholders and improving our credit metrics, as we do all this work, those are two of our guiding principles. Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Paul Westra of Stifel, you may ask your question. Paul L. Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks and good morning. Just a follow-up question on your menu pricing strategy going forward and how that might compare to your best guess of the commodity basket and labor inflation as you look out next fiscal year. And specifically, I was wondering if you could give some guidance again on whether we should be expecting about a 2% or so menu pricing going forward, how you maybe arrived at that, which does appear to be below the industry's number which is closer to 3%. Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Paul. We're planning on trying to price Olive Garden slightly below the industry and to continue to grow our value leadership position. We'll give more guidance or more expectations in our June call on what the commodity basket will look like next year. However, I will say for Olive Garden, we will obviously have less pressure in dairy, which had a big impact on the P&L throughout the majority of the year, but our expectation for next year and into the future is to price Olive Garden slightly below the industry in order to regain and continue to be the value leader in casual dining. Paul L. Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And it sounds like you are doing less discounting year-over-year. As you do the calculation, would that year-over-year less discounting, would that be captured completely in menu-mix number or on the pricing that you just bought? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. When you look at our press release, we break that out. So you look at February, for example, we had 1.8% in pricing, and 2.8% in menu-mix, with 0.6% of that menu mix just being attributed to the bulk takeout orders that we're selling. Paul L. Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. But philosophically, would \u2013 maybe end the question with, would you expect your ability to price and compare that to your underlying, I guess, food and labor, I mean, we shouldn't expect a big deviation between those two numbers? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I think there's going to be balance. I think we're going to continue to look at what we can do from a cost save standpoint, what we can do from an efficiency standpoint. Long term, when Olive Garden is at its best, it is the clear-cut value leader in all of casual dining. We lost that position over time over the last few years as we took more price than we should have been taking. And now, we are very conscious of maintaining that value leadership, and we will continue to look for other ways, other than just pricing, to offset inflation. Paul L. Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Steve Anderson, Miller Tabak, your line is open. Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. As we look at your takeout strategy, and by the way, it's very impressive given the strength of the 20% (01:10:26) plus gain there. But, are you concerned about the margins? Particularly given that the takeout sales traditionally have delivered lower margins, so that you don't really see the beverage or alcohol sales. What are your thoughts on that? Do you think it's more important that you get the actual absolute value on the top line gain? Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: When I look at the margins on the takeout business, especially as we move people to the bulk ordering, the margins are actually better. Because when you're doing bulk ordering, you're having less packaging. It's actually much easier to prepare, if we're just selling you a big sheet of lasagna and a big bowl of salad. And so we think the margins on that part of the business are better. As we start to work more towards catering, we think we will have good margins in that. The check average on the online ordering is up 30%, vis-\u00e0-vis someone calling over the telephone or ordering in line. So we believe that our margins are protected at this point on to-go. They're not enhanced, obviously, because you lose the alcoholic beverage, so on and so forth. But we do have teams working on, how do we create a more comprehensive to-go experience. And can we \u2013 are we able to sell some beverages along with that experience, how else can we enhance that to ensure that we maybe actually increase. This is a different guest occasion, and we've got a team that's working on it and thinking about it differently than how we run our in store operations. This is a huge opportunity. It is a need state that the consumer needs to be filled, and Olive Garden is meeting the consumer where they want to be. And we can do that because of the product that we serve Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : And at this time, we have no one else in the queue. Eugene I. Lee - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, so thank you all for your attention and great questions. I want to remind you that we expect to release our fourth quarter results on Tuesday, June 23, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. We look forward to speaking with all of you again, and have a great weekend. Operator : This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Following prepared remarks from Gene and Brad, we will take your questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter across all of our brands. Total sales grew 13.8% for the quarter, which was driven by combined same-restaurant sales growth of 3.8%, with positive same-restaurant sales at each of our brands, the addition of 33 net new restaurants, and the 53rd week of operations, which contributed 7.5% of sales growth to the quarter. Earnings per share on an adjusted basis increased 100% to $1.08, and fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margins increased significantly. Our fourth quarter capped a strong finish to 2015. For the year, annual sales from continuing operations increased by 7.6% to 6.8 billion, and all of our brands had positive same-restaurant sales for the year. Adjusted EBIT margins increased by 150 basis points through continued cost management, same-restaurant sales growth leveraging, and the unwinding of deep discounting at Olive Garden. As a result, our annual earnings per share on an adjusted basis were $2.63 a share, which was an increase of 54% versus last year. At Olive Garden, business momentum continued with 10 consecutive months of same-restaurant sales growth. The brand had sequential quarterly same-restaurant sales improvement throughout the year, and had its first annual same-restaurant sales increase since fiscal 2011. Our Olive Garden strategy has been to focus on our core guests and the frequency of their visits by concentrating on the following areas : First, ongoing service and culinary simplifications that allow our restaurant teams to deliver great food and service. Second, continued menu evolution that focuses on our core brand equities; the improving appeal of Cucina Mia provides a great everyday value option for our guests, thereby allowing us to be more balanced with our promotional offerings. Next, with a refined understanding of our core guest demographics, we have increased our digital marketing efforts. This enables us to reach guests with more relevant messaging through targeted online advertising, CRM, and social media engagement. And our takeout program meets our guests' growing needs for convenience, and continues to drive significant growth. We increased takeout sales by over 23% versus last year in the fourth quarter to approximately 10% of sales. Finally, better operations, leadership alignment on key priorities as a result of reduced management layers in the field has led to elevated execution. This was an important year for Olive Garden, and we're pleased with the progress we've made. The improvement in our results this year tells us we're working on the right things, and it underscores Olive Garden's tremendous brand equity and potential. With that said, our work at Olive Garden is still in its early stages, and we still see plenty of opportunity ahead. LongHorn had a solid year of performance with annual same-restaurant sales of 4.4% and positive guest counts of 0.08, both of which significantly outpaced the industry. Segment profits at LongHorn increased by 17% despite near double-digit beef inflation for the year. This performance is the result of several factors, including growing the business by focusing on guest loyalty, leveraging the core menu, and the Peak Season and Chef's Showcase platforms to offer regional flavors, and evolving our marketing strategy with more effective local execution, broader use of CRM and digital advertising, and a stronger promotional pipeline that leveraged our steak expertise. As we enter fiscal 2016, LongHorn is well positioned to improve on its same-restaurant sales growth and continue to improve margins. Now, let's spend a few minutes discussing the real estate announcement we made this morning. The Board and I are excited about our announcement to separate a significant portion of our real estate and create a separate real estate business, which can grow in its own right. This decision was the result of a comprehensive analysis that we performed along with the support of our advisors. The plan is intended to optimize the value of our real estate by separating approximately 500 of our real estate properties utilizing three different steps; first, the sale leaseback of approximately 75 restaurant properties, second, the sale leaseback of our restaurant support center in Orlando, and third, a REIT separation. After receipt of the proceeds, we intend to pay down $1 billion of debt. We expect this will maintain our investment grade credit profile. We believe this plan results in a favorable outcome for all of Darden stakeholders by strengthening our balance sheet, while positioning two companies to succeed in the future. The strategic rationale for our real estate separation creates benefits for both Darden and the future REIT. The benefits to Darden include an improved capital structure with no funded debt maturities for 20 years, improved capital allocation that strengthens our return on invested capital, and a strong conservative financial position that offers solid coverage for market rents. The benefits to the REIT are a lower cost of capital in Darden, and the ability to focus on growing a real estate business through broader opportunities beyond Darden. And finally, we expect the market to properly reflect the fair market value of real estate through the higher valuations from real estate companies compared to restaurant-operating companies. Now, looking at the three elements of our intended plan; we began conducting individual restaurant sale leasebacks in March of 2015 with 16 properties, and have expanded this to a total of approximately 75 properties, consisting mostly of Olive Gardens. We continue to be extremely pleased with the demand for our properties. We expect an average cash capitalization rate of approximately 5.5% for all 75 properties, and that EBITDAR will provide greater than three times the rent coverage. We anticipate a net book gain of approximately $50 million on the total 75 properties, with a $65 million gain being recognized over the next 15 years, and a loss of approximately $50 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Next, we're pursuing the sale leaseback of the restaurant support center in Orlando. And finally, the proposed REIT transaction would consist of approximately 430 high quality own property selected for their ability to comfortably cover market rents. The tenant base for the REIT will standout versus other REIT peers, and that is a 100% investment grade with an initial concentration of Olive Garden properties, and the REIT will be in a position to diversify to efficient 1031 asset exchanges. We have proven that our Olive Garden properties are in high demand, and the REIT management can utilize some of these highly desired Olive Garden properties to exchange for other diversifying assets. Additionally, we are capitalizing the REIT to provide capacity to support growth through acquisitions on day one. We anticipate this REIT will be attractively positioned immediately, and in the near future be able to further shape its metrics to be best-in-class. As previously noted, after receipt of the proceeds, we intend to retire $1 billion of debt. This debt retirement will be sourced by the sale leaseback proceeds, a REIT distribution back to Darden at the separation funded by debt raised at the REIT, and cash on our balance sheet. Retiring debt allows us to strengthen our balance sheet, while almost entirely working through the existing sale leaseback basket. We will be seeking bondholder consent to expand our current sale leaseback covenant limitation in the most straightforward manner. We fully expect bondholders to appreciate that we're choosing to seek their consent, but we may also consider other structuring alternatives. We expect the execution of our real estate strategy to be viewed as credit neutral to positive. We anticipate Darden's annualized cash rent to increase by approximately $120 million per year, and GAAP rent expense net of gain amortization of approximately 135 million, due to rent averaging accounting requirements. Depreciation will be reduced by approximately 40 million, and we will save approximately $45 million in interest due to debt retirement. This implies a run rate reduction in pretax earnings of approximately $50 million. We anticipate the combined dividends of both companies to be equal to Darden's current dividend. Looking at our timeline, we filed our private letter ruling request with the IRS on April 17. As many of you may know, last month the IRS announced a pause in issuing private letter rulings on the active trade or business in transactions like we're discussing today. However, our private letter ruling request is grandfathered until further notice from the IRS, since it was filed in April. We have been watching developments closely, and recognize that the IRS is reviewing its ruling practice in this area. Nonetheless, we have a significant corporate business reason for the selection of our active trade or business, which we believe meets all applicable laws. Other highlights in our timeline include finalizing the individual restaurant sale leaseback transactions, and the sale leaseback of the restaurant support center. Between now and the end of December 2015, we expect to identify and appoint the REIT management team in Board, file the Form 10 with the SEC, and complete the REIT financing and Darden debt retirement. Once again, we're excited about this next step in the evolution of Darden. Our fundamental restaurant operations and the guest experience will remain the same, but we will be separating a new real estate company, which will be able be independently grow with properties outside of Darden. And now Brad will share our financial update and outlook for fiscal 2016. Brad Richmond : Well, thank you, Gene, and good morning everybody. Fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margins expanded versus the prior year at an ever great amount than in the third quarter. This acceleration was the result of reduced discounting at Olive Garden, a more normalized commodity cost environment, greater costs savings, leveraging our positive same-restaurant sales, and the contribution of the 53rd week. Additionally, 50 basis points of the restaurant expense improvement this quarter versus last year related to improved workers' compensation and public safety performance achieved during the year. This quarter, we began reporting marketing and G&A expenses individually. Marketing as a percent of sales was below last year due to lower but more normalized marketing support levels. G&A as a percentage of sales increased due to three drivers; higher incentive costs related to the strong business performance, higher equity-based incentive costs that are hedged and fully offset in our tax expense, and investor costs related to the cost reduction efforts that are more than offset by the identified cost savings captured in our performance. Sales for the 53rd week were higher than we previously anticipated. Along with our improved margins and low tax rate, the 53rd week resulted in $0.07 of additional EPS in the quarter. I want to direct your attention to segment level reporting we introduced this quarter, which provides additional transparency into our results. The four segments are Olive Garden, LongHorn, Fine Dining, which includes The Capital Grille and Eddie V's, and our other businesses which includes Yard House, Season 52, Bahama Breeze, Consumer Packaged Goods, and franchise revenues. The segment profit reflects sales less costs related to food and beverage, restaurant labor, restaurant expenses, and marketing expenses. It's worth noting this quarter's profit improved significantly for each operating segment. Now, the outlook we are sharing for fiscal 2016 today is based on our restaurant operating results, and does not include the impact of the real estate transactions that Gene outlined, and any related cash and capital structure activities we undertake. We will provide additional information on those financial impacts once the timing and specific details of the proposed transactions are final. For 2016, we anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.05 to $3.20, that's growth of 20% to 25% on a 52-week basis. Improving operations performance is expected to contribute $0.45 to $0.60 of EPS growth in fiscal 2016. In addition, we have interest rate savings of $0.04 in the first quarter from last year's debt retirement of $1 billion. So, of the total, $0.49 to $0.64 of annual year-over-year EPS growth in fiscal 2016, we anticipate two-thirds of the growth in the first half of year, and the remainder in the second half. The front [ph] weighted growth is related to the timing of the reduced interest expense, costs savings, lapping on fiscal 2015 performance, and the benefit of the accelerated share repurchase in fiscal 2015. Our other expectations for 2016 include 18 to 22 new restaurant openings, with LongHorn and Yard House accounting for the majority of the openings. We expect same-restaurant sales increase for the company between 2% and 2.5%, Olive Garden growth between 1.5% and 2.5%, an increase between 2.5% and 3.5% for LongHorn, and combined growth of approximately 3% for the specialty restaurant brands. Same-restaurant sales will be reported on a 52-week basis, and will include several significant holiday shifts, in particular a Thanksgiving shift that will be moving into Q2 this fiscal year, compared to Q3 last fiscal year. Capital spending between 230 and 255 million with approximately 40% of that going to maintenance CapEx, approximately 30% for new restaurant spending, and the remainder going to refresh restaurants, technology, and other initiatives. We expect an annual effective tax rate between 21% and 24%. We anticipate fiscal 2016 to be a more normalized inflation environment, resulting in overall inflation of 1.5% to 2%, with commodity inflation of 0.50% to 1%, and we expect the price at the low end of the overall inflation range. Total annualized cost savings identified since October of fiscal 2015 have increased to $100 million to $110 million by fiscal 2017. That's $10 million higher than we announced in the third quarter. We realized 35 million of that savings in fiscal 2015. We expect 50 to 55 million in 2016, and the remainder in 2017. All of these savings expectations are net of any necessary reinvestments. We continue to evaluate all areas of our business to identify additional cost savings without impacting the guest experience. And now, I'll turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks. Gene Lee : Thanks, Brad. Before we move to Q&A, I want to share a couple of final thoughts. Fiscal 2015 was a year of meaningful transition at Darden with the election of a new Board of Directors, as well as my appointment to CEO. We have made substantial progress towards our goal of returning Darden to a level of profitable sales growth and value creation our stakeholders expect. An integral factor in this progress is the strong working relationship between the Board and the Management team. This allows for a very open and constructive dialog, and has resulted in alignment around the key priorities that are driving our improved results. Our back-to-basics focus, which is rooted in strong operating fundamentals around food service and atmosphere is a key reason for our proved guest experience and business performance. Of course, this is brought to life everyday by our 150,000 team members. As I visit restaurants across the country with our leadership teams, I clearly see their enthusiasm for creating the best experiences possible for our guests. On behalf of the Board and the leadership team I want to sincerely thank each and every team member for their hard work and dedication. Lastly, I would like to thank Brad Richmond for his contributions during his 32 years of service, from financial analyst to Chief Financial Officer, he has impacted all of our brands, and more importantly, he has had a positive impact on every one he's had the opportunity to associate with. All of us at Darden wish him the very best as he enters the next chapter of his journey at the end of July. Now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : All right. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] All right. Our first question comes from Mr. Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Brett Levy : Good morning. Thank you. First of all, just a couple of little technical questions; do you have any sense as to what the square footage is for both the owned and the leased? Gene Lee : We'll need you to repeat that. We couldn't hear you, Brett. Brett Levy : Oh, I'm sorry. I asked if you had any square footage owned and leased right now. Gene Lee : Do you want square footage, or do you want just number of restaurants? Brett Levy : No, just the square footage, I think we have the number of units. Gene Lee : No, we don't have the square footage. We can get back to you on that. Brett Levy : Do you have any sense as to what we can expect in terms of market rents and rent escalations on the leases? Bill White : Yes, Brett, this is Bill White. We are expecting rent escalations in the 1% to 2% range, and market rents will be at the -- we would say certainly in the market range, but at the more affordable level, but there will be a range there as well depending on the individual markets. Brett Levy : Right. Do you have an actual number that we can target for the rent, either per box or per foot? Bill White : On a square food basis, I would say in the $25 to $30 range. Brett Levy : And can you give a little bit more clarity on breaking down where the drivers were in terms of Olive Garden profits and what the actual profit growth was? Brad Richmond : Yes, Brett, this is Brad. And we've aided that question some with providing the segment information that we gave there. So you can see in the broad picture, but as we talked about for Olive Garden, the less discounting was obviously significant portion to them improving their profitability, along with their same-restaurant sales came some fairly meaningful leveraging of their restaurant expenses. Their improvement in workers' comp public liability was strong as well, and particularly food cost getting more back to normalized level, in the first half of the year we talked about dairy being up nearly 20% to the prior year. And so that has much more normalized for them as well. Brett Levy : And where are you on your contract right now for next year? Brad Richmond : One second here. So really for us we look out six months and we've got over 60% of our usage contracted, the back half of the year -- which the 60% is pretty typical where we are at this time of year, and we have about 20% contracted for the back half of our fiscal year. Angelina, can we get the next question please? Operator : All right. Our next question comes from Mr. David Tarantino. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. David Tarantino : Gene, I had a question about the Olive Garden same-store sales dynamics, and I wanted to first ask if the 2016 outlook assumes that you'll return to positive same-store traffic for that brand at some point in the year and when you might expect that to occur, if that is the case? Gene Lee : David, right now we're expecting traffic to be flattish for next year, which we think is going to end up beating the market by a point to point and a half. I've always said that the first barrier for us was to breakthrough and for Olive Garden to start to beat the market. We had a good quarter. We beat the market by a point and a little bit more if you add in the bulk takeout. So we're hoping that we can get the brand back to level guest counts, maybe slightly positive. And we would expect a little bit better traction in the back half of the year than the front half of the year as we still face some heavy discounting in the front half of '16. David Tarantino : Great, that's helpful. And then perhaps could you provide an update on the remodel strategy for Olive Garden? I think at one point you had considered that a critical element of the brand renaissance. And I don't know where you stand in terms of your remodel program when you're looking at 2016 and 2017? Gene Lee : Okay, Dave, we got a lot going on with remodels. I'll start off by saying the initial 13 that we did which were pretty extensive remodels are trending in the mid-seven range above the system average. So in a six-way analysis they are performing, it's a little over 7% in same-restaurant sales growth above the system. We've done another 20 or so remodels at different investment levels that were just starting to get a read-on. We're also up in the northeast working on 20 different bar remodels trying to figure out what we can do with the extra capacity that we have up there. So I would say that there is -- we have a lot of test going on, we're really encouraged with the feedback and we're trying to continue to hone in on what's the right investment level, is there a couple different packages out there that we can deploy for that. So we don't happen to do this same package in every restaurant. I would also that Dave and the team are starting the initial work on Olive Garden of the future, and we've identified the site and we're really excited about building what I would call a \"Contemporary Olive Garden,\" an Olive Garden that will be really competitive in today's environment. And I'm hoping that will be a significant inspiration into the future as we continue to refresh our older Olive Gardens. So a lot of activity, and I'm really excited about the initial results that we're getting from the original 13 we did. David Tarantino : Right. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : All right. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Jeff Farmer : Great. The strength of Olive Garden's to-go business continues to surprise, in my opinion. So I guess, from the outside looking in, it seems like the opportunity was always there. So I'm just curious what the operational or strategic shift was, as you guys pursued to get that to-go business really moving in 2015? And as you look forward to 2016, is there greater opportunity with to-go? Gene Lee : Yes, good question. I think what the Olive Garden team did first and foremost was they really rebuilt their systems and ensured they had the right system, the right packaging, and the right processes in place that enable this. This was really -- the insight came from our consumer insights team that said to the team, \"Listen, to-go is only going to get more and more important to our consumer. You have products that travel extremely well. You need to build out this capability.\" So the teams that's been working on this for 18 months, they started off with the initial focus was a 100% accurate and a 100% on time. When you do consumer research around takeout, that's what the consumer really wants. Enabling it through web ordering has been a big help. We've also promoted, the team is getting ready to implement delivery. We think large party delivery is a big growth outlet. Over time, I expect and the team expects that 20% of Olive Garden's total sales is going to migrate to takeout, and we think that we're really well suited to take advantage of that opportunity. Jeff Farmer : Just one quick follow-up; do you intend to pursue that delivery with a third party or tackle that yourself? Gene Lee : We're looking at both options right now. We do think that the third party dynamic is going to change dramatically over the next couple of years, and we're on top of what's happening in that space. Jeff Farmer : Okay, thank you. Operator : All right. Thank you so much [indiscernible] Mr. Farmer. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. Question with respect to the REIT structure, and I think you say the $1 billion to pay down debt. I wonder what you could -- how do you derive that or what is your total valuation that you're implying for the range for that 430 storefront or so? Bill White : Yes, Jeff, this is Bill White. The best way to think about the total value is take a look at the aggregate rents that we've shared with the group. So we're looking at essentially about a 135 million of GAAP rents or a 120 million of cash rent. That will be divided up amongst all those restaurants, both the individual sale leasebacks that Gene alluded to, as well as the 430 within the REIT. And I think the best way to think about the value there is really think about we are a dollar brand trade within the real estate space or the REIT space versus an operating company to get a sense of what that value differential could be. Matthew DiFrisco : Right. Okay. So then the $120 million is associated with the 500 stores, not just 430 that are going to spun out to the REIT? Bill White : That's correct. Matthew DiFrisco : Okay. And then also\u2026 Operator : Time up. Matthew DiFrisco : Do I have time for another one? Gene Lee : Go ahead, Matt. Matthew DiFrisco : Okay. Thank you. With respect to the breaking out of the Specialties brand now, the greater granularity separating them out to Fine Dining and then other, I guess initially some of the Board strategies have been expressed before to be one of the next steps after a REIT is to spin off, or consider greater monetization of the Specialties division. Is this something now structurally that you're looking at the businesses differently than has been historic, where you bucketed them as a Specialties division and you're separating functions, as well now, in that the brands together, Capital Grille and Eddie V's, would be the better positioned standalone brands, where the classification of other means that they're more akin to needing the support of Olive Garden and LongHorn, the smaller brands? Brad Richmond : No, I would say this is really about meeting investor needs for insight to how Darden's performing and understanding our financial performance. As we talked about, first in our priority right now is really the real estate strategy and executing on that. And I think down the road we will look at the opportunity for segmentations of the brand and separations of the brands, but that's far down our list right now, but something that we can look at, but don't read into this particular segmentation as anything beyond just providing more clarity, more transparency into our financial performance. Matthew DiFrisco : Excellent, thank you. Operator : Thank you so much Mr. DiFrisco. Our next question comes from Mr. John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. John Glass : Thanks. Good morning. Two questions; first, just being on the progression of the traffic at Olive Garden. So it declined sequentially through the quarter. The industry was down, but didn't really decline sequentially. Is that just a function of getting away from discounting -- how do you interpret that data, I guess, in looking at your overall comp was good, but the traffic was a weaker component than I would have thought? Gene Lee : Yes, John, we had -- let's start with March, we actually had a strong promotion over a weak promotion that drove traffic. That was our BOTO. The Easter holiday had some effect in March/April. When I look at those two months, I combine them, and then we are going over some heavy 999 discounting in May, and we backed off that this year. So when I looked at traffic for the quarter, I was overall pleased, I kind of wrapped up the quarter into -- I looked at -- last 15 out of 16 weeks Olive Garden has significantly beat Knapp-Track. We had one week in there, which was Easter week, the prior year that was for some reason we had a really bad week. That may have had more to do with promotional way to some other timing, but over the last 15, start of 16 weeks Olive Garden has significantly outperformed Knapp-Track. So I am pleased, I am not caught up any sequential trends where we continue to move our marketing spend to try to understand what's working and what's not. And when you make some commitments, sometimes it takes three to four weeks to adjust after you try something that might not be working as well as you like. Also remember we have 50 basis points of traffic that's not accounted for in our large party takeout. So we are not giving ourselves any guest counts for pans of lasagne [ph] or big pans of Fettuccine Alfredo. And that equates to approximately 50 basis points in additional traffic. John Glass : Thank you for the color. If I could just follow up with a question on the REIT, in your assumption of valuations, the sale leaseback market is hot, and therefore, you get some pretty attractive cap rates. Are you assuming that the REIT has not penetrated that favorable cap rate, in other words, a lower valuation or a higher cap rate? And have you thrown out or are you willing to throw out any ranges you're initially assuming in that valuation that you just talked about? Bill White : Yes, John, this is Bill White. Yes, we wouldn't want to speculate on that. We could just tell you that historically there is a pretty significant value differential between restaurant operating companies and REITs, but we wouldn't want to really speculate on the specifics about valuation on the REIT. John Glass : Would you at least be willing to say that you think that a single tenant REIT trades at a much lower valuation than a diversified REIT, and that's your working assumption going in and you diversify it over time to get improved valuation? Bill White : There is a lot of other factors that go into that valuation, aside from diversification. Some of the factors that -- Gene mentioned the fact that this will be a 100% investment grade tenant base, and there is really no triple -- no public triple net REITs that are even close to that level, so certainly other factors would go into that. John Glass : Okay, thank you. Operator : All right. Thank you so much Mr. Glass. Our next question comes from Mr. Joseph Buckley from the Bank of America. Sir your line is open you may proceed. Joseph Buckley : Thank you. First operating question or two, and then a couple of REIT questions, as well, in the overall inflation expectations for FY16, you shared the food inflation expectation. What are you thinking on labor inflation? Brad Richmond : Hi, Joe, this is Brad, and we put that in the all others, in that 2% to 3%. I would say the wage rate is probably in the upper-half of that range, but there's many other items that when you look at our P&L that would be bringing that overall inflation rate to the middle of that range at this point. Joseph Buckley : Okay. And then on the traffic, the traffic piece at Olive Garden, does that include the benefit of the to-go transactions? I think you said to-go sales were up 23%. So is that buried within that traffic number, so the on-site traffic numbers would be worse than what we're looking at? Brad Richmond : Some of the to-go traffic, if we sell entrees to go that is part of the traffic. If we sell large party items, such as pans of lasagna, anything that's bulk, and which we're doing a lot of. We're not taking any guest counts for that, Joe. And that has a 50 basis point impact on guest counts. Joseph Buckley : Okay. And then\u2026 Operator : All right, thank you so much. Our next question comes from Mr. David Palmer of the RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a quick question, Gene, just looking back and looking forward with regard to your costs, I know that there was a lot of costs that you got out of overhead by undoing a matrix type structure. But as you look at the P&L from a restaurant perspective, how are you getting at the costs better than you did before? Is there any real changes that are happening, even with regard to real estate? For instance, when you break out rent costs, you shine a brighter light on the underlying real restaurant earnings. Is that part of what you're getting out of the restaurant margins here is you're more accurately getting at the real restaurant earnings in your underlying assets? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes, David. A couple of components to that; first, I think our team is doing a much better job from a labor cost stand point. We're really focusing on being able to effectively plan our volume, and then from there, effectively plan the labor cost, and we've been able to take out a lot of cost that's built into the system. Compound that with the work the team is doing to simplify operations, for example, Olive Garden in the quarter, was able to take a 140 basis points of labor out, and improve their overall service metrics, which to me is exciting. I would also say is that, we've got teams doing zero-based budgeting with restaurants. And we're going up here in each of the brands, and were pulling -- across the country we're pulling every single invoice inside a restaurant, and we're finding things that have creeped in over the years from a basic restaurant operations perspective that we're able to take out. And so, I think our operating teams are doing a great job of going in and saying, for example, how many times do we really need to clean the carpets in a restaurant? There is a protocol, that you clean carpets once a month. If you do it more than that you end up actually destroying the carpet, and see really not a whole lot of benefit there. So we found a lot of restaurants that were cleaning carpets twice-a-month. So we've been able to find -- that's just one example of the costs the operating teams have been able to find over time. And so, this is really a bottoms-up, back-to-basics restaurant approach to remove costs from the P&L. David Palmer : Just follow-up on the REIT thing, if you were -- would you contribute some of your debt over to the REIT, would that be how it would work that you would lever up the REIT and then borrow new money on the remain co? How would that work in terms of setting up a capital structure in the future? Thanks. Bill White : Yes, David, this is Bill. We're still working through some of those details. Unlikely that we would do a debt for debt exchange of some kind, most likely some type of debt raise at the REIT, but we're still working through all those specifics, and we'll have more to come in our public filing. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you so much Mr. Palmer. Our next question comes from Mr. Will Slabaugh from the Stephens, Inc. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Will Slabaugh : Thanks, guys. Two quick questions, if I could. First, on Olive Garden, can you give us any further detail around the deep discounting you talked about at Olive Garden that you noted you're in the process of removing. What form did most of that discounting take, and then what percentage of what you would call discounting remains at the brand right now? Gene Lee : Yes, the majority of the deep discounting we're referring to is the 999 promotional platform that we were running last year. We were running a lot of 999, 1099, 11 of the 13 weeks in Q4 fiscal '15, what we call, deep-discounted. We refer to anything below 1199 as really deep-discounting. We're still going to have to have some value platforms across Olive Garden to drive the business, never Ending Pasta Bowl is not going away, it's in the base; it's something that we're going to need to do. But strategically, last February, of fiscal '15, we went back in, and we added Cucina Mia to the menu so that we could have a 999 price point to offer everyday value to our guests. This menu item is gaining momentum. It's gaining momentum across a few constituents that use the Olive Garden restaurant. We're finding that millennials love the 999 Cucina Mia because they get to customize their meal. We also find the value seekers like that entry price point. What's interesting is that 50% of the people who enter Cucina Mia at 999 do buy an add-on. And so the price does come up. Our strategy all along was to introduce and get everyday value back on the menu, become less reliant on, what we would refer to as, a lot of deep-discounting to drive the traffic. We want to continue to migrate over to more brand building, more advertising around the food that people really love. We love to be doing stuff around our [indiscernible] which has a lot of following. So we got to continue to evolve that piece of it. Will Slabaugh : Got it. And one quick one on the REIT, if I could; it seems like a couple of the primary benefits would be around one, the potential valuation gap which you mentioned, and then also the ability to add more leverage to a REIT and return that excess cash to shareholders through a dividend. Can you shed any more color on longer term capital plans for the REIT? Gene Lee : Yes, we're really not in a position, Mr. Will. We're not in a position to go into a lot of those details. We've still got to work through some of those, and again I think we'll have more to say when we get to the point where we're filing our Form 10. Will Slabaugh : Got it, thank you. Operator : All right, thank you so much. Our next question comes from Mr. Chris O'Cull from the KeyBanc. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Chris O'Cull: Thanks, guys. I just had a couple of questions. First, in terms of just operations, Gene, can you talk a little bit about how you're able to unwind deep discounting while still improving the comp, and also maybe what the margin impact of the discount reduction was? I think I may have missed that. Gene Lee : Yes, I would say that I think we're getting a little bit -- as I talked about in the last call, I think we're getting a little bit of help from the consumer. I do think the consumer is looking for less discounting activity today than they were a year ago, or two years ago. We've had a lot of discussion around the gas, what we call the gas dividend that's going back to the consumer. I think there's a lot of expectation that that was going to stimulate traffic. What I've been saying is, we haven't seen it stimulate traffic, but we have seen it change the consumer behavior once they're in our building, and they're not seeking the deals the way they were years ago. We're seeing some more \u2013- the consumers buy more add-ons. They're buying wine, dessert, apps. So I think that that is the environment, is helping us somewhat move away from these constructs, and we're just not finding them to be as successful as they once were, so we're able to do that. From a margin perspective, I would say that we're picking up at probably well over a 100 basis point from reducing this heavy discount mentality or strategy, and you see that in every line in the P&L. So you have less discounts, the food cost improves, your labor cost improves. Chris O'Cull: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, is tenant diversity more important than the single tenant with investment grade credit for this REIT? And then can you guys discuss why the company decided not to include the ground leases in the REIT? Bill White : Yes, this is Bill. The first part is the question on tenant diversity; it's certainly something that we're focused on. If we look at the strategy for the REIT going forward, and we think that we've developed a strategy that will be very well positioned to allow -- first of all, it's got very strong geographic diversification out of the gate. But then we'll be in a good position with enough excess debt capacity to be able to fund growth, as well as diversify through 1031 asset exchanges on a very efficient basis, with some highly desirable Olive Garden properties. We've got a good strategy in place for that. And then the second part of your question on -- Chris O'Cull: On the ground leases. Bill White : Yes, on the ground leases. The biggest issue, certainly something we examine carefully. The biggest issue we found with the ground lease is that they really require a commitment of locking in all of your existing option periods. In our case, 25-plus years of time that from an operating stand point really constrains and restricts your operating flexibility, to be able to go back and negotiate or renegotiate at those option periods, which have value to the operating company, as well as, frankly, just having less value, and typically not a very significant component of a REIT portfolio. Chris O'Cull: Okay. Fair enough. And the three turns, or the three turns of coverage, does that include a standardized G&A allocation overhead allocation or is that the actual G&A allocation for Darden? Bill White : That would be pre G&A. Chris O'Cull: Okay, thank you. Operator : All right, thank you so much. Our next question comes from Mr. Jason West from the Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Jason West : Yes. Thanks. Just want to understand on the dividend, you talked about the net earnings impact, about $50 million pretax, but you've also lowered CapEx quite a bit over the last few years, and wondering if you think you'd be able to pay that dividend that you're currently paying on the Darden corporate side, even with the higher rent expense that you're looking at? Brad Richmond : Yes, so what we've said is that we will keep the -- our plan is to keep the dividend whole between the two entities, between Darden post the separation, and then within the new REIT, the absolute value. So yes, we are very confident we can preserve that dividend, and actually continue to show some nice improvement or progress with the dividend pay-out ratio. Jason West : Okay. And can you help us understand in terms of the free cash flow outlook for the Darden entity -- so I guess in terms of the operating cash flow side, it would be the higher rent expense, the CapEx -- is any CapEx going to go away when the real estate transfers, and is that the way to look at it in those two pieces that are changing? Brad Richmond : A lot of that is projecting pretty far forward, but what I can share is these are triple net leases. So the CapEx guidance that I gave would pretty much stay in place that we talked about for this fiscal year. It would be hard to say there's any change there. In terms of the free cash flow, the real driver there in --you see it in this particular quarter as well, is the improvement in the operating performance of the business. And then we gave you the information, that when a transaction occurs what that would do to depreciation, which is a non-cash item, but also to interest and all those. So we're projecting pretty far forward, but I think the thrust to the question on CapEx, things like that, wouldn't change. We have improving cash flows. You can add what our working guidance is right now in terms of its impact for Darden to the operating company. Jason West : Okay. And then just one quick one, the $1 billion debt pay down, does that include paying, using the cash on the balance sheet, which is substantial right now, or is that leaving that cash alone, and you can still pay down $1 billion in debt? Bill White : Yes, Jason, this is Bill. It does include a portion of it. The majority of that debt retirement will come out of proceeds from the real estate transactions, but there will also be a component of cash coming up from Darden's balance sheet. Jason West : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Ms Sara Senatore from the Bernstein. Ma'am, your line is open. You may proceed. Sara Senatore : Thank you very much. I have one question about Olive Garden and then a follow-up on the real estate, if I may. The first is on Olive Garden, just with the improvement in the profitability and the same-store sales; do you envision returning that concept to growth at some point? I think there was a time when at least prior management thought this could be a 900 to a 1,000 unit business. Is that something that you envision being the case, if operating margins and volumes, everything gets back to or better than peak? So that's my first question. And the second question, the follow-up on the real estate, I just am trying to understand the value creation a little bit better. I understand the difference between the REIT and an operating business, but shouldn't we be comparing this to your debt? And so I guess in the sense of creating value, is it fair to assume that you think -- is the cash cap rates that you're talking about, are those better than how we should think about the debt that you're payin8g down, the effective interest rate on that? Thank you. Gene Lee : Sara, I'll take the Olive Garden growth, and then why we handle the value creation on the REITs. As we think about Olive Garden we actually opened up a few restaurants this year that have done extremely well. So as we think about growth we need to be opportunistic. [Technical difficulty] Olive Gardens is that they impact at least one restaurant, and sometimes up to two or three restaurants because we are so fully developed. We sat with our real estate team recently and looked at opportunity areas where we could build Olive Gardens and not have any impact, and they came up with Hawaii. And I'm really not interested in opening Olive Gardens in Hawaii. So at this point we are looking for selective areas of the country where we may be able to open five or ten Olive Gardens a year, not have major impact on our existing footprint or if we're going to impact in Olive Garden, we need to think about it around this whole notion of if we don't open this restaurant someone else is going to open the restaurant and they're going to have an impact on Olive Garden. Those are the filters that Dave and his team are running Olive Garden growth through. I think over the next few years, what we have guided Dave to try to do is to open five to ten great Olive Gardens a year. And that will continue to examine what the long-term potential for Olive Garden is. Bill? Bill White : And Sara, to your question about the repayment of debt, we would start with just sharing with you that we think the right comparison is not between the cap rate and the interest rate. It's really between the cap rate and the cost to capital, the weighted average cost to capital for a restaurant company. So it does come back to this notion that a dollar rent is going to be worth more to a REIT than a dollar rent saved at an operating company, less so about a optimal capital structure decision, more about the decision of owning real estate. Excuse me. So really paying down the debt allows us to do the size real estate deal that we desire we think creates the most value while not repaying the longer dated debt, and at the same time preserving the credit profile. Sara Senatore : Thanks. I'm sorry. And just one last thing, on the CFO search, I heard you say something about July. Did I miss it? Are you, have you identified candidates that you're very close to settling on somebody? Gene Lee : The CFO search is ongoing. We're doing a thorough search, and we have more news. We'll provide you an update. Sara Senatore : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you as well. Well, our next question comes from Mr. John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. Just to follow-up on the CapEx, if I may. I think in 2016, the CapEx is guided at $230 million to $255 million, of which 30%, if I heard you, was refreshed technology and other. So just to look at that refresh piece of that, call it, $240 million CapEx, it definitely doesn't seem like a big number relative to your own store base. So just a little bit more color on that in terms of where you think it could go. And certainly understand in 2015, you really put the brakes on that, and in 2016, it looks like you're studying the various options that you have. But longer term, what is the right level of refresh CapEx that we should consider for your business for your own portfolio? Thanks. Brad Richmond : Well, there's two things, John, one that the maintenance CapEx is now to keep the facilities up to the standards and expectations that we have. That amount is when you look at the size and unit the traffic that they're doing, that trend pretty consistent year-to-year. And in terms of the refresh opportunity, Gene touched some on the opportunities that we see with Olive Garden, but that work is still underway and we'll continue to evaluate that, and when we see the opportunity to invest more, that produces even greater return. We're comfortable doing that. John Ivankoe : And maybe is it the case that your maintenance CapEx, I think, is something pretty close to D&A, that's something that we should consider over time? And this is obviously a big change relative to how Darden used to be. Does refresh by definition not have to be as big as part of the plan as it was maybe interpreted two to 12 years ago, in terms of how Darden was previously run? Brad Richmond : Yes. Let me be clear. Through the process that we're going through we aren't really cutting maintenance CapEx. We know the importance of keeping our facilities up to the standards that we expect. And so, as we look at that over time on a per restaurant basis, quickly we take out the Red Lobster disposition and its older base. The amount that we're spending on a pre-unit basis, we felt very comfortable as consistent with what we've done and maintained the facilities to the high level that we need. I do think that you're on to a point on the refresh that we talked about that in the past and maybe have had programs and things that one more capital than we should have spent. That's why you see Gene and Dave George in the team they're being very diligent, very cautious, taking the time to understand the money that we're putting back into the pre Tuscan farmhouse Olive Gardens and making the proper decisions there. And so are no -- there would be more updates as we get further through that. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. Your line is open. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. These are for Bill. Bill, it sounds like you said a couple times on the call that your intent is to not look to pay down the longer dated bonds. So if you can just confirm that you don't have plans to touch the 2035s or 2037s. And then as you look at paying down the rest of the bonds that are in place, would you plan to do a tender or a make whole? And then finally, just around the consent solicitation, would that be on all of the bonds that are in place or just the ones that remaining in place and what your order of operations is going to be in terms of getting the consents versus taking out the debt? Thank you. Bill White : Yes, lot of questions in there Priya, but we are actually launching the consent process today. So our preference is to not really get into a lot of the details. They'll give us an opportunity to speak to bondholders directly which is what we will be doing. What I can't confirm for you is that yes, we'll be paying down all the debt outside of the long dated 2035, '37. The '35s and '37s, those the bondholders will be seeking consent from and more to share about that later in the day. In terms of the process that will take to retire the debt, we're still formulating that strategy. Our first step is to speak to the long dated bondholders. And we're towards getting consent with those individuals. We should make it clear that consents not a requirement to do what we want to do, but it's certainly the preferred route. Priya Ohri-Gupta: So what happens in the event that you don't get the consent that you seek from these long dated bondholders? Bill White : Yes, we really feel like that what we're going to bondholders with will be able to get consent. Again it's not a requirement and our preference is to not go into those details at this stage of the game. But our intent is to have a good conversation with bondholders and work with bondholders. Priya Ohri-Gupta: And then just one final one, if I could; what's your expected ongoing leverage of the op co, or the leverage that you're targeting as a result of all of this? Thank you. Bill White : Yes, we would expect leverage to stay around adjusted basis approximately where we are today and even improving with the improving operating performance for delivering. So adjust debt to EBITDAR. We would expect to continue to show progress and improvement. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Thank you, so much. Operator : All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Sir your line is open. You may proceed. Joshua Long : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I was curious if you could give us an update around technology investments, either at the store level or maybe at the above store level to support some of the off-premises sales channels that you're looking at? I'm thinking that we've previously talked around maybe some table top technology in the restaurants and then maybe anything to support that to-go channel that we've been talking about as a long-term opportunity at Olive Garden. Gene Lee : Yes, great. Technology is a big part of our plan moving forward. I will start with Ziosk. We are rolling that out in Olive Garden. We are over 100 restaurants today. Our guest and server feedback continues to be positive. We are seeing similar results or better results than our initial test sales. So, we are really excited about what we are doing with the Ziosk in Olive Garden. We are working on web-ahead capabilities. We think that that's going to be an important part going into the future. People are going to be want to be able to put their name on sort of list. Ahead of time, they want to know what the weight is. It's all building on the convenience trend, that's important. We are trying, one of our goals in Olive Garden because we do have a lot of overcapacity on the weekend is how do we improve the wait. So one of the technological things we are doing is we are putting screens in the lobby, so people can see where they are in the wait, and the initial feedback from that has been really, really positive. A lot of other technological investments right now are around CRM. And we are working with a partner to continue to move that forward. We are in the early phases, discovery phases of developing a loyalty program, so a lot of energy and effort there. We are also looking at -- from a technology standpoint, looking at out PoS systems in restaurants trying to figure out what's the best way to go forward there. That's really it from a technology standpoint at this point in time. Joshua Long : That's very helpful. And generally speaking, can we think of this as maybe an Olive Garden first approach, and then with a lot of these initiatives maybe being adapted to your other brands in your portfolios over time? Gene Lee : Well, some of the technology stuff that we are doing has to be implemented on the other brands. Olive Garden only has so much capacity. So we are doing a lot of web-ahead in LongHorn. And we look at each brand and say, \"Okay, who has the capacity to do this to run the test, so we can get the results,\" so that the burden isn't always on Olive Garden in the testing process. Joshua Long : Thank you. Operator : All right. Thank you so much. Our next questions from Mr. Joseph Buckley of the Bank of America. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Joseph Buckley : Thank you for coming back to me. I just wanted to ask a couple on the REIT. Is it going to be a triple net lease structure? And could you give us some help on the rent breakdown between the properties in the REIT and properties being done in the sale leaseback transactions? Bill White : Joe, this is Bill. It will be a triple net structure and we are not quite in a position to be able to give you the breakdown yet amongst, we have given you the total rental, number of properties, we are still formulating the exact mix and trying to do, take all the steps to be prepared to know what the cost structure and other things will look like for the new REIT. So, we are just not quite in a position to go into the level of detail with you here today. Joseph Buckley : From our seat, is it appropriate to think of it as an equal split, based on the number of restaurants in the two different transaction structures? Or is it something unique about the sale leaseback properties that would skew that? Bill White : No, I think that's a fair assumption, the only asset obviously in that mix is slightly lumpy to be our restaurant support center, but beyond that I think that's a very reasonable assumption. Joseph Buckley : Okay. And the $50 million incentive GAAP number, the pretax impact? Bill White : It is. Joseph Buckley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : All right. Thank you so much Mr. Buckley. Our next question on queue comes from Mr. Jason West from the Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Jason West : Yes. Thanks for letting us do some follow-ups. So one, on what Joe just asked about the pretax earnings impact, are you guys planning to call out the non-cash rent as sort of a one-time item in the earnings or are you planning to leave that in as the adjusted earnings? Brad Richmond : I think it's going to be on a GAAP basis. Once the transaction is complete, and we again aren't sure about the exact timing of that. So it's a little ways out, but as always the case even today with the facilities we have, our GAAP number that's on our P&Ls and then the cash that goes to the cash flow statement that will continue to go forward. I don't think there will be a need to call out that difference. Jason West : Okay. And can you explain again, I'm sorry if I missed it, how the $1 billion debt pay down proceeds, we know a portion of it is the balance sheet cash, a portion of it is the sale leaseback. And is there some expectation that you'll receive a distribution from the REIT as a portion of that, as well? Would that be a distribution if the REIT issues securities, or are you saying if you hold on to a portion of the REIT, you'll get distributions from the dividend payments from the REIT? Bill White : Yes, Jason, this is Bill. You're right on track. It's actually there will be a distribution from the REIT. The REIT will raise some debt, and send a distribution back at the point of spin or at the point of separation. That will come back to Darden and that will be one of the components. So the timing on some of that we would obviously expect to see some of the sale leaseback proceeds sooner. And then at the point of the separation, we will call it in the fall of this calendar year, that's when we see that distribution back from the REIT, and then addition to a component coming from Darden's balance sheet cash to satisfy that debt retirement. Jason West : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you so much. Well, at this time there are no further questions on queue. I'd like to hand the call back to the speakers. Gentlemen, you may proceed. Rick Cardenas : Well, thank you all for your time and attention today. As a reminder, we plan to release fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings on Tuesday, September 22. Have a great day, and have a great summer. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Dori and good morning and welcome everyone. With me today is Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Jeff Davis, CFO, and Bill White, Treasurer. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed earlier today and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's discussion and presentation may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. A reconciliation of these measurements is in our earnings release. In addition, we are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call. This presentation will be posted under the Investors tab on our Web site at the conclusion of the call. We plan to release fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings on Friday, December 18 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, following prepared remarks from Gene and Jeff, we will take your questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. We are pleased with the progress we made during the first quarter, as we significantly outperformed the industry in terms of same restaurant sales and traffic. Total sales grew 5.7% for the quarter, which was driven by strong same restaurant sales growth at 3.4% and positive same restaurant sales at each of our brands, plus the addition of 30 net new restaurants. Earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, increased approximately 113% to $0.68 and first quarter adjusted EBIT margins once again show strong improvement. Olive Garden continues to build on a positive business momentum generated in fiscal 2015, with its fourth consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. During the quarter, guest counts turned positive and outperformed the industry by more than 200 basis points. As we discussed previously, a key element of Olive Garden's culinary strategy is to create menu items that leverage core brand equities. During the quarter, we saw two examples of this strategy. First, the Create Your Own Tour of Italy promotion inspired by one of our most popular core menu items, allowed guests to create their own entr\u00e9e by choosing from many of their favorite dishes. Additionally, this full price and customized offer, which started in July, outperformed the deep discounted promotion during the same period last year. Second, we introduced the Create Your Own Lunch combination menu platform, which features the choice of unlimited soup or salad, plus the choice of either a mini pasta bowl, a flat bread, or one of our highly anticipated and extremely well received breadstick sandwiches. This platform's strength in Olive Garden's competitive advantage by adding more variety and giving guests the ability to customize their order for great value. The new lunch menu was supported by a successful integrated marketing campaign, which we call breadstick nation. That featured Olive Garden food trucks that travel across the country, making 80 stops in 20 different markets to share more than 50,000 samples of breadstick sandwiches. The campaign clearly resonated with our guests, as it generated more than 820 million impressions across traditional and social media. This new platform, coupled with the breadstick nation campaign, led to a three point improvement in weekday lunch traffic during the quarter. It was the most successful new lunch platform, since the introduction of the original soup, salad and breadsticks, and guest preference for the Create Your Own Lunch combination, was higher than the lunch option of soup, salad and breadsticks during the quarter. Additionally, OG To Go continues to be a focus, as we strive to meet our guest's growing need for convenience. This quarter, OG To Go grew 18% and we have seen a two year growth rate of over 30% and we continue to be excited about the opportunities that growth in takeout represents for our business. We also continued the roll out of our table-top tablets. The tablets are now on more than half of our restaurants, with 80% of the tables choosing to interact with the devices in those restaurants. We continue to see the same benefits, as we saw during the tests, higher add-on sales, faster dining times, and overall higher guest satisfaction scores. We are pleased with the progress of the rollout, and we expect to complete it by the end of the second quarter. And on a final note on Olive Garden, we have now refreshed 19 restaurants, and we remain pleased with their continued performance. As we have shared previously, we are taking the time to develop individualized plans for each restaurant based on a number of factors, to ensure optimal investment levels going forward. We plan to refresh approximately 25 additional locations this fiscal year. Now let's look at LongHorn Steakhouse; LongHorn continues to be well positioned in the market, and delivered strong top line growth driven by positive same restaurant sales of 4.4%, marking the 10th consecutive quarter that we have outperformed the industry. Two key factors have contributed to that performance include, focusing on culinary innovation that leverages our steak expertise, and continuing to evolve our marketing strategy, with an increased emphasis on one-to-one engagement. During the quarter, we welcomed Todd Burrowes back to LongHorn as President. Todd's strong operations focus, passion and deep understanding of the brand will further strengthen LongHorn's performance. Operational execution has always been a hallmark of LongHorn's success. I believe we have the opportunity to take our in-restaurant execution to an even higher level under Todd's leadership. Looking at our specialty restaurants, all five brands, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, and Eddie Vs had positive same restaurant sales during the quarter, and we are pleased with their continued progress. Each brand is well positioned in its competitive set, and has the opportunity to increase their market share through same restaurant sales growth and the addition of new restaurants. Now I want to provide an update on our comprehensive real estate plan that we announced in June. Since that time, we have made refinements to our plan. We now intend to separate 488 restaurant real estate properties through the sale leaseback of 64 restaurant properties, and a REIT spend that will include 424 restaurant properties to create an independent company called Four Corners Property Trust, which was discussed in its Form 10 filing last month. Using proceeds from the sale leasebacks, debt financing from Four Corners and Darden's balance sheet cash, we will retire approximately $1 billion of debt, and pay approximately $100 million of debt repayment costs, largely representing the acceleration of interest payable through 2017. The rating agencies have conveyed that they anticipate these transactions will be credit neutral to positive for Darden. These transactions are bond covenant compliant, and bondholder consent is not required. The approximate annualized financial impact of these restaurant real estate transactions to Darden will include, incremental cash rent of $108 million and GAAP rent expense of $116 million; a reduction in depreciation of $51 million and a reduction in interest expense of $45 million, resulting in a run rate reduction to pre-tax earnings of $20 million. Of course, in the spin-off, Darden shareholders will receive equity in Four Corners, the new owner of the real estate. We would expect the equivalent per share dividend amount of Darden and Four Corners to be at least equal to the current Darden dividend. Since announcing the appointment of Bill Lenehan as CEO last month, to process, to buildup a management team and board is fully underway. We continue to work towards the goal of completing the Four Corner spin by the end of the calendar year. And one final note on our real estate plan, we continue to pursue a sale leaseback of our restaurant support center. With that, I will turn it over to Jeff, for a financial update and outlook on fiscal 2016. But before I do that, let me say, how excited we are to have Jeff as our new CFO. In the short time he has been here, he has made a meaningful contribution and has proven to be a valuable addition to our executive leadership team. Jeff? Jeff Davis : Thank you, Gene, and good morning everyone. I am excited to be a part of this outstanding organization. I look forward to the opportunity to work with many of you in the future. As Gene mentioned, we reported strong same restaurant sales of 3.4%, and as you saw on the release, there was monthly variability and sales performance. We report same restaurant sales on a fiscal calendar basis, and due to our 53rd week last year, its not on a comparable calendar basis. In addition to normal holiday shifts, this may create month-to-month variability in our reported results. However, during the first quarter, the monthly variability was completely offset by quarter end, and as a reminder, the upcoming thanksgiving holiday will be reported in our fiscal second quarter versus fiscal third quarter last year. Reviewing our earnings performance this quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations, more than doubled as adjusted EBIT margins expanded 330 basis points versus the prior year. This was partially driven by leveraging positive same restaurant sales. Other significant drivers on margin expansion were 170 basis points improvement in food and beverage expense, and 100 basis point improvement in restaurant expense. More specifically, we had significant year-over-year favorability in dairy costs at Olive Garden. We had six fewer weeks of deep discounted promotions at Olive Garden versus last year. We continued progress towards previously disclosed cost reduction initiatives. A 30 basis point improvement in workers compensation and public liability expense related to historical claims, and more efficient restaurant support, resulting in 30 basis point improvement in G&A versus last year. Moving below operating income, interest expense was considerably lower this year, as we lapped the $1 billion extinguishment of debt last year. Our effective tax rate was 130 basis points higher than last year. We expect the tax rate for the full year to be within 21% to 24% range we disclosed in June. From a balance sheet perspective, we received approximately $130 in proceeds related to the sale and leaseback of 33 restaurant properties, which are included in the 64 Gene mentioned earlier. These proceeds largely drove the increase in our cash balance for the quarter. Turning to segment performance, Olive Garden's segment profit margin of 20.3% grew by 410 basis points from leveraging their positive same restaurant sales, dairy cost favorability, fewer weeks of deep discounted promotions versus last year, and continued progress on cost reduction initiatives. LongHorn's segment profit margin remained flat at 14.9%, and a significant beef cost inflation offset sales leverage and cost reductions. Fine dining expanded segment profit margins by 100 basis points, as leverage from sales growth more than offset beef cost inflation. And finally in other business, Seasons 52 and Yard House significantly improved their profitability, resulting into 360 basis point improvement and segment profit margin. While we continue to expect margin expansion in the second half of the year, we anticipate that it will significantly moderate versus first half performance, as we lap margin improvement initiatives that begin in the third quarter of last year. Given the company's strong first quarter performance and our expectation for the remainder of the yea, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2016 full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to range between $3.15 and $3.30 versus $3.05 and $3.20, previously announced in June. Our same restaurant sales expectation for the full year remains unchanged at 2% to 2.5%. We also remain on-track to deliver 18 to 22 new restaurants, with LongHorn and Yard House accounting for the majority of the openings. These expectations do not include the impact of any fiscal 2016 real estate transactions and related capital structure activities. However, as we approach the completion of the various real estate transactions, we will provide more details on the specific timing and impacts to our financial performance. And now I will turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks. Gene Lee : Thank you, Jeff. I want to close by reiterating that our intense focus on improving our food, service and our atmosphere continues to drive our positive business momentum, enabling us to capture market share, as our guest reward us by choosing our brands more frequently. We are excited about our progress, but we know we have a lot of work to do. Our restaurant teams and our support center staff at our restaurant support center are focused on the right priorities and the progress we are making is a direct result of their hardwork and commitment to creating memorable guest experiences. So thank you to our 150,000 team members who bring our business to life everyday, and now we will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Your line is open. Joseph Buckley : On the monthly data, it looked like the check increase moderated both at Olive Garden and LongHorn. Is it coincidental that happened to both brands, or is there some effort to make that happen? Gene Lee : Joe, it's Gene. I think its more coincidental and I think it has more to do with our fiscal calendar not matching up to what I would call, the operating calendar. As we ship, we have got some -- there is some noise in the data. Joseph Buckley : Okay. And then, secondly, what are the kind of key hurdles or milestones to getting the REIT spinoff done. These reports about the IRS being [indiscernible] to pre-approve transactions? I don't know if that is significant or not, in the scheme of things. Could you talk about that? Bill White : Yeah Joe, its Bill White. What we would tell you, is that the latest public statements that the Services made really -- they have talked about a no real position applying to PLR requests filed on or after September 14th. And so that really, in our minds, does not impact our plans. We are working towards spending the entity by the end of the calendar year. Joseph Buckley : Okay. Maybe one last one, just on the rent expense line, we realized some nice improvement. Can you talk about the cost buckets in that line with the savings and the efficiencies are being realized? Gene Lee : Joe, do you mean restaurant expenses? Joseph Buckley : Yeah. Did I not say that, that's what I meant to say? Gene Lee : Restaurant expenses, well first of all, we are getting some leverage from our sales growth. As Jeff mentioned in his comments, we had some favorability and historical claims on workers comp. We are also continuing to manage the non-consumer facing costs very aggressively and we continue through the work of PCG to bid a lot of work, and we are using our scale, as we talked about in the past, to bring down these costs. One of the big areas Joe is contract services. Joseph Buckley : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim. Matt DiFrisco : Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit more I guess, on the August comp trend and what just sort of -- give I guess, investors a little comfort, that you don't seem too concerned about the volatility within the quarter. You mentioned something about some moving around weeks. I am just curious if you could sort of tell us what might be driving sort of that perception of slowdown on the -- both traffic and the overall comp at a [indiscernible] brands? And then also, just curious I guess -- just as a follow-up to Joe's question, has there been a change in your view then with the IRS or no, there has not been a change since you began to reprocess and there is nothing -- you don't think you will meet resistance is what we should read through? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yeah. Matt, as far as August goes -- again, this goes back to our fiscal calendar versus, what I would call the operating calendar comparison. The last week of August was a really bad fiscal comparison, which hurt the overall month, and as we look at it, we don't see a deceleration as we look at, what we would call, comparable comps, or true comps is what Malcolm refers to them. So we believe that the business is -- on an operating basis, didn't have as much variability as it shows -- as we report through the fiscal calendar. As far as the question on the REIT, we are really confident that our proposed transaction will satisfy all the requirements of applicable law, and we plan on moving forward and having this deal done by the end of the calendar year. Matt DiFrisco : Okay. I guess, just to read through for layman's terms; the later timing of Labor Day, I guess, is that something to say, might have caused the imbalance on fiscal versus actual -- of how you look at it on business quarters? And so, what might have been lost in August? You are feeling good enough that that's evenly balanced and what might have been hurting August, just like July and June, some shift [ph] maybe we are going to see a lift in September? Gene Lee : Well I am not going to comment on the sales in September at this point in time. But it was the combination of the Labor Day pushback. You have heard some retailers talk about that, and also comparing, the fiscal calendar back. We are actually comparing it against the last week of our fiscal calendar, was comparing against a week that wasn't really in the center of August last year, and not towards the end of August. So those combinations really created for a tough fiscal comparison in the last week of August. Matt DiFrisco : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens Inc. Will Slabaugh : Thanks guys. I had a question around the Olive Garden comps, and you mentioned, one of the reasons that both of the margins in the comps improved, saw some really good uptick on the promotions and then, a little bit less of a deep discounting. So wanted to center around the deep discounting comment that you made. Can you put any numbers around, what the discounting looks like last year, and what that looks like now, and sort of what you want the discounting piece of the business to look like going forward? Gene Lee : Yeah, good question. Last year, in July, we ran three course, which is heavily discounted promotion, it was at $12.99. This year, our promotion was Build Your Own Tour, starting at $12.99 with add ons, so it had more of an effective price range in the $15 to $16 price point. And so that worked really -- really helped us, as far as our overall cost management, it helped our labor costs, it helped our costs, so on and so forth. We are going to -- and we look out into the future. We are going to continue to look for ways to modify the promotional calendar. At the end of August and right now, we are running buy one take one against buy one take one. We are going to run never ending pasta bowl against never ending pasta bowl. So there are times of the year, we think we still have to have a strong value message out there. But as I have mentioned in the past, the three course and the two for 25 constructs are nowhere near as effective as they were, 24, 36 months ago, and we are tying to move away from those constructs from a promotional standpoint. Will Slabaugh : That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up if I could, on the food cost basket. So 50 basis points, it looks like there was an improvement year-over-year. Wondering, how much of that was directly attributable to better commodities versus simply food waste [ph] or more efficiency, and what are your updates also on sort of food costs and beef in particular, given the spike that you said you saw at LongHorn this quarter? Gene Lee : Yeah. For Olive Garden, half of our commodity favorability was dairy and shrimp. The other half was, primarily, menu mix, and we saw some improved waste which we can tie back to the simplification efforts that management has been working on for the last couple of years. Olive Garden, actually in the quarter had its best waste ever in the history of the brand, since we have been tracking. So very pleased with the operational improvements on the cost of sales side. On beef, as I have said in the past, beef year-over-year comparisons have a lot to do with when you contracted last year. We believe that we are going to start to have some positive advantages in LongHorn, as the beef market starts to weak, and especially, we expect to see some significant improvement in the back half of the year. But as we move into 2017, we think that the beef market is going to be a much better market for us. Will Slabaugh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company. Mike Tamas : Hi, great. Thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. So you have had a couple of quarters of easy comparisons at Olive Garden. Now we are going to be facing much tougher comparison. So can you maybe walk us through how you are thinking about the comps, and specifically traffic at Olive Garden, as you roll over tougher comparisons? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yeah. I think the way we are thinking about it right now, is, how we are performing against the industry. We made great progress in the first quarter, as we -- our guest counts exceed the industry by 200 basis points. But I would caution everyone to say, that the industry did weaken from fourth quarter to first quarter. The industry was 100 basis points -- lost 100 basis points in momentum. So as we look out, I think there is two things that we are considering, what's the strength of the industry, and then what's the strength of the Olive Garden brand. And I believe, that we have strong momentum in Olive Garden right now. I think that we are executing at a very high level. I believe that the consumer is more aware of Olive Garden today than it was a year ago. I think we have done some pretty interesting marketing campaigns, and as we have looked out, we think that although the comparisons are a little bit more difficult -- they are a little bit more difficult on the sales side. We still had some weak guest counts in the back half of last year. So I think that we will continue to outperform the industry, as we move forward. Mike Tamas : Great, thanks. And just one quick follow-up, you have talked about paying down debt obviously, and the dividend for your [ph] two combined companies. But any thoughts on maybe doing a share buyback? I mean, by our math, it seems like you will have plenty of capacity left over, either do a dividend raise at pro forma Darden, or doing some buybacks. So any thoughts there please? Gene Lee : We will look at the capital structure after we complete the deal, if we complete the spin-out. Mike Tamas : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank. Brett Levy : Good morning gentlemen. If we could spend a little bit of time talking at the Labor situation. Obviously, strong improvements across all the other line items. But can you give a little bit of your thoughts on wage, retention, turnover, and what kind of productivity you are making at the unit level? Gene Lee : We continue to make strong productivity improvements in the direct labor line. I think our overall direct labor performance was really strong in the first quarter. I think, the increases we saw were indirect labor. As last year, we weren't accruing a lot of bonus payouts, because the performance was weak. We had good performance in the first quarter, so the majority of the labor -- there was an increase. I believe, labor was actually slightly less than last year. But it was mostly in the indirect line, as we accrued bonuses for management. Wage pressure continues to be a problem. We will continue to monitor it, as we monitor the different states and the different cities and what they are doing with minimum wage. The job market is improving. We are seeing in certain markets today, becoming a little bit more difficult to hire help. So that will eventually put some pressure on our average wage. But right now, I believe that we are managing this very-very effectively. Brett Levy : Would you be able to give us any sense as to what your wage rate inflation is? Are you seeing any increases in turnover, something you quantify? And also, can you give us little bit more details on where you stand on your commodity basket, not just for the next quarter, but for the full fiscal year? Gene Lee : Sure. I will comment quickly on the wage rate. Wage rate is somewhere between 1% and 2%, and I think that's -- as we -- especially in Olive Garden, as we continue to simplify the operation, we are able to remove ours, and that changes the mix of labor hours. And if its done correctly, allows you through that mix, to keep your wage rate at or below last year, as we take out some of the higher cost production labor in the back of the house. Jeff, you want to talk about the commodities basket? Jeff Davis : Yes. As we think about the commodities basket and what we have seen and if we can take a look at what your question is about the full year. What we are seeing right now is, that we still expect our food and beverage costs to see inflation about 1%, 1.5% which was our original guidance for the year. The front part of the year, we are actually seeing a little more of that inflation on the expectation, as it would continue to wane, as we get through the second half of the year. Brett Levy : And lastly, can you quantify what your G&A savings were for the quarter, and what your outlook is for the rest of this year? Thank you. Gene Lee : We will get back to you on those specifics. We will have Kevin get back to you on the specific G&A savings. It was 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but there are some savings in there and some offsets to those savings. But overall, we are making great progress with our G&A and we believe our run-rate G&A for the year will be somewhere between 4.6% and 4.8%. Operator : Does that answer your question? Brett Levy : Oh I am sorry. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great, thank you. Two questions; just one, I think you made a comment in your prepared remarks, just about the lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we saw that would be -- the earnings effectively double in this first quarter. So I am just wondering, if you could give some [indiscernible]. I think you said the second half margins versus the first half were going to be significantly less of an uptick. Can you just give a little more -- so what's terms of the magnitude of that and how that might translate into earnings? It seems like, just on a quarterly basis, The Street is -- struggled at least in the first quarter, that kind of nailed down the earnings. I am just trying to figure out the outlook for margin on earnings as we move to the four quarters fiscal 2016? Gene Lee : Jeff, we expect to still have margin improvement in Q3 and Q4, it just won't be at the same rate, as it has been, since the last half of 2015. So we made great margin improvements in Q3 and Q4. We obviously had great margin improvement in Q1. We expect that we will see some more significant margin improvement in Q2. But then its going to moderate in the back half of the year. When you look at a two year stack and we have it in the presentation, we expect there still to be margin improvement in the back half of the year. As we have stated, the big part of the earnings per share growth for the year will be in the first half of the year and we expect the second half of the year to moderate. Although, we still expect EPS to grow in the back half of the year. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. And then just a follow-up on earlier question about the cost savings. There was no mention there, but I am assuming its still the $50 million to $55 million in fiscal 2016. Just wondering, whether you achieved more than your pro rata share in the first quarter; because it seemed like -- well at least from an earnings guidance perspective, you raised the full year guidance of earnings without necessarily raising the comps. I am just wondering, whether the course of it is still the same, or whether there has been a shift in terms of when they are being achieved quarter-over-quarter? Bill White : So our estimate for the year still remains $50 million to $55 million. As it relates to the savings during the course of the year, as Gene had mentioned earlier, there were some items in G&A that offset some of those savings as a result of more discrete types of items. But we expect the $50 million to $55 million for the entire year. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. And then just lastly Gene, you often talk about the Italian segment, since like you have a pretty good view, kind of the state of the union. I am just wondering, how you think about the segment versus Olive Garden specifically, since like Olive Garden is getting better. But the broader segment -- and do you see the entire segment doing better, or do you think its Olive Garden specific? It seems like the segment has been challenged by kind of the view of just being more celebratory, more heavy, and just not necessarily in line with the consumer trend? Gene Lee : Yeah. I don't really want to comment too much on the segment. This segment -- however does continue to struggle. I just think that we have -- we have worked hard in Olive Garden over the last couple of years, to improve our overall value equation to the consumer. I believe that we have simplified the operation. We have added more value with the 9.99 [indiscernible] which is getting approximately 6% of sales today. We have more effectively communicated the appropriate message to our consumer, and don't underestimate what we are doing from a convenience standpoint, and really capitalizing on to really go; which I believe is exposing new guests to the Olive Garden experience, and its an experience that they really enjoy using Olive Garden for. When I think about those four things, I think that Olive Garden is executing at a high level, and it\u2019s a culmination of a couple of year's worth of work. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Jason West : Thanks. Just going back to the real estate transaction. Can you guys talk about why you made some of the refinements in some of the store counts and things like that? And then secondly, given the chatter out there around the IRS and their no-rule position, do you think you can move forward with this without an IRS sign-off, just using a private counsel? Thanks. Bill White : Yeah Jason, this is Bill. The refinements we made, there were just a handful of restaurants that we did exclude from the individual sale leasebacks as well as the Four Corners REIT spin, just to ensure full compliance with the covenant. And then the question about pressing forward, yeah, what we would refer you to, is some of the Form 10 filings that we have made around details of our plans. We don't really have any specifics to say about going on -- just opinion or anything otherwise. What we can say, is that we are going to be fully compliant with all the laws in place, and that we are pressing forward with the spin-off of Four Corners. Jason West : And just one quick one, I mean, would you be able to say, given the timing you guys have proposed of November-December; what would that imply in terms of the IRS ruling, timing, to get that done on that schedule? Bill White : I think we believe, that we are going to be in full compliance. What we can say about the IRS is that, the laws haven't changed with the revenue procedure bullets and that they have issued. So it suggests that there is not that retroactive application of any new laws they would contemplate, would not take place. So we are expecting to be able to complete our transaction by calendar year end. Jason West : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Andy Barish : Hey, good morning guys. Just bouncing back on the strong Olive Garden To Go growth. Can you give us a little color maybe on how that impacts the overall quarter in terms of same store sales, with mix and traffic? Gene Lee : Yeah, its Gene. I think -- when we look at To Go sale, it is definitely having a big impact with the overall quarter for Olive Garden. We believe -- any cannibalization its creating from our diamond businesses, we are able to fill that with the extra demand that we have for the business. So To Go is representing about 9.5% of our sales today. We have seen a 40% increase in the large party To Go sales, which we think is a huge opportunity. And I would remind everyone on the call that, for our large party takeout To Go, we are not attributing any guests for us, and it really equates to approximately 50 basis points in guest traffic that we are not accounting for. Its all part of the strategy now to -- as the way we look at it is, its both -- what can we do in restaurant and what can we do from a takeout standpoint. We are testing delivery. We think that that is a large party delivery. We do think that's another avenue for us to really leverage, to meet the consumer's demand for this convenience. We just have a great brand in Olive Garden, because our food travels so well. It\u2019s a great brand to take advantage of what the consumer wants today, and I think that says so much about its flexibility and so much about the strength of the brand that it can pivot from being an in-restaurant experience to a takeout experience and do really well. And then back to what I said earlier, I think it attracts a little bit of a different consumer. Andy Barish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS. Keith Siegner : Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions on August Digital [ph] and just a follow-up on that last one. Can you talk about where the orders for To Go are coming now? Is this still a large component via phone? Is it via web? Do you have plans to launch enhanced mobile? Could this make the To Go growth -- could this continue for a while, as you roll some of those things? Gene Lee : Most of the To Go orders today are still coming through the phone. We are incentivizing people to move over to the web. We are up approximately 20% online, and we continue to work to develop technology, to make it easier for our guests to access our web site, where we have introduced mobile, the adoption rate continues to rise. We know that when a consumer orders online, that their order is going -- the check average is going to be approximately 20% higher. So we are trying to incent more and more people to use that way of ordering, and hopefully over time, we can continue to get that to migrate closer to 50%, and even hopefully past that. And so we have got some technological things that I don't want to really get into a lot of detail for competitive reasons today, but we want to continue to enable our guests to be able to access Olive Garden from a takeout standpoint very easily. Keith Siegner : Okay. And then another area I want to focus on was the in-store tech; it sounds like the roll-out of the table top tablets is going very well. You highlighted all the benefits. I was just wondering. It seems like there is a little bit of debate, let's say, in the industry about full service and loyalty programs. Can that work, could it not work? Some are trying and some are not. How do you think about the potential for loyalty, integrating into table top tablets? Is this something you are considering? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes. We are considering the best way to implement a loyalty program, and we think that we are in a unique position, because of our seven brands, and with that, we think we can offer something that others can't offer.  I don't want to get into a whole lot of details from a competitive standpoint, but it is something that the team is working on. And I would say that -- that's Rick Cardenas' top priority as the Chief Strategy Officer for Darden right now. He is developing an effective loyalty program across all our brands. Keith Siegner : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris O'Cull with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning guys. Gene, the company looks to be on-track to have high single digit EBIT margin this year. Where do you think the long term margin should be for Darden, excluding the impact of future real estate transactions I guess? Gene Lee : Chris, you were braking up. I couldn't hear the question. Chris O'Cull: Let me try that again. It looks like the company is on track to have high single digit EBIT margin this year. Where do you think the long term margin should be for the company, excluding the impact of future real estate transactions? Gene Lee : I don't want to put a number out there, that I think that we are trying to get to. I think the competitive environment dictates that. I think the commodity environment will continue to have impact on it. What I do believe is that we can still grow our margins through a few levers. Obviously, being able to leverage same restaurant sales is the most important piece we can do. I think there is still work that can be done with our menus, that we can yield a better -- whether it\u2019s a food cost percentage or a gross margin dollar at the food line. Chris, you know how I think about that and how I think about revenue management. I think that's important. I think there is work that can still be done there. I think there is sill more efficiency in labor, which could be offset by some headwinds with wage rates. But overall, I do think there is additional costs that can come out of the system. And so, I am not going to put a number out there, where we think we can get to. But I do think that there is still a lot of margin enhancement that can be accomplished over the next few years, with the primary focus being on leveraging same restaurant sales growth. Chris O'Cull: You said beef inflation, are you pleased with the margin performance at LongHorn? Gene Lee : When I look at the LongHorn history over the last 18 years, and I look at where beef prices are, compared to its history. I think the operating margins are okay, and I do think that they will improve dramatically as beef comes down. The real challenge, when I look at the LongHorn business and what I have charged Todd with is, is we have got to raise the average unit volumes, and we are at approximately 3.1 today, and I believe that -- even as well as the brand has performed over the last couple of years, we need to get those top line sales closer to 3.4 million, 3.5 million, and then the operating margins will be right line to where we want it to be. Chris O'Cull: Great. And then one last question; Bill, what gives you confidence that six LongHorns will represents a sufficiently meaningful active business in the eyes of the IRS? Bill White : Yeah. We are not going to comment on the specifics around that. We think we have got a substantial business purpose, and a big component of that is the taxable REIT subsidiary that you're loading to the six LongHorn franchise restaurants. So we think it all holds together very well. It\u2019s a compelling story for both Four Corners and Darden for a very promising future growth story. Chris O'Cull: Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask about the advertising budget and the plan for the rest of the year. Can you just give us an update on where you stand today in terms of the percentage of sales on the advertising budget, what you're thinking for the rest of the year? And if there has been any changes in the media mix and/or the focus from an advertising perspective on either lunch or the To Go business? Gene Lee : There is a lot in that question. Let me start off by saying that, we continually move the media mix every single quarter, to try to see which lever is working. So when you think about Olive Garden, you think about media mix. We have got promotional television, we have got brand television, we have got lunch television. We even got a little bit of a takeout now. And so, when we think about that, and so when we think about that, we are constantly moving how much we have in promotional, how much we have in brand, how much we have in lunch, to see which vehicle is driving the most guest comp. And so, we will continue to monitor that. We would expect our advertising spending throughout the rest of the year, to be slightly below last year, basically the same. And what we are doing there, is we are able to -- the big thing is, we are able to cover the inflation. That's what I have charged the team with is, how do we cover the 7% to 8% media inflation, and not raise our overall costs. We expect our all-in advertising to be really approximately -- a little bit less than 4.5% for Olive Garden, and we will leverage it down with the other brands from there. LongHorn is going to finish the year at around 3.5%. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Diane Geissler : Good morning. Gene Lee : Good morning. Diane Geissler : Wanted to ask about the remodeling program, which is something you put on hold, while you were doing a little bit more investigative work. It sounds like you are ramping that a little bit more aggressively this year with the 25 units. Can you talk about kind of your comfort level in terms of what you think you will see in terms of your uptick? And then, in terms of the total portfolio, I think we were always thinking, it was about 250 to 300 restaurants that need to be refreshed. Can you talk about the sale leaseback -- will that impact the number of units that you potentially will remodel, just how that might impact your plans on that front? Gene Lee : Yeah. The sale leaseback will have no impact on our refreshing our restaurants. We continue to be pleased with the initial 19 restaurants. We have got a good read on approximately 10 of those restaurants, and we are seeing approximately a 7% lift in those restaurants. We have got a couple of things going on right now, as I mentioned in the last call, we have this Olive Garden -- older colony [ph] Olive Garden of the future under development where, we are going to try to build an Olive Garden, that would be extremely -- obviously very competitive in 2025. And so, we believe through this process, as we redesign the Olive Garden of the future, not just similar to what was done back in the late 90s with the Tuscan farmhouse. We believe its going to become some inspiration in that process, that will help us with future remodels; and so, we are going to move forward and do another 25 this year. We have got restaurants out there that we think, it can significantly benefit from this capital investment. Dave is in the team of being very strategic in which restaurants they are refreshing. In those restaurants, there is some deferred maintenance that needs to be taken care of. And so we need to get in there and do those, before we get the inspiration from [indiscernible] Olive Garden in the future. Diane Geissler : Okay. I think part of the previous plan was that you would do it on a geographic basis, so that the consumer would see the new plan at sort of all of the local restaurants? Sounds as if it will be more kind of picking shoes in terms of what marketplace you go into? Is there a way we should be thinking about, in terms of -- like the number of units, total that need to be remodeled and how that might be staged over time and then how do you deal with sort of consumer confusion, as the restaurants look vastly different than what they have looked previously? Gene Lee : I think the plan still is to do this by market, and each market has different needs and it depends on how many Revitalias we have in certain markets versus farmhouses. So I think that, there is a lot of efficiencies by doing the refreshes market-by-market, we can put one team in there to manage the process. So I would look for it to still be done on a market-to-market basis. As we look forward, we haven't really determined what the pace will be. We want to get some more -- continue to get learnings from this, and I think Olive Garden of the future, down and up in operating, and we get the inspiration from that. I think we will be in a better position to lay out exactly how we are going to move forward, refreshing these Revitalia restaurants. Diane Geissler : Okay, great. Appreciate the additional detail. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara Senatore : Thank you very much. One question and then a follow-up if I may. You talked about beef favorability in 2016, and certainly 2017. One of the things I think we have noticed is that, the whole steak category has been quite strong, and it seems to be correlated with how much inflation we have seen in beef prices, just because the relative value versus grocery stores has gotten so much better. Maybe, can you give a little bit of historical perspective, is that the case, and I guess if so, as you look out to beef disinflation or deflation, would you expect to see potentially moderating topline, but better margins? Gene Lee : Sara, I am not sure I am going to subscribe to -- as the beef markets come back, we are going to have some top line pressure. I do think we are going to have some margin improvement with that. I think overall, the steakhouse category from a value standpoint has done a better job than the bar and grill and some of the other full service dinner houses, with the overall value equation. I think its something that over time Olive Garden had struggled with the price point for an entr\u00e9e without protein, versus a protein centric entr\u00e9e that a steakhouse restaurant is selling; and that was one of the real reasons we went back to [indiscernible] at $9.99. We felt we had to have something that competed effectively against the steakhouse category. And so, when I think about steakhouse, I think that there is a consumer out there that's a little financially healthier, that is opting into the steakhouse experience, because of the quality and the value that you're getting in that experience. I think that's what's driving that category right now. I think we have done a better job in the steakhouse category with culinary invention and creating overall value to the consumer. Sara Senatore : And so, in that context, you mentioned needing to get volumes higher. But to your point, the category has actually been -- LongHorn in particular, and the category generally has done a good job. What else can be done than -- to grow volumes, given that the environment actually seems pretty salutary at this point for steakhouses? So can you just talk a little bit about, when you look at it -- the value proposition could be better still, is it the brand messaging isn't perfect yet, the focus on getting volumes higher. Clearly the right one, but given that the performance actually has been very good, I am just trying to figure out, what are the levers that you have to pull? Gene Lee : When we think about LongHorn, the issue is a little bit more geographic than overall brand. We have -- well LongHorn has a dominant market position and has a lot of legacy, we have had strong average unit volumes, we have had a little bit more growth in those markets. What's weighing on LongHorn today, is some of the newer development that has happened over the last couple of years. And longhorn has a history of taking a little bit longer to breaking in new markets and for the consumer to really understand the value equation of that brand. And so, the big challenge for LongHorn right now, is effectively competing in marketplaces, where there is a third or fourth steakhouse in the market. And our ramp up time is taking longer than we would like. But in our heritage market, where we have got a strong foothold, we have -- our average unit volumes are where they need to be and the margins for that business are where they need to be. So LongHorn is more about really the geographic challenges we have, as we have been growing the brand. Sara Senatore : Great, understood. And if I may, just one quick follow-up for Jeff; we talked about moderating margin expansion, you and I have talked about some real supply chain expertise, now that you have been there a bit longer. Are there any particular areas you could talk about, what the opportunities look like to you? Jeff Davis : I would like to just go back to the fact that, one of the opportunities we have is to leverage our scale. And as we think about how we continue to look to our supplier base, to go out and continue looking at our contracts and using that scale to bring better costs to our overall organization. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets. Andrew Strelzik : Hi, good morning everyone. I am wondering how you are thinking about kind of the multiyear growth profile of the business going forward? And given the stabilization and operational improvements that you have seen, are you getting more comfortable with potentially talking about longer term metrics and targets going forward? And if not, why not? Gene Lee : I think that's a really good question. We are really focused right now on two things, improving the execution of our brands, and then secondarily, completing the REIT spin. I think once we get the REIT spin behind us, we will look at where we are as a company, and determine -- and look at where we are as a company, but also look at the overall operating environment, and determine what our longer term sales and EPS targets are, as we move forward for the organization. We believe -- as we look at this today, we have made tremendous progress in the last year; and once we look at our opportunity today, we believe that, there is a chance for us to increase new restaurant growth into 2017 and 2018, and from there, be able to really determine what our long term EPS targets would be. We need to fully understand what the capital structure is going to be, and how we are going to use our cash flow to drive shareholder value. Andrew Strelzik : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk Management. Howard Penney : Hi. Thank you very much. I have two questions, the first one is on the Olive Garden assets. The phrase or the word refresh has a different connotation to it than remodel. It\u2019s kind of a softer term if you will, and maybe express a little less urgency. And I was wondering if the momentum that you're seeing in the business. If I am reading that correctly, the momentum you're seeing in the business, less of a need to remodel the stores, as much as you did sort of the last two or three years? Thanks very much. Gene Lee : Howard no, I don't think its changing the sense of urgency. I think where we are at, is we want to make sure if we are going to invest this capital to refresh, remodel, whatever we want to call it. We want to make sure it is, first and foremost, it is the appropriate amount. Second, it\u2019s going to have the desired outcome that we wanted to have. And from there, we have to pace it and we have to ensure that we continue to improve and evolve with current learnings on how to make these investments more valuable to us. What we want to guard against, is designing a look and a feel and rolling it out, taking two or three years to do that, and you get to the end of year three and realize what you were rolling out, really isn't where you need to be today. And so our proponent of -- more of this evolving rolling refresh over time, and using your current knowledge to make those dollars work as hard as they possibly can, at the time you're making the investment. I think it will just be wrong to lock in on a certain look and feel and just roll it out to 300 restaurants and try to go as fast as you possibly can. I want to get into the system, where we are rolling in an X number of refreshes every single year. Howard Penney : Thank you. And then just hanging on to that last question about longer term target. I assume Gene, as you took over the role as CEO, you made a presentation to the board as to a three to five year plan, as to where you saw the business. And I was wondering in that plan, if you presented long term targets and growth in profitability and revenues and if you could share what those targets were? Thank you. Gene Lee : Well yes Howard, I did present a longer range plan and potential for the company. But at this point in time, the pending spin and where we are at. Not at the point, where we want to give out our long range targets and I will commit to the investment community, that we will get those out in the next three to six to nine months, on what we think this business can achieve. But I want to get through this spin and understand where we are post spin, and determine what the opportunity for Darden is moving forward. Howard Penney : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Your line is open. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? Gene Lee : Yes Priya. Unidentified Analyst : Yes? Okay, great. Thank you so much for taking the question. This is actually Diana Chu [ph] on for Priya. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the consent solicitation for the 35 and 37 and speak to where you are in that process? Thank you. Bill White : Yes Diana, this is Bill White. Yes the update we would tell you is, we did not get consent for the modest increase we were seeking for the covenant basket size. But as we have said previously, that was not a condition to pursuing the real estate transactions, where we are marching forward on. So really with some pretty minor modifications in those plans, we are fully covenant compliant. We simply don't have the extra room we were hoping to accommodate for future transactions, whether they be the -- roughly 80 or so properties, the simple properties left behind or others from future acquisitions. 20 years is a long time, but we are perfectly comfortable moving forward with our consent. Unidentified Analyst : I see. Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you so much. If the question was on labor, Gene, I think you touched on it a couple of different way of saying, you think you perhaps have an opportunity, just be more efficient at the store level. But you are acknowledging the reality that, wage rates are increasing in various parts in the United States, I guess anywhere from moderately to very significantly. So just asking about your experience, having lived through hot labor markets and changing labor markets before in the past. Does it make sense for Darden to lead by example or just lead from an employee perspective and start to change the way that employees are compensated or what their incentive structures may be? And especially as we think about maybe some significant cost of goods sold or leased, perhaps into 2016, reinvest even more in labor than maybe some of your peers are, to differentiate the business through that extent? Gene Lee : I want to say, we believe that our employment proposition today is really strong. We compete for talent every single day. And when you look at where the average Darden employee is today, it\u2019s approximately $15 an hour, which is double the federal minimum wage. We think that through a few avenues. Our employment proposition is just incredibly strong. We have a great opportunity for employees -- all employees that grow into management. Last year, we promoted 1,000 ROIT [ph] team members into management. We have programs that allow our team members to move up to the restaurants. Our team members to go cross-brand, if they think -- after they become proficient, and maybe in a casual environment, they can move to a more polished or even a fine dining environment. And so, as we look at this today, we keep coming back to -- there are so many things that we do for Darden team members, and it\u2019s a compelling proposition. Our turnover rates are 20% lower than our competition. We continuously win best employment practices for the majority of our brands. We think that our employees are really in a good position, and we are going to do what we need to do, to ensure that we have the best talent at all levels in our organization, and that will be -- we will be at the forefront of that. And we believe today, we are getting the best talent. John Ivankoe : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo. Michael Walsh : Good morning. Michael Walsh filling in for Todd. Appreciate you getting us in. Just another couple quick bondholder questions. I think in the past, you have noted that you like to maintain an investment grade profile and we got a number of months here before the REIT transaction takes place, at which time, you'd look at your capital structure. But do you foresee, within that capital structure, still maintaining investment grade profile, and with that, is there any type of credit metrics that you use, whether its at least adjust the leverage target that you would manage to? Bill White : Yes Michael, this is Bill; just to address the last part of your question first, I think you hit the nail on my head. The least adjusted -- really at least adjusted debt to EBITDA is probably one of the more key metrics we focus on and we'd be targeting in the range of 2.5 times or less, and certainly the agencies are quite comfortable that where we are moving in that direction is -- if not neutral, a positive to the credit profile. So maintaining, preserving, and solidifying the investment grade credit profile is a priority. Michael Walsh : Got you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : At this time, I am showing no additional questions. Kevin Kalicak : All right. So I think we are done. Thank you for your questions. I want to remind you that we expect to release our second quarter results on Friday, December 18, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you all and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. That does conclude the call at this time. All participants may disconnect.",

We plan to release fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings on Tuesday, April 5th before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, following prepared remarks from Gene and Jeff, we will take your questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. This morning we want to take time to discuss several things with you. First I'll review our quarterly performance and brand highlights and Jeff will provide more detail on our financial results from the second quarter, as well as our dividend and share purchase plans and I'll provide an update on our outlook for the fiscal year. And then I will close by sharing our framework for long-term value creation. Before we get started, I want to note one point that will help frame our performance. It's important to look at our same-restaurant sales performance on a comparable calendar basis. Due to the 53rd week last year and the shift in key holidays such as ThanksGiving moving from Q3 last year to Q2 this year, we reported same-restaurant sales on both a fiscal and a comparable calendar basis. Our brand significantly outperformed the industry during the quarter with strong same-restaurant sales growth of 2.9% on a comparable calendar basis and positive same-restaurant sales at each of our brands. We also added 14 net new restaurants which take into account to six LongHorn San Antonio restaurants that were part of the Four Corners Property Trust spin off. Second quarter adjusted margins showed strong improvement for the fifth consecutive quarter and benefited from both our top-line performance and ongoing disciplined cost management that is focused on non-guest facing elements of our business. The momentum we have built at Olive Garden continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew at 2.8% on a comparable calendar basis outperforming the industry by more than 300 basis points. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of growth. In addition, same-restaurant\u2019s traffic was positive on a comparable calendar basis. These results are reflection of our continued focus on operating great restaurants along with developing relevant, integrated marketing initiatives that reach our guests more effectively. Equally as important is the work we're doing to evolve how our loyal guests experience Olive Garden. During the quarter, we completed the system-wide roll out of table top tablets, which enhances the guest experience. Additionally, we continued our emphasis on OG-to-go sales which addresses a key niche state for convenience. Overall, we have seen fantastic results with a two year growth rate of more than 30% for OG-to-go. Finally, the team at Olive Garden continues to make great strides on culinary innovation, filling the core menu pipeline with a number of exciting new dishes that will roll out in the coming months. LongHorn maintained strong top-line momentum during the quarter and delivered solid profit growth. Same-restaurant sales grew 3.6% on a comparable calendar basis, outperforming the industry by more than 400 basis points and same-restaurant traffic was positive on a comparable calendar basis. LongHorn's results reflect a relentless focus on in-restaurant execution. That focus was strengthened by continuous simplification of the core menu, which allows our restaurant teams to execute against menu items with the highest guest preference. LongHorn also continues to benefit from the success of its You Can't Fake Steak marketing campaign which drove excitement for two compelling promotions that featured popular steaks at a great value. Turning to our specialty restaurants, all five brands had same-restaurants sale growth on a comparable calendar basis, led by Bahama Breeze at 5.8% and Seasons 52 at 3.8%. The specialty restaurants brands remain focused on culinary innovation, providing unique guest experiences and creating personal connections with their guests, which was further enhanced by the launch of new Web sites at each of our brands. These five strong brands continue to perform well and increase share, as consumer demand grows from our polished dining experiences. Before I turn it over to Jeff, I would like to briefly comment on wage rates. There are two key factors at play, steak and local mandated minimum wage increases and the improving employment environment. First, we expect the mandated minimum wage increases which are set to take effect on January 1st will inflate our hourly wage rates by 1.2%. Each of our brands will be impacted differently based on the geographic footprint. The overall impact to Darden is mitigated compared to others even our geographic diversity. Second, low unemployment is creating increase competition for talent, and we expect it will put additional pressure on wage rates in the future. We continue to be well-positioned to deal with this competitive labor market given our strong employment proposition and industry-leading retention rates. Further, we will continue to find productivity enhancements through our simplification erforts that will enable us to effectively manage future wage inflation. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Davis : Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.54, an increase of $0.26 or 93% versus last year's adjusted EPS. Key drivers of the $0.26 of EPS growth were continued improvement in core operating performance which accounted for $0.27. Favorable settlement of legal matters added $0.05 and is reflected in G&A. This was mostly offset by $0.04 of expense from three restaurant impairments. Additionally, this quarter we began realizing the effects of real-estate transactions, resulting in $0.02 of net incremental expense. Adjusted EBIT margin expanded 300 basis points in the quarter, principally from leveraging positive same-restaurant sales, commodities deflation driven by dairy and sea food. Accelerated progress with cost and expense reduction initiatives and reduced marketing spend in line with annual expectations. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was a credit of 23%. This was driven by the discreet tax impact of expenses incurred related to the execution of our real-estate transactions. On an adjusted basis, our effective tax rate was 22.9% for the quarter. Before reviewing our performance by segment, I want to point out that fiscal 2016 segment profit now includes incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the completed real-estate transactions. While the benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. Starting with Olive Garden, Olive Garden's segment profit grew $16.6 million, excluding the incremental rent from the real-estate transactions segment profits grew $23.9 million or 17%. This growth was primarily the result of leveraging positive same-restaurant sales, dairy and sea food cost deflation and continued progress on cost reduction initiatives. LongHorn segment profit increased $12 million, excluding the incremental rent from the real-estate transactions. Segment profit grew $13.4 million or 31%. The growth was supported by leveraging positive same-restaurant sales, improved cost of sales and lower marketing expense. Fine dining segment profit grew $1.3 million by leveraging positive same-restaurant sales and then finally in other business, segment profit grew more than $9 million this quarter. Reduced food costs and improves labor productivity at Seasons 52 and the Yard House were the key drivers to this quarter\u2019s segment profit growth. Turning to our real-estate plan. We completed the spent off of Four Corners Property Trust. Additionally, we finalized the sell lease back of our restaurant support center in Orlando and an additional 15 restaurant sell lease backs, bringing the total to 62 with two more properties remaining. We received net proceeds of approximately $631 million related to these transactions. These proceeds in addition to existing cash on our balance sheet were used to retire approximately $1 billion in total debt. $270 million was retired by the end of the quarter and $743 million was retired after the close of the quarter. This strengthens our balance sheet and credit profile and is expected to position us within our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA targeted leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times. For fiscal 2016 we expect to realize a net $0.08 per diluted share from net incremental expenses related to the real-estate transactions. On an annualized basis, we anticipated net incremental expense from the real-estate transactions to be approximately $20 million to $25 million. This includes approximately $130 million to $135 million from incremental rent and other taxes, a $60 million reduction in depreciation and $50 million in interest savings. Completing our strategic real-estate plan was a key part of our commitment to deliver value to shareholders and given the current trading multiples of both companies, we believe we have created significant value. And in addition to providing an approximate $7.00 stock dividend value from the spinoff of Four Corners the Board of Directors declared a regularly quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per common share this quarter. This represents a 14% increase compared to the minimum post-spin dividend of approximately $0.44 per share which was disclosed on November 9th. Darden\u2019s Board of Directors also authorized a new share repurchase program. Within this program the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock. This combined with our dividend program demonstrates our confidence in the strength of our business and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. For fiscal 2016 we are increasing our outlook for same-restaurant sales to a range of 2.5% to 3% and we are increasing our outlook for adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $3.25 to $3.35. This includes approximately $0.08 per diluted share of net incremental expense related to the real-estate transactions. Finally, we are raising the range for our adjusted effective tax rate to 23% to 25% to reflect a higher earnings outlook. We are not in the place to practice of giving quarterly guidance, but we do expect Q3 and Q4 EPS to be similar not unlike what we saw last year once you adjusted for the 53rd week. In addition to improvements in our core operating business, we continue realize savings from specific cost expense initiatives. We are on-track to deliver an additional $30 million to $35 million of savings from our previous outlook of $50 million to $55 million for a total of $80 million to $90 million for fiscal 2016. To-date, we have also identified savings of $30 million to $40 million in fiscal 2017 which will bring the total identified annualized savings to $145 million to $165 million which is $45 million to $55 million more than our previous outlook. And now I will turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks. Gene Lee : Thanks Jeff. The Board of Directors along with our executive leadership team has spent the last 12 months developing and implementing several strategic priorities, most significantly our comprehensive real-estate plan. Recognizing that our Company looks different today, I would like to spend a few minutes providing some perspective on our framework for long-term value creation. At its core our business is relatively simple and success for us is really predicated on two key areas. First, we must remain laser focused on executing against our operating philosophy at all times. This means relentlessly pursuing perfection across four key elements, culinary innovation and execution, attentive service, engaging atmospheres and integrated marketing. Second, we must support our brand by leveraging our four competitive advantages that drive sales and expand margins. These advantages include significant scale, expensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Doing so provides a value creating business model that generates significant and durable cash flow to fund growth and return capital to shareholders. Looking at our framework, our goal is to deliver a long-term total shareholder return of 10% to 15%, which we believe is a compelling and attractive investment for our shareholders. Achieving this type of return will come through a combination of our business performance and returning cash to our shareholders. Looking at the components of our long-term operating targets, we expect same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 3% driven by the strategy I just outlined, new restaurant growth of 2% to 3% and EBIT margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points by leveraging sales growth and our scale. This should result in approximately 7% to 10% growth in earnings after tax. It\u2019s important to remember that the growth in the individual components will vary year-to-year based on several factors, including but not limited to the macroeconomic environment and commodities. In addition, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders. We anticipate a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% $100 million to $200 million in share repurchases, which should deliver a return of cash in the 3 to 5% range. This framework is meant to be long-term in nature and we will continue to provide annual guidance as well. Before we move into Q&A, on behalf of the Darden Board of Directors I would like to conclude by acknowledging the 150,000 hard working women and men across our Company. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they create exceptional experiences and lasting memories for our guests. Thank you for all you do to make our Company successful, we've made great progress together and I look forward to making even more in the New Year ahead. Now we'll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Participants, please be advised to limit to one question and a follow-up question. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Company. You may ask your question. Brian Bittner : Thanks very much and congratulations on a great quarter, guys. A quick question on the reporting first, just if you could clarify this, so the profit leverage that you got this quarter, should we think of that as leverage you got on the fiscal comps or is that on the counter comp or maybe it doesn't matter, if you could clarify that? Gene Lee : Brian, it's on the fiscal comp. Brian Bittner : Okay, okay. I just want to go back to Olive Garden you know I realize that you guys really changed out the incentives for store level managers at the beginning of this fiscal year. Can you just talk about what it is that you exactly did there and how you think that may affect the business performance growth as we look forward? Gene Lee : Brian, what we did was we simplified the bonus program. The emphasis on our bonus programs have always been sales and profit growth but prior to what -- the big change was we really just simplified it and it's on a -- I would say the framework is on a 3%, 3% for the managers for what they grow same-restaurant sales year-over-year and then they get a percentage of the profit growth also. That is what we were doing in the past it was just much more complicated, today you can walk in the restaurant and the managers understand what their bonus program is, there's also a competitive component of the program today that\u2019s really helpful is that we are basically ranking the profit performance of every restaurant and the ones who are at the top-end of that curve will get a kicker in their bonus. So there's competition amongst the general managers in the system. Brian Bittner : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Brett Levy : Good morning everyone, if you could do me a favor and just talk a little bit about where you are in terms of unit extension, remodels, refreshes, what do you think you can still do for this year, next year and what kind of sales lifts we should expect? Gene Lee : Yes I'm not going to comment on -- I will give guidance in June for the following year but let me give you an update on where we are in the Olive Garden remodels. To-date we've remodeled 32 locations at various investment levels. The lift is about 5% in guest counts. We have 13 more that we're going to do in '16. I think the team has done an exceptional job of developing different packages for different sites. We're still reading some of the last work that we've done, but we're optimistic about the lift that we're going to get from these remodels in the future, so it\u2019s been successful, we've done -- one of the thing that's been helping us is that we've gone in to 40 restaurants and we've just refreshed the bar and spent minimum money. However we're getting a 1% lift just from that exercise as we turn that area into a much more functional area. Today in some of our older restaurants it's not as functional and Dave and his team have done a great job of going in, putting in some tables and just making a much more comfortable place to enjoy an Olive Garden meal. Kevin Kalicak : Any other questions Brett? Brett Levy : Oh I'm sorry I was not doing a -- I wasn't going to do a follow-up. Any thought on, no I guess we'll leave it at that, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh of Stephens Inc. You may ask your question. Will Slabaugh : Yes, thanks guy. Just curious if you could speak to the cost savings you mentioned earlier and the addition. So can you remind us now of the general buckets and the size of those buckets for the savings that are going to fall out given the update you made this morning? Gene Lee : Yes, thanks for your question, the size of the buckets and once again we've increased for the quarter going from -- actually for the year going from 50 million to 55 million, we have increased that to now $80 million to $90 million, that\u2019s about a $35 million increase. The buckets that we talked about was basically food and beverage also in our restaurant expenses and G&A. We did not necessarily break that down if you will in between the three. But what you can see from of the presentation of we have included and I would refer you to may be take a look at that. It's about now -- about a third, a third, a third as to how we see those savings actually being realized during the course of fiscal \u201916. Will Slabaugh : Got it, that's helpful and a quick call, if I could, just given on what we've heard from some of your peers and seen from some industry data, in that you have concepts reaching across the full-service spectrum, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how the restaurant consumer is behaving right now. Are there any notable changes to consumer behavior through particular purchases or [indiscernible]. Clearly you are outperforming the industry. So I'm just curious if you have any sort of maybe your rationale for why the industry has seen some slowing here recently? Gene Lee : Yes I would and this is Gene, I would say that the consumer has been consistent quarter-to-quarter in our observations it is still buying a little less on daily using the whole menu. They are buying appetizers, they are buying deserts, they are buying high value items we are seeing a lot of migration into the 9.99 Cucina Mia in Olive Garden. But an interesting dynamic with that is that over 50% of people that buy that item will add on to it and turn it into a 12.99 entre by adding some protein. So we have seen consistency, obviously I am aware of the slight turndown in the NAP track numbers in Black Box, I really don\u2019t have an idea of what caused that. But I would say that it deals from our standpoint it feels pretty good out there right now. And I like the environment we are operating in and I think the consumer is going to value but value today isn\u2019t all about price. We are seeing consumers do some things in LongHorn where we have got actually we have increased the size of our filet we have got a 10 ounce filet on the menu that\u2019s doing really-really well. And the -- because the consumer is rewarding high quality execution and so we will continue to monitor, but right now I am pleased with how the consumer is behaving in our restaurants. Will Slabaugh : Okay thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. You may ask your question. Matt DiFrisco : Thank you. One quick question on the commentary from the call, the script, as well as just your outlook for some potential future business opportunities, one on the marketing side, it sounds like across the board the brands pulled back a little bit on marketing dollars in the quarter and helped out margins. Is that an ongoing thing in the initiative to sort of use marketing dollars more efficiently or is it a reflection that perhaps the marketing dollars are shifting to more efficient, cheaper ways such as mobile apps and mobile advertising or digital rather than TV? And then I do have a follow-up question. Gene Lee : Okay, Matt. What I would tell you is that the savings in advertising dollars in the quarter was strictly at LongHorn and they were driven by moving from national cable strategy back to a spot market strategy. From immediate standpoint, we are being much more effective with that, we have eliminated a lot of waste that was in the national cable buys and that\u2019s a -- we are into it just about a second or third quarter on shifting on this strategy. So that\u2019s the primary reason for the savings. Following up a little bit on what you are telling but we are migrating dollars from traditional television media into digital and we have continued to find that to be affective. But we are also continuing to find the television advertising is affective. You did see some choppiness in Olive Garden sales to relative quarter as we have started to play a little bit with reduction in TRPs or moving our TRPs from different points in the promotional cycle to understand, if they are really driving consumer traffic and through that promotion we found out at the television is still of a very-very effective medium to drive traffic. And lastly on digital, digital is very effective so we can get very targeted and we can measure that. So that\u2019s why the advertising expenses were down 40 basis points in the quarter. Matt DiFrisco : Okay, and then shifting gears to Olive Garden or OG on the go there. Where do you think that could be -- top out as a percentage of sales, if you have sort of a goal in mind as well? I mean is this an avenue that maybe you would test delivery with potentially third-party sources out there on a broader more approachable basis than just some select opportunities? Gene Lee : Yes, good question. We started off this OG to go journey thinking that 20% was going to be a great target, 20% of over 4 million is a heck of a business inside an Olive Garden. We are over 10% now and growing rapidly. We are very in tune to what\u2019s going on with third-party delivery and we are studying that very-very closely. As you know we are also testing our own delivery for large catering parties and having some success with that but we are monitoring the situation we believe that there is going to be some sort of massive change in third-party delivery. There are a lot of people that are playing in that environment today and we are looking for the partner with who we think is going to be the clear winner. But that is going to be an avenue for continued growth in Olive Garden. And I want to keep reiterating the fact that the type of food the cuisine that we serve in Olive Garden travels extremely well and we follow back up with our consumers who use an Olive Garden to go experience, this satisfaction level is very-very high. And so we are excited about this business, our people are doing a great job. Matt DiFrisco : Excellent, good luck in the New Year. Gene Lee : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley of Bank of America. You may ask your question. Joseph Buckley : Thank you good morning. Just a follow-up on Matt\u2019s question, do you sense of how much third-party delivery is going on now in terms of your sales mix? Gene Lee : Yes and I would say 50% of our Olive Gardens are being covered by some third-party where it is a local deal but I am not sure it\u2019s as productive as it can be, I am not sure that we are a preferred provider in some of those arrangements and so we have got tests, we are working with Postmates, we are working with Google, Hoover is going to come in into play. We are working from a corporate standpoint at 50,000 feet here trying to determine where do we want to step a partnership and where are we\u2019re going to harvest, so how does this all play out. A fragmented system is not going to be the way to go, it\u2019s going to be some sort of national system, we can cover 70% or 80% of our Olive Gardens with one provider so that we can use our scale to drive the best possible financial outcome for both parties. Joseph Buckley : Okay, then Gene, the long-term a normalized guided I'd ago how you would characterize it for 7% to 10% can't remember now if it was EPS, I think it was EPS growth. Talk about the timeframe for that versus these terrific numbers you're putting up currently? Gene Lee : Joe, as we look at this portfolio today consider the operating we're using kind of the operating environment that we've operated in the last three years has kind of five that job. What is it that we can do over the next four to five years or so? What we think is available to ask you might we think we can drive earnings after-tax from 7% to 10% and we're going to drive that suit same restaurant sales growth. We think we have the portfolio gives us 2% to 3% new unit growth that we think we can leverage margins anywhere from 10 basis points to 40 basis points depending on what's going on in the environment. We think we can supplement that with a dividend that 50% to 60% of our earnings in a significant share repurchase program to get us into that 10% to 15% EPS growth. And we think with the portfolio we have today the environment that we're operating in our brands we have some really strong brand that are really well positioned. And when you look back over time when you look back over the last 10 years Olive Garden has outperformed not track by close to 20%. Over the last seven years old one is outperformed Track by over 20% so we really strong brands. We think we can compete in any type of economic environment going to use our scale and are insights to give our brands and advantage in the marketplace. So we think this is a good framework is how we're describing it as a framework. We will continue to give and provide yearly guidance and so we're focused and we believe this is a good framework for us. Joseph Buckley : Okay that\u2019s helpful thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line John Glass of Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. John Glass : Thanks good morning. First off, if I could just come back to this quarter in the beat maybe it's a two-part about one is relative to expectations when you the gap on the most and I'm asking on the context offs G&A a court G&A specifically seem to be significantly lower when you string of the one-time items in your adjustments year at 4.4% of sales so I think would suggest a $70 million something which is materially lower than the last quarter and also a year ago. Is that the now ongoing run rate of G&A or where there some one-time items in that were seasonality that affected it? Jeff Davis : So a couple of things going on with G&A this particular quarter, first off as we had mentioned earlier we had the legal settlement that added approximately $0.05 to G& A. We also would have had as a relates to those impairments offset by $0.04 but that's in a separate line item the G&A rate that we are seeing right now is where we would believe we start to moderate to through the end of the year. John Glass : And I am sorry, the adjusted 4.4%, that would exclude legal settlement or did it not? Jeff Davis : That did not. I'm sorry the 4.4% was net of the $0.05 of legal settlement. John Glass : Got it, okay, so it could be higher in the future, and then on the capital structure side of the business, you had mentioned on a rent adjusted basis you were kind of in a range you were comfortable with. Can you talk about your willingness to use debt in the future? Does your share buyback the you announced today assume just using free cash from the cash from operations or leverage in the future? How do you think about capital structure going forward? Jeff Davis : I think in the near-term we're going to use free cash flow to do as share repurchase. We will continue to look at the capital structure going forward. Right now our objectives is to firmly get in between the two is to firmly get in between the 2% to 2.5% adjusted debt-to-EBITDA and we're really focused on maintaining our investment grade credit profile. John Glass : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Robert Baird. You may ask your question. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Gene, just a couple of questions, first, maybe on your outlook for the second half raising the comps guidance for this year seems like you're feeling very good about the trajectory of the business, but that being said, it looks like the comparisons on an absolute and relative basis start to get a little tougher. So maybe frame up your thoughts on your confidence level and in achieving that implied second half guidance in light of the more difficult comparisons? Gene Lee : Yes I think the confidence comes from the momentous we have in the business. When we look at what's going on in Olive Garden between the promotional schedule that we have coming, the value and the feedback that were getting from consumers, the trajectory in the to go business, we believe that Olive Garden is set up and has done a tremendous amount of work over the last year to really position that brand to be able to compete effectively. We think that we're getting more effective in our digital marketing efforts. We're much more segmented and how we're talking to our consumer. We think we've got relative messaging out there, and we just believe that this momentum will continue into the back half of the year is the environment stays the way it is right now. We really think one of the big changes that we made was anchoring every menu with a $9.99 price point at lunch and excuse me $9.99 at dinner and $6.99 at lunch and that provides our guests are looking for value the every day option to come to Olive Garden and it's a full meal at a price that is a great value and one that's extremely competitive in the casual dining segment. And Longhorns got some great momentum to what I think that business is really focused on improving the overall experience and we continue to make subtle improvements to our menu. We've simplified. We've gone from 125 menu items back down to 100. We're focused on moving a lot of high-volume items and doing it very-very well. We're confident not overconfident but we believe that our hard work is starting to play forward and we've got momentum. The thing that I've been think a lot of you over time is when you get one is a dozen people in the Olive Garden system trying to do the same think they create great dining experiences and that creates great feelings and communities. Olive Garden right now feels as though it's very relevant with the consumer. David Tarantino : Thanks, and thank you. And then a separate question. On the long-term value creation framework the unit growth requires a step up in the number of openings and I was wondering if you could comment on which brands do you think are really going to drive up the step up as you look at the next couple of years? Gene Lee : I think we're going to get back on a path where we're opening between somewhere between 8 to 12 Olive Garden's eight years of that will be a big boost to our numbers. Olive Garden still an incredible investment from a new restaurant perspective. There will be some cannibalization but we think Dave and the team have a strategy to identify trade areas that could support and Olive Garden but without so much cannibalization that can't make the returns work is so we think that we could do there. Obviously were going to continue to push on Yard House and we think LongHorn to get back up to the double digits also and so with those types of new restaurant development, we can firmly be in that 2% to 3% range. David Tarantino : Great that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. You may ask your question. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great thank you. Two questions, one theoretically if you look at of the next 12 months seems that were talking about higher labor costs presumably offset by lower commodity costs. I know over the past few years perhaps most would agree that that was the reverse just wondering which is preferential when you think about it as an operator, you prefer the outlook you have going for versus what you had before commodity me just in the context of your ability to price to offset it would seem like might affect great opportunity to price of the commodity inflation less opportunity do so labor that I'm just wondering how you think about the dynamic of the two of them? Gene Lee : Good question, Jeff. First they want to clarify that at this point in time, we are not seeing a have a lot of wage rate completion in our direct labor is actually less than it was last to what you're seeing a labor costs is bonus payments this year are up for our managers so I think about the dynamics that you outlined which I think are really a good way to describe the situation that our operating in historically when there has been wage pressure and wage growth, that has been good for the demand of the casual dining restaurant business. What we tried to request variables back, wage growth is much more favorable than discretionary income. And so that in environments where we've seen significant wage growth in casual dining, we've been in environments where we've had stronger demand. And so that's been a more preferable environment then having food inflation and not having wage growth. So I guess the crux of your question is which environment what I personally prefer to compete in is the environment that we are in today. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got you, and just as a follow-up that ties into the cost savings I know you mentioned some of the wage rate inflation. Despite you can Medicaid the cost savings initiatives and I think it's quite impressive that even for this fiscal year you raise your cost savings from 50 to 55 to 8290 where halfway through the year it seems like a big increase that I know you had that chart that shows that they third a third a third between the three components but is there any meaningful bucket. It's just a price that you can see such a big increase what's been the biggest driver to raise not only this year's but effectively you not raise your cumulative numbers pretty meaningfully. Looks like there are just a couple years are you guys are thinking about 59 does camel to our talking about North of $150 million cumulative? Gene Lee : Jeff, the dynamic there is what's happening is our action capturing some costs quicker than we thought we would. We've had incredible relationship between the supply chain and operations. They have partnered very effectively to move these costs forward into this year and additionally what we've done is we've identified additional costs in the last quarter that we've been able to talk on to \u201917. For me, what's really impressive is the job that both teams our supply chain and our operations teams have done to be able to implement these effectively at a pace that we did think that we could get to and so that's what's really happening here. We're pulling forward and we've identified new ones. So it really wasn't new cost saves that were identified that were pulled into \u201916 they were identified for \u201917. We pulled them for but subsequently we've identified additional once were \u201917. Everything that we're doing I want to reiterate this everything that were doing as transparent to the guest and that every conversation we have around some sort of cost save is the first thing we ask is how does it affect the guest and if it affects the guest comments off the table. So this is all stuff that's not affecting our guest in the guest experience. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got you, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner of UBS. You may ask your question. Keith Siegner : Thank you and happy holidays everybody. Just a follow-up on that are one of the best questions so we have the wage inflation should be better for demand about the pricing piece of it though right so Olive Garden has been a roughly 1% pricing for the last two quarters a little below the prior trend LongHorn actually is a little puppy trend with a 4Q and one qubit now running in the low twos pulling all these pieces together, how do you think about the pricing? And I asked because one of the most frequent questions we've been getting is, is the industry at risk of losing pricing momentum as we head into next year? So just pulling all of those pieces together how do you see pricing going for the brands and even for the industry? Thanks. Gene Lee : I think pricing in any competitive environment we're in pricing is going to be cautious. I think we need to continue to price at or below inflation but I think there is a couple of components the way we think about it. You've got to use price effectively on your core menu to help offset some of the inflationary costs you're facing. But how we introduce new products and what price points we introduce new products to create a mix is very, very important. We have been over time been able to use our menu mix as a lever to increase our pricing. As a pullback in some of the heavily discounted a lower price point promotions by moving up a dollar or two, you are effectively getting a positive menu mix begin not really increasing pricing for giving the consumer choice to purchase that whatever price point level they want to purchase that. And so I think as we move forward, I think there will be pressure on our ability to price. However, I want to come back to what I think is really important in our business which is execution at the restaurant level and if we create an environment where our executing our food, we've got great service and atmospheres a compelling, overall value will be defined by much more than price and we talk a lot about that organization. And that is that we're not going to compete just on price. We're going to create on creating a great experience and the better the experience, the more tolerance you have for pricing. And so that's that were thinking about a. We've got to continue to improve our experience so that we can price effectively and be able to still drive our top-line sales and driver guest counts. Keith Siegner : That\u2019s good perspective thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Greg Badishkanian : Hi good morning this is Greg on for Karen this morning. With tablets rolled out at Olive Garden do you have any data of how it might help serving your response rates maybe satisfaction scores or tablet versus non-tablet users check or the number of e-mail club sign ups? Gene Lee : Yes great question we are excited about what the team did to be able to get this rolled out as quickly as they did. This has been incredibly positive for our guests. Guest satisfaction scores are really high with people who use the tablet. The other thing and you mentioned it that\u2019s been very positive is the fact that the e-mail club sign-offs, we are getting 80% of the guests that interact with the device are signing up for the e-club and over half of those are new sign ups. So we continue to build this database that allows us to communicate more effectively with those guests. Game revenues have been stronger than we thought and our servers are embracing this as an enhancement to creating a better dining experience for the guest. But most of all I think as we have said that one of the biggest upside surprises of this was our ability to get instantaneous feedback on the servers\u2019 experience that that server is providing, it allows us to coach and help those servers become more effective. So Ziosk on our tabletop tablets has exceeded our expectations and now we have spent the last nine months working to get those on the table. Now the management team needs to develop plans to further enhance their productivity and how they create a better dining experience for the guests and how they merchandise on that device, how they advertise on that device and how they keep the games relevant and up-to-date so the consumer wants to interact with them. Greg Badishkanian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull of KeyBanc. You may ask your question. Chris O'Cull: Thanks good morning. I had a question regarding the long-term framework Gene should we assume there are no other strategic options that are being considered at this time such as brand divestitures? Gene Lee : No our primary focus right now is running the business and executing at a very high level and I am really proud of the work that the team has done over the past year. Our management team and our Board will sit down and regularly evaluate alternatives we have to manage our business more effectively and to be able to achieve our financial goals. But as we think about this framework this is within the current portfolio it\u2019s something else with the change we will adjust the framework. Chris O'Cull: Okay. Fair enough and then can you give us some more color on what future productivity enhancements you mentioned that you plan to implement to help mitigate wage inflation? Gene Lee : Yes it\u2019s going to be all based on simplification. I believe overtime our menus and process and procedures have just become too complex. And both Olive Garden and LongHorn have done a great job and initial efforts to continue to simplify but when I look at who I really admire in this business, it\u2019s folks who are -- have real simplified operations the execution level is designed in a way that simplified that allows for the product to be delivered at a really high quality level. And so we are going to continue to push to simplify our menus to ensure we have the right range of menu products on our menu. But more importantly behind that, that as we develop the recipes and we think about how we operate inside the restaurant, have we made them as simple as we possibly can while increasing the quality of the menu item itself. And I believe that's where this future productivity enhancements. Chris O'Cull: Okay, great and one last one. Jeff can you remind us what debt remains outstanding and the rates on each of those notes? Jeff Davis : Yes, the remaining debt would be approximately $450 million spread between two tranches of long-term debt, the 35 bonds being 150 million and the 37 bonds being roughly 300 million. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Ma'am you may ask your question. Sara Senatore : Thanks, just a couple of I think follow-ups. The first is on just overall competitive environment, it feels like what you're seeing is different than a lot of others and in particular we've heard some pretty big competitors say they're going to get more aggressive on value whether it's price point value or kind of bundled value. Have you seen that and has it affected your business at all, it certainly sounds like you don't think so but just trying to gauge whether it's already started manifested and you feel like you're inflated or not, you haven't yet seen what the, a big tick-up in aggressive kind of price and value competition. And then I have another follow-up on margins please. Gene Lee : Okay, Sara what I'm seeing or what we're seeing is that yes our competitor set is getting a little more competitive and going back to some of the tactics that were used three or four years ago with bundles, and we know what we're monitoring it, we're watching closely what others are doing obviously is they're watching what we're doing. But we're focused on value, just not price. And that's where we're having our most success right now and especially in Olive Garden we're able to offer our consumer great value and it starts with soup, salad and bread sticks. And I think that really creates a value gap and the consumer's telling us through our offers that they're not that interested in the bundles. We had actually an interesting dynamic in the fall where we never any possible and we actually saw Cucina Mia actually have a pretty good preference through that promotion when in fact we thought it was going to basically go to nothing and that tells us that the consumer is more interested in ordering what they want to order. They want to be able to customize their order versus being told this is what I have to order to receive value. And there's so much value on our menus. So we're monitoring it and we'll stay on top of it. Sara Senatore : Thank you, that's very helpful. And then on the margins, you know you\u2019d said you're capturing cost more quickly than you thought you would. Yet if I look at the restaurant margins they're largely in line with consensus maybe not with what you expected but the beat you know again seems to be below that line. So I guess that the two questions are, is the cost of it sort of incremental cost days is that more heavily weighted to the back half of your fiscal year, as opposed to what we've seen in this quarter and second are there inflationary pressures that you didn\u2019t expect that might be offsetting those incremental cost saves because again the restaurant margins look pretty consistent with what I think many of us thought they would be? Gene Lee : Yes a couple of things here Sara, first remember that we had rent in the restaurant expenses that wasn't planned to be there from the real-estate transaction which was a big offset to some of our restaurant expenses. We picked up 60 basis points in restaurant expenses throughout the quarter, we picked up 110 at the Food and Beverage line so there was some consolidation there and we're getting some pretty good savings in G&A so it's being spread amongst the buckets. The rent -- the restaurant expenses when you adjust for rent would be a lot more significant than 60 basis points. Sara Senatore : Okay, so it's not the case that these cost savings are going to be offset by unexpected inflation and I think many of us did adjust for rent so just trying to gauge whether anything else besides that may have been a headwind that sounds like you're pretty much able to benefit from the entirety of the cost saves that you're identified? Okay. Gene Lee : We're giving you on a cost save a net basis not what we are -- because we are investing some of this money back in fact into a savings back into the business but we're giving you a net number. Sara Senatore : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Penney of Hedgeye Risk Management. You may ask your question. Howard Penney : Thanks so much, I have two questions, one can you just comment on your process of a new unit openings relative to the prior regime and what kind of returns do you expect and I mean in the past obviously that didn't work out too well for them so just kind of your philosophy on returns and new units and that process going forward and then and to follow-up on a previous question about the portfolio, will you rule out making acquisitions to add to your portfolio? Thanks Gene Lee : Good morning Howard, our philosophy on new restaurants is that we want to exceed our cost of capital which we have as approximately 9%. We are looking at a risk adjusted return on investment I would say that from a process standpoint we have established the committee that oversees the investment in all new restaurant properties. I look at -- I personally look at every restaurant property that we are going to make an investment in. And then we talk about it with the brand presidents and our development department and we are using our collective knowledge of developing restaurants for 20-30 plus years to ensure we are making a best possible decision. More importantly on new restaurant performance, we have a detailed tracking methodology from month one on every new restaurant that we open and I get -- I personally get that report every 30 days to understand what the performance is and there is the appropriate pressure on our operating teams to ensure that these restaurants are performing at a high level. And so I think that\u2019s really what's different today lot more engagement at the senior levels, lot more follow-up and we are reacting quickly when they have a restaurant that is not performing. As of now all of our restaurants and all of our classes are performing above the required return on investment. As far as the portfolio question goes, as I have been saying we are not going rule out anything but - we will continue to meet with the management team and the Board and we will evaluate all of the alternatives that are there for us to create value for our shareholders. Howard Penney : Which includes potential acquisitions? Gene Lee : It will includes everything. Howard Penney : So can I Just sort of, just going back to the previous question about units, how was is it done in the past of just out of curiosity more than anything else? Gene Lee : And I am not much sure. I want to define the process in the past, I think what I would say it was handle a little bit more at the brand level than -- and it's still a brand level decision I am just heavily involved in. Howard Penney : Okay thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. David Palmer : The protein players include things that these costs are going to be going down for the next few years, one supplier was saying that it's going to be the most meaningful multi-year move in terms of the beef cycle since the early 90s what do you think this will mean for Darden does this mean that the supermarket becomes more competitive essentially with eating and there is more protein-oriented deals from competitors and it's all a little bit more of a nice side ultimately sales are less? Or do you think this is more of a tailwind for margins and Darden earnings ultimately? Thanks. Gene Lee : Good morning David. So here is what I think about where we are in the beef market, beef has -- the animal itself has been declining in price, middle meats continue to be strong, we haven't seen that much decline in the overall cost of the middle meat which you strips and aligns the short lines and such. We have seen some weakness in ground beef which is really good for the hamburger players. We do expect there to be some tailwinds, we do expect to be able purchase beef in a deflationary environment for the next couple of years, as the herds continue to build and the cycle starts to change. I don\u2019t believe that beef is going back to levels that it was at 10 or 15 years, I do believe it's coming down year-over-year. But beef is still going to be a very expensive commodity, in comparison to the other options. Now, does some of this beef get back in the retail maybe but I am not sure. I still believe that a steak, people come to a steak house because a steak house has the capability of preparing its steak in a way that they can't at home and they are much more comfortable making that purchase that more expensive purchase and trusting that experience to professionals who cook steaks every single day. So will there be a little bit more pressure from retail if this pulls back, yes however, I see this is a positive tailwind from primarily LongHorn and therefore a tailwind for Darden. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason West of Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Jason West : So Gene you had mentioned that you guys saw some choppiness during the quarter at Olive Garden as were generally testing some different levels of TV advertising, can you talk about what was going on there and what you learned from that? And was there a material change in the TV leaks during the quarter and how you are thinking about that going forward? Gene Lee : Yes a couple of things at play here. First of all, Never Ending Pasta Bowl started a couple weeks later on a calendar basis than it did at the prior year. We didn\u2019t heavy up as much on the TRPs on the front-end to see what would happen if we took a promotion that everybody knew and understand and we didn\u2019t load it up with TRPs. What we learned in that is that the TRPs still matter and taking off a promotion with a little up to heavy weight does get things going a little bit quicker. So we were trying to go in with a more balanced approach in a few less TRPs and try to switch some of that into digital. Digital, throughout the quarter, our digital efforts were much more targeted and one of the things that we are trying to do is we are trying to get into these shorter redemption periods to understand how quickly we can get a message out there and a get a consumer to act. The consumer dynamic is changing dramatically and how they use incentive to come in to the restaurant. It\u2019s getting at the point where if it has any age on it at all, it\u2019s forgotten. And so what you are seeing us try to do and understand is, if we put a message out for a couple of days and then we talk to a guest and we know this guest likes this offer what\u2019s the likelihood of them utilizing that offer. And we continue to learn and so when we talk about data insight, that\u2019s where we are really creating some great capabilities. Jason West : Okay that\u2019s really helpful. And then one other on, you guys have mentioned that you tried out have some bar remodels that were pretty minimal expense that had a nice lift on I guess 1% with some comps. Is that something you think you could move quickly on going forward and maybe would do a separate for the full remodel program or is it something that would be sort of a one-off here and there situation? Gene Lee : No .Great question Jason that is something that we believe that we can continue to do. We are not doing anything in these bar remodels that we would have to undo when we would go in and do more of a floor refresh in the restaurant. So it\u2019s just we have restaurants out there where that center dining area in the bar is just not very comfortable and the team can get in there for minimal amount of money make it much more comfortable to have a meal and it becomes very -- all of a sudden becomes very productive on the high volume nights. And so Dave and the team are going to continue to do some more of that here as we move into \u201917 and again I will give you much more guidance on that in June. Jason West : Great thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler of CLSA. You may ask your question. Diane Geissler : Good morning and thanks for the question. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the remodels and it\u2019s really from the perspective of capital allocation. So it sounds like you are planning to open more new units, increase your dividend, increase your share repo. So where does the investment behind remodeling fit within the overall capital plan and maybe you could just frame it up a little bit in terms of your how the costs I know you have different packages that you can utilize at different store basis but how we should be thinking about the range of potential spend on a per unit basis? Gene Lee : I will start with the range on a per unit basis. It\u2019s anywhere between 250 and 450 depending on the size and the age of the unit and it also has a little bit to do with once we start opening up walls and moving things around what we might find in some of these 20-30 year old restaurants. As we think about this in our capital plan, we have set on our slide in the deck we have got 145 to 170 designated this year for our refresh and our maintenance cap. We believe we have ample capital to be able to both increase new units slightly and continue to reinvest in Olive Garden over the next two or three years. And we will give you some more details in June on the exact cap expenses, capital expenses for fiscal \u201917. Diane Geissler : Okay great thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG you may ask your question. Peter Saleh : Great thank you. I just wanted to circle back on the tablets. A couple of things, are you seeing any throughput of benefit from the tablets of the some of the higher volume locations on Friday and Saturday night? Gene Lee : Yes good question we are seeing Peter we seeing six to seven minute decline in the overall table turn. So something that was a minute seven now down to a minute -- one hour and seven minutes and now down to an hour. So we are picking up seven minutes. Primarily that savings comes primarily on the backend. However as the consumer becomes more comfortable with it, it will pick sometime in the front end too. Peter Saleh : Excellent and then just the implementation of the tablet, is that helping to drive any of the cost savings that you are forecasting either later this year or into 2017? Gene Lee : No, it is service enhancement we are trying to improve the quality of the experience. Peter Saleh : Excellent thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Andrew Strelzik : Hi thanks for taking the question. We have seen on a two year basis the LongHorn traffic decelerate a little bit here and you've already even asked about a step up in promotional activity and the value equation at steakhouses lower beef prices, it doesn't sound like you think those components are really playing a role. So what would you attribute that to or do you think it's kind of much ado about nothing? Gene Lee : I do -- I think we've backed off a little bit on our lower price point promotions. We're trying to get back off the 11.99 six ounce top sirloin promotional activity. Some of that activity wasn't as profitable as you probably would have liked so I think it's -- in this business there's some slight pressure there but nothing to be concerned about. I think you've seen that in the margin improvement too as we back off some of that stuff. Andrew Strelzik : Got it, okay, great thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Anderson of Maxim Group. You may ask your question. Steve Anderson : Yes, I wanted to ask about any kind of regional discrepancies you saw in your data and I wanted to also point out the -- I guess the what you saw in the increase at Capital Grille probably less than maybe some of us are looking at and I just want to see if you see any broader trends in the higher end steakhouse category that points to deceleration in business trends. Gene Lee : Yes Stephen, we're seeing, good question, we're seeing some weakness in Texas in both Capital Grille and Eddie V's, some of our other competitors have noted. We've had in Cap Grille we've had a couple big restaurants that have had some significant competitive intrusion, we've also had some other onetime events that were significant in the quarter that won't happen again that affected same restaurant sales for Capital Grille. These brands are well positioned, they're executing at extremely high level and I'm confident that they will continue to take market share in the future. Steve Anderson : Right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick of Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Todd Duvick : Yes, good morning. Quick question for you on the balance sheet, you've been very busy there and have done a really nice job of taking down the debt. You do have two bonds outstanding with relatively high coupons and I'm just wondering are you considering liability management for that to potentially reduce your coupon, is that something that you're looking at. Jeff Davis : No, not at this time, we're not looking at doing anything additional to what we have already done. Todd Duvick : Okay. And then I guess just related to that, with the share buyback program that was announced today you do have an elevated cash balance as of the most recent quarter. Can you tell us and I think some of that was probably used to take down some of the debt. Is there a minimum cash balance that you like to run with to keep on hand for working capital purposes? Jeff Davis : As you mentioned yes, at quarter end we had a elevated cash balance and as I\u2019d mentioned we\u2019ve actually, surely after the quarter paid down approximately $740 million of additional debt, as relates to minimum cash balance we do take that into account as we think about running the business and that's in a range of approximately $100 million. Todd Duvick : That's helpful, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Joshua Long of Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question. Joshua Long : Great, thank you for taking my question. I appreciate all the color on a lot of the restaurant level initiatives that have been going on, a lot to get excited about there but I was curious maybe we could take a step back and talk about the opportunity for your branded products at the grocery level in the CPG category and maybe perhaps an update there or at least a recap in the opportunity to expand that into new products and your skews going forward? Gene Lee : Josh, we have a small presence in the CPG market primarily Olive Garden salad dressing, it's a strong performer and does very well, at this time we are not pursuing any other alternatives or options with CPG. Joshua Long : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, no question at this time. [Operator Instructions] Kevin Kalicak : Any more questions Gaby. Operator : There're no questions at this time. Gene Lee : All right, well thank you everyone for your participation in Darden's second quarter earnings conference call this morning. I want to remind you that we expect to release our third quarter results on Tuesday, April 5th before the marker opens with a conference call to follow, thanks again and happy holidays. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call, thank you all for joining, you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Hans. Good morning and welcome everyone. With me today is Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release, which was distributed earlier today and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliation of these measurements is included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and year end earnings on Thursday, June 30 before the market opens followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and brand highlights. Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results from the third quarter, as well as an update on our expectations for fiscal 2016 and then we will open the call for your questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am to have Rick with me this morning as our new Chief Financial Officer. Rick\u2019s extensive experience and proven track record of results leading finance, operations, IT and strategy during a 25 plus year career at Darden. In addition to his consulting experience with Bain & Company and the Parthenon Group make him uniquely qualified for this role. Also, I want to point out that just as we did last quarter, we reported same restaurant sales on both the fiscal and a comparable calendar basis. This morning, I will refer to the comparable calendar comps during my remarks. We had another solid quarter, with great same restaurant sales and significant operating margin improvements. Our operations focused philosophy continues to drive strong performance across our brands and we are gaining significant shares as a result. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.85 billion, a 6.7% increase from the third quarter last year. Each of our brands delivered strong same restaurant sales growth during the quarter and we added 7 net new restaurants. Olive Garden\u2019s positive sales and earnings momentum continued during the quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 4.9%, outperforming the industry, excluding Darden, by more than 600 basis points. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. In addition, same restaurant traffic was up 3% for the quarter. Key drivers of this performance include an improved guest experience delivered through proper staffing and the simplification of processes and procedures; culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, as seen with our successful flavorful pastas and Create Your Own Tour of Italy promotions; and continuing to meet our guests\u2019 needs for convenience, with the national launch of large party catering delivery. This is an enhancement of our successful OG To Go platform, which has experienced a 2-year growth rate of over 40%. Year-to-date, OG To Go sales represent 10.5% of our total sales. We are confident that our overarching strategy continues to be effective. Our focus on food, service and atmosphere, has improved the perceived value of the Olive Garden dining experience. We have anchored our lunch and dinner menus with compelling price points, $6.99 at lunch and $9.99 at dinner, which provides everyday affordability. This enables us to deliver promotional value with a wide range of price points. Olive Garden\u2019s relentless focus on delivering great guest experiences will allow us to further enhance our perceived value. This will continue to be the key to our ongoing strategy as we build on the momentum we are experiencing. LongHorn Steakhouse\u2019s sales momentum continued throughout the quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 2.7%, the 12th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry, excluding Darden, by over 400 basis points. Same restaurant traffic was slightly negative. However, our performance is well above the industry average. We pulled back on our price-pointed activity and optimized our media spend to be more effective, which contributed to LongHorn\u2019s 29% increase in segment profit and helped to offset the incremental expenses associated with the recently completed real estate transactions. Additionally, we will continue to invest in menu enhancements and reallocating labor as we further simplify operations and optimize our media spending. Finally, LongHorn continues to deliver communication that resonates with our guests through its You Can\u2019t Fake Steak advertising campaign, which was recognized in December when Ace Metrix named LongHorn, the Brand of the Year for casual dining for the second year in a row. Turning to our specialty restaurants, we saw positive same restaurant sales growth across all five brands, led by Bahama Breeze at 6.3% and Seasons 52 at 5.3%. Bahama Breeze continues to significantly outperform the casual dining industry as consumers are reacting favorably to operational improvements and culinary innovation. I am impressed with the progress the leadership team continues to make. Additionally, Seasons 52 had another strong quarter, making meaningful improvements to the business as we have temporarily slowed new restaurant growth, enabling us to improve our operational execution and evolve our menu. We are encouraged by the positive reaction our guests are showing to the changes we are making. We are excited about the momentum we have gained and we started to rebuild our pipeline for new restaurants. Yard House, the Capital Grille and Eddie V also had strong quarters. Although Eddie V\u2019s same restaurant sales were impacted by a significant slowdown in fine dining within Texas. Overall, I am pleased with our performance this quarter. Our strategy is working and we continue to grow market share, improve margins and return capital to shareholders. And with that, I will turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. It\u2019s great to discuss our business results with you today. Darden\u2019s third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.21, an increase of $0.22 or 22% higher than last year. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS growth is over 50%. While Gene referred to the comparable calendar of same restaurant sales to better highlight our quarterly sales trends, it was our strong fiscal same restaurant sales of 6.2% and the continued improvement in core operating performance that drove our earnings growth and more than offset the incremental ongoing real estate expenses this quarter. The strong cash generation inherent in our business model enabled significant return of capital to our shareholders. We paid $64 million in dividends this quarter. We also repurchased approximately $140 million of Darden stock. This leaves $360 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization that we announced in December. Third quarter reported earnings per share were adjusted by $0.34 of cost associated with the early retirement of debt this quarter and $0.03 of implementation cost associated with our strategic real estate plan. Separately, the ongoing impacts of the real estate transactions are now reflected in the financial results for the entire quarter, reducing pre-tax earnings by $6 million and earnings per share by $0.03. Looking at the specific impacts, we incurred incremental rent and other tax expenses of approximately $32 million. Depreciation and amortization was lower by $15 million and interest expense was [$1-11] [ph] million lower due to debt reduction of over $1 billion. As a result of this debt reduction, we now have $450 million of outstanding funded debt, with maturities due in 2035 and 2037. The company\u2019s adjusted EBIT margins increased by 200 basis points this quarter as a result of leveraging positive same restaurant sales, continued progress on our cost reduction initiatives and seafood, beef and natural gas deflation, all of which helped to more than offset the ongoing incremental real estate expenses I detailed a moment ago most of which is included in restaurant expenses. Before discussing our performance by segment, I want to remind you that the fiscal 2016 segment profit now includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transactions, whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. Additionally, the benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. Olive Garden segment profit of $220.1 million was $18.7 million higher than last year and continued their strong segment profit margins of 21.6%. In addition to Olive Garden, all of our segments significantly improved quarterly profit, led by LongHorn Steakhouse\u2019s segment profit growth of $19.1 million versus last year, which as Gene mentioned, is 29% higher than last year and segment profit margin increased almost 400 basis points to 20%. Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2016, we are increasing our range for same restaurant sales to 3% to 3.5%. We are also increasing our range for adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to $3.48 to $3.52. Given the strong performance this year, our annual effective tax rate is expected to be at the high-end of our previously communicated range of between 23% and 25%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we have begun to ramp up the development pipeline for future sites and we anticipate 24 to 28 new restaurant openings. We expect to complete at least 60 Olive Garden remodels with an investment of between $250,000 and $450,000 each. And we will continue our bar refresh program, completing up to 150 next year. The bar refresh investment of approximately $20,000 per restaurant significantly improves the utilization of our older Olive Garden caf\u00e9 and bar areas and is a component of our larger remodel package. We have seen a solid return on the remodel and bar refresh investments to-date. Additionally, to ensure all of our restaurants are well-maintained, we invest roughly $60,000 per year, per restaurant in annual capital spending. Total capital spending for 2017 fiscal is estimated between $310 million and $350 million, of which $110 million to $130 million is related to new unit openings and the remainder related to remodels, the bar refresh program, maintenance, technology and other spending. Additional guidance for our 2017 performance will be shared in next quarter\u2019s release and conference call in June. However, I would like to take this time to remind you of the long-term framework we have for value creation. Over time, we believe our business can deliver total annual shareholder returns of 10% to 15%, which is composed of earnings after-tax growth of 7% to 10%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 3%; new restaurant growth of 2% to 3%; and EBIT margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points, by leveraging sales growth and our significant scale. Additionally, given the strong cash generation of our business and the earnings growth expectations, we anticipate return of cash to our shareholders in the 3% to 5% range annually, consisting of a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% and share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million. We believe the 10% to 15% total shareholder return represents a healthy and attractive investment. Finally, I am excited to be speaking with you this morning. Darden has been a huge part of my life for over 25 years and I am humbled by the opportunity to serve as the CFO of this dynamic organization. I also want to share with you how I am approaching this role. First and foremost, my diverse experiences working within the brands, including my time and operations gives me a deep understanding of our restaurants and the ability to partner with the leaders in the business. Also my experiences away from Darden, as a management consultant, help me maintain a strategic and external focus to ensure that we are not overly insular. In this role, I will be focused on ensuring we leverage our significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and a disciplined capital allocation approach, ensuring that every dollar we spend will be a dollar worth spending to deliver on the long-term value creation framework I just reviewed with you. This role comes with the pleasure of developing strong relationships with our analysts and investors and I look forward to strengthening that relationship. And with that, I will turn it over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Rick. As you saw this morning, Jeff Smith informed the Board of Directors last night that he was stepping down as Chairman and resigning as an Independent Director. I want to take this moment to thank Jeff on behalf of the board and the Darden management team for his leadership and partnership. From the moment he walked into the boardroom, Jeff has been focused on helping Darden regain its leadership position in full-service dining and we are all grateful for his perspective he has brought to our business. We have accomplished a number of extraordinary feats under his leadership, including improved operational excellence, disciplined strategic planning and the spin-off of Four Corners Property Trust. On a personal note, I have appreciated in value Jeff\u2019s vision, constructive attitude and counsel during the past 18 months. He has been a wonderful partner for me and I wish him well in all his personal and professional endeavors. We also announced that Darden Board of Directors unanimously elected Chuck Sonsteby as Chairman. Chuck is a proven leader with extensive industry experience and I am looking forward to working with him in his new capacity as Chair. Darden has regained momentum and I am excited about the opportunities ahead for our brands and for our team members as we continue to focus on delivering exceptional guest experiences. We have an engaged board, a strong leadership team and great team members across our company focused on the right priorities, providing strong value propositions for our guests, leading to increased frequency and enhanced loyalty. And with that, we will open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open. Brett Levy : Good morning, gentlemen. If you could do me a favor and talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, what you are seeing by the brands, where you are seeing the biggest impact either economically or from a competitive standpoint? And then just quick question on what do you think the possible peak margins are for Olive Garden, LongHorn and how do you get there? Thank you. Gene Lee : Good morning, Brett. There is a lot in that question. Let me start off by just talking about the overall environment. I think that\u2019s what you really would like to hear us talk about this morning. The environment does remain competitive. We believe that the consumer is behaving very well in our restaurants. They continue to use the whole menu. We continue to see people buying \u2013 purchasing add-ons, both as appetizers, alcoholic beverages and desserts. We see people buying a little bit less on deal than they have in the past. However, we have done a good job as I mentioned in our prepared comments about anchoring our lunch and dinner menus with very attractive price points. The overall environment does feel a little bit promotional at this point in time and we are watching what everyone is doing. However, we think we are positioned well to continue to take market share. I just think the biggest move that we made in Olive Garden was putting that everyday value back on the menu. And we want a long time with our $9.99 price point at dinner. And I believe that \u2013 anchoring that menu with that price point has allowed us to use a lot of our promotional activity to deliver value in a different way and value can be delivered with the higher price points and the consumer has been very accepting of that. And I believe in Olive Garden, the overall experience has improved dramatically. As far as overall peak margins, I really don\u2019t want to talk about a number that we want to put out there as what our peak margins are going to be. I mean I think there are so many variables that are inputs into that, what\u2019s the commodity environment? What\u2019s the pricing environment? We are going to continue to invest into the guest experience and do the things that we need to do to maintain and grow our market share and we will continue to focus on removing non-consumer facing costs from our business. And that\u2019s something we have been focused on for the last 18 months and we will continue to be focused on. Brett Levy : Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird. Sir, your line is now open. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Gene, my question is really on the outlook or the implied outlook for the fourth quarter. If I look at the comps guidance for the year, it does imply at least to the midpoint that your Q4 comps would be slightly below what you have been running in the past several quarters. And my question is, is that just conservatism on your part or is it related to comparisons or are you starting to see some signs of softness, I guess in the overall environment? Gene Lee : Good morning, David. Our guidance is based on what we know today and what we believe the environment will provide us in the back half of the year. We believe it\u2019s the appropriate guidance with what we know today. The environment I would say continues to remain choppy. Week to week, as you look at Knapp Track and Black Box, continues to move around, trying to focus more on longer term trends than I am \u2013 what\u2019s happening week-to-week. We have got a shift in the Easter holiday that is I think going to make some of the week-to-week comparisons in the fourth quarter a little bit difficult to read. And I think \u2013 when I think about our guidance, I think \u2013 as we finish the year in the 3 to 3.5 range, I think that\u2019s a great year for Darden. And I think that\u2019s something we should be incredibly proud of. David Tarantino : Great. And then one second question here, Gene could you maybe talk a little bit about what the initial reception to the catering effort has been and what you are seeing so far there and what you think the opportunity you would look out over the next 1 year or 2 years? Gene Lee : Yes. We believe catering is a big opportunity. The reception has been fantastic. Again, it\u2019s been designed around this whole need space of convenience. We are able to bring this experience to you. We benefit significantly in Olive Garden because the food travel is so well, especially when we put it in these bulk containers. We are measuring closely intent to reorder and overall satisfaction. And the scores are really, really strong. The consumer is very, very happy with the product. It\u2019s unique and we believe that this is a huge opportunity over time, as we continue to build awareness. As we think about this, our consumer today has very, very low awareness of us doing this catering delivery. We have run some limited television advertising in some small markets to see what \u2013 how consumers react to that. And the reaction has been very positive. And so we will continue \u2013 our goal is to continue to find ways to build awareness of what we are doing. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And we also have a question coming from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is now open. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Thank you. Good morning Gene, Rick and Kevin. Question about the Olive Garden momentum that we saw in the quarter, we saw a pretty meaningful acceleration in the third quarter despite few other industry are remaining stuck in the same gear, that the go momentum is obviously very strong, but mathematically I don\u2019t think it could have driven that large of an acceleration, so what\u2019s really going on, in the third quarter to drive that large of an acceleration in the business, I know you guys with tablets in the assets before the quarter begin, does that have an impact, do you have any other color you can provide? Gene Lee : Got it. Brian, I want to start at the level that \u2013 we are just running better restaurants today. And I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I don\u2019t think we should discount the importance of ensuring that we are properly staffed, our teams are properly motivated. Dave and his team have done an exceptional job of simplifying the operation by reducing the size of the menu and the processes and the procedures. I think the overall experience inside an Olive Garden today is significantly better than it was 12 months to 24 months ago. I think we are getting a lot of momentum from that. The tablets, obviously are helping as I have said in the last quarter, we are getting \u2013 we are closing out checks 7 minutes quicker than we have in the past. And so we are excited about some of the basic operations. And one of the things that we are focused on now is trying to keep things simple. And we talk a lot about simple is hard and doing simple things every single day is really, really hard. But that\u2019s what\u2019s giving us the biggest lift in Olive Garden. Our teams are doing a great job creating great dining experiences and we are not having to rely on promotional activity to drive the business. We are winning every single day at the 9 square feet. And I believe that\u2019s why we gained some momentum throughout the third quarter. Brian Bittner : And just a follow-up question on \u2013 so far in the fourth quarter, I think it\u2019s no secret that the industry is pretty soft in March, what do you think is going on, what do you really attribute that to based on the seat that you sit in, what\u2019s going on with the consumer? Gene Lee : Yes. I contribute them \u2013 the month \u2013 the week-to-week noise in March. And really, as I look at the industry, has more to do with Easter coming forward a couple of weeks than anything else. Brian Bittner : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Sir, your line is now open. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. I have a question, but I have a follow-up on the previous question to go about the catering, I guess if you could talk about and look about some of the stores that do the best in either catering or OG to go, so I guess the ones that index higher than that 10.5% or so, how do they do on the other business, the in-store business, have they been out comping, I am curious if there is a halo effect as far as someone uses you on the go and does that strengthen the brand equity, are you seeing any incremental sales or is it cannibalistic to that existing business that was done in the store traditionally? Gene Lee : Matt, one of the things that we are looking at is I think as I have said in the past, we are tokenizing credit cards. And so we are able to see if this consumer is using us for take out, is using us for in restaurant, too and we are seeing a lot of crossover. And so we are seeing people use both to go and in restaurant, which is exciting for us. We are also seeing consumers that just use us from a to go standpoint. When a restaurant has momentum, it\u2019s having \u2013 it\u2019s usually demonstrating momentum in all categories, so both takeout and in-restaurant. And so I think the root of your question is, there is a halo and one of the things that we think and we are trying to bear out in some research is takeout and OG to go is exposing Olive Garden to maybe some lapsed consumers. We are using it and then to say, hey that was pretty good, I am going to come back in and then try the restaurant. And so I think - basically I think what you are trying to get across in your question is true that we are getting some halo for the whole restaurant because of the to go experience. Matthew DiFrisco : Great. And then I just want to clarify your detail of Texas, I think you called it out for how it\u2019s affected any reason, I am curious, that was the higher end, but have you seen any other distinguishing trends in Texas or weaker trends in Texas below sort of the any of these price point in the fine dining category, is it impaired or have you seen it \u2013 be economy down there, way over something like a LongHorn or in Olive Garden? Gene Lee : No. We have seen nothing in casual dining that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s still Texas is still performing fairly well and Houston is performing fairly well. I called it out any of these because when you look at that footprint, I think Texas is about 40% of the total footprint. And so it\u2019s a little bit \u2013 it\u2019s really easy to see there, especially in Houston. We have two restaurants in Houston that have been significantly impacted. Matthew DiFrisco : So that\u2019s just to read then I guess on the higher end as far as related to the energy business is getting curtailed, roughly\u2026? Gene Lee : Yes. I think it\u2019s a large party, the celebratory. We need to work hard in luxury dining to make sure that we find other people or other businesses that are doing well and make sure that we invite them in and use our facilities. Matthew DiFrisco : Understood. I appreciate the detail. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we also have a question coming from the line of Billy Sherrill from Stephens Incorporated. You may begin. Billy Sherrill : Hi. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter and thank you for taking my question. So last quarter you guys touched on the tightening labor market conditions, you were saying and I was hoping to get a little more visibility and how you guys are navigating that environment, I guess particularly with respect to demand or turnover and whether or not you are having to I guess plan to take any additional steps to retain some of that talent? Gene Lee : Yes. The wage environment is definitely continuing to evolve. I would say that turnover in the industry is up. Our gap to the industry continues to improve, but our turnover is up. And I would talk about that as I think the restaurant employee is a little bit more mobile today. I think that there is people who were working in our industry because there are \u2013 other alternatives weren\u2019t available to them, I think those other alternatives today are starting to become available. It\u2019s going to put a little bit of pressure on wage rate as the industry competes for the best talent to run their businesses. I think at Darden, we have a compelling employment proposition and I think that we are \u2013 when I think about it, we are at an advantage here. The other thing to point out is when you look at Darden\u2019s footprint we have a great footprint and operate a lot of restaurants and markets where we still have federal minimum wage in those states and that\u2019s \u2013 that really offsets some of the other mandated wage increases that are happening in some of the other states. And I would conclude by just stating that at Darden, we have industry leading retention. We have some of the best retention and low turnover rates in all of full-service dining. So again, we are positioned well to deal with this. I would like to say that historically operating in an environment where you have a little bit of wage inflation at \u2013 with your staff has been good for sales long-term. And I would much rather operate in this environment than in an environment where the industry was maybe struggling a little bit more from a top line standpoint than we had plenty of help. Billy Sherrill : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just one quick follow-up if I could. I believe, you also said that last quarter, you had thought that you might have trouble pushing more price in the near term given the current environment. So, I was wondering \u2013 I am assuming that there is not anymore additional pricing implied for the back \u2013 for the last quarter of the year, but do you have an idea of when you will be able to push some more price particularly at Olive Garden? Gene Lee : Well, I think we will continue to look at what pricing is available to us. In Olive Garden, we are trying to holdback our pricing, to improve the value proposition for the consumer and so we are looking for other ways to improve margins other than through pricing so that we can continue to create a compelling value. This is where I think it\u2019s important that we focus on using our scale to our advantage. If we can use our scale to our advantage, price less than our competitive set, our value \u2013 perceived value with the consumer should go up and that\u2019s what our strategic plan is right now, use our scale, don\u2019t rely on pricing to create value and let\u2019s win market share. Billy Sherrill : Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful and congrats again guys. Operator : Thank you. And we have a question coming from the line of Joseph Buckley of Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open. Joseph Buckley : Thank you. First, just another question on sales, can you say what the To Go catering influence was on the third quarter same-store sales? And then is there a difference in pricing between what you realized in the third quarter and the price effect you are assuming in the fourth quarter and your full year guidance? Gene Lee : As far as takeout, takeout was 35% of the overall comp and of that delivery was 25% of that growth. So, takeout is playing a big part, but in this quarter, it wasn\u2019t the whole thing. So very, very good growth in restaurant takeout and then we should look for catering and delivery to continue to ramp up over time as we build awareness. As we think about the fourth quarter, we don\u2019t have any additional pricing schedule to go in. We are going to continue to try to create value by not pricing, our pricing a lot less than we historically would have. Joseph Buckley : Can I ask where on the expansion also? Rick, you gave us the range of potential openings for 2017, could you update us what you are thinking the full year numbers will look for \u201816 and for the \u201817 numbers, what brands will get the lion\u2019s share of that? And is that a gross number also? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Joe. Yes, for \u201816, we still expect to open around 18 to 22 new units that is not a net number, that\u2019s a gross number. And for \u201817, the numbers I talked to you about, 24 to 28, is also gross and we will give you more insight on to what brands are going to have some of that growth next year in our June call. Joseph Buckley : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is now open. Jeff Farmer : Great, thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on the table turn topic I think a 7 minute or 10% reduction in average table turn time in Olive Garden, that\u2019s a pretty big number. So, if the concept is capacity constrained for 15%, even 20% of transactions, that 10% reduction in table turn time would be a pretty sizable traffic driver. So, is it a fair way to think about it like that? Gene Lee : Jeff, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think your logic is correct. However, what we are measuring is the time the check opens and the time the check closes. That doesn\u2019t mean that consumer leaves, just because they had the ability to close that check out quicker. Internally, we are making the assumption that the guest after they closed out their check with a credit card and doing it in the historical way, on average, was hanging around the same amount of time after they paid the check as the consumer who is closing out on Ziosk is hanging around. And so if we make those two assumptions then that 7 minutes is meaningful. But if \u2013 we have no way of knowing if the guest is closing out the check with the Ziosk and then staying around the few extra minutes and we are not really getting that full 7 minutes. Jeff Farmer : Okay. Then let me ask the question just a little different way. I think your Olive Garden\u2019s year-to-date traffic up about 1.5%, big number, especially relative to the peers. What would some of the key drivers of that be? Gene Lee : Yes. The key drivers is \u2013 I am going to go back to \u2013 we are running better restaurants today. We are better staffed. Our processes and procedures are simpler. Our restaurant managers are more focused and feel an ownership of having the responsibility to drive sales. Their compensation aligns with them driving same restaurant sales. And so I think those are key drivers. I do think there is other things that we have done along the way. Ziosk is one of them that\u2019s helped out and so on and so forth. So, I got to \u2013 I want to keep going back to we are running better restaurants today, we are winning at the 9 square feet and we are creating the loyalty of these people, we are exceeding the guest expectation. We are focused and we are executing and we still have room to improve. Jeff Farmer : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have a question coming from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. Gene, I think investors are wrestling with the fact that Darden puts its stake in casual dining in that segment over the long-term and I guess it\u2019s gotten worse lately. It\u2019s showing same-store sales or in particular same-store traffic declines. Our industry participants out there not executing like Darden, perhaps they are not reinvesting in food and labor like you and perhaps they are not even representing the segment versus fast food, which is doing much better than casual dining lately. Will we see some other segment relevance issues and perhaps tying into that you get customer satisfaction survey data that we don\u2019t see perhaps that gives you a signal as to what\u2019s going on in terms of the competitive differentiation? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes. Good morning, David. I don\u2019t want to get \u2013 comment on what our competitors are doing. I will say that we are \u2013 there are others in casual dining that are winning, that continue to outperform the industry and significantly outperform the industry with strong value equations and relevant brands. We continue to believe that if we invest in the guest and we provide an experience and provide value to the guest on multiple dimensions, we will continue to grow our market share. We do have access to research. We like the trends that we are seeing with our brands and it tells us the consumer is seeing what we are doing, but it does start with the basics of having a great host or hostess at the front door, inviting guests in. It starts with having service staff that\u2019s appropriately \u2013 has the appropriate size section. They have derived small ways and the tools that do their jobs. And we have a simplified process in the kitchen where our chefs and cooks can prepare the food properly. And I believe all the little details that we are doing is giving \u2013 is allowing us to create this deal market share at this point in time. David Palmer : So the food, the labor scores, I mean what are the major \u2013 if you had to pinpoint the scores that people where really are \u2013 if they are getting the joke about your brands and the fact that Olive Garden and you are outperforming what others too, is it mostly the food and mostly the labor, what is this? Gene Lee : It\u2019s \u2013 David, it\u2019s all and when we talk about food service and atmosphere as our key operating philosophy here, we are winning on food, we are winning on service, we are winning on atmosphere and that all equals value. And value, I think value today in our industry is much more than just a price point. And so when we talk with management teams and the presidents here about what they are doing, we are trying to deliver value on multiple dimensions. Now you have to have value on with a price point for certain guests. But other guests on that dimension are looking for value that we deliver in different ways. And I think we are doing a really good job of doing that. But we can\u2019t rest. We have to continue to evolve and continue to look for different ways to deliver value because everything we can do in this industry can be replicated except for the operational part. The operational part is really hard and I will go back to something I have said earlier in a response to the question is, we are focused on doing simple things and simple things \u2013 doing simple things is really hard. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is now open. Jason West : Yes. Thanks guys. Just a couple of questions, one Gene, if you could talk about sort of your broader philosophy here around advertising, I know we have tried to dial back some of the monthly promotions that the brand used to rely on, but also just a broader kind of TV spending, Darden and Olive Garden have always been very heavy in that category, do you see that type of spin winding down or not winding down, but sort of moderating over time as you run better restaurants and you need to rely less on that type of spending?And then I had a follow-up on CapEx. Thanks. Gene Lee : Alright. Jason, TV for Olive Garden is still the best medium for us to spend our money. We can see sales move week-to-week based on how many TRPs we are spending. And so we are transitioning some dollars from TV over to digital and other \u2013 and social and some other things. But TV is always going to play a big part of the Olive Garden story until something dramatic changes with the consumer. Our target audience is still fairly easy to reach through television. And one of the things that we have done a lot better in the last 24 months is really hone in on that target and spend against that target appropriately. And so, Dave and the team have done a great job of ensuring every dollar we invest is moving forward. Where we are making meaningful progress on advertising spending is in LongHorn, where I believe we became very inefficient over time and trying to act like a bigger brand than we really were. And so we have been able to save significant dollars in that budget as we move to spot television and supporting our restaurants that aren\u2019t media efficient with other means of support. And that\u2019s been investment very effective for us and we will continue to do that. Jason West : Thank you. And on the CapEx, Rick can you talk a bit about the plan at Olive Garden, I think you are talking about 60 remodels there for fiscal \u201817, I think you guys had done some tests around 30 units this year, is that sort of the type of run rate that you are looking at for the next few years or do you expect that number to ramp more aggressively over time. And how many of the Olive Garden units do you think need a full remodel, is it still that sort of half the base, sort of number that we are thinking about? Rick Cardenas : Yes. Jason, in regards to remodels for next year, the 60 number is what we expect to be doing next year. We are getting great returns on those remodels. We also anticipate continuing to invest in our restaurants, including remodels the year \u2013 in future years. But as I have mentioned in my prepared remarks, we also invest over 60 \u2013 around $60,000 a year per restaurant to make sure that our restaurants continue to look fresh. The 35 that we have done have \u2013 as I said have done great for us. We expect to continue that result and we will continue to remodel as we find the right restaurants to remodel. But one thing I will say is in the past, remodels were one-size-fits-all. And we believe that we need to look at every restaurant individually to ensure that we spend the right amount of money in each restaurant. And think of the remodel is more of an evolution versus a revolution. So we don\u2019t think we have to do all 200 to 300 of them at one time. Jason West : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Sir, your line is now open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. I am just looking back over the past 18 months obviously it\u2019s been an impressive turn of the fundamentals, I think we agree on both the comp and the cost savings side, as we now think is kind of the next 18 months, just getting a lot of questions on the sustainability of that performance, obviously it\u2019s hard for you to forecast the comp side, maybe you can offer some more color on the cost side, which I know you have been saying kind of the long-term run rate was now in the $150 million plus range and whether you are now start to consider some of the other big suggestions that came out 18 months ago, whether there is any thought of separating or monetizing some of the Specialty Restaurant Group and/or are more potential around any kind of franchising or what not, just your thoughts on those potential opportunities? And then I had one follow-up. Gene Lee : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. We are proud of the work we have done over the past 18 months. We have really made some good improvement. We have done that through focusing on some basics, as I have talked about. The management and the Board will continue to evaluate all the alternatives for the business over time. We have laid out our long-term strategic framework. We believe the portfolio we have today is a great portfolio to achieve that. We have also laid our strategic initiatives, which revolve a lot around scale. And we have laid out and we laid it out in the presentation \u2013 in our investor presentation how that scale is really benefiting us from a G&A standpoint. And so as we look at what we are doing with the portfolio right now and our strategy, we believe moving forward with what we are doing in the past that we are on is the right path. As far as sustainability of the path that we are on, I will go back to a couple of things. I will go back to continuing to use scale. We are in the infancy of really taking advantage of our data and insights. I think that we are doing a lot of that today. I can\u2019t talk too much about it because it is a competitive advantage for us. And I also think that we are doing some really great things from a strategic planning standpoint that are giving us an advantage in the marketplace. We will continue to stay focused on running great restaurants. I believe that\u2019s the key differentiator at the end of the day. This is getting to be $100 billion category, although we would like to see it grow faster than it\u2019s growing. There is still a lot of market share available to be taken, if we continue to outperform and out execute the competitive set. And that\u2019s what we are focused on. And we have \u2013 again, as far as momentum, we have kind of laid out with the long-term strategic framework, what we think this business is capable of and we believe providing our shareholders a 10% to 15% total shareholder return is a compelling investment in today\u2019s environment. Jeffrey Bernstein : Agreed. And then just to your point you mentioned earlier about the categories heading towards $100 billion and obviously you would like it to be a little healthier, but I am just wondering, when you get asked why maybe you are not seeing stronger trends across all of casual dining, if the consumer confidence and employment are positive and gas prices are favorable, I am just \u2013 when you size up what you think the greatest industry headwinds are, the greatest concerns, is it capacity or is I guess just lost value or maybe fast casual intrusion, just what\u2019s holding back the category from what would have \u2013 we would have expected to be further improvement in trend based on the historical correlations in some of those key metrics? Gene Lee : Yes. I think there are two things out there. I think there is capacity. There is a lot of capacity out there too. I think there is a lack of really good innovative new ideas that get consumers excited about what we are doing. I think that\u2019s the biggest headwind. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have a question coming from the line of Keith Siegner of UBS. Sir, your line is now open. Dennis Geiger : This is Dennis Geiger on for Keith and thanks for the question. So, just to build a little bit more on the competitive environment theme. Anything that you would call out as it relates to where you are seeing the most impact from competition, whether it\u2019s the dinner or the lunch day part? And then for Olive Garden, are the $6.99 and $9.99 lunch and dinner price point offerings, in your view the key drivers that\u2019s better helping you to win on value or is it much more a combination of things? And if the former, can we see the continued evolution of similar value offerings going forward? Gene Lee : Let me start with the second question first. I do think anchoring your menus with everyday value is important, so the consumer knows that they can come to your restaurant, not have to rely on being told what they have to eat from a promotional standpoint to get that value or use a coupon to get that value. And Olive Garden has always been the value leader. And so I think that\u2019s really important for them. What was the \u2013 can you just tell me what the first question was again? Dennis Geiger : Sure. Just as it relates to value, if you could call out where you are seeing it \u2013 I am sorry, competition, where you are seeing it more whether it\u2019s the lunch or the dinner day parts, any kind of commentary there? Gene Lee : Yes. I mean, all day parts we are seeing incredible competitive pressure. I will say that I think the lunch day part for casual dining has a lot more competition, because I think fast casual is a much more bigger option at lunch. I also think good \u2013 great quick-serve restaurants provide competitive competition at lunch. And so when quick-serve gets stronger and gets in the value of becoming much better that puts a little bit more pressure on lunch. Dennis Geiger : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. John Glass : Thanks very much. On LongHorn, you talked a little bit about pulling back on price promotion and maybe that was the reason why traffic was softer than prior quarters. Is this part of the evolution that you are doing in the brand similar to Olive Garden where you are going to focus more in these anchor price points? Are you doing that at risk or peril of, since the commodity is down, your competitors are going to be more price promotional on steak, maybe you can talk about if you have actually seen that and if that\u2019s a real risk there? Gene Lee : John, when we think about the positioning for LongHorn. We see that the target consumer there is a lot different than the target consumer at Olive Garden. And I think historically \u2013 in the last couple of years, we have drifted the target in LongHorn down to a consumer that is more trying to be more like an Olive Garden consumer. And I think that we have done a lot of price points at 2 for $29, $12 steaks. I believe LongHorn is a bit of more of a premium offer and we need to focus on that. So right now, we are out there doing our 18 ounce bone-in ribeye and we are off there promoting a 10-ounce fillet, which is the first time in 6, 7 years we have been out there with a 10-ounce fillet. And consumer satisfaction is improving dramatically. At the end of the day, what we are doing in LongHorn today is we are removing some consumers, some guest from the guest base that we are confident that we weren\u2019t making any money on. And they were a consumer that was spending \u2013 buying a low-end steak, coming in with a $5 coupon and that was all happening while we had a 45-minute wait outside the restaurant, waiting \u2013 people waiting to get into pay full price for more of a higher end experience in casual dining steak. And so we believe that we are transitioning the positioning slightly and we believe this is the right place to be. It\u2019s a place that I am personally a lot more comfortable with LongHorn and where LongHorn should be. We are going to invest in quality. We are going to invest in staffing. And most importantly, we are going to invest \u2013 we are going to continue to simplify the LongHorn operation has become too complex over time. John Glass : Great. And Rick, if I could just follow-up on your comments on \u201817, first, just with respect to CapEx, is this kind of a steady state going up, I don\u2019t know, 30%, 40% next year, but is this kind of the new steady-state in terms of unit openings you would expect for the next couple of years? I think you commented about remodels, but is this a good way to think about the capital spending in the business in aggregate? And then, is 2017 also an opportunity to look at the balance sheet? How active a conversation is looking at the balance sheet, now that you have got a real estate behind you and the business is in a much stronger footing, is that potentially a 2,000 event \u2013 re-leverage event? Rick Cardenas : Thanks, John. The 2017 CapEx that we mentioned in the new units, I would refer you to the long-term framework that we have for new units of 2% to 3%. The amounts that we gave you there are slightly below the long-term framework on new units, but we expect to be at the long-term framework over time. And can you give me the \u2013 remind me the second part of the question, sorry? John Glass : Your balance sheet\u2026. Rick Cardenas : The balance sheet, we continually work with our board to regularly evaluate the alternatives that we have with the cash on hand to achieve our financial goals and \u2013 but our first priority is to maintain the investment grade profile. John Glass : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have a question coming from the line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Ma\u2019am, your line is now open. Karen Holthouse : Yes. Another question on catering, I am curious if you have any idea of the breakdown for how much of that is B2B versus going towards a consumer? And then within what I think a pretty fragmented sort of large order catering market, do you have a sense of who you might be taking share from? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes. Karen, it\u2019s primarily B2B at this point in time. However, we are seeing some growth in residential. We have done weddings. We are heading into graduation season. And so again, I get back to the point I made earlier. This is about building awareness, because every time we do an event, we are \u2013 the intent to reorder is extremely high and the satisfaction is extremely high. Right now is a natural for B2B, but we do believe we can grow it into more of a residential, large home meal replacement opportunity. Karen Holthouse : Great, thank you. And then one quick housekeeping if I can squeeze it in. Last year, the fourth quarter ended a week after Memorial Day and this year it looks like it ends on Memorial Day weekend. Is there any sort of \u2013 would you expect that sort of that first week of summer index to a higher \u2013 lower sales week that we should be thinking about? Rick Cardenas : Yes. I would say, Karen, for the fourth quarter you would probably expect the first week to be a little lower because of the Memorial Day weekend. Karen Holthouse : Great, thank you. Rick Cardenas : The last week. I am sorry, the last week. Operator : Thank you. And we have a question coming from the line of Andy Barish of Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open. Andy Barish : Thanks, guys. The LongHorn margin stepped up significantly in the quarter to 20%. I know you talked about some of the promotional changes. Are we at a sort of a new level here? I mean, it was a pretty rapid step up or maybe how much of it was beef versus some timing or marketing shifts, just trying to gauge what went on with the margins at LongHorn? Gene Lee : Yes. Part of \u2013 first of all, third quarter in LongHorn is by far the best quarter and so that model really starts to work when you get into $67,000, $68,000 a week for average weekly sales. Beef was very little of it. We haven\u2019t started to see that really flow through. Some of it was as I have talked about was the marketing. We have got every single line item continued to improve and it was a lot of individual, 10 basis points here, 20 basis points there that added up to the 400 basis points with the big savings coming in labor. And so again, it gets to that whole idea of when we get LongHorn to $67,000, $68,000 a week this model really works. Andy Barish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have a question from David Carlson of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open. David Carlson : Thank you, guys for taking my call. Gene has the increased To Go volume created any operational issues for the restaurants and do you believe the restaurants are well-positioned to handle greater volume following the receivables advertising support? And I have a follow-up. Gene Lee : Yes, David. One of the things that the Olive Garden team did was before we really started to push takeout is they went back and they looked at every process and procedure and ensured that they were able to handle the increase in volume. And therefore this has been really, really well-thought out. The beauty of the catering delivery is it\u2019s \u2013 we ask for 24 hour advance notice. And we are actually able to increase our productivity, because we are able to plan ahead and we are able to use some of our downside \u2013 downtime in our cycles to help prepare for the catering delivery. So, that\u2019s really been a real enhancement from a productivity standpoint. We believe that we can continue to handle the increase in volume, especially if it comes in catering delivery, because that usually goes out our door before lunch or before dinner, which is ideal. So, growth in that business really, really increases our overall productivity. David Carlson : Well, that makes sense. And then my follow-up was now that you guys have the digital ordering for To Go, have you noticed much more of a much larger ticket from the online orders versus the old phone-based ordering system? Gene Lee : Yes, the online ordering is still \u2013 I think it\u2019s still 20% higher than calling in on the phone. We are incentivizing people to switch over to online ordering. Just the overall process, when you think about it, when you are on the phone, we are trying to do the best job we can at the restaurant, but sometimes that person taking the order behind the counter or behind the bar has got a guest in front of them. And so, they are \u2013 one of the things they are trying to do is get the order as fast as they can and get them off the phone, where if you are online, we can push you through a process and do a much better job selling to you. And we find the consumer online is much more happy to buyout. And so we are trying to incentivize as much business to switch over to online ordering. And we also just put out \u2013 the Olive Garden just put out its new app this week. So hopefully, that will continue to help, that will help migrate people over to online ordering. David Carlson : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And we have a question from Steve Anderson of Maxim Group. Sir, your line is now open. Steve Anderson : Very good. I just have a couple of questions on your cost reduction goals as well as on food cost. First, on the cost reduction side, I know you gave guidance back in December on the food \u2013 rather on your cost reduction goals. I just want to see, I may have missed this, is if you could provide an update on this call as well as any update on your food cost \u2013 outlook on food costs, is that changed? Gene Lee : Sure, Steve. We still expect our total cumulative savings to be between $145 million to $165 million over fiscal \u201815 through fiscal \u201817. And I just want to remind you that we are leveraging our scale and simplifying our business in ways that don\u2019t impact the consumer. We expect $80 million to $90 million of those cost savings to come in this year. In answer to your question about inflation and commodities, we expect and what we have in our web presentation in the appendix is we expect low single-digit deflation in commodities in the fourth quarter. But overall inflation for the year is still expected \u2013 expected to be 1% to 1.5%. That\u2019s slightly favorable to the amounts that we gave you in the second quarter. So, again, overall inflation, 1% to 1.5%, but low single-digit deflation in food and beverage in the fourth quarter. Steve Anderson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have Andrew Strelzik for the question and answer from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open. Andrew Strelzik : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two things. First, clearly, the comps momentum is strong, but if you look at it on a 2-year basis in February, the traffic did slow a little bit. Is there anything maybe one-time in nature that might have impacted that or do you not look at it that way? And secondarily, just looking at capital allocation for 2017, obviously the step up in CapEx, I am wondering if the long-term $100 million to $200 million share repo is in play for 2017 or should we expect something maybe lower than that with the step up in the CapEx? Gene Lee : Yes. Let me answer first the CapEx question and I will go back to the same restaurant sales. The $100 million to $200 million that we have in our long term framework is that it\u2019s our long-term framework. We will tell you a little bit more about \u201817 in \u201817, but I would expect it to be somewhere in there. But it won\u2019t be \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be impacted by the increasing CapEx, I can tell you that. On the same restaurant sales, our 2-year same restaurant sales in February, trying to get to that number for you real quick is about 5.7%, so still a strong 2-year stack. It wasn\u2019t as big as January, I believe, but still 5.7% over 2 years is strong performance and we feel good about that. Andrew Strelzik : So, certainly the overall comp, I wouldn\u2019t disagree with your comment. I was looking more at the traffic, but maybe we will take the question offline. Thanks a lot. Gene Lee : That will be great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we have a question from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open. John Ivankoe : Short one for me, when you guys look at where the beef spot markets are and where the beef futures markets are on the terms of live and feeder cattle and maybe the price of corn. I mean, how does that give you feeling about in terms of what you think your commodity basket could potentially be for \u201817? In other words, relative to what you paid in \u201816, how good of an environment could we potentially be in? Gene Lee : John, we will comment on the full commodities breadbasket in the call in June for \u201817. But let me just \u2013 I will just give you my thoughts on the beef market as I am pretty close to it. The futures market looks very positive as we move forward. We at Darden have been short through this last cycle and we expect it to be a tailwind as we move into next year. I will say and I think it\u2019s important for everybody to know this, is that the middle meats continue to be strong. And we have seen a lot of relief in ground beef, but we have not seen a lot of relief in the middle meats, your tenderloins, your short loins and your ribs. And so I believe that beef in \u201817 will be less than it was in \u201816, but I also believe beef is still going to be historically expensive. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we don\u2019t have any question on queue. Kevin Kalicak : Alright. Thank you, Hans. That concludes our call. I want to remind you all that we expect to release our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year results on Thursday, June 30 before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you all for your participation in today\u2019s call and have a great day. Operator : Thank you and that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company's press release, which was distributed earlier today, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our Web-site at www.darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and the reconciliation of these measurements is included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings on October 4 before the market opens followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about quarterly performance and brand highlights. Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results from the fourth quarter and share our outlook for fiscal 2017. Then Gene will have some closing remarks before we open the call for your questions. Before we begin, I want to point out that just as we did last quarter, we reported same restaurant sales on both a fiscal and comparable calendar basis. This morning we will refer to the comparable calendar comps during our remarks, unless otherwise noted. Additionally, sales and earnings comparisons versus last year will exclude the impact of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, unless otherwise noted. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had a strong quarter with each of our brands, significantly outperforming the industry benchmarks as we continue to focus on improving our execution. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.6% with positive same-restaurant sales in each of our brands. It was a volatile quarter as a result of multiple holiday and calendar shifts, including Easter, Memorial Day and spring break vacations, which we believe negatively impacted comps across the industry. Olive Garden had another great quarter and concluded a year in which we served more than 220 million guests. The Olive Garden brand is extremely relevant, the business is strong and our strategy continues to deliver results, as evidenced by our ongoing momentum. In Q4, same-restaurant sales grew 2.4%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 440 basis points in both sales and traffic. This was our seventh consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth and fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-restaurant guest counts. Three key drivers of this performance include; first, further simplification of our operational processes and procedures leading to improved execution in our restaurants; second, culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, as seen with our successful Italian Pot Pies, Mediterranean Fresh and Lasagna Lover promotions; and finally, continued growth of our successful OG To Go platform. To Go sales were up 19% year-over-year with a two-year growth rate over 40%. For the year, OG To Go sales represented 10.8% of total sales, an increase of 140 basis points versus last year. Additionally, we had the best Mother's Day in Olive Garden history, which further demonstrates the brand's relevance and its broad appeal as a destination for family celebrating time together. Olive Garden remains laser focused on driving frequency of our loyal guests while delivering great experiences and our guests are responding positively. Our innovation pipeline is strong and we still have meaningful operations improvements to capture. LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its solid top line momentum and once again delivered strong profit growth. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.2%, the 13th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 400 basis points, and same-restaurant traffic was well above the industry average. We will continue to invest in food quality to enhance the overall perceived value of the dining experience and have multiple in-restaurant tests underway. Additionally, LongHorn continues to simplify operations to strengthen in-restaurant execution and deliver great guest experiences. This focus on operational excellence is augmented by compelling non-price pointed promotions like our Big Bold Steaks and Longhorn Favorites that reinforce our steak expertise. Looking at our specialty restaurants, all five businesses continued to deliver solid results that included positive same-restaurant sales growth at each, led by Seasons 52 at 5% and Bahama Breeze at 4.7%. Seasons 52 had another strong quarter. We continued to execute our strategy at a very high level and I'm impressed with what the team has been able to achieve throughout the year. Seasons 52 is an on-trend concept, giving guests the opportunity to enjoy handcrafted cuisine that is healthful without sacrificing the taste or style. We look forward to building on the momentum we have created as we rebuild the pipeline for value creating new restaurants. Yard House represents a significant growth opportunity for us and during the quarter we named Mike Kneidinger President. I'm excited to have Mike lead the Yard House team and he is supported by an extremely strong team. Mike did a tremendous job leading Bahama Breeze delivering same-restaurant sales growth of 3.5% annually over the past three years and I'm confident he will build on the momentum at Yard House. All of our specialty restaurants continue to perform well and are differentiated and well-positioned to grow market share into the future. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we achieved this quarter. And now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss those in more detail. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning everyone. Darden's fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10, both on a reported and adjusted basis. They were 8.9% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. As a reminder, last year was a 14-week fiscal quarter. The 8.9% growth assumes a 13-week quarter last year. Additionally, this quarter we paid out over $63 million in dividends and repurchased approximately $45 million in Darden stock. Key drivers of this quarter's growth included; positive same-restaurant sales of 1.7% on a fiscal basis; continued progress achieving our cost savings initiatives throughout the P&L a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1% deflation in food and beverage expense; and depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions. These results were partially offset by 170 basis points of incremental rent and other taxes related to the real estate transactions. Excluding the additional rent expense and other taxes, restaurant expenses would have been favorable by approximately 20 basis points. And while our adjusted tax rate was in line with the expectations we shared last quarter, tax expense as a percent of sales was 80 basis points unfavorable to last year, driven by tax timing. Turning to segment performance, as a reminder, fiscal 2016 segment profit includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transactions, whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. In total, these costs were $30 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings, which were $27 million, are not recognized in segment profit. Olive Garden segment profit margin of 19.3% was 100 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 130 basis points higher than last year. LongHorn Steakhouse grew segment profit margin by 120 basis points for the quarter to 19%. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit increased 250 basis points at LongHorn. Our Fine Dining and Other Business segment profit margins were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis at 20.1% and 18.9%, respectively, with our Other Business segment impacted by additional rents. We are pleased with the progress each of our segments has made improving profitability. They are leveraging their sales growth and continuing to improve the guest experience while taking advantage of Darden scale and working closely with our support teams to identify and capture cost savings. Finally, as we announced this morning, our Board declared a $0.56 per share quarterly dividend, a 12% increase from last quarter's dividend. We were able to spin off our real estate into a separate publicly traded company and still increased our quarterly dividend above our pre-spin quarterly dividend. And our spin-off of real estate assets to Four Corners created additional growth for our shareholders as the current combined dividend of the new companies is now 23% higher than the Darden dividend before the spin-off of Four Corners this past November. Fiscal 2016 was a year of significant progress at Darden. We achieved 4.4% total sales growth on a 52-week basis, 3.3% same-restaurant sales growth and 38% growth in adjusted diluted net earnings per share. In addition to meaningful sales and adjusted earnings per share growth, we profitably grew our market share exceeding the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales by over 400 basis points, increased adjusted operating margins by over 200 basis points, leveraged our scale further optimizing our supply chain and managing costs resulting in $95 million in annual cost savings which exceeded our initial target, and returned more than $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Importantly, we also executed our real estate strategy by completing a tax free spin-off of select real estate assets and restaurant assets into a new public company, Four Corners Property Trust. This transaction advanced our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders, while improving our capital structure and reducing debt. Using proceeds from this transaction and from the sale-leasebacks of our Restaurant Support Center and 64 restaurants plus cash on hand, we paid down $1 billion in debt during the year. This reduction in debt significantly improved our leverage resulting in a return to investment grade credit status from all three credit rating agencies. Overall, we are excited \u2013 we are executing a value creating business model to generate significant and durable cash flow that will fund growth and return capital to shareholders. Now looking forward to fiscal 2017, we anticipate total sales growth of 1.7% to 2.7%, which includes same-restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 24 to 28 new units, capital spending of between $310 million to $350 million, cost savings of approximately $30 million, total inflation between 1.5% and 2%, and annual effective tax rate between 26% and 27%, and approximately 128.5 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in earnings per diluted share between $3.80 and $3.90. We anticipate first quarter earnings per share to have the highest growth on a percentage basis as we expect commodities deflation in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 while we forecast commodities inflation in subsequent quarters. As a reminder, in December we shared our framework for value creation including a 7% to 10% earnings after tax growth and a 10% to 15% of total shareholder returns calculated as EPS growth plus dividend yield. The metrics for our fiscal 2017 outlook are within the long-term targets we shared this past December with the exception of new restaurant growth. We are working diligently to build the pipeline of new restaurants for future growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks Rick. As I think about fiscal 2016, I'm extremely proud of the progress we made in pursuit of our mission, which is to be financially successful through great people, consistently delivering outstanding food, drinks and service and inviting atmosphere, making every guest loyal. Our results reinforce that our strategy is working as our restaurants and team members continue to build guest loyalty by relentlessly focusing on our back-to-basics operating philosophy, which is rooted in culinary innovation and execution, attentive service, engaging atmospheres and integrated marketing. Finally, we continue to leverage our four competitive advantages that we see as key to unlocking sales growth and expanding margins. They are, the significant scale of our Company, the breadth and depth of our data and consumer insights, our commitment to rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented people culture. It's that last competitive advantage, our people, that truly sets our Company apart. Together we have accomplished a great deal over the past two years and we've done it by getting a little better each day. It may sound simple but it's hard to consistently deliver outstanding guest experiences day in and day out. It only happens because of our 150,000 outstanding team members across our Company. So let me close by thanking each of them. We know we've got a lot more work to do but I'm confident our team is up to the challenge. Now we'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have our first question. It is coming from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brett Levy : Obviously another quarter of a nice job on the labor line. Can you do us a favor and talk a little bit through what your thoughts are and how you're managing labor, what you can do on given all of the scarcity that's out there how you're looking at inflation, and also have you had an opportunity to assess what kind of impact the changes to overtime will have to your labor line in the way you're approaching business? Gene Lee : A couple of things. Let me deal the last point first, which is the labor impact. That will have no impact on our organization. Let me talk about labor. Labor is something that we continue to focus on but we are focusing on it in a different way and we are focusing on it on really when we think about menu development, how our menus are constructed and how that leads to processes and procedures in the kitchen. And we continue to focus on simplification in all aspects of what I would call the production process or the manufacturing process of producing our menu items. Our teams are doing a great job of simplifying the processes and thinking about how products that we have are adding to the menu or we have on the menu impact the production process. And so we've taken products off the menu that are complex, we've simplified processes and procedures, which has allowed us to improve the overall productivity in the back-of-the-house. Obviously the front of the house is an area where it's kind of off-limits. We have our beliefs in what it takes to execute out front and we're focused on back-of-the-house. We've also got a lot of energy around making sure that we have the appropriate labor in the restaurant at the right times. One of the things that we do with our P&L reviews at the end of each quarter is we sit down and we really look at what's the productivity of our restaurants before we have guests in there and then after we don't have guests in there, and we've been able to take a lot of hours out by making some adjustments there. So we feel like we're improving the guest experience. We are working on productivity in the back-of-the-house with the design of our menus and processes and procedures. I'll close by saying, and maybe preempt some other questions on labor, is that labor market is tight and it continues to be tight in specific markets, which is driving a little bit more inflation. But as I've said many times on this call, I prefer to operate in an environment where labor is tight. I think that will lead to demand into the future. Brett Levy : Would you be able to quantify what your wage rate inflation is or what you're seeing in terms of turnover? Gene Lee : We're seeing 2.5% to 3.5% wage inflation depending on where we are, in which brand and which part of the country. We've not seen a major tick-up in any of our turnover. Actually, our turnover remained strong. We believe in our employment proposition. We're continuing to look at that and we provide our employees the tremendous opportunity for advancement. And so the industry hasn't seen a pretty good tick-up in turnover but we're not seeing it in our Darden brands. Operator : Our next question is coming from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is now open. Brian Bittner : Question about the outlook for 2017. On the comp front, your 1% to 2% guidance is not the same as your 1% to 3% normalized outlook. I guess at the midpoint it's a little below and it is a little below where your trend was in May and for the fourth quarter. So what's driving just a slight bit more caution there, is it the current environment or is it the fact that you're lapping some pretty outsized comps? If you could just talk about how you constructed the comp outlook, I'd appreciate it. Gene Lee : I think that what's involved in our outlook guidance of 1% to 2% is we're giving guidance for a very long period of time, over the next 12 months, and based on all the things that we know today and all that we don't know about the next 12 months, we think 1% to 2% is a prudent guide that would indicate that it's still significant outperformance over the industry. And so we believe that's the appropriate guidance at this point in time with all the knowledge that we have. Brian Bittner : That makes a lot of sense, and it's pretty solid. On the EPS front, why are you guys guiding to a little higher share count year-over-year when you're also saying you're going to buy back $100 million to $200 million of stock. Is there that much dilution going on with stock-based compensation or what's going on there? Rick Cardenas : This is Rick. A couple of things. There's just a lot of assumptions and factors that make up our share count, including dilution as you mentioned, option exercises, new equity grants which really aren't that different than last year, and share price, so the assumptions that we make for share price and the timing of our buyback. So we thought it was most prudent to just give you a share count number that we're using for our EPS, which we haven't done in the past. Operator : Our next question is coming from Will Slabaugh of Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Billy Sherrill : It's actually Billy on for Will this morning. I was interested to hear what you're seeing from the consumer across your brand portfolio. Are you seeing different trends at some of your higher end dining relative to the lower end and what you think from your perspective is driving that behavior? Clearly we've heard many companies allude to a recent shift in consumer behavior but have you at Darden seen anything discernible or at least worth noting? Gene Lee : No, I think the way I would talk about consumer behavior is that guest continues to look for value, and affordability is only one component of that value but it's not really enough to drive sustainable traffic growth. And so obviously in an Olive Garden, we serve a lot of different guests to get to 5,000 guests a week, and each guest is looking for something different, but whenever we find something that the consumer really believes has got value, that's where the consumer goes, and that's not always the lowest price point or the thing that's discounted the most. We still see a lot of guests in LongHorn just gravitate towards a great fillet because it's a great value. We saw a high preference in Olive Garden with seafood lasagna which caught us a little bit by surprise, but it was the best value in the offering that we had. And so I believe the guest continues to look for value and the value equation is not always just what's in the numerator. When you think about \u2013 we think about our brands all the way from Olive Garden to Capital Grille, obviously price plays a lot more importance in creating that value in an Olive Garden, where in Capital Grille it's much more about how we make you feel that creates the value in that experience. And so we think about it and go along that line in between Olive Garden and Capital Grille. We're looking for that real value differentiator that will drive traffic. And sometimes it's affordability and price and sometimes it's more some of the other attributes and we keep pulling on all of the attributes, not just one, and we continue to make improvements in quality, we continue to make improvements in service. That's why we focus so much on execution. We believe at the end of the day we got to execute at what we call the 9 square feet, at that table in every one of our restaurants one table at a time. That really drives the most value to the consumer. Overall, their behavior continues to be same. We see them still using the full menu. If we've got good interesting appetizers, they are buying. If we've got good interesting desserts, they are buying them. And so it's compelling for us to keep coming up with great culinary innovation that make people want to buy our products. Billy Sherrill : Got it. Thanks. It's actually very helpful. And then one real quick follow-up if I could with regards to the off-premise and To Go sales, A, what do you think has been the biggest contribution from the Company's part in driving the growth and I guess kind of assimilating to that platform, and then second, would you by any chance be willing to kind of breakout what you believe the contribution from the online sales were to this quarter's comp? Gene Lee : Let me address the first part of that question. I think we identified four or five years ago that the [indiscernible] convenience was going to continue to grow, and that's the one thing that consumer was telling us in the insights was that we don't have enough time to do all the things that we want to do, we want you to make this more convenient for us. And so we built the platform that enabled us to do that. We've been able to market it effectively, we've been able to deliver it in different ways whether it's through a traditional to-go experience, whether it's through an online ordering experience, whether it's through bulk. And now with this delivery and catering that we are doing, we're just giving the consumer another access point to get what they want, which is something that's convenient, that's high quality and a great value. And that's why I think take-out is working. We've got a brand that's meeting that consumer where the consumer wants to be met. Do we have on the percentage? About 20% of our business today is online and that continues to grow each quarter. Operator : Our next question is coming from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Matthew DiFrisco : Before I get to my question, I just wondered, can you elaborate a little bit more on what you consider online? Is that an online reservation or are you saying that 20% of the people are actually paying online? Gene Lee : No, 20% of the people are ordering take-out online. That's a big point of focus for us because the more we convert, we [indiscernible] when we have a higher check, but operationally it's much easier when we get that order online. Matthew DiFrisco : And how much is online in aggregate right now? Gene Lee : 20%. Matthew DiFrisco : No, overall how much of your business at Olive Garden is take-out, 20%? Rick Cardenas : No, 10.8%. Matthew DiFrisco : Got it. And then 20% of that 10.8% is online? Rick Cardenas : Yes. Matthew DiFrisco : Understood, okay. My questions as far as the gap to your NAP appears, you accelerated and even widened that towards the end of the quarter in what it appears to be the month of May. I know obviously your calendar NAP has a different period somewhat, so maybe it's not a perfect science, but both brands seem to have accelerated in the back half of your fiscal quarter. I wondered if you could elaborate on maybe some of the promotional activity or something that you saw competitively that really lidded up in the back half of the quarter. And my follow-up question would be, you did comment that the commodity environment suggested the EPS in the first half of fiscal 2017 would probably drive greater earnings growth. Is that the same for the same sort of sales front as far as what we saw in the month of May, are we carrying greater momentum? And looking at the compares, it would suggest probably that the first half also will be a comp stronger period than the back half. Gene Lee : Let me deal with the second part of your question. We're not going to comment on sales trends in June and I don't think you should make that leap. I think you should look at the same restaurant sales as 1 or 2 as pretty flat throughout the year, based on what we know right now. And as far as May goes, you are correct, we did accelerate against the industry in May. I think that we focused a lot on Mother's Day and in and around Mother's Day which gave us a great boost. As I said, Olive Garden had a record Mother's Day, LongHorn had a \u2013 every one of our brands had a record Mother's Day and the days around Mother's Day as we really focused and we think that drove a lot of the activity in the month. We really have liked focusing on these days, both from a communication standpoint but also from an operational standpoint. When you look at a Mother's Day in both OG and LongHorn, it's just about how many guests you can get through and execute perfectly throughout the day. And so I think we were active both digitally and other promotional activity and we executed extremely well. We also got a big bump in catering and delivery for Mother's Day in OG, which was a strong bump. So I think it was our teams did a great job. We capitalized on the volume when the volume was there. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Palmer of RBC Capital. Your line is now open. David Palmer : If you were to audit the sales drivers at Olive Garden for 2016 through renovation, LTOs, the value platforms, To Go, what were the biggest drivers in your opinion for the year, whether you want to put numbers on it or not? And how do you think about contributors going into 2017, do you have a sense of how differently the sales drivers will shape up this next fiscal year? Gene Lee : I think there's a few. First, I want to start with, I think we are executing better and I know sometimes we want to look for some other things but I want to pivot back to I think Dave George and Danielle Kirgan, the team at Olive Garden have just done a great job improving the day to day executions. I think that's been the number one sales driver. And as I said in my comments, we think we still have meaningful improvement to make there. Second, we think To Go has been a great sales driver. This has been a leader in what we've been doing. We think we're exposing more guests to Olive Garden. It's been a terrific sales driver. We've done great culinary innovation. We've hit some really big products. Our pot pies were a big hit, our culinary tour was a big hit, our Create Your Own Tour of Italy has been a big hit. Ziosk has been a sales driver. So it's been a good lever that we don't think that we've fully hit full stride with that. We've still got some room there. And then remodels have been a solid sales driver outperforming the base by almost 4% in traffic, 3% or 4% in traffic. So I feel like there's multiple levers but I want to wrap that back around with our maniacal focus on trying to execute better at the restaurant. We as a team, and me especially, believe that is the key driver of winning in this business, is that interaction between a server and the guest. If we don't win there, all the other things are \u2013 I don't want to say they are meaningless but they are close. We've got to execute at a very high level and congratulations to all the Olive Garden people who are listening out there, you did a great, great job. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is now open. David Tarantino : I have a question about the 2017 margin guidance. It looks like you're assuming margin improvement in line with your long-run targets, but I think you also should be seeing some carryover benefits and new benefits from some of the cost savings that you've achieved. So my question is, is there something offsetting the cost savings from an investment perspective that's preventing the margin expansion from being above the range you normally would expect going forward? Rick Cardenas : David, there's a couple of things. I would say, one, we have the second half of the real estate that we have to wrap on. So real estate primarily offsets the $30 million of cost saves that we talked about for next year. And if we get cost savings greater than that, we're going to continue to reinvest in our business to drive sales growth. So while we are still in our long-term framework, again the real estate transaction and the rents, et cetera, are offsetting our cost saves. David Tarantino : Great, that's helpful. And then one more clarification on the guidance, on the comps outlook, can you give us a sense of what the breakdown in the comps might look like from a check and traffic standpoint or at least what you're assuming at this stage? Rick Cardenas : What we're assuming David is we're going to be at the low end of our 1% to 2% pricing in next year, and so we do assume some traffic growth in our guidance. Operator : Our next question is coming from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. John Glass : I wanted to go back to the 1% to 2% outlook for next year as well. It is a little lower than your 1% to 3%. One, what is your assumption on the industry, is this just that industry generated slower, so maybe you could be more explicit about that? And I think you've been a little bit more restrained around pricing. Do you think price value is becoming a bigger issue in the industry and that's why you are being more restrained on that as well? Gene Lee : I think that's a great question. As Rick said, we're right now at the lower end on a pricing thinking is that we're going to be in the 1% kind of range depending on the business, but we definitely think Olive Garden can't be more than 1% in the current environment. We're looking at an industry last year that was down 1.3% but trending \u2013 I'm sorry, that was the quarter \u2013 we're looking at an industry that was down closer to almost 2% or high 1s. We're working off that number. And so we're looking at a meaningful outperformance with minimal price as we continue to try to improve the value offerings in our businesses. We need to continue to invest. There is a lot of talk about how promotional the environment is right now, but the facts are the industry still charging the guest 2 plus percent more than they did last year for the experience, and we believe that 2017 with what we know right now is the year to invest, continue to invest back into the guest experience to continue to grow market share. And we believe if the overall industry was to improve, then I think, we think we would improve also, but based on the current trends and what's happened in the last couple of years, we think this is the right way to head into fiscal 2017. John Glass : And just a follow-up, on LongHorn, do you think the shift in promotional activity is hurting sales there? I understand you're still outperforming, but the sales are lower and traffic is now negative. Is that shift in promotion partly to blame for that or not? Gene Lee : I think that's only half the question. I think you have to go to the P&L and look at how much more money that we are making. What we're doing right now is, through our data and insights we identified that there were certain guests in the LongHorn system that we were losing money on, and it was obvious to us, and Rick's team did an outstanding job and we've backed off trying to attract those guests into the restaurant. I'm saying, if we can't make money on the guest taking up the table on a Saturday night, we're not going to push to bring them in. So there are few guests that are slipping out that were in our base last year but they weren't profitable. I'm incredibly impressed with the margin improvement and the progress that we're making with LongHorn. The team has done an outstanding job and I'm not as concerned about where we are from a traffic standpoint. This model is starting to get back to work the way the model was designed to work many, many years ago and I'm super-excited about the trajectory of this business, especially when I look at where the sales are and the margins. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jason West of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jason West : Couple of questions. One, I guess, Gene, you have a probably better visibility than we do on the industry trends, in other words, the end of June, we had been seeing some slight improvement in May for the industry as you talked about moving away from the Easter shift, have you seen the industry kind of give that back a bit in June, is that part of the caution that you're referring to? Gene Lee : I really don't want to comment on June. You guys have access to different benchmarks. At this point I want to talk about fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 and we're not going to talk about what's happening in the industry in June. Jason West : Okay. And then a separate question, on the savings outlook, I think you said $30 million baked into the guidance. I think the original target for 2017 was $30 million to $40 million and maybe there was some hope that as you're still digging through the business lines that you'll find some additional savings. So would you say the $30 million is conservative and you're still sort of looking for other opportunities or have you kind of tapped out what you can do there? Rick Cardenas : Couple of things, Jason. One, we got a little bit more of the savings in the fourth quarter of this year. So that was $5 million more than we had originally anticipated. So that gets you to $30 million to $35 million. We've just made the decision that we are going to invest some of those savings. So if we find over $30 million, we are going to reinvest in our business. So we're going to continue to look for cost savings where it makes sense, where it doesn't impact the guest experience and use those cost savings to continue to improve the value equation at all of our brands, especially at Olive Garden. So $30 million is where we think we are. I'm not saying it's conservative, I'm saying that's where we're going to be net, and if we find more, we'll probably reinvest it. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeff Farmer : Just to follow up on share purchase and free cash flow, couple of different questions there, so delivered a second year of almost $600 million in free cash in 2016 and I'm just curious why you were not more aggressive with putting some of that to work in terms of share repurchase? Gene Lee : A couple of things, Jeff. One is, we've given you the long-term framework of $100 million to $200 million of share repurchase. We have $500 million of share repurchase that the Board has authorized. We have $315 million left in that. We'll continue to find opportunities and work with our Board to understand the best uses of our cash going forward, but the share repurchase we have is within our long-term framework. Jeff Farmer : Okay. And then just sort of to beat the horse on this one, so FY 2017, similar setup, you guys are going to raise your CapEx by about $100 million with still about $0.5 billion free cash. So it still seems like a similar nice problem to have. You're just throwing off a ton of free cash. So again I would be curious about the repurchase, but then also you just alluded to the best uses, what else is out there, what are you guys considering other than potentially modestly accelerating unit growth, remodels, returning cash to shareholders through the form of repo, what else is the Board thinking about? Gene Lee : This is Gene. We're constantly in constant communication with our Board about what's the best thing for us to do as we move forward. We'll continue to look at all the alternatives available to us with our excess cash, our capital structure, and we'll continue to make the prudent decisions to invest in the business long-term and we'll evaluate what the opportunities are every quarter. We just finished our year-end Board meeting and we'll get back together in September and we'll evaluate the opportunities that are available to us at that time. You alluded to this as a good opportunity for us and we'll continue to evaluate and make the right decisions, but at this point in time we have no further comments. Jeff Farmer : Okay, just one other technical question. So certain shareholders exiting the Company over the last several months and I was just curious if that in any way ties your hands from a regulatory standpoint in terms of being more aggressive with share repurchase? Gene Lee : No. Operator : Our next question is coming from Chris O'Cull of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Chris O'Cull: Gene, many restaurants are talking about retooling or changing their value platforms or message because they believe that their message is stale, but do you feel Olive Garden needs to alter or enhance its everyday value platform at all? Gene Lee : I think what we need to focus in on Olive Garden, without talking too much directly to our competitors right now, is continuing to expand the offerings between $10 and $15. We've got the $9.99 platform which really anchors ourselves at dinner, we have the $6.99 at lunch, but we're looking for different ways to deliver value somewhere in that $10 to $15 range to give the consumer just a few more options, and we think we have the innovation to do that. And so we'll continue to focus on that, but back to a statement I made earlier, we're just as focused on other components of value than we are just on price, and Dave and the team are really working on other ways to provide value for the guests. So let me give an example of that. One thing about an Olive Garden where we see the value perceptions go down is how long the people have to wait to come into our restaurant. So what can we do while they are on their way to improve that process? We're starting to play with and test a few things, and if we do it correctly, we actually improve the overall value experience without changing anything else on the menu or pricing. And so we've got to continue to focus on the other components of value where we talk about other components in the numerator and just not focus on what's on the denominator of the value equation. And so we do need to work at certain price points but we do need to execute some of those other variables. Chris O'Cull: Rick, you mentioned commodity inflation as to the first quarter. Is that based on known contract prices or just your anticipation commodities will start to inflate again? Rick Cardenas : So, Chris, we've got about 60% of our coverage for the first half of the year. So we're keeping open in some places, but we're just making the forecast that commodities are going to increase in the back half of the year, on inflation on the commodities. So it depends on when you buy as well. So, we've got just slight commodity inflation in the back half of the year. Chris O'Cull: Is beef a part of that contract you already have for the\u2026? Rick Cardenas : Beef, is beef part of the contract? Yes, we're pretty open in the back half of the year on beef. So we've got, as I said, 60% of our total commodities covered in the first half but 45% of that is beef. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeff Bernstein : Just two questions. One, following up on the balance sheet discussion before and specifically around maybe leverage, it does seem like the industry is ramping up often with the help I guess from franchising or I should say refranchising, which is contrary to Darden which has been paying down, I think you mentioned $1 billion this year, but post the real estate spin and you got the upgrade to the investment-grade, so I'm just wondering maybe you can give an outlook on both fronts, both debt, for your target debt levels and the potential for any refranchising? I think in the past you've mentioned maybe a LongHorn opportunity, but just wondering how you think about that leverage opportunity relative to the conservative level today. Gene Lee : As we've said before, our first priority is to maintain our investment-grade profile and we just were upgraded by all three agencies in the fourth quarter. We think that's great news. Our targeted debt coverage is 2x to 2.5x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, and right now we're at the very low end of that range, and we continue to say we're going to be within that range and we'll continue to demonstrate sound fiscal policy. We're not going to talk much about franchising going forward, but just the 2 to 2.5 is where we expect to be. Jeff Bernstein : Got you. And then just the comment you guys made I think on the unit growth, I guess that was where you were going to fall short potentially in fiscal 2017, at the end of slides you breakout unit growth by brand in terms of expectation. So I was wondering if you can offer a little color again being below your target level. It seemed like Olive Garden and LongHorn are the two brands that are still carrying it in 2017 whereas the other brands that are all doing quite well there's very modest growth. So I'm wondering your outlook for Olive Garden perhaps in future years, whether that's a number that goes up or whether you would expect some of the other brands to start to ramp things up based on their strong performance? Gene Lee : Good question, Jeff. When you turn the development pipeline off, it's pretty difficult to turn it back on. And so we're in the process of turning the development pipeline back on. It's easier and your results come quicker in your casual dining brands, your Olive Garden and your LongHorns. Our specialty brands, it's a longer lead time from a development standpoint. And so we would look for the smaller brands to actually pick up and make up that differential in the gap. We need Yard House to grow at 8% to 10%, we need Seasons to grow at 5% to 8% into the future. We are very pleased with what's going on with Breeze. We need them to \u2013 we're making some commitments there. I would just say, this is just a function of the lead time of the specialty brands and the kind of properties that we need. We're working diligently. We've got the whole development function working on getting us and making sure that we're in range in fiscal 2018. Jeff Bernstein : Understood. And just to clarify the comment earlier about May comps seeing an improvement, I think you said big focus on Mother's Day and otherwise. Was there any shift from a Memorial Day perspective? I know you had said earlier on the call that maybe there was some few different shifts and that hurt you guys. So I'm just wondering Memorial Day specifically in May might have helped. Gene Lee : Memorial Day for the fiscal and the calendar really kind of offset each other. So Memorial Day wasn't really that big of an impact for us. Operator : Our next question is coming from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Karen Holthouse : So another question on the labor line, if you look at it, it seems like your wage inflation outlook has ticked up a little bit from how you were talking about that taking then price down a little bit, cost cuts are slowing. Would the expectation be that you can still leverage the labor line on an overall basis or is it something where we might actually see a little bit of deleverage this year? Gene Lee : I think that we're going to probably not going to see a whole lot of leverage there unless we get outside our sales range. I think that we'll continue to search for our productivity enhancements in the back of the house through our processes and procedures and we'll continue to manage wage rates effectively. We're also going to continue to evaluate how do we improve our overall employment proposition so that we have other ways to attract employees, not just through paying them more in salary. So overall, I think we're looking at this right now to try to hold labor flat throughout the year. Operator : Our next question is coming from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Andrew Barish : Just two quick ones on any daypart commentary or differences, particularly in the Olive Garden business, and then also on Olive Garden where you stand for fiscal 2017 remodels, both as you look at the bars as well as the full remodels? Gene Lee : We're seeing no difference in dayparts, Andy. In Olive Garden, there's a little bit of fluctuation depending on what we're doing and what we did the year before, but overall, when you really look at it on a trailing trend, there's not a lot of noise there. As far as remodels, we're going to do 62 full remodels in 2017 and we've got 155 planned bar refreshes. And just to remind everybody, that's when we go in and we take these bars that don't have very comfortable seating and we put in very comfortable seating, we add TVs, and basically we turn these bar areas that aren't very productive today into productive dining seats, and we're seeing a very small lift, $20,000 or $25,000 investment, and it's more than paying for itself, and it's just, when we go in and do the full remodel and the bar is done, that just means the bar is done and we're not to touch it. Operator : Our next question is coming from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Sara Senatore : Just a couple of follow-up questions, the first on LongHorn, I think you had been saying now for a couple of quarters now that it's a very deliberate decision to try to look at who is profitable in your customer base, but that I think in part you had thought that as you may be, as some of those less profitable customers leave, it makes room for more profitable customers and the higher-margin customers who are not turned away by the lines or the capacity restaurants. But I guess given the traffic is negative, is it going to take a while for that to happen, because it seems like the less profitable customers are leaving but you're not bringing in some of these more profitable customers that I had thought you had in mind who would sort of fill the gap. So I guess I'm just trying to understand the dynamic over the next couple of quarters when that might happen. So that's the LongHorn question and then I do have another follow-up on Olive Garden please. Gene Lee : Okay. When we think about LongHorn \u2013 let's start \u2013 we're still from a guest count basis still 200 basis points above the industry. So we're still taking market share from a guest count standpoint. I think that's in itself very impressive when you look at the rest of the competitive set. We are continuing to make improvements that are going to take quality improvements \u2013 that are going to take time to show through to the guests. We've done some things when the price of beef was increasing that I think hurt the business, but just by changing and we're going back to them tomorrow doesn't mean a guest is going to come the next day. It's going to take time for our guests to come through and have a different experience and grow the business. And so when I look at this business, and this is the one that I am personally the most familiar with, this is a business that has been underperforming from a profitability standpoint and has been run a little differently over the years than I think it should have been run and now we're running it back. This has never been a business that needed a lot of high guest counts to achieve its profitability. These are small boxes. They are designed to put out a strong profitable return, and then when that business building gets full, you build another building 4 miles down the road. And you look at how this business is really set up in Atlanta where we have 45 restaurants. There's no one in dining, casual dining, that comes close to having the kind of penetration we have with this strategy that we put in place there. And so we are back to building smaller restaurants and focused on ensuring that we are getting the right profitability from those units. We are going to make strategic choices to improve the overall quality of the experience. It's going to take time for those things to get into the consumer, for the consumer to see those, and then start improving their frequency or reaching other guests that we weren't reaching because of our advertising and how we were talking about the brand. And so I'm really confident directionally about where we are going and this business is contributing now at a much more, at a level that's I think appropriate where it has under-contributed. Even though it was growing sales all these quarters, it wasn't making any money. Sara Senatore : And then just on Olive Garden, you had mentioned meaningful operations improvement you can still capture. Can you talk about what that looks like and is that more about top line or efficiency around the cost line? Just as I think about all that you've done so far, there's been a lot of, a tremendous amount of change it feels like at Olive Garden. So I'm just trying to understand maybe what's left in terms of a driver of the business going forward. Gene Lee : When I think about meaningful, I think about it on a few different dimensions, but first, I think that we still break down too many times in Olive Garden where somewhere in the service experience we have a deficiency, whether it's the timing wasn't right, the server didn't get to the table at the right time, the food didn't come out right. When you're talking about the number of guests that we serve, improving that by 1% or 2% has a significant impact on improving our same-restaurant sales. And so we think about just consistently delivering a better experience. I think that's the number one opportunity for us. We've still got room to improve on production and menu simplification. Some of the recipes are still complex and Dave and the team are thinking about it every day, how do I make that less complex to be able to deliver that to the consumer? There's labor productivity opportunities. We still, in a system the size of Olive Garden, we can see in our own data we have opportunities for certain restaurants to improve food productivity. Sometimes, and what the team has done a really great job was, they just haven't gone to the lower volume restaurants. Some of the time, the opportunity, the most opportunity we have within our higher-volume restaurants. And so they are developing ways to analyze and really discern where are my real opportunities to improve productivity. There are some controllable costs and management of controllable costs that still we have people that don't perform at the same level as others. So there's executional opportunity there. And then lastly, we still think we can execute To Go better and we think that that's a huge opportunity for us. As well as we're doing, we believe there's an opportunity to improve that even further. Sara Senatore : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Andrew Strelzik : Just had a bigger picture question on to-go and delivery. We're hearing a number of concepts across the industry talk about focusing on delivery and to-go and putting up very nice growth rates like yourselves. So I'm wondering, over the next couple of years how you're thinking that this plays out. I mean is this a kind of rising tide lifts all boats type of equation where we are giving guest something that they've been looking for and so broadly this was going to work, or is there something specific to Darden, and where do you think those eating occasions are coming from, is it all coming from eating at home or how do you think this plays out over time? Gene Lee : Good question. I do think there's an opportunity for everybody in the industry to capture this. Where we believe that Olive Garden is better situated is the kind of food that we serve. And so, if you are Bar & Grill, it's not like you can put 20 hamburgers in a container and send the rolls home and have them put everything together and still have a quality product, but we can send at home pans of lasagne, pans of chicken parmesan. I think the style of food that we serve really lends itself to this trend that's taking place. And so I think at Olive Garden we are better situated. We're seeing to-go sales increase in LongHorn but we don't believe \u2013 we need to go with what the consumer wants there but we don't believe we have a platform to really in LongHorn with the style of food to be able to push that to a 20% of our overall business, where we think that it's something that Olive Garden has a real capability. Third-party delivery is something that's going to evolve, that's going to affect the overall industry, and there are a lot of big names out there trying to figure out how they are going to come up with a solution to solve this problem, and I would say that's a stay tuned because there's just a lot of activity there with the big one but there's a lot of dollars for our Company. And I won't mention any names, if they can come up with a solution for us and for a casual dining and Olive dining, there's some money to be made there. Operator : Our next question is coming from Steve Anderson of Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Stephen Anderson : Embedded in your guidance, what number are you looking at for interest expense for the full year? Rick Cardenas : For interest expense for the year, so we've got another reduction of \u2013 interest about $45 million I think for the year, which means it's $26 million less next year than it was this year. Operator : Our next question is coming from Joshua Long of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Joshua Long : My question was on the technology update and just really the technology opportunity. You mentioned that Ziosk has already been a sales driver for you. So I was curious, just in kind of what capacity or what inning you think you are in terms of being able to turn on those features? You have it rolled out to the restaurants, so I'm sure you're still going through and learning how to use it not only from a guest perspective but maybe there might be an opportunity for it to help with labor-management or things in back-of-the-house that the guests doesn't see. So just curious on where you are with that update and kind of what the opportunities might be to layer on additional features going forward in 2017 and beyond? Gene Lee : Sure. So we haven't wrapped yet on our implementation of Ziosk. So we still have a little bit to go and a lot more training to do to teach the servers and the teams how to use that most effectively to improve the service experience for the guests. As we've said, the benefit of that device isn't \u2013 we're not expecting to take labor out of the system because of the device. We expect to continue to increase sales. We get a lot of data from our guests. Many more of them are filling out the surveys, so we learn a lot more. And it actually improves the biggest pain point that a guest has, is paying at the table. So we believe that we're still early stages of getting all of the benefits from the Ziosk device that we can get, as we build on other things from that device. Again, nothing in the back-of-the-house that would be saved from that. We're thinking about looking at loyalty and how do we use loyalty with Ziosk, but we're still in the very early stages of that as well. But we're learning some things that we can use to use that for training and other things. So, still a long way to go there but we feel really good about where we are. Joshua Long : That's helpful. Thank you. How much of the system has Ziosk or maybe at Olive Garden has Ziosk right now and kind of what's the expected rollout for 2017? Gene Lee : At Olive Garden, 100% of the system has Ziosk. We're looking at it to see if it makes sense in other brands, but right now Olive Garden is the brand that we're focusing most on for the Ziosk. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Jake Bartlett : The question just is on delivery. In the last quarter you talked about how much it contributed to comps. I'm wondering how much it contributed in the fourth quarter as well as maybe what we should expect in 2017. Rick Cardenas : Delivery was not a very big part of our overall To-Go. So we just actually launched, rolled out catering delivery, just about a week ago, and seeing some pretty good results there. But again, the delivery part of our \u2013 I'm sorry, the online catering, I'm sorry \u2013 online catering, seeing some good results there, but delivery isn't a tremendous part of our To-Go business. It's still growing. Jake Bartlett : Actually I meant catering. Rick Cardenas : Catering, okay, that's what I thought. Catering is about 25% of our overall To Go, and not all of that is delivery. So when we talk about catering, it also means people can come in and get a big order and take it with them. Jake Bartlett : Okay. And then in 2017, I mean is there any reason we shouldn't expect To-Go to continue to grow at this rate and kind of have the similar contribution to comps? Gene Lee : I can say that we launched To Go Online two years ago in July and we saw a 20% increase in the first year and 20% increase in the second year. I can't tell you that we'll see 20% increase in the third year. However, we continue to improve our To Go experience and convenience is a big driver of our To Go experience. I will say on the catering side, the deliveries that we are doing, we're getting almost 100% of the people saying that they are going to reorder, they're going to do this again. So as that becomes bigger and bigger, it will become a bigger and bigger part of our pie. So we would continue to expect delivery and catering and To Go to grow for us. And I think we have said in the past that we expect To Go to be in the long run 20% of our business. Jake Bartlett : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : I see no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Mandy. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind everyone that we expect to release our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter results on Tuesday, October 4 before the market opens \u2013 excuse me, that's first quarter fiscal 2017 results, with the conference call to follow on. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed earlier today, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and a reconciliation of these measurements is included in the presentation. We plan to release FY 2017 second quarter earnings on December 20 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights. Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results from the first quarter and update our outlook for FY 2017. And then Gene will have some closing remarks before we open the call for your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Gene. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: [Technical Difficulty] \u2026keep going -- cultivate our results-oriented people culture to enable growth. We remain confident that we have the right strategies in place, both in the operating businesses and at the Darden level. And we continue to significantly increase market share as we execute against them. Olive Garden's positive momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 410 basis points. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. The primary drivers of this performance include; one, our ongoing focus on flawless execution inside the restaurants. Our teams are working hard to get better every day which is reflected by the fact that our overall guest satisfaction scores rose to an all-time high during the quarter. Two, the strong performance of OG ToGo. ToGo sales grew 20% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a three-year basis. And, three, culinary innovation. During the quarter we introduced dishes that build on brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, including pepperoni fettuccini and Italian pot pies. Additionally, we continue to interact with our guests in a variety of ways. During the summer we surprised and delighted many guests by setting up our never-ending family table in multiple states across the country. It debuted at the High Line in New York City where we served 6,000 guests in four hours. This type of non-traditional marketing is popular with Millennials and leverages Olive Garden's strong emotional connection. The Olive Garden business is strong, and we remain laser focused on delivering exceptional experience for our guests. LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its top line momentum and delivered significant profit growth during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 0.6%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 270 basis points. We continue to focus on strengthening our in-restaurant execution to improve the guest experience. One way we are doing this is through operation simplification, which enables our team members to better focus on delivering a quality experience for our guests. Another way we're strengthening in-restaurant execution is through enhanced training for all culinary team members because we know perfectly grilled steaks are critical to a great steakhouse experience. This came to light during the quarter through our Steak Masters Challenge, a highly engaging training program and two month competition that began with 6,000 culinary team members and ended with the grill master Alex Alvarado being crowned as Steak Master champion. The team at LongHorn is focused on the right priorities and our research shows that we're making meaningful progress on multiple fronts. Turning to our specialty restaurants; all five of our businesses continue to perform well and increase share, and each one is well positioned for growth as we build out our pipeline. The Bahama Breeze team delivered another strong quarter. Same-restaurant sales were up 3.9% as guests continued to respond positively to the enhancements we're making to create an immersive experience that feels like a tropical getaway. Seasons 52 performed well with same-restaurant sales up 0.7%. We continue to be a leader in culinary innovation and the restaurant of choice for guests who are conscientious about what they eat but are not willing to compromise taste. Same-restaurant sales were flat at Yard House. I really like what the team is working on as Mike Kneidinger gets further immersed in the business. Finally, The Capital Grille and Eddie V's same-restaurant sales were down 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively, wrapping on 7.2% and 5.1% same-restaurant sales growth last year. Not only did we anticipate this was going to be a difficult wrap for both brands, Texas continues to be a tough market for our fine dining brands. However, if you normalize for Memorial Day, which was observed in Q1 of this year but Q4 of fiscal 2015, the Capital Grille would have been positive. Now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail. Ricardo Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's first-quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. We returned more than a $0.25 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of more than $70 million in dividends and approximately $196 million in share repurchases. And as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to $500 million of Darden's outstanding common stock. This plan does not have an expiration date and it replaces the previous plan. For clarity, we repurchased an additional $4 million worth of shares in the first week of the second quarter, which were still under the prior authorization, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $200 million. As a reminder, while our long-term framework reflects share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million per year, the actual amount of shares we repurchase in any given year could be higher or lower than that range, just like any of the elements in our framework. Looking at key drivers of our earnings performance for the first quarter, we had sales leverage from our positive same-restaurant sales of 1.3%, a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1.5% deflation in food and beverage expense, continued progress leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings throughout the P&L, and approximately 170 basis points of incremental restaurant rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. Excluding these costs, the restaurant expense line would have been approximately 10 basis points favorable to last year. In addition, below the restaurant level EBITDA line, we had depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions, a planned gain of approximately $8 million, primarily related to the sale and closure of one Bahama Breeze restaurant. This transaction occurred in the first month of the fiscal quarter and was contemplated in the full fiscal 2017 earnings outlook we provided in June. And legal expenses that were unfavorable to our expectations by approximately $3 million, along with $2 million of support center rent expense and other taxes related to the sale leaseback.  Excluding these expenses, G&A as a percent of total sales would have been 40 basis points favorable to last year's adjusted G&A expense. Turning to segment performance, as a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit for the quarter includes incremental rent and other tax expense of $29 million. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. Olive Garden segment profit margin of 19.4% was 90 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 140 basis points higher than last year. LongHorn Steakhouse continues to strengthen its business model, improving segment profit margin by 70 basis points this quarter to 15.6%, even with a headwind of 150 basis points related to additional rent expenses. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit margin increased 220 basis points at LongHorn. Segment profit margin declined 90 basis points to 14.8% in our fine dining segment. Although margins were lower due to negative same-restaurant sales in the quarter, they were flat when excluding incremental rent expense and preopening costs, primarily related to two new Capital Grille openings in the quarter. Our other business segment profit margins were down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis, as additional rents drove 60 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit margin at our other business was 50 basis points higher than last year. Turning to our annual outlook, we increased our fiscal 2017 annual earnings per share range to be between $3.87 to $3.97, from our previous $3.80 to $3.90. This reflects an updated diluted average share count for the year of approximately 126 million shares, primarily as a result of higher than anticipated share repurchases in the first quarter as we took advantage of volatility in our stock price. All other aspects of our fiscal 2017 outlook remain unchanged, including our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% and 2%. And while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I do want to remind you of a few timing-related factors that impact our quarter-to-quarter performance and comparisons to the prior year, specifically in the second quarter. First, in November we will lap the completion of our real estate transactions last year. As such, we will incur approximately two-thirds of the incremental quarterly rent and depreciation impact we've been experiencing. However, we will have essentially a full quarter's of interest savings relative to last year as most of the debt reduction related to our real estate transactions didn't occur until early in last year's third quarter. Additionally, the G&A expense in the second quarter of last year was abnormally low due to a favorable legal settlement of approximately $13 million that we do not expect to recur. Finally, this favorable settlement was partially offset by approximately $8 million in asset impairments in the second quarter of last year, which is reported on the impairments line of our financial statements. As Gene mentioned, we are confident we have the right strategies in place. This is clearly evident in our sales outperformance versus the industry, while our teams continue to better manage their businesses and leverage Darden's scale to improve profitability. We continue to believe Darden represents an attractive investment, given our strong cash flow generation, our investment grade credit rating with a compelling dividend yield, which is 3.65% based on yesterday's closing price, and, as we laid out in our long-term framework, our expectations for 10% to 15% total shareholder return over time. And with that, I will turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Thanks, Rick. I was informed that I had a problem with my microphone as I opened. So I'm going to summarize my opening comments before I close. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance and the progress we made against our strategic initiatives in the quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, an increase of 1.6%. Same-restaurant sales grew 1.3%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 340 basis points. And earnings per share were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings. So overall, Q1 was a good quarter for us. Our strategy's working. We continue to grow share, improve margins and make meaningful investments in our business, while returning capital to shareholders. It was also an important time of year for us as we held our annual leadership conferences for each business. These conferences allow us to get in front of every General Manager and Managing Partner across our 1,539 restaurants to align on our plans for the year and generate a lot of excitement. For me personally, aside from being in our restaurants day-to-day, it's one of the things I enjoy most about my job. It's a great chance to engage with our leaders and listen to those closest to the action. It also confirmed for me that our result-oriented people culture is truly what sets us apart. Our restaurant teams and our restaurant support center staff are the best in the business. And I take great pride in the fact that our team member turnover continues to be flat year-over-year, which reflects our compelling employment proposition.  So I'll close by saying thank you to our team members who are at the heart of everything we do. And now we'll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris O'Cull, KeyBanc. Your line is you now open. Chris O'Cull: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Gene, on the last call you indicated less menu pricing for the year than I believe what was maybe taken this first quarter. Has your thinking changed or do you expect less pricing in future quarters? And then I have a follow-up. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Good morning, Chris. I think we expect to price less in the back half of the year than we did in the front half of the year, as we had some pricing from the third and fourth quarter last year that's still on the menu that we haven't lapped yet. Chris O'Cull: Okay. And then I know there had been some traffic growth embedded in the 1% to 2% comp guidance. But can't you achieve the guided range with slightly negative traffic and less pricing, given the contribution you're seeing from the off-premise sales growth? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Yes, I think that's true. I think that we're also having some more success with our add-on sales and other things that we're doing. But when you look at the Olive Garden number, you've got about between 50 to 60 basis points in there of mix that's really guest count, so it should be associated with guest counts. Chris O'Cull: With the catering business? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Yes, with anything that's -- anything that's large container. So when we sell a pan of lasagna, we're not giving [ph] ourselves any guests. Chris O'Cull: Okay. That's right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Levy, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brett Levy : Good morning. Can you please give us a little bit of incrementality on what you're thinking about the competitive landscape, and why Olive Garden performed so much better than the others, and, really, where you saw the pockets of softness across the other brands, whether it be on the value, the premium sides and regionality? Thank you. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Well I think I'd start, let me start pretty broad, Brett, and then I'll get down into our brands. I think the consumer environment, it continues to be difficult. I think there's a lot of choices the consumer has with their discretionary income. And I think restaurants are competing against a lot of those other choices, not just restaurants. I think restaurants today have to stay -- they have to stay relevant, and they need to continue to invest in the experience. And I believe that this quarter of outperformance has less to do with what we did this quarter but more to do with what we've done over the last two years to improve the overall experience in Olive Garden.  We've been on this plan now for almost three years since Dave George has been involved, and everything cumulatively is adding up to our competitive advantage that we have in Olive Garden, which is value. And I think our advertising's relevant. I think, most importantly, we're running better restaurants today than we were in the past. And as you all know, this is a momentum business and I think this business has that momentum right now. When I look at what you call weaknesses in the other business -- I'm not sure I want to use that word -- I think our businesses performed well. We had big gaps in the marketplace. And I think LongHorn had a really good quarter. When we look at LongHorn, we're giving you segment earnings now, we need to look at that number, the overall performance of that business is up. We needed that business to contribute more from an earnings standpoint. We're getting that. And I'm pleased with that. When I look at -- let me give you a little bit of color, just based on geographic. Texas it still, it continues to be an area where we struggle. I would say Olive Garden continues to hold its own in Texas but the momentum has slidden there, too. Brett Levy : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Buckley, Bank of America. Your line is now open. Joseph Buckley : Hi. Thank you. First, a bookkeeping question. The $7.8 million gain, is that the normalized tax effect against that? Is that in effect about $0.05 a share in EPS? Ricardo Cardenas : Joe, that's about $0.04 in EPS -- $0.03 to $0.04 in EPS. Joseph Buckley : Okay. And then curious on the off-premise, if you could elaborate a little bit on that, how it's breaking down between ToGo and catering, if delivery's playing into that. And I realize the -- I expect, maybe I don't realize -- I expect the mix is going to vary somewhat seasonally by quarter. Could you share with us what the mix of off-premise was in this quarter? Ricardo Cardenas : No, I'm really not going to share the mix for competitive reasons. Let me say that we've identified convenience as a huge opportunity. We've demonstrated that we've been able to pull that lever, take out \u2013 altogether it is -- up 50% over the last three years. What I will say is that we have momentum in the catering and delivery space but I'm not going to break down the components of our ToGo for competitive reasons. Joseph Buckley : Okay. And maybe just one more then on LongHorn. Can you talk about what you're doing competitively? It seemed like the email coupons picked up during the quarter. Again, maybe that's seasonal, or I didn't know if you were getting a little bit more aggressive perhaps than you had been in the past couple of quarters. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Yes, let me address that because this is a strategy that we're implementing. We're executing this holistic marketing strategy and looking at all the tools we have available to us. As part of that, we've increased our digital spending in conjunction with our promotional strategy, which is really less broad scale discounting, and while using more targeted incentives to create value. And you can see the results of that as you look at our check average over time. We're not giving up check average as we shift incentives from free-standing inserts to digital. Digital's a much more cost effective way to reach your consumer. As you take the value away from these price points and promotions, which were deep in LongHorn over the years, and you shift it to more of a targeted digital incentive, we think that's a much better way to go after this, and I think we can see it in our financial performance. I would also just say the landscape on advertising and marketing is changing dramatically and we are constantly trying to find new ways and using our data scientists to analyze what is going on and what is the most cost-effective way to deliver the appropriate value to the right guests at the right time. We will continue to evolve this over the next probably 24 to 36 months as the environment continues to change. Joseph Buckley : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tarantino, Baird. Your line is now open. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. Gene, my question is about Olive Garden's relative performance versus the industry. If I look at the past several quarters, it looks like you saw a very sharp acceleration in the middle two quarters of last year in terms of your relative performance. My question is really about your degree of confidence in sustaining the type of relative performance you've been seeing in the upcoming quarters, given how difficult the comparisons are starting to get. And then I have a brief follow-up. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: That's a pretty tough question, David, in all honesty. We think that we're doing the right things. We're starting with focusing on the basics of the operation. I'm really impressed with Dan Kiernan, our head of operations and what he's done with that team to keep them motivated on trying to improve. Our guest feedback is at its highest levels ever. We think our promotional strategy moving forward is sound. But do I feel confident that we're going to continue to outperform at the levels we've outperformed? I'm not sure. We're going to do the best we can but I can't predict that. I think we've got a good plan. I think we've done our work over the last few years and we'll continue to do our work. So, I think we're well positioned, but those are big hurdles to get over. David Tarantino : Great. Then the quick follow-up, Gene, are you assuming that the industry trends get a little better than they have been recently or are you assuming more of the same as you look at the balance of the fiscal year? And then maybe the second part of the question is what do you think is needed for the industry trends to get better than what we've seen recently? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: I think there's a lot in that question, David. I would say that, as we think about the industry, we are preparing -- we prepare our plans, we assume the industry's going to stay where the industry's going to stay. We're not assuming that the industry's going to get a whole lot better. I would say that my message to our team's let's focus on what we can control, running great restaurants and delivering great food service and atmosphere. I think there's some real uncertainty in the near term here but that's going to pass from a consumer standpoint. We're focused on the long term. When you think about what's it going to take to move the whole industry, I don't know, I still look at there's a lot of great brands out there doing great things, growing sales and growing new restaurants and same-restaurant sales. I think they're well positioned. They've got good value equations. I'm hoping that some more inventory will come out of the system. We've seen some big announcements of closures lately. And I also think there's other -- as you drive down the road, you're starting to see more restaurants close. You're also seeing more restaurants open. But we could use some inventory to come out. That would be helpful. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sara Senatore, Bernstein. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Stephanie representing Sara Senatore. Good morning. A question on LongHorn. A lot of the conversation this quarter has been focused on gaining a certain mix of profitable customers. Now that you've had a bit of time to assess the data and the P&L and work on the strategy, has the profitability mix responded in the way that you expected it to? And if low beef prices were to persist, does this strategy still make sense? Thank you. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Yes, I think we're thrilled with the performance of LongHorn. Profitability has come back to historic norms. We've had 14 consecutive quarters of same-restaurant sales growth, significant outperformance over that time period, over the industry. So we've taken a lot of share. So we feel good about where we're at, at this point in time. We'll continue to make investments. Yesterday, we made some huge investments into our business in LongHorn. We actually went back and increased the size of a couple of our steak [ph] that we felt we needed to and make that investment to get the quality where we need it to be. We improved our house salad yesterday. So, we're making investments in that business. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And a quick follow-up -- could you update us on your commodity outlook and if you're still expecting a return to inflation after this quarter; and, on a similar note, what that means for price competition within in the context of this environment? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: I heard the commodity outlook question. I didn't hear the second part of your question. Can you repeat that? Unidentified Analyst : I was asking if you could update us on the commodity outlook and if you're still expecting a return to inflation after this quarter, and if you could talk about what that means for price competition. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Okay. We still expect commodities to inflate in the back half of the year, more towards the fourth quarter. But we do expect commodities to be flat to low single digits unfavorable for the year. And, as I said, this quarter we had 150 basis points of commodity deflation. So, you would see that we'd have some inflation in the back half of the year. What does that mean to pricing? We still believe that we have the pricing strategy that's correct for us. Overall inflation for us, when you include labor and other things, is still going to be 1.5% to 2%. So, even though commodities are down in the beginning of the year and they're inflating in the back half, overall for the year we expect total inflation of 1.5% to 2%. As that relates to pricing, as we said, we expect to be in the low end of our 1% to 2% pricing this year. Olive Garden has taken their pricing action for the year already. And LongHorn just did this week -- earlier this month, I'm sorry. And so we don't expect to do much more with pricing for the rest of the year unless something dramatically changes. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh, Stephens. Your line is now open. Billy Sherrill : Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Billy on for Will. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the labor line. You mentioned again last quarter the labor market remains tight across many of your markets. Do you have any updated thoughts that might be helpful for us? And should we still be thinking about that 2.5% to 3.5% wage inflation as appropriate, even headed into this new calendar year? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Yes, it's a good question. I think that your 3% assumption for wage rate in the back half of the year is probably the right assumption. The market continues to tighten. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're holding turnover flat year over year. We've got a strong employment proposition. Our people like what we do. We're a place people want to work. And so we'll continue to monitor the environment. We've changed some of our processes and procedures around hiring to help enable our restaurant managers to do a better job. And most importantly, we'll continue to look for ways to improve productivity at the restaurant level. I've said it for two years now, simplicity is a key to success in this business. We've made these businesses too complicated and we can get productivity enhancements as we simplify. Billy Sherrill : Thanks. That's helpful. And then just one more if I could, kind of taking a step back. I wanted to ask on possible acquisition opportunities. Do you guys have any updated thoughts here? Lately as we've seen valuations come in across the space, your balance sheet seems to be in a good place. So I guess, is there any reason why something like that would be off the table if a good opportunity presented itself? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: As I've said in the past, the management team and the Board will regularly evaluate all the alternatives open to us to achieve our financial goals and we will continue to do that. I'm not going to make any further comment than that. Billy Sherrill : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Jay, we are ready for our next caller. Operator : Yes, our next question comes from David Palmer, RBC. Your line is now open. David Palmer : Thank you. Gene, first a follow-up on Joe's question earlier. Last quarter the take-out catering mix was a little under 11%. Are you updating that number? Can you give that number for the quarter? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Total take-out was 11%, it was 11% of the business. David Palmer : Thank you. And the discount that I was getting on our adjusted email list -- and I know we're a sample of one and we were seeing online orders that was being marketed at 20% discount versus the traditional pricing. It seems like an important initiative for Olive Garden to get people into that habit, at least for take-out. Can you maybe walk us through the rationale of doing discounts like that? Perhaps it just makes sense on a mix basis given the saved labor and other, and maybe there's a growing base of web marketing that you can get from that. And then if I could squeeze one more in, is online ordering of delivery for individual orders in your future and how distant could that be? Thanks. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: A lot there. Let me deal with the first one and hopefully I'll remember the second one. We believe that it's important to move as many people as we possibly can over to online ordering. We've talked about the importance of that because the average check is much higher when someone orders online and we can prompt them through that order. But secondarily, from an operations standpoint it's really important, if we can move people off the phone taking orders to serving guests in the restaurant, that's really helpful. And when you think about, we have a ToGo specialist, one, two or three, and they're on the phone taking an order and there's a guest in front of them, the priority becomes the guest in front of them, not the person on the phone. So we feel like the service experience is a lot better as we move people to online. And we will continue to incentivize people to get in that habit. And we believe that the 20% discount, to do that is well worth it until we can change the behavior. The second question was individual order delivery. Yes, we will continue -- we are monitoring what is going on in that space. We are intimately involved with the big players that are in that space. They need us, we need them. We're going to proceed with caution. However, individual delivery orders are coming in the future somehow, some way. We just don't know who's going to be our partner, what the economics are going to be at this time. David Palmer : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Karen Holthouse, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Karen Holthouse : Hi. Another question on the ToGo business. As you started to move people onto a digital platform and have a little bit better sort of tracking of who's ordering what, do you have any numbers around frequency you'd be willing to share, or any suggestion that people are using large order delivery or large order take-out as almost a home meal replacement option versus a catering occasion? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: I'm not going to get into a whole lot of detail, again, for competitive reasons. But they are using it for all different occasions. They're using it as a whole meal replacement. They're using it -- catering's a big word, but you've got a minimum of $125, I believe, on the Olive Garden take-out. Some families that's a family meal, if it's a large family. So it's being used for all sorts of occasions. I would tell you that the satisfaction rate is incredibly high for anybody that uses these services. Obviously we're trying to monitor every single event and trying to get feedback from the consumer. But right now the consumer feedback is extremely high and they're very satisfied. Karen Holthouse : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just on the financial stuff, what's your calculated debt-to-EBITDAR ratio today? And how does that relate to your targeted range? And if it's below your targeted range, could you dip into this low interest revolver you have? I think you have $750 million of untapped availability there. Could you dip into that to help accelerate these repurchases? Ricardo Cardenas : Hey, Brian. It's Rick. Our debt-to-EBITDAR ratio right now is slightly under 2% and our long-term framework is 2% to 2.5%. We do have a $750 million revolver. That doesn't mean that we're going to dip into it. We'll continue to work with the Board on figuring out what the best use of our capital is. If the stock price becomes volatile, we'll take advantage of that. But that's probably about as far as we'll go in talking about how much we're going to buy back. Brian Bittner : Okay. Just going back to this ToGo business, I think it's probably one of the main incremental drivers to your outperformance against the industry. And just still trying to fully understand what it is that sets you so far apart in this piece of your business relative to your competitors. Obviously the food appears to be more portable than others. But if you could just maybe hit a little bit more on what it is that you're doing to drive the incrementality there, and what's setting you apart on the ToGo business versus your peers. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: I think you hit on one of the most important ones, which is that the food travels really well. But I also think it's important to note that Olive Garden is under-indexed on Italian take-out for a long time. We think it was a huge opportunity for us to really promote and make people aware of what's available. And I think we're still, we're scratching the surface on how we market this and I think the opportunity is large. When you think about, even when we look at our other businesses and what the take-out opportunities are, they're not as great. Olive Garden, because of the food, you can you do a pan of lasagna, you can do a pan of fettuccini Alfredo. The cuisine lends itself to a take-out type of event. I think that's part of why we're having so much success there. We've got food, we under-indexed, and I think we're marketing it very effectively. And we've got a consumer that wants it. The consumer wants the convenience. Brian Bittner : As you go forward and continue to talk to us about ToGo, is catering going to be lumped into the ToGo conversation? Are those all going to be talked about as one? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Yes, Brian, they're all one. I really want to reel this in for competitive reasons. Brian Bittner : Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco, Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. I have a question about the other side of the outperformance. I guess if you look, both brands seem to have, both LongHorn and Olive Garden, seem to have outperformed roughly about 200 basis points if you wipe away the benefit that you're getting from the growth, the 20% growth in take-out and catering. So I guess is that a reflection of not only the value but is that also a reflection of dinner? If you could talk about what you're seeing across the industry, both your brands have historically indexed a little bit more towards dinner than some of your Malcolm Knapp casual dining peer group. So I'm curious if the competition seems to be a little bit heavier that you're seeing at the lunch day part. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Actually, we're seeing some decent growth at Olive Garden for lunch. I think if you go to an Olive Garden, you look at our lunch menu, there's only five or six price points on the front of that menu, except for the bottom part, and they're all below $9.99 in most parts of the country. So we've seen some good growth there at lunch. And dinner remains strong. I hate to keep pivoting back to this. I know that you guys don't like to hear it. But we're so focused on improving the restaurant visit for the guest at each individual restaurant. Operations is driving some of this growth. I can't emphasize that enough. This is a very difficult business to execute at a broad level. And we've done a great job focusing our teams on that. And I think that's what's driving growth. Matthew DiFrisco : That's great. Also, can you just talk a little bit about, as far as if I look at the margin side, when do we get to the point, or are we at the point, where take-out is, across the board, sort of being agnostic as to whether it's a order pick-up or catering, is it a higher margin than your in-store visit even with the potential discounting or marketing needed to drive the business? Are we seeing this as a positive flow-through on the margins, as well, on the mix effect? Ricardo Cardenas : Yes, Matt, this is Rick. We're still saying that our margins are neutral to what our in-restaurants are. A lot of it is because of the alcohol and the other beverages that you can sell in restaurants. Even though we do have a higher check on our ToGo business, we've got a lower margin on the food than on the alcohol. Matthew DiFrisco : And then just a last follow-up on that, where do you stand as far as testing across some markets, potentially delivery with some third parties? Ricardo Cardenas : We're testing. We're looking at different third parties. We're not really wanting to talk about our testing for competitive reasons. But as Gene mentioned, we're talking to a lot of these deliverers to see which one is going to win out. Matthew DiFrisco : Is it meaningful, though, to the growth that you're seeing now across enough stores that it's affecting the year-over-year growth rate that you're seeing in take-out and off-premise? Ricardo Cardenas : No, no. The only delivery that's meaningful in our growth is our catering delivery that we're doing ourselves. Matthew DiFrisco : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Glass, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. John Glass : Thanks very much. Gene, food deflation, and particularly food at home deflation, has been cited as one of the key reasons why restaurant sales have been weak recently. And that makes sense sort of intellectually, but I don't think I've ever really seen it happen, at least to this extent. So do you believe in that? Do you see it in your own data when you either talk to customers or survey customers that they're actually preferring to eat at home now instead of dining out because of that? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: John, obviously I was prepared for that question because it's being asked a lot of my peers. The way I think about this, John, it has to be a headwind for the entire industry. When I say the industry, I'm lumping fast food and other pieces in there. It's really hard for me to quantify the impact on casual dining. When I take the week-to-week noise out of the benchmarks, casual dining's down a little bit more than 1%, whether you look at it from a 13-week or 26-week or 52-week trend. So, when I look back over the year, as this spread has started to happen, I haven't seen a whole lot of difference in the trend. There's noise week to week but I like looking at these benchmarks on more of a trend to see what's happening, and try not to get too excited about what goes on week to week. I just have a hard time, when you think about our brands, that, where they're experiential, that people are trading out and staying home because they can get their groceries a little bit cheaper. I'm just having a hard time with that. John Glass : Got it. You mentioned some of the higher end brands that struggled. Do you see the higher-end consumer in, say, Olive Garden or LongHorn changing their behavior? If you look at your customers by that segment, are they ordering less or visiting less, maybe you're picking up lower-end consumers, or maybe you're getting the benefit of trade-down? How do you see the high end interacting with your main brands? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: I don't see, really, any interaction there. I don't see any change in behavior. I think when we look at The Capital Grille sales for the quarter, the one thing I didn't mention in my prepared remarks, we had some shift in the restaurant charity weeks that moved back into September, which are huge weeks for us. So those businesses, when you look at them on a longer-term trend, are performing really well. So I don't see any change in the upscale consumer behavior at this point in time, other than Texas. Texas continues to be weak. We're going to lap that here pretty shortly. But I haven't seen any -- it's not like the higher-end consumer is trading down. I think -- we look at -- again we set out two years ago to try to increase frequency in Olive Garden. We thought that was the play. We thought we spent too much time trying to increase our reach. We went back to try to increase our frequency and stay focused on our core. I think that's what we're doing. We're driving more core business. John Glass : Got it. And, Rick, just one quick one. You mentioned the one-time gain this quarter was in your guidance. I just feel compelled to ask, is there anything else in that guidance that we may not normally anticipate for the balance of the year? Ricardo Cardenas : Other than the things that I told you that happened last year, I wouldn't see there's anything very different than normal year-to-year stuff. John Glass : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein at Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, Gene, just on the comp trends, I'm just wondering from your seat, the sequential trends you look at, and I know we talked about shifts this year and last, more so last I guess, but would you say that trends through this quarter, ex those shifts were stable, or perhaps you saw any kind of trend one way or the other? I think you also mentioned something about when you think about the broader category that you're competing against broader consumer discretionary. So I'm just wondering, when you put that aside for a second, just from your restaurant peers how would you assess that competitive landscape, whether it's getting better or worse in terms of the discounting. And then I had a follow-up. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Jeff, I would say, again, I think, when you look at month to month, we've got promotional changes in there where we've got different tests going on with incentives. So, I don't get too worried about what's going on month to month. I'm kept fairly well informed of exactly what's in market and being tested and what to expect. We're pretty good at predicting when we're going to be a little bit weaker versus last year and then when we're going to make it up. When you look at LongHorn for the quarter we are right on our plan. We planned to be at 0.6% and we were at 0.6%. We nailed the plan based on what we're doing with the marketing schedule.  As far as the competitors, there's a lot of talk about it being very promotional. I would just urge you to go back and look at the benchmarks and see that there's still a 2% to 2.5% gap between -- we phrase it this way -- the consumer's paying 2.5% more this year than they did last year. And that's been true for seven years. For me, we haven't really seen a real promotional environment since the great recession. There was an 18-month period there where we saw a lot of promotional activity when check average was actually less than guest counts. But since then we've been adding between 2% and 3% to the consumer every single month. People say it's promotional. I'm not so sure that the consumer believes it's promotional because they're still paying 2.5% more. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. And then just to clarify, I know in your slide deck you talked about the cost saves. I think you said $30 million in fiscal 2017. I'm just wondering whether you can provide any color in terms of the components of that. Are we now going forward in a state where we should be expecting savings in that range, and the low-hanging fruit of the $100 million-and-some-odd over the past couple years are now in the past, and this is the new normal run rate? Ricardo Cardenas : Jeff, just big picture on the cost saves, since Gene's been the CEO, we've taken about $160 million out of costs out of the business. Yes, a lot of that was early low-hanging fruit. We're continuing to look for other areas of productivity enhancements that we can get. We do expect $30 million this fiscal year. And as we said in June, if we get more than $30 million, we'll decide whether we want to reinvest those savings into our consumers so that we can improve our value perceptions. But we're going to continue every year to look for more productivity enhancements. I can't tell you what the savings will be in 2018 and 2019. We are still working through those. But if we have an update we'll give you one when we have one. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason West, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jason West : Yes, thanks. Just one quick one first and then a follow-up. You guys mentioned the Memorial Day shift, I think, impacted the fine dining business in the quarter. But it didn't sound like it impacted any of the other brands. Can you just explain what happened there? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: It was de minimis in the other brands. It was almost 100 basis points in Capital Grille approximately. But the other brands were de minimis. Jason West : Okay. Got it. And then just big picture, on the two big brands there, you saw some strength at the end of the quarter in August. Could you try to just clarify how much of that was maybe promotional timing, things like that, maybe the pricing timing, versus if you are seeing any signs of improvement out there with just the general consumer, would be helpful? Thanks. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: I wouldn't read too much into August. Schools start differently every year, the calendar, we had some promotional changes. There was a lot going on in August. And we could tell in certain areas what schools went back before Labor Day. There were big changes in the school schedule. So I would look more at the quarter number than the month number. Jason West : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole Miller, Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Nicole Miller : Thanks. Good morning. Could you update your potential new unit growth opportunity? And when we look back at the growth targets, I think you outlined in one of your investor decks in the spring or summer, do those represent both Company units and JV or franchise units? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Nicole, what we said earlier in June was we'd expect 24 to 28 new units this fiscal year. We still expect to be within that range, 24 to 28. Now, I'm going to take you back to our long-term framework. Our long-term framework is 2% to 3% new unit growth. And as we said, early on in this long term, we'll be below that. But that does include just company-owned. That does not include any JV or any franchising sales growth for new units. Nicole Miller : And any -- would any international, outside the US, be contemplated in that? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: No, international is all franchising. So that's not contemplated in the 2% to 3%. That would all be upside. Nicole Miller : Thank you. And then just as a quick follow-up, in some of our field checks we've noticed a very heavy family mix, really tables with like very large families lately. Have you noted that customer mix change, as well, and does it have any impact? Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Yes, Nicole, we really haven't noticed a big change in family mix. Olive Garden's always had a larger family presence, anyway. So, we haven't really noticed a big change in mix in families. Nicole Miller : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe, JPMC. Your line is now open. Alexander Mergard : Hi. Thank you for the question. This is Alex Mergard on for John. A quick question on Olive Garden remodel CapEx. I believe it was mentioned previously that you're targeting 62 for the year at about $250,000 a unit. Can you provide a quick update on where you stand at the end of the quarter and also your initial take for 2018? Thanks. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Yes, Alex, we're still on track to hit our 60 roughly remodels for this fiscal year and we expect to do about 60 next fiscal year. We're still determining whether we want to accelerate that or not. But right now we're at 60 this year, roughly 60 next year, and then we'd be done with the year after at 60. They're running $250,000 to $450,000 in our total cost of remodels. But we're still on track for our 60 this year. Alexander Mergard : All right. Great. And then one quick follow-up question. Going back to the longer-term opportunity you mentioned accelerating development, perhaps, in 2018, particularly in your other business brands. Would you say that's still the framework for ramping development? Or could it be sooner? Later? Any clarity there would be great. Thanks. Eugene I. Lee Jr.: Alex, the other brands, you're talking about, the smaller brands on ramping up development, we believe that all of our brands have room to grow. It takes a little bit longer for those smaller, more specialty brands to build a pipeline. So when we kind of slowed the pipeline down a couple of years ago, some of these take 24 to 36 months to get open. What we talked about, our long-term framework on new units, was we expect to be below that long-term framework early and start ramping up for that. The good news is these specialty brands are higher sales volumes than an average Darden restaurant. So even if we open one or two, it's like opening three or four LongHorns. Again, we expect to be at the low end this year, or below the low end of our long-term framework for new units. And when we talk about 2018, we'll let you know when we get that sometime later this fiscal year. Alexander Mergard : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time I show no questions in queue. [Operator Instructions] Kevin Kalicak : Jay, if there are no further questions, we'll conclude the call. I want to remind everyone that we expect to release the results for the second quarter on Tuesday, December 20 before the market opens, with a conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we get ready to head into the holidays. We'll keep our remarks brief so we can get to your questions. We had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.64 billion, an increase of 2.1%. Same restaurant sales grew 1.7%. Outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 450 basis points and diluted net earnings per share were $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. Our intense focus on food, service and atmosphere drove our performance once again this quarter. Additionally, at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on our four competitive advantages. One, leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages; two, using our extensive data and insights to better understand our guest and effectively communicate with them; three, ensuring our brand is systematically go-through our rigorous strategic planning process; and four, cultivating our results oriented people culture to enable growth. Our approach continues to be effective and we believe we still have opportunity to improve in all aspects of our business. Olive Garden's strong momentum continued during the quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 2.6% outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 540 basis points. This was our ninth consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. Looking at the key drivers of this performance, it was really three things. First, the operations team led by Dan Kiernan continued to improve restaurant level execution. We're committed to improving the service experience and still have more opportunity on that front. However, we did achieve all-time high scores for both overall guest satisfaction as well as server attentiveness during the quarter. Next, we continue to see solid growth in our OG To Go platform. To Go sales grew 21% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a three year basis. During the quarter, we added the create your own pasta station to our To Go catering menu enhancing the convenience of To Go by providing a customizeable off-premise dining experience. The exciting thing about To Go is that our operations excellence team continues to learn more and more about how to meet our guests' growing needs for convenience. And finally, our promotional and core menu strategies continue to work together to create value for our guest. During the quarter, we had two strong value promotions. Buy one, take one, which capitalizes on the consumers need for convenience by allowing them to buy one entree and take a second entree home to prepare later and Never Ending Pasta Bowl. Both of these leverage brand equities and were supported by integrated marketing highlighted by our Olive Garden highly anticipated pasta pass. In honor of the 21st anniversary of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl, we made 21,000 pasta passes available, and all of them were claimed online in less than one second. The passion demonstrated by our guest who got a pasta pass and disappointment by those who did not reinforced the strength and relevance of the Olive Garden brand. LongHorn Steakhouse's same restaurant sales grew by 0.1%, the 15th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 290 basis points. Our focus at LongHorn remains on improving the guest experience. We are doing this primarily by making strategic investments in quality and simplifying operations to improve restaurant execution. And we're seeing positive results. Our research shows strong improvement in LongHorn's ability to provide value through high quality food and service and that's important because value is the number one driver of guest intent to return. Additionally, LongHorn has refined their new restaurant opening process. We're very pleased with the results we've seen in the new restaurants opened over the past nine months and it gives us greater confidence about future openings. The team at LongHorn is engaged and focused on the right priorities. We are making long-term strategic choices to position the brand to compete effectively in the future. I want to close by acknowledging that the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they create memorable experiences for our guests. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our team members for all you do to help our guests celebrate this time of year with family and friends and for making our company successful. We continue to get better every day and I'm excited about the new calendar year ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and happy holidays, everyone. As Gene mentioned, we had another good quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. Included in this $0.64 is one penny of unfavorability from market based compensation due to the significant appreciation in the stock market that was not perfectly hedged. This market based comp impact is reflected in three parts of our P&L. Restaurant labor, G&A, and income taxes. So I will provide more detail in our margin analysis. We continue to return cash to shareholders this quarter, paying out approximately $70 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 300,000 shares of stock, totaling around $19 million. Turning to our margin analysis. We had sales leverage from our positive same restaurant sales of 1.7%. We also continued to realize cost savings throughout the P&L and are on track to meet our $30 million of net cost savings in fiscal 2017. Now, in addition to these sales leverage and cost saves I just talked about, we also had favorable food and beverage expenses due to commodities deflation of approximately 1.3%, 20 basis points of unfavorability in restaurant labor of which 10 points was related to the market-based compensation expense. Unfavorable restaurant expenses of 130 basis points, all related to the incremental rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. G&A was unfavorable as we lapped the $13 million favorable legal settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and we had roughly 20 basis points of unfavorability related to market-based compensation this quarter. Excluding these impacts, G&A would have been favorable 60 basis points to last year. Depreciation and interest were favorable, as expected, related to the real estate transactions. The impairment line was favorable due to impairments last year of three restaurants totaling approximately $7.7 million. And finally, we still expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 26% and 27% for fiscal 2017. However, this quarter's rate was lower than the annual expectation due to tax favorability related to the market based compensation impact. Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit includes incremental rent and other tax expense of $21 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. Going forward, we do not expect incremental impacts in future quarters as it is now more than 12 months since the spin-off of Four Corners. Olive Garden segment profit of 16.8% was 80 basis points lower than last year for the quarter, as additional rent drove 170 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 90 basis points higher than last year. LongHorn Steakhouse segment profit of 14.4% was 60 basis points lower than last year for the quarter, with additional rent expense driving 120 basis points of unfavorability. Adjusting for the incremental rent, segment of profit margin increased 60 basis points at LongHorn. Segment profit margin of 18.2% was flat to last year in our fine dining segment. While our other business segment profit grew margins 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Even with additional rent headwinds of 50 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, segment profit at our other business would have been 110 basis points higher than last year. Finally, as we reported this morning, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2017 outlook for earnings per diluted share of $3.87 to $3.97. And our same restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% to 2%. Additionally, our total inflation estimate of between 1.5% to 2% remains the same. However, this inflation expectation now assumes commodity costs are flat to last year and that labor inflation is approximately 3.5%. I am proud of the work our teams continue to do to strengthen our performance and drive shareholder value. This continued progress gives us confidence in our expectations for the remainder of our fiscal year. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. First question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer Securities. Your line is now open. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning, guys. The industry trend actually got a little bit worse sequentially from your first quarter but trends at Olive Garden for you guys actually accelerated sequentially. I really have two questions on that. First question, is it the industry trend really being held down by the bottom half of the players within that trend? Is that kind of what you're seeing? And the second question is what really drove your widening gap versus Knapp this quarter versus just a quarter ago. Was a lot of the incrementality from that 20% growth in To Go or is there something else going on? Gene Lee : Hey, Brian. We got a lot to unpack in that question there. And we had a little bit of trouble hearing you. Let me see if I can get to it. I think when you look at Knapp throughout the quarter there's a lot of noise in that number. We had some holiday shifts. You also had a major hurricane in that period which affected brands differently. So we look from October to November, there was just I think a point just in Halloween switching there. Veterans Day messed around a little bit with sales in November moving from midweek to the weekend. So I think that created a lot of noise in the quarter. I wouldn't get too hung up on the months to months there. As far as the overall -- when you look at the overall indexes, I think you were asking about is it really the bottom 25% that's dragging that down. I think there's something to that. I mean, we obviously don't have visibility into everybody that's in that index and what the distribution looks like, but I keep coming back to what I believe are the really well-positioned concepts that are out there that are executing at a high level, they continue to grow market share. And so that's what pivots us back to -- we've just really got to be focused on what we can control and we work off that core operating philosophy of food, service and atmosphere. And if we're not focused on one of those three things, other than our competitive advantages at the Darden level, then we're not working on the right stuff. We're just focused on trying to make our guests happy and right now that's working for us. Brian Bittner : Okay. So I'm sorry you couldn't hear me. The second question I had on that was, was the To Go growth the biggest driver you saw of the widening gap versus the industry or was there something else that you could point to? Gene Lee : I think we happily saw some great momentum with takeout, but we also saw some good in-restaurant momentum. I think our two promotions in Olive Garden that we ran during the quarter, Never Ending Pasta Bowl and buy one, take one, are very, very strong value promotions and they're tough for our competitors to really go against. And we had a lot of great publicity around the pasta pass and a lot of people were excited about that promotion. So I think it's two-fold. I think we had a good quarter in takeout. The business continues to grow. But I think we had a good quarter in restaurant also with our strong value promotions. Brian Bittner : Okay. Thanks, Gene. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. Gene, I was just wondering if you could share your thoughts on the overall industry outlook post the election and I know you may not want to comment on trends you're seeing quarter-to-date, but is there any signs of strengthening or optimism that you're seeing related to the outcome of the election? Gene Lee : No, David, I'm not going to comment on what's happening in the third quarter. I would say as I think about this, the new administration's pro growth policies if they're implemented should be good for restaurant consumers. We're watching closely. But there's a lot of time between talk and action and how that's going to impact us long-term. I'd like to say we're somewhat hopeful that these pro growth policies will help. What's happening in Washington is not going to change what we're focused on. And we believe in our strategic -- the strategic choices we've made here at Darden and this should enable our brands to consistently outperform our competitors going forward. David Tarantino : Great. That's helpful. And then, just one question about the current quarter. This is an unusually challenging comparison that you're cycling. Is that the way you're looking at it? Is this a tough comparison or I guess how would you frame up sort of the current quarter and the puts and takes on that? Gene Lee : Yes, David. I think it's fair to say this is a difficult quarter. We had a little bit less than normal winter last year, so we had some favorable winter throughout the season. December was very mild and didn't have a lot of weather impact last year. So it's a -- we had a lot of momentum in the quarter last year. We also had a lot of calendar noise. We had the 52/53. There were other things going on. I would say that right now I think holidays are slight negative in the quarter, but my counsel to everybody listening would be weather's going to be what weather's going to be and that really has no impact long-term on the momentum or the overall value of our company. And if it snows on a Saturday, it snows on a Saturday. But it's not going to snow next year on a Saturday. And so I'm not getting all worried about things that we can't control. And I'm trying to get the organization just to stay focused on creating great dining experiences. I believe if we do that and keep our 150,000 team members focused on that we'll continue to grow our business. David Tarantino : Makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens. Your line is now open. Will Slabaugh : Thanks, guys. Just wanted to ask on LongHorn, on the check there in particular, so that's been a little bit soft in terms of growth the past few quarters and in this quarter was slightly negative. Curious if you could talk a little bit more about the value that you're pushing in the restaurant and if we should think about that check remaining in the flattish to down range going forward, and then, what you think that eventually might mean for traffic. Gene Lee : Yes. Good observation, Will. I mean we are doing some different things with our merchandising on the tables which is having a little bit of a negative impact on add-on sales. We believe that we may have too much activity, too much -- too many things on the table that is not really enhancing the overall dining experience. So we had some negative mix at different times during the quarter. We've got a little less price in there, 1.5 I believe price. We're just trying to -- part of our strategic -- the strategic choice in LongHorn is to try to simplify. We believe that business over the years has gotten too complicated. For it to work, it needs to be a high food cost, low labor cost model. And so simplification's a big part of it. We believe that we'll continue to try to under price a little bit in LongHorn, as we are in Olive Garden, but I'm not overly concerned right now with a little bit of movement in negative mix as we try to get -- try to undo some of the things I think that weren't done for the right reasons for the brand in the past. Will Slabaugh : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. John Glass : Thanks very much. Rick, two questions for you. First, just on post election, a lot of proposed changes around taxation. Can you frame up how you think about it first just from a corporate income tax benefit? You've got a lower rate because you benefit from some deductions. How do you think about how your rate might end up in a lower corporate tax rate environment? How do you frame that up? How do you think about things more broadly? Maybe there's CapEx depreciation accelerating. Does that benefit businesses like yours and would that incent you to build more restaurants because of that? Have you spent more time post election thinking about possible tax implications and how that may change how you think about capital allocation? Gene Lee : We've thought about this for quite a bit. But, I will say, just in tax reform and other things, we've been working with members of Congress for many years on tax reform over time. We look forward to continue to work with the new Congress and the new administration on those things. We do have an advantage on some of those items but we'll continue to work with them to find out what the best solution is for everybody. We'll continue to apply the appropriate discipline on our capital spending and ensure that the capital provides a positive return above our cost of capital. So whatever that tax rate is, we'll take into account with our growth in the future. John Glass : Okay. Thank you. And then just on G&A, appreciate it was lower year-on-year because last year's was high. But it's lower than it was in previous years, previous quarters. Is this the right run rate current quarter G&A or was there something unusually low about this quarter relative to, say, the last couple of quarters on G&A? RickCardenas: I wouldn't say there's anything unusual. I would say we continue to find cost savings throughout our P&L. As we've mentioned we've got $30 million this year, $165 million or so over a three year period and a lot of that is in the G&A line. Just remember, this is our lowest volume quarter so G&A is usually a little higher there. But we were -- I think what I said about 60 basis points better in G&A had we not had the legal settlement last year that was favorable. I would just say continue to think about our G&A more along the lines of the run rates that we've had over prior year as we continue to get our cost saves. John Glass : Okay. As a percentage of sales, is that how you're looking at it, or dollars? RickCardenas: We look at it as a percent of sales but I would tell you that a Q1 G&A dollar number isn't that different from a Q2 G&A dollar number which isn't that different from Q3. So but I would say if you focus on G&A as a percent of sales year-over-year, you'll probably get close. John Glass : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. I just had one bookkeeping question, then a follow-up question also. With respect to the growth and the openings, I guess the 24, 28 new store restaurants and even the CapEx budget of 310 to 350 does seem like it's heavily back end weighted. Was that in your initial guidance? Is there any concern that some of those stores could potentially fall into FY'18? Gene Lee : Yes, Matt, we still expect to open the 24 to 28 restaurants that we said at the beginning of the year. Based on weather and other things and timing of openings, generally a lot of them happen towards the very end of the year but we still expect to open our 24 to 28. Matthew DiFrisco : Okay. And then sort of a longer term question also, I mean you guys have done a great job obviously you always compare yourselves to Malcolm Knapp Group, but seems like you've led the pack there or you're finding other ways to drive business. You've improved the Customer Service and you've seen it in your scores. You've seen you're outcomping the Knapp peer group. Does that sort of change the longer term vision of maybe the growth rate of these brands? Are you thinking that the 24 to 28, if we see this demand and the superior demand trends continue, would that manifest itself in greater square footage growth or do you think you're just also expanding the capacity of the existing 800 stores and we would see probably more capital used towards enhancing and modernizing those stores on an ongoing basis to drive greater comps and greater leverage? Gene Lee : I'll talk about a couple of things in that question. One, I point you back to our long-term framework for new unit growth, 2% to 3% a year. We expect to be this year at the low end of that. But as we move forward and we start building our pipeline, we expect to move closer to the middle or the high end of that range. We also continue to invest in our restaurants as we talked about with Olive Garden and remodels. We're adding capacity in some of these remodels. We'll continue to find ways to invest appropriate capital to grow our business, whether that's adding more restaurants than we have in our long-term framework or getting to the top end of that range or adding more remodels. The other thing is we still expect all of our restaurant brands to grow. So we believe in all of our brands, every brand in our portfolio has growth opportunities for them and so we'll continue to see openings in all of our brands. Matthew DiFrisco : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brett Levy : Good morning. I guess I'll just follow-up on the capital side. Can you provide us a little bit more clarity and updates on your remodel and renovation pipeline, how many you've seen completed, what kind of returns you're seeing and you how should we be thinking about the remainder of this year and into next year and the number of projects. Thank you. Gene Lee : Good morning, Brett. It's Gene. We've got 23 full ones to complete in fiscal 2017. We've got 25% of the 160 approximate bar refreshes complete and we will have those done by the end of 2017. The remodels to-date are getting about 3.5% traffic growth. So we're still very pleased with what we're doing there and as far as I know and Dave George is sitting right next to me here saying we're on track to get these done this year. So I have not been told otherwise, so let's assume they get done. Brett Levy : Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from David Palmer of RBC Capital. Your line is now open. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. Away from To Go, when you compare Olive Garden's performance versus the casual dining peer set, where are you seeing the relative strength? And you can slice it in different ways but I'm thinking about the day parts that people say are weak for casual dining like lunch. Or even on a demographic spaces people talk about Millennials not using chains like they used to and I heard Olive Garden might be doing relatively better there. But any data points would be helpful about how you think you're outperforming? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes, David, good question. A couple things. We're actually seeing strength at lunch. And we're seeing strength on the weekend. Actually, the only place where -- it's not weak, it's just not growing as fast is as the other segments is Monday through Thursday dinner time. So we believe we have a little bit of an opportunity there. But, I think we've done some pretty good things at lunch to increase our value perception. You look at our lunch menu today, there's really only four price points on the front of it; $6.99, $7.99, $8.99, and $9.99. Every time I go for lunch I'm just -- I can't believe the value that you can get there, you can get at Olive Garden for lunch I think it's fantastic. I'd also say we've got some geographic areas that are performing really well for us. California, the Pacific Northwest, Mountain, continue to perform above the system average. We got good presence out there. So I think that's where we're seeing Olive Garden outperformance. David Palmer : Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Karen Holthouse : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Just one quick one on wage inflation where guidance came up a little bit versus last quarter's range. I'm just curious if that's something where a particular region is driving it or if it's more broad-based. And then, how do we think about sort of cadence through the year? Is that 3.5 pretty similar quarter-to-quarter, something that's ramping into year-end? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes, Karen, another really good question. Labor is under some pressure. I would say the labor environment is -- we're operating in a low unemployment situation and in that environment we're going to continue to see wage increases. Now, this is different as you might allude in your question, this is different, different parts of the country, depending on the overall economic environment. We have parts in our operations in that geographic area unemployment's extremely low, well below the national average and we're seeing a lot of wage inflation. And we've adjusted our practices to ensure that our management teams at the store level have the tools and the flexibility they need to be able to pay their people appropriately, based on the environment in which they're operating. I would say that historically these types of environments we've operated in them before have turned out to be great for our business. And so I'm optimistic that this wage inflation that we're seeing is going to turn into discretionary income and some of it's going to end up back in our restaurants. Karen Holthouse : And then the cadence in the year? Gene Lee : I think it's increasing a little bit as the year goes on. But its de minimis, but we are seeing more and more pressure. The environment continues to get better out there from an employment standpoint. Karen Holthouse : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Chris O'Cull of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Gene, the past few years it looks like off premise sales growth has stepped up in the fiscal third quarter. Is there a seasonal push around catering sales? Gene Lee : Yes, Chris. Obviously, the more penetrated we get around the holidays, the better off we're going to be. Even Thanksgiving and -- that's second quarter. Around certain times of the year, convenience becomes more important. Valentine's Day, believe it or not, is the largest, it's the biggest takeout day of the year for Olive Garden. Chris O'Cull: Is there an opportunity to he see off premise growth accelerate this season as you kind of broaden the reach or the awareness of the program? Gene Lee : Yes. I mean, I think -- I really don't want to get into a lot of details around that that part of the business for competitive reasons, but yes, we're focused on it. We see it as an opportunity and we hope that business continues to grow. Chris O'Cull: Is that part of the confidence you have in lapping these difficult comparisons this third quarter? Gene Lee : I think you could make that statement. Chris O'Cull: Okay. Great. And then one last one, Rick. Why do you expect inflation, commodity inflation in the back half of the fiscal year? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Chris, we -- as we've said in the past, we forecast our inflation based on the contracts that we have and then what we have open. And we still have some parts of our inflation open or some parts of our commodities open. We're only about 70% covered for the back half of the year, so we've still got 30% To Go and we assume whatever's not covered is the typical inflation. So the hope is that the inflation isn't as high as we have in our plans as we continue to find and continue to go out farther in coverage, but we just want to make sure that we are prudent in what we estimate. Chris O'Cull: Is there any commodity in particular that's floating in the back half that you're concerned about? Rick Cardenas : Nothing that we're concerned about, but we just have a lot of things that are floating. In our presentation we've got beef covered at about 55%. Produce is the one that's the least -- that's the most covered at 80. But there's nothing that we're super concerned about. We just like to be prudent in what we forecast for inflation. Chris O'Cull: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you. Two questions as well. First, just Gene, as you think about the industry and obviously have a lot of brands in our portfolio so I think of you as a pretty good proxy for broader casual dining. But, most of your peers have talked about headwinds, confluence of factors kind of pressuring results and I think you acknowledged the industry may be softening a bit. So, I'm not sure whether you would say you are less vulnerable to some of these headwinds. I was wondering if maybe you could kind of prioritize for us these different headwinds in terms of how you think they're impacting the industry, whether it's food at home, food away from home, divergence that we hear more and more about or the shift from brick and mortar to online or political uncertainty, value bundle fatigue, and just seems to be a lot of things that some of your peers are talking about, was wondering as an industry veteran how you would prioritize those potential headwinds for the industry. Then I have one follow-up. Gene Lee : All right, Jeff. Again, a lot there. When I look at the industry today, I think there's more competition for discretionary dollars than there has been in the past. Whether that is -- I think the biggest one that we really don't talk about that is -- that people -- that restaurant sales are competing with is data and other what I would call new necessities today, whether smartphones, whether your cable bill, your Netflix bill, those all have increased significantly over the years and I think that people are making choices. And I just think it's not just confined to food. I think people just -- I think we're competing. And we've got to in the industry and most -- my focus at Darden is to find a way to create a reason for people many want to come spend money with us. And I think we have to continue to innovate from a culinary standpoint. We've got to do a better job from a service standpoint and we've got to create environments that people want to come to because they have more choices. I think if you read a lot of Malcolm's -- he talks about the reallocation nation, I think there's a lot of truth to how he's describing the situation in the industry. People are feeling better and when they feel better they're spending on bigger home good items. So that's having an impact. But as I look out over the overall industry and I look at people that -- brands that continue to create value from the real value players, all the way up to mid, all the way up to higher end, if you're doing a good job and you've managed it over the years, I think conservatively, I think you're doing pretty well today. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. And then, just a comment you made earlier in terms of I think we can see the sequential trends in terms of menu pricing but it seems there's easing at both core brands in recent months. Just wondering if that's a conscious decision or maybe how should we think about that outlook going forward and your ability to protect the margin if pricing continues to slow down to that maybe 1% range. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jeff. This is Rick. Our pricing for the year we still expect to be at the low end of the 1% to 2%. And as you did say that we've had some deceleration in pricing that's more because we took pricing multiple times last year versus the really one-time this year. As you think about our advantages that Gene's talked about so often and scale being one of them and driving costs out of our business, we use that to reinvest and one of the ways that we reinvest is by pricing we hope below our competition in the long run. So whatever happens with inflation or other things, we still expect to focus on keeping pricing at the lower end to maintain and accelerate our value proposition and we are -- we continue to fight for that as long as we can. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Stephanie Ng : Good morning. This is actually Stephanie Ng representing Sara Senatore. A quick follow up question on labor. Could you comment on the DOL overtime ruling, does that impact you at all? And could you see labor pressures easing with the new administration and how much of an impact would changes in federal regulations really have since you've already addressed this first and some of your benefits in compliance? Gene Lee : All right. Overtime regulation, whether that's implemented or not as we've said in the past it's not going to have any material impact on our business of the compensation levels of our managers. So there's really -- there's no story their for us. That's a non-impact. As far as the new administration, I would say we would expect less structural pressure at the federal level, but we expect to have continued activity at the state level, which is really where the pressure has been for the last decade. And so, I don't know how much the changed administration is going to have on our overall labor policies going forward. I see this as much more of a state issue. Stephanie Ng : Okay. And a quick follow up. You spoke earlier about the price point for lunch but could you provide a bit more color on menu or food based on that lunch? And also given weakness in the biggest fast casual competitor, are you taking any traffic share from that category? Gene Lee : I'll answer that. We haven't been able to trace back where the share's coming from. But we've innovated at lunch and I talked about this in the past. I mean current management team, Dave George and Jose and Dan, for the first time have been able to unbundle soup, salad and bread sticks effectively at lunch with the duo platform which allowed us to get back to the $6.99 price point. And to me, that's been the big innovation, the big breakthrough. When you look at our, create your own lunch duo, which pivoted us away from having to rely totally on soup, salad and bread sticks. That to me has been the biggest innovation in Olive Garden ands has really just changed the whole complexion of lunch. I mean for $6.99 you can get an eggplant parmesan sandwich and all the soup or salad that you want. That's an incredible value. I'm looking at the menu right now and it's just you get a meat ball sandwich for $6.99 plus either a soup or salad and that's all if you need option. Incredible value. We've got to continue to find ways to communicate that and we've got to continue to innovate the food platform inside that. But that's our big innovation. Stephanie Ng : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeff Farmer : Great. Thank you. Just following up on some of the labor questions. You suggested that discretionary wage rate increases are having a greater impact on labor inflation than some of the legislative wage rate increases that are out there. So with that said, is that prudent to assume that this discretionary wage rate pressure driven by that very tight job market could persist or even intensify as you guys get deeper into calendar 2017 or as we move into calendar 2017 and get deep into calendar 2017? Gene Lee : There's always the chance that it could get deeper and if unemployment continues to decline, but I would say that we are very well positioned to deal with that. Industry turnover continues to increase. Darden's team member turnover in the second quarter actually declined slightly. We've got a strong employment proposition that we will continue to work hard on. We believe we have a great relationship with our team members and that's one of our competitive advantages. And so if the labor market continues to tighten, I think we're very well positioned to handle it. We've been working for a year with our restaurant teams and changing the processes and procedures on how we hire, how quickly we do it. We're becoming much more technologically advanced with that. We know that's going to be a real problem. It's something that we wake up every day and we think about is how are we going to make sure that our employment proposition remains strong and that we are going to be -- we are going to have enough team members to do what we need to do. Jeff Farmer : That's helpful. Then an unrelated question. November consumer confidence index number jumped 107. I think that's the highest reading in almost 10 years. To the extent you guys have looked at this data, if you go back and look at the last 10 plus years of your own business, have you seen your same-store sales traffic trends, whatever that might be, is it a relationship worth discussing between your same-store sales and traffic trends versus those consumer confidence numbers or do you find that relationship to be relatively weak? Gene Lee : That relationship is relatively weak. Jeff Farmer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jason West : Yes. Thanks. Couple questions. One, I guess last quarter you guys talked out about one of the few areas of weakness was Texas, particularly on the higher end brands. I think you said Olive Garden was lagging a little bit there as well. Just wondering with the improvement this quarter if you saw any strength or stabilization in Texas and sort of the outlook there? Gene Lee : Yes. It's slightly better but still lagging. In certain parts of Texas that are more difficult. I mean Houston obviously continued to struggle. Dallas is a little bit -- Dallas is fine. And so overall Texas is a little bit of a drag, but it's better than it had been. As we're starting to -- basically we're starting to lap when Texas became a problem. Jason West : Okay. Got it. And in terms of the To Go business, providing such a nice uplift here, I mean can you guys I guess give us an update on where mix is. I believe it's around 10%, 11% of sales. And how much of the strength there is from new platforms around catering since that's a fairly new offering or is this really more about the in store To Go business just continuing to gain strength? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : To Go was 12.6% of total sales in Q2 and it's all aspects. I'd go back to the insight that we're operating on. It's convenience. The consumer is demanding more and more convenience today and one of the things that we think about here every day is how do we apply that to everything that we do. That's the biggest thing I've seen change in I think about decades. Over the last decade, the consumer's desire for convenience has significantly increased and I think that's what's driving the takeout in Olive Garden because we're able to meet that need, that need state, through multiple channels. And again, I go back to we have food that travels extremely well. Jason West : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Andy Barish : Hi, guys. Just a quick one back on LongHorn. Can you give us an update in terms of where you are in sort of shifting the promotional strategy? I think you were kind of moving away from the value consumer and trying to move a little bit higher price point and why that isn't showing up in the mix line as well. Rick Cardenas : We've been pivoting away from the low price steak promotions. We have not been trying to pivot to higher price points. I'd say we've gone to medium type price points, so it's not like we're out there advertising porterhouses. We're out there kind of in the middle. We were doing a lot of $10.99, $11.99 steak promotions that we thought we had to pivot away from. I think we're into only one of those now a year. And so I would say it's more of a strategy of kind of pivoting away from these promotional periods where you have -- you're selling $11.99 promotional steak and you had other digital incentives out there which you need to have out there to be competitive. We determined that there were a percentage of the guests that we were serving; we were not making money on. And we decided that we were going to try to move away from that. And I would urge everybody that's out there listening and thinking about LongHorn is look what we've done to the overall business model over the last 18 months and what LongHorn's profitability has become. This brand obviously the one that I am the most familiar with, as I ran it for a lot of years, is a high quality, is a simple, high quality business and that's the way we're going to win. We're making the right strategic choices. I believe in it. These decisions that we're making are going to take years to pay out. But as I look at the landscape and I look at the landscape of all of casual dining, I think there's a niche over time that LongHorn can compete in and be extremely effectively in. It's not going down. It's not going down and competing with the more value players. It's actually carving a niche out a little bit above what I would call traditional casual dining. Our research is incredibly encouraging. You I am not hung up right now on what day-to-day same restaurant sales are. I believe in the research. I believe that we've got the business model back. The business is still too complicated and we've got to simplify it so we can continue to remove some labor from the operation so that we can invest in great steaks and get them cooked right for our guests. Andy Barish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning. You just touched on some of the strategies at LongHorn. But you mentioned the proportion of the consumer base that focuses on value and you also mentioned wanting to be a high food cost, low labor cost model. So I'm just wondering bigger picture, longer term, as you're thinking about reinforcing that value, it doesn't seem like service in that model really is going to play as large of a role maybe as it played at Olive Garden. Is that the right way to think about it? How do you really think about pulling those value levers without the price point promotions over time? Rick Cardenas : I think about it a little bit different. I think service has got to play a higher -- a more important role in LongHorn. We want great service in Olive Garden, don't get me wrong. If we're going to have a $21, $22 check average at LongHorn, that service has got to be better than casual dining service. We should have the best servers in LongHorn because they should make more money because the check average is higher, we do a little bit more volume. We should have the best people out there on the floor. I think that when I think about LongHorn, we're still paying the price for opening 40 restaurants -- approximately 40 restaurants for a couple of years. And we are -- by slowing down and really focusing on some basics, we have -- we're making great, great improvements and I think one area where since Todd's been involved, he's been really focused on food quality and getting the food back to where he thinks it needs to be. We both agree that we may have not paid enough attention to service and LongHorn for years had a unique service style that the consumer talked about. And I think that we've lost a little bit of that. And I think we're going to get back to a little bit more balanced operational message where we're going to continue to focus on food. We want to elevate the service experience inside of LongHorn. We think there's big opportunity there. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. John Ivankoe : Hi. Excuse me. Couple of quick ones if I may. Firstly had, thanks for the outlook on the commodities for the second half of fiscal 2017, but it does kind of beg the question of what any kind of initial indication may be for fiscal 2018 as you see where commodities are relative to spots or futures, what have you and what your overall outlook may be if there's an early look that we could get there. Gene Lee : Hey, John. Thanks. We're not going to talk too much about 2018 yet as we finish up this year. We're only halfway through this year. I will say we're taking coverage in 2018 now. So as we still see the supply out there, we're taking coverage on some products now which we might not have done in the past. John Ivankoe : Maybe if I can get you to answer this one. Any outlook just on steak which I recognize it's not as easy for us to see in terms of just the overall trend of steak because it's not feeder cattle or live cattle in terms of where your buy might be as the biggest category. Gene Lee : John, this is Gene. For competitive reasons, I'm not going to comment on that. But I'll give you the one place that I look. I think you can go right to CME Board and look at live cattle futures and just look at a three year trend and you can get a pretty good idea. The ratios changed throughout the years, but it can give you directionally where the market is. And so I'd look at that. I don't want to comment for competitive reasons what we're going to do on beef. John Ivankoe : Okay. Fair enough. Thought I'd ask. Secondly, there's been a lot of conversation about restaurant supply. There's been some slowing in chains, independents maybe maintaining the rates, possibly even increasing the rates. But, could you give us a view of just kind of effective real supply increases as you currently see them and what your outlook might be for calendar 2017, if that's possible. Gene Lee : We look at the Crest data which has historically been directionally the best piece of research. We're seeing the supply up slightly. It's outgrown population. I think as long as there's capital out there, people are going to build restaurants. Whether they're good investments, who knows. Especially on the independent front. So as far as capacity, I think that I would expect capacity right now to outpace inflation as long as capital is cheap, especially driven by the independents. I would continue to look for the strong -- continue to get stronger and people who -- brands that aren't able to reinvest into their business could get weaker through this cycle. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Your line is now open. Peter Saleh : Comment you made a little while ago talking about wage increases and how it could potentially translate into some incremental discretionary income which could come back and show up in the restaurant sales. Are you seeing any evidence of that in states like California that were ahead of the curve on raising wages versus the rest of the country? Rick Cardenas : Peter, I'd hate to make that connection that their wages are the reason why that we're seeing better performance in California. I'm not sure I can prove that out statistically. But California for Olive Garden is one of our better performing markets. But, I'm not quite ready to make that link yet. Peter Saleh : And then on the To Go business, how are you guys thinking about delivery on single orders? Is that something you guys will consider doing either later this year or into next year? Rick Cardenas : We've got multiple tests going on with all the big players out there. Obviously, they want us. We want them. We've just got to figure out how we make this work for both parties from a financial standpoint. Stay tuned. Peter Saleh : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Nicole Miller of Piper. Your line is now open. Nicole Miller : Thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions. You talked about your organic unit growth outlook. How does the portfolio look from the positioning of adding another brand organically and/or acquiring another brand for the portfolio? Gene Lee : Good morning, Nicole. I'm going to go back to a standard answer here, one that -- we're in continuous conversations with our Board and with the rest of management evaluating all our alternatives to achieve our business results. We're not -- I would just say that we're not in the active business of developing our own concepts today, but we'll continue to have these conversations with our Board and we'll figure out what's the right decision to build long-term shareholder value. Nicole Miller : Thank you. And just a final question. Thinking about the specialty restaurant group and specifically most of them tend to be higher check, but the highest check concepts within that group, how do you think they're positioned for holiday? What do you expect not out of your brands per se, but just broadly bookings and the spend in terms of food and alcohol if you could? Thanks. Gene Lee : You're asking a forward-looking question. I really don't want to duck it, but I'm really not going to talk about what's happening in December, or what our bookings are like. We'll talk about that in March. Nicole Miller : Thank you for your time. Operator : Thank you. Next question is in Howard Penney of Hedgeye Management. Your line is now open. Howard Penney : Thanks for the question. My question is also on delivery. There is a lot of talk [Technical Difficulty] if one of the possibilities to participate in this market -- Gene Lee : Howard, you're breaking you up. We can't hear you, Howard. Howard Penney : Can you hear me now? Gene Lee : That's a little better. Howard Penney : Sorry about that. I was just wondering if you agree with the statement that delivery would be one of the most disruptive influences on the restaurant industry in a generation. And then, the second question from that line is, would you ever consider building out your own network of [Technical Difficulty]? Gene Lee : I'm going to repeat the question back. I think you talked about delivery being the most disruptive innovation in the industry and us building out our own network. Howard Penney : Yes. Thank you. Gene Lee : I agree with you, delivery is disruptive and as we think about developing our own network, all I'd say is that those are conversations as we think about where is it going to be in 10 years, those are conversations that we'll continue to look at. Developing your own network is couple fronts. We could be developing our own network that could handle the one-off deliveries. We think what we're doing today around catering is kind of our own network. Then it's all the way to could you actually build a kitchen in a warehouse district and deliver in a major city out of that. So I see that disruption in a very long perspective. I mean you've got a lot of choices along that continuum. And so all I'd say is that we're aware of what the choices are and we think a lot about the Amazon effect, as we call it around here. What would Amazon do? And so that's where we kind of get to -- is someone going to develop a kitchen in one place and just deliver food from that kitchen. So that would probably be the most disruptive. So I guess the answer to your question is, yes, we're thinking about it. We don't have any plans in future, but we're fully aware of this disruption and where it could go. Howard Penney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. With the prospect of wage inflation continuing to be strong or potentially increasing and commodity inflation coming in the future, how much opportunity do you have to continue to find cost savings, whether it's in labor or other areas of the business beyond the $30 million you're looking for in 2017. Gene Lee : Cost saves are going to be a big part of how we go forward. It goes right into the number one competitive advantage I think we have which is scale. And challenged the Presidents of the businesses and the functional leads to make sure that we are as efficient as we possibly can be from a support standpoint and then secondarily, in all our non-consumer facing areas, have we become -- have used our scale as much as possible to be able to drive down cost. And we've made great progress. I still believe there's work to be done there. Jake Bartlett : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your final -- go ahead. Jake Bartlett : I just had one more clarification, actually. On the G&A, you mentioned an answer to an earlier question about G&A as a percentage of sales being about right on the year-over-year basis I guess, but I'm looking at G&A down roughly $10 million in the second quarter from the first quarter. Is the absolute dollar level that we're seeing in the second quarter, is that the right run rate to think about or was there some reason why that might be lower than your kind of run rate going forward? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jake. Let me clarify what I said before. G&A is probably closer in the third and fourth quarter to what Q1 would have been maybe slightly lower than that. The reason Q2 was a little lower is incentive comp. We don't usually have as big a charge for incentive comp in Q2 based on the way our earnings grow throughout the year. So just to clarify, thanks for that question, Q3 and Q4 is more like Q1. Jake Bartlett : Okay. Thank you very much. Rick Cardenas : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Final question is from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. Just sorry if I missed it. Did you guys mention how much share repurchase you may have done in the current quarter or towards the end of the quarter, just the weighting of that $19 million, just because it looks like you may have more activity in the second half of the year than you had in the first half of the year. Rick Cardenas : More activity in the second half of the year? Matthew DiFrisco : Planned. Planned for the fiscal. Rick Cardenas : What we've said in our long-term framework in this year is, we're going to be between $100 million to $200 million. The Board did authorize some more share repurchase after the first quarter. We've only bought $19 million worth of shares since then. And we'll continue to be opportunistic as the market gives us opportunities to buy. Matthew DiFrisco : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time speakers no other questions on the phone. I would like to hand the call back to you. Gene Lee : Thank you, Tori. That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we expect to release results for the third quarter on Tuesday, March 28th before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call and we wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed earlier today and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our Website at www.darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and a reconciliations of these measurements is included in the presentation. This morning we will briefly review our results from the third quarter and discuss the Cheddar's transaction in more detail, both of which were announced last night via press release and filed with the SEC. After the prepared remarks, we'll open the call for your questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review our third quarter performance and share the exciting news of our acquisition of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our performance during the quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.88 billion an increase of 1.7%. Same restaurant sales grew 0.9%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 510 basis points and diluted net earnings per share were $1.32 an increase of 9.1% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. Olive Garden had another impressive quarter, achieving same restaurant sales growth of 1.4%, outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 560 basis points. This was Olive Garden's 10th consecutive quarter same restaurant sales growth, driven by our focus on operational excellence, was drove all-time guest satisfaction scores, continue to meet our guest needs for convenience with OG To Go and providing compelling promotional and core menu offers such as Never-Ending Classics and our taste of the Mediterranean platform. LongHorn Steakhouse's same restaurant sales grew 0.2%, the 16th consecutive quarter of growth. I am pleased with their results as the team continues to implement their long-term strategy, focused on investing in quality and simplifying operations. Our success in our ability to continue fulfilling our mission is due to our competitive advantages, our back to basics operating philosophy and our portfolio of differentiated brands. We believe our four competitive advantages give our brands an edge in the marketplace by enabling us to drive sales growth and expanding margins and they are leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages, using our extensive data and insights to better understand our guest and effectively communicate with them, ensuring our brand systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process and cultivating our results-oriented people culture to create a team as a passion to serve and a desire to win. Our operating philosophy is the driving force behind the way our branch teams lead their restaurants. Though simple, this philosophy is powerful because it demands that we remain incredibly focused on driving strong operating fundamentals and that means we're laser focused on culinary innovation and execution inside each of our brands, delivering attentive service to every one of our guests and in creating an engaging atmosphere inside all of our restaurants and these priorities are supported by smart and relative integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guest. All of this, are competitive advantages, our operating philosophy and our portfolio brings me to the exciting announcement of our acquisition of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. When you look at all these things, you see why Cheddar's is strong brand on its own, is an excellent fit for our company. The addition of Cheddar's to the Darden portfolio further enhances our scale. Our significant skill provide meaningful synergies for Cheddar's, further strengthening an already robust business model. Additionally, being part of Darden provides Cheddar's the opportunity to leverage all of our competitive advantages to help increase sales and margins at existing restaurants and drive disciplined, profitable new restaurant growth. In addition to the mutual benefit realized through scale, we're also extremely confident about this acquisition because Cheddar's and Darden's are a cultural fit as well. We're focused on the same operating priorities. This focus on food, service and atmosphere has enabled Cheddar's to become one of the top brands in casual dining, one known for its high quality, made from scratch food at compelling prices in a polished yet warm atmosphere. We believe Cheddar's is a strategic fit for Darden for several of the reasons. First, it complements our portfolio and allows us to compete in the undisputed value leader in full-service varied menu category. This category remains sizable with evolving preferences that Cheddar's satisfies. Additionally, Ian has built an experienced management team that encourages and empowers service-minded team members to be passionate and to bring the distinctive personalities to their roles, so they can deliver a personalized experience that is authentic and attentive. Next, the restaurant level economics are very attractive. Cheddar's has average restaurant volumes of 4.4 million, average restaurant guest counts of approximately 6,300 guests per week and an average check of approximately $13.50, all of which helps provide a strong return on investment and with only 165 restaurants today, the significant runway for growth. And finally, Cheddar's is an incredibly strong brand. In fact, it is the undisputed leader on value perception and intent to recommend, which are both leading indicators of same restaurant sales growth. Now I'll turn it over to Rick, who will discuss the financial details of the quarter and this transaction. Rick Cardenas : Thanks Gene. We delivered another strong quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.32, an increase of 9.1% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. Looking at the P&L for this quarter as a percentage of sales, food and beverage was favorable to last year related to commodities deflation of approximately 0.8% and continued cost savings. Restaurant labor was favorable, driven by lower manager incentive pay, given last year's strong performance in the third quarter. This was partially offset by continued hourly wage rate inflation pressure. Restaurant expenses were unfavorable due to higher than anticipated utilities inflation, particularly natural gas, increased preopening related to more second ever openings this year than last, increased credit card fees and Worker's Compensation and public liability claims. Marketing was unfavorable due to year-over-year timing and is flat on year-to-date basis through the third quarter. G&A was favorable due to lower management incentives than last year, as we wrap on a strong Q3 in fiscal 2016. And finally, taxes were favorable due to year-over-year tax timing. Specifically, we had some tax favorability move into the third quarter this year that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Second profit is not comparable to last year and the impacts of the real estate transactions are now in both year's results. This quarter, Olive Garden segment profit was below last year -- profit margin was below last year, driven by marketing expense timing, utilities inflation and higher preopening expenses related to Q3 and Q4 openings this year versus none in the second half of last year. LongHorn segment profit margin was below last year, driven by higher restaurant expenses, primarily the Workers Compensation expenses I mentioned. All other segments showed growth in segment profit this quarter. Turning to our outlook in fiscal 2017, we increased our expectations for diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $3.95 and $4 a share. This assumes total sales growth of approximately 2.3% for the full fiscal year, same restaurant sales of approximately 1.5%, commodity deflation for the full year, although we expect the fourth quarter to show slight inflation. Overall inflation of approximately 1.5% driven by wage inflation for the year of approximately 3.5% to 4% and finally an effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for the year. So, this implies fourth quarter results of same restaurant sales between 2% and 3%, an effective tax rate of between 25% and 26% compared to approximately 21% in last year's fourth quarter and earnings per share between $1.11 and $1.16. Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, I want to inform you that we will discontinue disclosing our monthly same restaurant sales results in our quarterly releases beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This change is due to the significant variability in month-to-month sales results, due to weather, promotional calendar shifts and holiday shifts, among other things that generally resolve throughout the quarter. In 2018, we anticipate total capital spending of between $360 million and $400 million of which $150 million to $175 million is related to growth new restaurant openings of between 30 and 35 and the remainder being related to approximately 100 Olive Garden remodels, ongoing restaurant upkeep, technology and other spending. The outlook for fiscal 2017 and the ranges for fiscal 2018, CapEx and new restaurant estimates, exclude any impact from the acquisition of Cheddar's. Additional guidance for fiscal 2018 will be shared in next quarter's release and call towards the end of June and will include the impact of Cheddar's. Regarding the acquisition of Cheddar's, we have signed a definitive agreement to purchase the company for $780 million in an all-cash transaction from private equity firms L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners. Net of approximately $30 million of certain cash tax benefits of deductible goodwill from Cheddar's purchase of a franchisees assets in January 2017, this represents a multiple of 10.4 times Cheddar's trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We will also pay the seller $10 million for certain tax attributes related to their deductible transaction expenses. In addition, we will reimburse the sellers for capital expenditures they have made on new restaurants expected to open over the next 12 to 18 months. We expect to close the transaction before the end of fiscal 2017. This addition to our portfolio will enable significant synergies due to the scale advantage Gene mentioned. We have a track record of achieving significant synergies with other transactions with annualized run rate synergies on average of over 5% of revenues in prior acquisitions. This anticipated annualized run rate synergies with this transaction total $20 million to $25 million, representing approximately 4% of Cheddar's trailing 12 month revenues. We believe the $20 million to $25 million is both achievable and meaningful and we expect to achieve this annualized run rate by the end of fiscal 2019, primarily through administrative and supply chain savings. Given Cheddar's strong business model and meaningful EBITDA, we expect that this transaction will be accretive to our earnings per share by approximately $0.12 in fiscal 2018 and $0.20 to $0.25 in fiscal 2019, excluding acquisition and integrated related expenses of between $25 million and $35 million. We'll fund this transaction with the proceeds of a new debt issuance and with cash on hand. This issuance is expected to be completed by the transaction closing date. Once the deal closes, our initial focus will be on integrating Cheddar's with minimal disruption of our operations and achieving the synergy estimates we've outlined. We have experience integrating brands from prior acquisitions and we'll apply learnings from those in this transaction. As I mentioned earlier, we will provide greater detail on our outlook for fiscal 2018 in our earnings conference call in June. However, I want to wrap up by saying that the addition of Cheddar's to our portfolio gives us even more confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term value creation framework we have discussed previously. We also intend to maintain our investment-grade credit profile. In addition, the terms and structure of this transaction will put us more in line with our targeted leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. And with that, I want to welcome Ian and turn it over to him for a few comments. Ian Baines : Thanks Rick. Well today is a really exciting day for the Cheddar's team as this acquisition is the right next step for us as a brand. Being part of Darden, benefiting from the support structure and expertise in developing brands will enable us to reach our growth potential by opening up new opportunities that were previously out of our reach. Additionally, it became evident during my interactions with Gene, Rick and the team and at Darden, throughout this process that there are incredible amounts of similarities on how we run our restaurants and lead our teams. The cultural fit between both parties that Gene discussed will ensure a smooth transition for us and help us to stay focused on delivering exceptional experiences to our guests. We will be stronger because of Darden and I'm confident that we will make a meaningful contribution as part of the company. Now I'll turn it over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks Ian. I just want to close by mentioning that this is the fourth acquisition that I've been a part of at Darden and I've been on both sides of the table. The process can be complex, but we have a seasoned team with a terrific system in place to ensure a smooth integration. I want to thank Ian and his team for the partnership they have given us through this process and I want to welcome all our new team members from Cheddar's to the Darden family. We're committed to delivering against our mission and I'm extremely excited to continue this journey with the Cheddar's team who will strengthen what is already a very talented team at Darden And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is open. Brett Levy : Good morning, team. Can you provide us a little bit more color on the Cheddar's P&L what type of seasonality? How you're thinking about growth in terms of company or franchise restaurant level margins and also any thoughts on the near-term with a long-term -- near-term growth targets or the long-term unit potential? Rick Cardenas : Hey Brett, it's Rick. The restaurant P&L we mentioned is about a 17% restaurant EBITDA, which is strong in the industry. $4.4 million AUV and they\u2019ve got 25 franchises now. The revenues are fairly immaterial to the overall revenues Cheddar's. And as we mentioned, we have a pipeline -- they've already got a pipeline of about three restaurants in this fiscal year and another eight or so in the next fiscal year. I'd like to just close by saying they\u2019ve grown about 12%, 15% over the last 10 years and we feel really confident in their continued growth. Brett Levy : Can you share anything about the comp cadence or what they're running, what they generally run in terms of on an annual basis and the comp waterfall for new units as they come out? Gene Lee : Hey Brett, it's Gene. What I was going to comment on the comp performance historically, I will say that they're outperforming the industry at this time and we'll give you some more insight in June once we get this deal closed. Brett Levy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good morning and congratulations. Maybe just bigger picture from Cheddar's, what might you deploy into your system in terms of their value proposition or positioning? Also, maybe anything they're doing in technology human capital or otherwise, thanks? Gene Lee : Yes, we think there's a lot to learn from the value proposition. They're obviously the value leader. You saw the chart that we had in the presentation. They\u2019ve had a long history of underpricing the industry, developing products from scratch, which enable them just to really deliver a high-quality product at a little bit lower price point. So, I think there's a lot that we can learn from them about value and as far as technology and human capital, I think there's a lot that we can share with them. We're excited to be able to help them with some of their back of the house technology and some of the process oriented things that we've developed here at Darden that over the years, they\u2019ve haven\u2019t had the opportunity to implement. And we think there's upside plugging them into our human resource systems and we think we can help improve their team member turnover and retention. Nicole Miller : And just so everybody does have it, what is the approximate average check at Cheddar's? Rick Cardenas : It's about $13.50. Nicole Miller : Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Bittner : Thanks, congrats guys on the quarter and the acquisition. Just a big picture, financial creasing question on the deal, you said the transaction will be EPS accretive in year one by about $0.12 and then expanding to $0.20 to $0.25 in your two or 2019. Is the difference in the accretion projections, simply you're not assuming much synergies in the 18 number and you're assuming all the synergies in the 19 number, or is there some type of growth that you're assuming out of Cheddar's? Gene Lee : Yes Brian, thanks. We have more of the synergies coming in, in '19 than in '18, although we do expect some growth in Cheddar's in '19. Brian Bittner : Okay. And then as far as the 2.3 EBITDAR, should we be assuming in our models that you're taking out around $500 million out of your credit facility that you currently have untapped to fund this or should we be assuming more? Rick Cardenas : Well, what I'd start with if you look at our balance sheet right now, we've got about $390 million in cash. We're not going to talk about the way we're going to fund the debt other than to say we'll use some debt whether it's credit facility or other things to fund this transaction. We expect to close that before the deal closes. Brian Bittner : Okay. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open. Greg Francfort : Hey guys, just one question on the EBITDA multiple, I know Cheddar's had a 44-store transaction happen earlier this year, you including those stores in the multiple in the EBITDA they're using for the multiple. Gene Lee : Yes Greg. We're including them for a pro forma for the full, for the full 12 months. Greg Francfort : Got it. Got it. And then just, I think you guys have been testing loyalty in some markets and is the strategy going forward to potentially acquire more brands and build out sort of a broader loyalty network? I guess how do you think about how Cheddar's fits into plans you're doing and what you're testing on the loyalty front? Gene Lee : Yes, you're correct. We have a small loyalty test out there right now and as we've said in the past, we're going continue to go slow with that test. And how does Cheddar's fit into that, I think we keep coming back to our four competitive advantages and one of our what we believe is a competitive advantage is our data and insights. And so, having Cheddar's being able to plug into the resources that -- and capabilities that we've developed with data and insights should be a big advantage for them. It's going to take us some time to be able to get them into our systems, but that we think about the Darden platform and plugging brands into it, we think that gives -- that enables these brands to have a significant advantage in the marketplace. As far as a strategy to continue to do this, no, let's focus on completing this transaction and grading this brand really, really well and then we'll move on and look at it when that time comes, but that's a long time from today. Greg Francfort : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, it's Sam Beres of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Sam Beres : Good morning, Gene, I was just hoping maybe in terms of the broader industry, hoping you could maybe share some thoughts on just how you're viewing kind of the underlying demand fundamentals from that industry perspective right now, just given the large amount of noise we're seeing within trends in recent months whether that's from weather, calendar shifts or maybe timing of tax refunds? Gene Lee : Yeah, I think all those, the things which you just mentioned have played a big impact in the quarter and I continue to urge people to take a little bit longer term approach to this and not getting hung up week-to-week, quarter-to-quarter. I would say if you look at our industry benchmarks, for the first couple weeks of March, the delay in the tax refunds was an impact in February and we've seen a few, a little bit better trends in the beginning of March. We're also in March dealing with a much later Easter this year than we had last year. So just a lot of noise. When I think about the consumer, I think the consumer has been pretty steady. We know the consumer is looking for everyday value. The consumer is not reacting to promotional value constructs, the way they did a few years ago and I think that when you give the consumer what it is that they want, they're visiting restaurants. And I think if you look at our industry, the brands that are performing and executing at a high level that are well-positioned, continue to do fairly well. Sam Beres : Great. That's helpful and I guess maybe just one follow-up on the implied outlook for Q4 comps of 2% to 3% does assume a nice pickup from the level your just reported. So, I guess, in terms of the puts and takes on that, what gives you the confidence in delivering that acceleration? Is it just that better trend line that you've seen here recently at the start of March? Gene Lee : Well, I think it has more to do with the late Easter. Last year we were sitting around the table and talking about why trends slow down with Easter coming forward and this year we'll get the benefits of a later Easter and later Easter helps restaurants and retail. Sam Beres : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next, is Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Stephanie Ng : Good morning. This is actually Stephanie Ng representing Sara Senatore. Thanks for taking my question. I had a broader question. I just wanted to understand your perspective on the bar and grill category in relation to the acquisition. This category has been one of the weaker casual dining categories over the last couple of years, warranting to deflationary pressures and competition from limited service. Why expand your portfolio to this category and why now and also if you could talk about your longer-term view on the bar and grill category, that would be great. Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes, first, we don't consider Cheddar's as a traditionally ubiquitous bar and grill concept. We see this as a differentiated varied menu concept with a totally different footprint and much larger buildings, 300 seat restaurants, much more broadly appealing and we see Cheddar's in a segment that we've defined as the place where brands are winning and we see Cheddar's competing against Cracker Barrel, Texas Roadhouse and to some degree Olive Garden in a segment that has got a very broad audience and is very appealing to lots and lots of people. And so, we don't think of this as bar and grill. Sometimes it gets segmented that way, but we see this as a varied menu restaurant and almost the antithesis of bar and grill. When we got scrap -- making all our products from scratch, it's a very broad appealing menu. So, a lot of ribs and stakes and chicken fingers. This is a full dinner house menu that's competing very, very effectively and if you look at the value ratings on this compared to bar and grill, they're not even in the same quadrant. And so, we think this is the right brand at the right time with a great consumer base to be able to continue to grow this business and its significantly underpenetrated. Stephanie Ng : Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up, how should we think about implications on the buybacks for the balance of the year and if acquisition would likely to divert some cash? Gene Lee : Yes, on the terms of buyback, what I would just lead you to is our long-term framework, which is $100 million to $200 million a year and in this fiscal year, we've already bought $200 million. We didn't buy any shares in Q3 because we were in the middle of this acquisition. So, we couldn't be in the marketplace. But I would just say, this does not preclude us from staying in the $100 million to $200 million range next year, which is our long-term framework. Stephanie Ng : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Will Slabaugh of Stephens. Your line is open. Will Slabaugh : Thanks guys. Just a question on Olive Garden, you further widened that gap as you mentioned between you and peers and didn't show that volatility that we've been seeing in the industry. So, I'm curious where you would attribute that success? Where the growth has to go, spending stepped up a little bit this quarter or if you think the promotions there seem to gain more traction on a relative basis. And I'm curious as well if you might comment on LongHorn too. Gene Lee : Yes, I think there is a couple things going on. I think I'll make a couple comments, I think are both true for Olive Garden and LongHorn and it's a boring comment, but we are maniacally focused on improving how we run our restaurants every single day and our operations teams in both those businesses continue to make significant progress, driven by our goal of simplifying the operation. My overarching message to all our teams this year is that these businesses have gotten way too complex. We need to continue to simplify and through that simplification, we should execute at a higher level. Now I think both businesses are making some really good decisions and they continue to invest in value. They continue to invest in menu innovation that continues to resonate with the consumer. Olive Garden is still benefiting from strong to-go presence. That business continues to grow and we're benefiting from that. And LongHorn I think we're starting to see the payback from all the investments that we're making in food as we start to increase the size of our stakes, improve our house salad and some other decisions that we made along the way to improve the overall operation and it's going to take time for those to continue to show themselves, but our consumer research right now in LongHorn has never been better. We're moving Northeast in our in everything that we do there and I'm really, really excited. So, I think the brands are well-positioned. They're focused on the right things. They're making good -- the leadership is making good long-term decisions in both of those brands and they should continue to win because of those decisions. Will Slabaugh : And as a quick follow-up, would you mind giving their To Go gross at Olive Garden for the quarter? Gene Lee : Yes, To Go, grew 17%, so we got a three-year stack of approximately 60% in takeout. Will Slabaugh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. I had a couple of questions with respect to trying to better understand the growth potential of Cheddar's in your portfolio. I guess I've been following it a little bit the last couple of years and as far as the overall system growth, I don't think it was at the 15% pay. So, did I hear you right that you think that this is a 15% growth brand? Is that something that you've seen in the past or is that something that within your portfolio you think you can get to those levels? Rick Cardenas : Hey Matt, this is Rick. The 15%ish growth rate was over the last 10 years. So, the last few years, they've had a little bit of slowdown in growth. We expect this brand to continue to grow in the category and to grow faster than Olive Garden would grow. So, we feel really good about their potential. They're at a 140 company-owned restaurants right now with the potential to well exceed that. Matthew DiFrisco : When it comes into your -- what is the current growth rate now in your perspective, when you bought this, are you looking at this as a you say a strong, obviously faster than Olive Garden, but that's a wide range. Is this better than a better than 5% to 10% growth or even faster? Rick Cardenas : What I would say is still little early to tell, let us get through acquisition integration and we know that we're going to have a little bit of a slowdown in growth because of the integration and ask what they've got in their unit count and then we'll come back to you later on in this fiscal year to tell you what the growth potential is or the growth rates are. Matthew DiFrisco : I guess just to better understand what's going to go through that analysis, can you talk about the portfolio? Is it today growth -- is it a diversified, does it diversify your portfolio of real estate? Is this a different location where you would find a Cheddar's in your opinion for the next 140 stores and maybe where a LongHorn or an Olive Garden would go, or is this going to compete for those same type of sites? Gene Lee : Well it's a two-acre site, so it's very similar to what Olive Garden needs. It's a much bigger site than a LongHorn. So, they probably won't be competing for LongHorn sites and I think we got 835 or so Olive Gardens today. There are a lot of places that Cheddar's can go. We're already established from an Olive Garden standpoint. So, I don't see any competition for sites. I think what it does from a portfolio standpoint, is it allow us to secure the best real estate in a market and then let us decide which one of our brands that we're going to use to take advantage of that site and that's what's exciting to our real estate team. Matthew DiFrisco : Okay. And then just a last follow-up question, the outperformance I just want to understand as far as at both LongHorn and Olive Garden, is any of that explained by the later? Are you benefiting more and seeing a seasonality because of the later timing of Easter or something else with the calendar, or is that just pure momentum, the widening of the gap at peer group. Gene Lee : I am going back to I think where we've been for two and half years focused on running better restaurants and I know it's not sexy. It's not something that people like me to talk about. That's what we're focused on. It's one guest at a time and I would truly believe that we need to focus -- continue to focus on that. We're winning because our retention rates are great. Our people are excited about what we're doing. They're rewarded appropriately and we're taking care of our guests. When they come in, we're delivering on that promise and when we don't deliver on that promise, we are recovering with our guests both socially and in other ways. Matthew DiFrisco : Excellent. That clarity is very appreciated. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have David Palmer of RBC Capital. Your line is open. David Palmer : All right. Good morning. First, just a housekeeping on Cheddar's, the restaurant level margins and overhead as a percent of sales, did you discuss that? Gene Lee : Yes, we said that restaurant level margin is about 17% of sales. We haven't talked about their overhead, but we'll talk more about that in the June. David Palmer : Okay. Great. And if you could maybe just a strategic question, what was the institutional learnings do you think from past acquisitions at Darden like Yard House and just a broader point about why Darden is ready for a portfolio approach today when that's been difficult for Darden in the past in certain areas and certainly other companies as well this portfolio approach has proving to be a distraction at some critical point, thanks? Gene Lee : Well David, I think we've always been a portfolio company. We've had more brands, less brands, more brands. I think that the way we're organized today, we're fairly decentralized on each brand as an operating company present and they have their own team. Unless it's non-consumer facing and we can get some significant synergy out of it. It's in the brand and it is non-consumer facing. We bring it in and we try to get as much synergy as we possibly can out of it. And I know I pivot back to what we think we do really well at Darden and what we do really well at Darden is enable our brands through a couple ways to succeed in the marketplace. We think we give them a great scale advantage. We think the data and insights work that we're doing, we think we help them with their strategic planning and we've got an umbrella that enables them to have unique operating cultures inside the brands and yet have these industry-leading retention numbers. And so as long as we're organized appropriately and we stay decentralized and have great presidents run their businesses, managing the portfolio is really just a management challenge and we got to keep the center small and so that we don't burden the brands but we help the brands compete more effectively in the marketplace and I believe every one of our brands goes to market today with a significant advantage. As far as what we've learned on past integration, I think we've learned a lot from 10 years ago when we did the rare acquisition through the Eddie V's and Yard House, I think that we'll understand the appropriate speed in which to implement things. We'll be able to prioritize better this time than we did the last time or the time before that. We know where the potholes are. We're going to use an outside consulting agency to do -- to lead the PMO so that there is less distraction with our internal resources so we can stay focused on the existing businesses. No one from any other brand will have any involvement in the integration at all, so that every brand president we be fully engaged running their business. And I'll just have a cursory overview of the integration, but I'll be focused on running our businesses day in and day out. So, we have learned things. We'll get better and we'll continue to get better, but we're excited about it and we think we can do this fairly quickly and fairly well. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass : Okay. Thanks very much. Just going back to Olive Garden margin performance this quarter, it wasn\u2019t clear to me, are these timing shifts you think that impacted margins or is there a step up in marketing for samplers as pre-opening is going to be a greater pressure. So is that another way, do you expect these to go away in the fourth quarter in 2018 or is there some of these pressures here to stay. Rick Cardenas : Hey John, this is Rick. Yes, the marketing pressure you talked about specifically was timing. Year-to-date we're flat on the marking as a percent of sales and we just had a very strong quarter last year which leveraged our sales in the marketing side. The other things that we've talked about are generally -- yes, again preopening is one of the big one. So, if you think about what we've had, last year Olive Garden didn't open any restaurants in the back half of the year and we're opening a lot more restaurants in the back half of this year. So, for Darden, we are opening more -- we expect to open more restaurants in the fourth quarter this year than we open all of last year. So, in Q3 and Q4, a lot of it was preopening differences. John Glass : Okay. But said another way, some of that would say then right, if you're going to, if you see to open more restaurants. Rick Cardenas : Yes, some of the preopening, we expect preopening to increase a little bit going forward, but we don't expect our margins to decline year-over-year as we go forward, but we'll talk more about next year in June. John Glass : Okay. And then just on Cheddar's and the overlap, you mentioned Olive Garden as a competitor that values space. So, what do you know about how you currently trade customers, Olive Garden with Cheddar's and when you look at the physical footprint of the two brands, how much of an overlap now when you study those stores how do you see the impact of a Cheddar's opening for example on Olive Garden. Gene Lee : Well, we don't see it impacting. This is a variety of seeking category. Obviously, we trade guests with Cheddar's, but we trade with every competitor and so we think that there are two different occasions even though they're both value occasions, we don't see them as a major threat. Whether we what we own them or not, they're going to open restaurants. So, they're just like any other competitor and that's part of how we have to deal with it internally as our brands have to compete against each other effectively. John Glass : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Sir, your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Just two quick questions on the broader industry. First one, Gene in terms of the challenges we're seeing for the broader industry, I think you mentioned in your remarks earlier, that you don't think the consumer is reacting to the promotional activity as perhaps they have in the past. I am just wondering how you frame that versus or how does that differ maybe from Olive Garden's LTOs? I am just wondering how you bucket those two things and whether you're seeing a change in the competitive landscape from those competitors and then I had one follow-up? Gene Lee : I think where I am trying to go with that is that when you look at every day value, you look at our Cucina Mia offering and Olive Garden, that's grown from 1.5% preference to 10% preference over the last two years and so we're still out there with some promotional messages, but we're not seeing preference on promotional items increase year-over-year. Now we have some very broadly appealing promotions that we run every single year that our consumer look forward to. They look forward to buy one take. When they look forward to Never Ending Pasta. Never-Ending Classics was a big hit. People look forward to that. So, we think our promotional cadence is broader than what some other of our competitors are doing where they're forcing you into buying through a construct to get that value, yet their check average continues to increase through mix and pricing. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. And then just more broadly when you think about maybe adding another brand, but just in general, in terms of the supply-demand, do you see any change or shift in the dynamic and that's kind of bigger structural headwind that the category is facing, whether you're seeing easing headwinds closing of units or maybe shifting of chambers in industry. Just how you see the industry from a supply-demand standpoint over the next couple of years? Gene Lee : Yes, there is definitely there has been an over supply for 10 years in our industry and then when you look at their shared takers and the share givers and I think the brands that are really focused on their positioning, understand what they're trying to deliver to their consumer or taking share. We opened a Yard House today and we traded $8 million in sales. We didn't create $8 million of sales in that marketplace. We took that $8 million from other competitors. And so, the way I think about is do we have share takers or share givers in all of our brands today are our share takers. And so, I think there is structural headwinds as there are lot of seats our there, but I think that our brands because of our scale and our advantages really have a strong advantage in the marketplace and we're utilizing that once we continue to aggressively manage non-consumer facing costs and put less pressure on pricing, I think we'll continue to take market share. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Jason West of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jason West : Yes thanks. Just a couple housekeeping items I guess on Cheddar's. What is the investment cost per store there and the actual square footage that you guys are targeting on those boxes? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jason, this is Rick. The average investment cost is similar to an Olive Garden. So, I'll just go with that. I'm not too different than Olive Garden and not too different than in Olive Garden size. Again, we'll get into more detail on everything about Cheddar's in the June call, but that should give you a good idea. Jason West : Okay. And then in terms of the cash flow going forward, you mentioned that you do still see room for some buybacks here, but we're obviously adding quite a bit of debt to the balance sheet. So is the plan then not going to be to pay down the debt once the deal is funded and you're cash flowing or you're going to maintain that level of debt going forward unless the EBITDA kind of catch up. Gene Lee : Yes, Jason, when we finish this transaction, whatever debt we take on, we expect to be well within our 2% to 2.5% adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR. So, we don't think that we have to go down and pay down debt as we continue to grow, but we do expect the EBITDA to continue to help with that, but day one, we would be right smack in the middle of our adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA range of 2% to 2.5% times. Jason West : Okay. It makes sense. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Karen Holthouse : Hi. Another quick question on Cheddar's, outside of the unit growth outlook, what's just the state of the system in terms of remodels? Is it one that you would expect any increase in near term spending on maintenance or remodels, thanks? Ian Baines : Hello, this is Ian. One of the great attributes of the brand is that the buildings are built to be timeless. So, they never really have to remodeled. We refurbish to make sure that they're kept in pristine fashion, but because there is no branding etcetera, the building is timeless. Karen Holthouse : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Howard Penney of Hedgeye Management. Your line is open. Howard Penney : Hi. Thank you very much. Hi, thank you. I think just by putting all the pieces of the puzzle together today is it opening up at Olive Garden gets a better return on capital than Cheddar's, is that correct based on what you said today? And then Gene, can you maybe go into little more detail in the pivot to buying brands? I know you went through the rationalization, but I was just curious as to why the acquisition strategy again? Gene Lee : Okay. Good morning, Howard. It's Gene. Yes, obviously, investment in an Olive Garden would yield you a higher return today than at Cheddar's. However, the opportunity to open Olive Garden is not as plentiful as the opportunity to open Cheddar's and we've got -- we're not fully penetrated with Olive Garden, but we're getting closer and closer and it's getting harder and harder to find locations where it would be -- we could get that return because of cannibalization and other factors. As far as the rationale and why we think this was the right time to do an acquisition, I think there is a couple things. I think we are really confident in the platform that we have built here in our four advantages and especially the first two around making scale work for us and second, what we're going to -- what we're able to do and going to be able to do with data and insights, as we get all -- get a broader portfolio. And so, we think that that was one of the reasons that we could plug something into our portfolio and given the advantage in the marketplace. This is a mature industry and we believe that some consolidation makes sense and that's what we're trying to do. We think that if we get a little bit more scale, we can continue to improve our supply chain, we can improve our use of the data and insights and hope -- and our plan if I plugged into a Darden platform, our brands have an advantage in the marketplace and we can underprice our competitors and we can continue to take market share. Howard Penney : Thank you for that. I don't mean to compare it to the previous regime, but I think some of -- the platform is there before, but it didn't work. I know this question was asked, but I think it's an important one. The platform has always been there to run multiple brands. So, your tenure, what's changed or what is different for it to work this time for me not have not been successful last time? Gene Lee : I think we're much more decentralized today than when we were -- when we were purchased by Darden 10 years ago and I think during that time, there were decisions made right, wrong or indifferent, that they were going to build more capabilities in the center and they made investments in G&A that they believe they needed to make to grow the business. We're just doing the exact opposite. We're letting the presidents run their businesses and we're focused on where we can get synergies in the middle on these non-consumer facing areas and we're trying to manage and drive down cost. G&A is 4.8 and we're committed to get making further south and we think we can continue to push that forward. And so, I think that's one of the big differences is just how we're operating. The other thing I would add Howard is that dad is more valuable today and we think that if we can use this data to understand our consumer better, we're actually focusing on a couple other things from a data standpoint that's worked in real well for us from an operational effectiveness. We think it's going to give us a huge advantage and for us to have all that data, and I think the other big difference organizationally is we're just very operational focused today and we're focused on the day-to-day execution and cost management. We understand that cost management is going to be extremely important, so that we can continue to put value on the plate for the consumer. Howard Penney : And then just lastly, is there To Go opportunity with Cheddar's or delivery or take out? Gene Lee : Yeah, so there is a huge opportunity for To Go and Cheddar's and I think that the management team is just starting to size that opportunity understand what they have to do operationally to be able to deliver on that. These are extremely busy restaurants with 6300 guests and then adding the To Go component of it, really takes a little bit operational change in their operation and I know management and my initial discussions early on have identified that and they're putting and developing the processes to implement now. Howard Penney : Thank you for the questions. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Brian Vaccaro of Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian Vaccaro : Good morning. Just wanted to circle back on the state of the Cheddar's fleet today. I believe the brand underwent a repositioning that reemphasize scratch kitchen's versus a casual caf\u00e9 positioning in the past, but just curious, was there a meaningful remodeling program associated with that shift? Gene Lee : No, I think that as Ian just said, these buildings are built in a timeless manner, very well thought out. I think the management over the years has done a great job. I think the repositioning under Ian's leadership has really more to highlight and it bring to the forefront all the wonderful things they've done with food over the years. And I think he's brought a fresh approach to it, and went out did some research, found out what consumers thought of the brand and what did he need to bring to the forefront to highlight all the attributes that the consumer, some consumers were given credit for and some weren\u2019t and I think the teams has done a masterful job with this. I love the positioning and it's on trend, scratch cooking. Brian Vaccaro : All right. That's helpful. And Gene, you mentioned that Cheddar's has or is outperforming from a comp perspective. Was that sort of last 12 months? Was that the last few years? Can you give any historical perspective there on what you were referencing there? Gene Lee : No, the only comment, I must stick to my comments. It's been outperforming the industry benchmarks in most recent times and we'll give you a little bit more color once we own this business. Brian Vaccaro : Okay. All right. Fair enough and then just shifting gears to Olive Garden if I could, I wanted to ask about average check, I noted that mix flattened out a bit or maybe some color on what's driving that? Is that an incremental shift towards value maybe some outperformance at lunch? And then also, what's your latest thinking around menu pricing at Olive Garden. I noticed that picked up a bit late in the quarter, was that pricing or a change in thinking? Thank you. Gene Lee : No, it was just, the pick-up in February was driven primarily by some adjustments in To Go pricing. We thought we were a little bit too far on the market with that. So, we ticked up there and especially in the catering piece, we also took some a little bit of pricing on the West Coast in February to offset minimum wage increases. But our philosophy going forward is we're going to try to drive that down a little bit lower than what it has been historically. I don't want to say too much more about it from a competitive standpoint, but we believe long-term if we can continue to underprice the marketplace, we're going to wake up a few years from now and have a real value gap. And the only way we can do that is to take advantage of our scale and find cost efficiencies in the rest of the operation. Brian Vaccaro : Okay. And then on the mix dynamic specifically, was that shift towards value or maybe lunch or something else driving that? Gene Lee : No. One of them is if you think about our To Go sales aren\u2019t growing nearly as fast as they were before, we're well above '20 we're down to '17. Catering is still driving some of that growth, but a little bit less of it because of To Go and we had some promotional timing shifts. So, it's not anything other than that. Brian Vaccaro : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups if I may, Gene, you mentioned we've been oversupplied in the category for 10 years. I wanted to get a sense in the trade areas that you care about whether that's effect of supply growth is slowing down or if it's maintaining the same pace as it was before? Gene Lee : No. There is definitely less supply growth especially in the mature trade areas just because there is not a whole lot of more room to develop. And so, the dynamic that's going on now is I think the trade areas are getting smaller and people are willing to drive less than they used to. And so, I think more of us are thinking about how do we bring restaurants closer to the consumer and how do we develop with that mindset, but overall the real mature trade areas today, there is just not a lot of room for development. John Ivankoe : And one of the ways that some companies are trying to do that is by developing fast casual as opposed to casual dining that is you say needs two acres in some cases to develop. So, what was the thought of going casual dining versus fast casual and is fast casual ever an option for Darden as you foresee it? Gene Lee : No. I don't see any upside in fast casual. I think it's a very difficult business model and I think there's a lot of growth out there. I am not a believer there's a lot of profitability out there. I think the barriers to entry are really low and I think our goal is how we put the fullback into full service and by doing that making sure that we understand the consumer's need to respect their time and that we're able to provide an extra service experience that is within their time parameters. And if we can do that for at the same price or sometimes even less than fast casual, we're going to continue to win. John Ivankoe : And I think you've talked before about having 2% to 3% supply growth in the U.S. for your own concepts. So, does Cheddar's allow you to be on top of that? Will you be within it? Does Cheddar's growth take over maybe some of the other businesses and I think you may have answered that a number of different questions, but\u2026 Gene Lee : I think it's absolutely within the framework. We don't think it gets us over the top of the framework. We think it helps us get solely in the framework. John Ivankoe : Okay. And the last one, thanks for this speed round, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned commodities actually being up in the fourth quarter of '17, if I heard that correctly, is that the kind of the beginning of another cyclical trend in commodities? What are you currently seeing in the basket? Rick Cardenas : Hey John, it's Rick. Yes, we did say commodities are expected to be up, buy up ever so slightly in the fourth quarter. Eventually this is going to turn. So, we're not going to talk about '18 yet, but we do see commodities slight inflation this quarter and what we talk about in our presentation, we're about 80% covered. So, we're, pretty covered for the rest of the year and including 80% in beef. So, we feel pretty good about where our numbers for the rest of this year and we'll talk about '18 in '18. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Todd Duvick of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Todd Duvick : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just a couple of quick ones. Could you tell us how many of the Cheddar's restaurants are owned and if there is a potential sale leaseback opportunity for these restaurants? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Todd, this is Rick. All the restaurants are leased. So, there is a potential for a sale-leaseback. Todd Duvick : Okay. That's helpful. And with the remaining franchise restaurants, can you tell us if the franchisee, well if it's one or multiple franchisees and if they have development rights for future restaurant growth? Gene Lee : Hey Todd. This is quite a few franchisees not really any development rights other than maybe a couple of them for future growth. Todd Duvick : Okay. Thank you very much. Gene Lee : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Steve Anderson of Maxim Group. Your line is open. Steve Anderson : Yes. Good morning, Just a follow-up on the questions just asked before about the franchise units. Do you foresee any plans to buy back those franchise units given that Cheddar's already had bought back a large franchisee of 44 units, that deal closed back in January? Rick Cardenas : Hey Steve, it's Rick. That deal was part of right of first refusal that Cheddar's had to buy those franchisees back. It's still little early in the process. Again, we don't want to talk about integration. We're just getting throws of that and what we're going to do with the 25 other franchise restaurants. Suffice to say there have been some conversation that Ian had yesterday just letting them know that the acquisition is happening, but that's just as far as we're going to go. Steve Anderson : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Andrew Strelzik : Hey. Good morning. I just had two quick ones. On the synergies number, you mentioned 4% of revenues versus over 5% historically. Is there anything structural with respect to Cheddar's that limits that synergy opportunity relative to history, maybe the decentralization that you talked about? And secondarily, I know over the last 12 to 18 months, there were some Cheddar's unit closures, just wondering what went into that decision and maybe anything that you learnt from a market perspective or a growth perspective, development perspective going forward thanks? Rick Cardenas : Hey Andrew, the synergies we're seeing 4% of sales. We're just getting in the process of estimating the synergies. We wanted to give you an idea of what we think they could be with some solid numbers. So, we wanted to feel good about the synergies we told you. If we think there's more as we go through the integration process, we'll let you know, but right now using 4% versus our historical 5%, we think is a prudent thing to do. In regards to some of the closings, as we said, they did have a pretty good growth spur over the last 10 years around 15% growth rate in their company-owned restaurants including Greer. And they closed about five or six of them couple years ago as their process and that's normal, that's normal in any restaurant company. You have some closing. The good news for us is they already did that, night. So, they\u2019ve gone through the process of looking at their portfolio and they made those closings a couple years ago including a couple of them I think were franchise units. So, we don't feel that the closings were an issue. We think that was a good thing for us. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Chris O'Cull of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Gene, it looks like Cheddar's will represent just under 10% of the portfolio's EBITDA. How did its size factor into the consideration and do you expect it to become the third core primary brand in the Darden portfolio? Gene Lee : Good question, Chris. We wanted to make sure we added something that was going to make a difference for Darden and to help kind of hedge longer-term against Olive Garden and make sure we had a big enough opportunity there. We look at the opportunity for Cheddar's and we look at the consumer and we look at how it compares to an Olive Garden. We definitely think that Cheddar's long-term will be the number three brand. It could possibly be the number two brand inside the portfolio. This is a very broadly appealing brand that has a strong, strong reputation in the marketplace and so we wanted to make sure that we added something to the portfolio that was going to be -- give us a significant opportunity into the future. Chris O'Cull: Okay. And then just, answer this question in a different way, but how quickly could you accelerate development of Cheddar's? Do they have managers in training, opening teams or do you plan to use the other brands to help, build those spots? Maybe talk a little bit about that. Gene Lee : Chris, I think someone asked me earlier what have we learned in the past? We learned that integration is hard and so we're going to spend the first 12 months, 12 to 18 months integrating the existing units into our systems so that we can benefit from our advantages. They\u2019ve got a strong pipeline, but like any business that we've owned, people will be the restrictor on how fast you can grow and so we'll figure out over time is there is a way for them to leverage resources, human resources from our other brands to help them grow, but if not, we will grow as fast as we have the human capital to grow. Sites won't be a problem, but we'll just to gauge our readiness from a human resource standpoint. We've got to -- the biggest challenge I see growing this brand is to maintain the culture and don't dilute the culture into the future and to do that, you've got to train people and give enough time in the brand so that they can understand what you're trying to do. These are high-volume, fairly difficult restaurants to operate. Chris O'Cull: Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Jake Bartlett from SunTrust. Your line is open. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first just a point of clarification just so we understand the growth at Cheddar's in the past, how many units did Cheddar's have at the end of 2015 and I asked looking at Technomic numbers, which show 168, so wanted to make sure that that's correct or not? Rick Cardenas : Yes Jeff, Jake, I am sorry. This is Rick. We don't know what the Technomic number was. I hear you say 168. I don't have the number that they had at the end of '15 in front of me, but we get back to you on a one-on-one call with that information. Jake Bartlett : Okay. And then also just in terms of your own unit growth you gave us 30 to 35 gross units in 2018, can you help us out with what that means for on a net basis? Gene Lee : Well, in a typical year, we may have some restaurants as leases are coming up, I would just keep -- we gave you the growth numbers, so you can understand the capital piece. We'll give you -- what I can tell you is in our long-term framework, we've got 2% to 3% total new unit growth, which includes closing. We think we'll be within that framework without Cheddar's. Jake Bartlett : Okay. Maybe could you help us year-to-date this year in 2017 how many have opened and how many have closed? Gene Lee : Yes, we have opened -- year-to-date, we've opened 15 and we've closed six. We have as I said 24 to 28 openings -- growth openings in the plan this year. Jake Bartlett : Okay. Thank you very much. Gene Lee : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. Just two number questions, the 17% in the Cheddar's margin, how much is marketing in that or how does that compare to what you pay or you spend on marketing for your brands? And then also I just, I don't know if you addressed this or not, I am sorry if I missed it regarding franchising. Obviously, this was the first brand that you've gotten in your portfolio now with franchise growth potential. What type of commitments are out there and is this something that's going to be consolidated longer term or is this now a new addition to your portfolio of franchise growth? Gene Lee : Hey Matt, marketing as a percent of sales is fairly low. It's less than 1% as a percent of sales. As it relates to the franchise growth, there aren't any commitments really from these franchisees to open any more restaurants and we will talk a little bit more about what our plans are as we get through the integration. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. No more questions at this time sir. Kevin Kalicak : All right. Thank you, Ray. That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we plan to release fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, June 27, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of those measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings on September 26th before the market opens followed by a conference call. This morning Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights, Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from both the fourth quarter and the full year before providing our outlook for fiscal 2018. And Gene will have some closing remarks before we open the call for your questions. During today's call, references to Darden same restaurant sales for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 do not include Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks, Kevin and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.93 billion, an increase of 8.1%. Same restaurant sales grew 3.3%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 480 basis points. Adjusted operating income grew 10% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.18, an increase of 7.3% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. The momentum we experienced as a result of our back to basics operating philosophy. Our focus on food, service and atmosphere drives our simplification efforts. These efforts continue to enable us to improve execution on our restaurants and strengthen team member engagement, as evidenced by our industry leading retention rates. The fact that our guest satisfaction scores are at all time highs, while we are growing guest count is a clear indication that we're improving operationally. Olive Garden momentum continued during the quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 4.4%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 590 basis points. This was Olive Garden's 11th consecutive quarter same restaurant sales growth, driven by our focus on flawless execution, which lead to all-time high guest satisfaction scores, compelling promotional offers like our giant stuffed pastas that resonated with our guests and our strong To Go performance which grew 16%. The numerous investments the Olive Garden team has made over time, such as our remodels and bar refreshes, new kitchen equipment and the technology platform behind Olive Garden To Go, continues to pay off. The team is making meaningful strategic decisions where both our guests and our team members win. Longhorn Steakhouse's same restaurant sales grew 3.5%, the 17th consecutive quarter of growth outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 500 basis points. We are seeing the brand's long term strategy to begin to pay off. The team continues to focus on improving the quality of the guest experience by investing in food quality and service execution, simplifying operations, and leveraging our unique culture to increase team member engagement. These efforts drove increased guest count of 2.1% during the quarter, and our guest feedback has never been better. Turning to Cheddar's, we closed the acquisition on April 24th, and same restaurant sales were up 1.3% for the five weeks that we owned the brand. I continue to be impressed with Ian Baines and his team. They're focused on the right things to drive the business. We are well underway integrating Cheddar's into the Darden platform so they can benefit from our competitive advantages, while ensuring the restaurant teams maintain their high levels of in-restaurant execution. Although, it's a complicated process, everything is progressing as planned. The integration includes bringing Cheddar's on to a proprietary POS system, which is the backbone of our platform, and that will take approximately a year to complete. Once this foundational element is finished, we will be able to introduce our productivity tools, which we expect to have further improved performance. Cheddar's is an exciting addition to our portfolio, which we believe will add significant value to Darden over the long-term. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thanks, Gene, and good morning everyone. As Gene mentioned, total sales for the fourth quarter increased 1.8%. This included $63 million in sales from five weeks of Cheddar's operations. Fourth quarter reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.99 and were negatively impacted by $0.19 related to a non-cash accounting charge of $0.10 from the early settlement of a portion of our pension plan commitments, and $0.09 of Cheddar's transaction and integration expenses. After adjusting for these items, earnings per share growth was 7.3% to $1.18, driven by strong same restaurant sales growth of 3.3% and an additional $0.01 contribution from Cheddar's operating results. We also paid-out over $70 million in dividends and repurchased approximately $15 million in stock this quarter. Looking at the P&L, food and beverage was favorable at 10 basis points with commodities inflation essentially flat this quarter. Restaurant labor was unfavorable 10 basis points as continued wage pressures slightly offset productivity gains. Restaurant expense was unfavorable 20 basis points due to incremental pre-opening expense related to seven more new restaurants opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Sales leverage, primarily at Olive Garden, resulted in marketing expenses being favorable to last year by 20 basis points. And G&A was unfavorable 10 basis points to last year due to greater incentive compensation expense as a result of our strong fourth quarter performance. This all resulted in EBIT margin expansion of 10 basis points above last year, and adjusted absolute EBIT dollar growth of 9.9%. Our 23.3% effective tax rate in the quarter was 270 basis points higher than last year's rate, which was aided by one-time tax benefit. This difference in effective rate along with incremental interest from our new debt issuance resulted in adjusted EBIT growth key growth of 5.8%. Turning to our operating segments, Olive Garden, LongHorn, and Fine Dining, all posted segment profit margin expansion versus last year. While segment profit margin for the other business was 150 basis points below last year due to incremental preopening costs for three more openings in last year, temporary closures at Seasons 52 and Yard House and the addition of Cheddar's to the segment, altering the segment profit margin mix. Fiscal 2017 marked another great year of progress as our brands continued leveraging the power of Darden's competitive advantages. Total sales grew -3.4% to approximately $7.2 billion. Same restaurant sales growth of 1.8% exceeded the industry by over 400 basis points. All segments posted positive segment profit margin growth after adjusting for the impact of increased rent from the real-estate transaction. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share grew 14%, and we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders in the form of approximately $280 million in dividends and $230 million in share repurchases at an average price of approximately $63 per share. Our average diluted share count for the year was 126 million, and we ended the year with approximately 126.9 million diluted shares outstanding. In addition to meaningful sales and earnings growth at our legacy brands, we further increased our scale with the Cheddar's acquisition. Cheddar's has broad guest appeal and is ranked number one in value and casual dining. In addition to being number one in value, Cheddar's also ranks first in both food and beverage and atmosphere ratings, leading to the highest intent to return and intent-to-recommend ratings in casual dining. Cheddar's is a strong performer with same restaurant sales for full 2017 Darden's fiscal calendar of positive 0.3%, outperforming the industry by over 300 basis points. Restaurant sales volumes averaged $4.5 million and the average of the top and bottom quartile , each are within plus or minus 25% of this $4.5 million. Average restaurant level EBITDA of 17% is compelling and essentially all restaurants have positive cash flows. With over $600 million in sales, $70 million in EBITDA and given their current footprint, Cheddar's will make a significant contribution to Darden's growth. As we further progress with the integration of Cheddar's, we have gained more confidence in our initial synergy estimates. We now expect run rate synergies of $22 million to $27 million to be fully realized by the end of fiscal 2019, up from the $20 million to $25 million we previously indicated. We\u2019ve included a couple of additional slides at the back of this presentation, providing supplemental information regarding Cheddar's. Turning to fiscal 2018, as we announced last quarter, we will discontinue disclosing our monthly same restaurant sales results beginning with our next earnings release. This change is due to the significant variability in month-to-month sales results due to weather, promotional calendar and holiday shifts among other things that generally result throughout the quarter. In fiscal 2018, we anticipate total sales growth of 11.5% to 13%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of between 1% and 2%, 35 to 40 new restaurants; including Cheddar's with roughly one-third opening in the first half of the year and the remaining two-thirds in the back half, and the full year impact of Cheddar's sales. We also continue to expect approximately $0.12 of accretion related to Cheddar's; capital spending between $400 million and $450 million, including Cheddar's; total inflation of approximately 2% comprised of between 0% and 1% commodities inflation and between 3% and 4% of total labor inflation; and annual effective tax rate of roughly 26% and approximately 127 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year; all resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share of between $4.38 and $4.50. This morning, we also announced that our Board approved a 12.5% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $0.63 per share, which results in a dividend yield of 2.9% based on fiscal 2018\u2019s beginning share price. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gene for some closing remarks. Gene Lee : Thanks, Rick. Looking back at fiscal 2017, I am proud of the progress we\u2019ve made to achieve our mission, which is to be financially successful through great people consistently delivering outstanding food, drinks and service and inviting atmosphere making every guest loyal. Our results demonstrate that the execution of our strategy is working. We continue to build guest loyalty and take market share by executing against our back to basics operating philosophy. And we continue to strengthen and leverage Darden's core competitive advantages to enable sales growth and expand margins across the portfolio. Ultimately, it's more than 175,000 team members who bring to life our strategy and fulfill our mission. The teams in our restaurants and our restaurant support center are engaged and focused on the right priorities, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished this past year. And so I want to close by saying thank you to all of them, especially our newest team members from Cheddar's. We recognize there's more work to be done, but I'm confident that we have the right people in place and we will continue to win by building loyalty, one restaurant, one ship, one guest at a time. And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim. Sir, your line is open. Matthew DiFrisco : My question is with respect to OG to go and the delivery business, in general, for your portfolio. I guess, how do you see the building of it now as we get into -- we're cycling some of the bigger growth rates from the year ago. Does it continue to expand its reach, and is delivery something now that is going to propel the off-premise sales further? And then I don't know if you gave it. But can you just tell us what percent does Cheddar's do and how much of an opportunity given its strong value proposition would off-premise sales be also or the meal at home occasion similar to what you've executed with Olive Garden? Thank you. Gene Lee : Good morning Matt, that's a lot of question in there. Let me just answer the Cheddar's, I'm going to go backwards. And Cheddar's is about 4% to 5% takeout. It's something that, again I think that the consumer's demanding. And so therefore, we're going to use some of our learnings from Olive Garden and pass that along to that management team, and hopefully that will be a driver of that business going into the future. Let's go to Olive Garden, takeout remains strong; we got a three year comp of about 58%; we're about 12.5% of total sales; the consumer's still demanding convenience. And if you step back and say okay where do we make the strategic choice, it was three or four years ago, let's say, we were going to bet on the consumer wanting more convenience in their dining experiences, and we built a strategy to go after that. I don't believe that if a consumer is going to back off at all, and the consumer's going to continue to demand this from us. And we'll continue to meet them, meet that demand, and I foresee growth continuing. We think the upside still is in our catering, our large party delivery. I'm not going to get into specifics about that, but we believe that we've got a product that is differentiated compared to our competitive set, and we think there's some big upside growth there. Lastly, on the third party delivery, just as we were last quarter, we're in test with multiple purveyors delivering our product. We're trying to see how this whole thing plays out, but I think that the majority of our focus in Olive Garden is still large party delivery and large party takeout. I would think that's where our competitive advantage is. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Rick, first question is for you, just on the EPS guidance for 2018. Are you assuming any of the $22 million to $27 million of synergies -- close at all into '18, or are we going to assume that all goes into \u201819? Rick Cardenas : We assume low-single-digit millions is going to flow into '18 and the rest of it will be in '19. Brian Bittner : And then Gene just on the restaurant traffic, I mean your brands have been outperforming the industry nicely for a while, but the inflection in your own traffic this quarter was really interesting to see in the release. Can you just put a little more color to what you think actually drove that upswing in traffic, both at Olive Garden and LongHorn? Gene Lee : Well, I think there is couple of things. Let's not forget that we\u2019ve had a later Easter this year. We did have a calendar benefit in the quarter, difficult for us to quantify because this isn't like holiday moving from one week to the other. So we did have some benefit with the calendar, but I believe the real driver of this is the strategic choices that we continue to make. We continued underpriced inflation, which results in underpricing our competitors. And I believe that we're now at three years into improving our operations every single-day. Don\u2019t underestimate how simplifying our business has helped us improve execution. When we look at both Olive Garden and LongHorn where they were three years ago operationally to where we are today, these businesses are much simpler on a trajectory to continue to get even more simpler and we believe that's the key to our guest count growth is better execution through simplicity. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Ma'am, your line is open. Sara Senator : Just a couple of questions about the top line, please. The first is just on the comp guidance, 1% to 2% when you look at what you did this year above that, and kind of the momentum you are bringing into the start of the year. Just curious if that's -- if it mean that using that guidance reflects just kind of the long-term view. What the portfolio should comp or if there is something else to it in terms of your outlook, and then I guess the second question on this top line. When I look at your core brands as I think of them, Olive Garden and LongHorn, they certainly seem to be outperforming the rest of the portfolio; and so including Cheddar's, although it might have had an impact from the transition, but I guess I was just curious do you still see or can you still articulate the rationale for portfolio. And do you think that when you look at Cheddar's, is there an opportunity to accelerate that top line maybe a little more detail than what you\u2019re able to give us last quarter? Thanks. Gene Lee : Let me start with the first question. I think when I think about our comp guidance and we\u2019re forecasting into the future and pretty far out in the future, at this point in time and what gives you yearly number. And there are just a lot of unknowns. Our plan is to under price inflation again with the goal of increasing market share. So we\u2019re going to rely less on check average to get same restaurant sales growth. And so when we look that far out, we're thinking 1% to 2% is a good place to start. It has nothing to do with how we feel about our current trends. We\u2019re just trying to forecast out for 12 months. So we feel that\u2019s a prudent guidance at this point in time with everything that we know. And as we get closer towards the end of the year, as we have in the past, we\u2019ll continue to update that guidance. As far as the portfolio and rest of our brands, couple of comments later Easter hurts fine dining and so capital grow was impacted by that. When I look at- - I look at their rest of our brands, the returns on invested capital, the profit margins in those brands are really strong. If we try to measure every brand up against Olive Garden from a return standpoint that\u2019s just not possible, I mean Olive Garden is a once in a lifetime restaurant brand. I look at our performance throughout the quarter. Yard House was $8.3 million or $8.3 million average unit volumes, same restaurant sales are going to continue -- always going to be hard to get as we continue to add new units and build that out. It's an incredible brand we want own that. Bahama Breeze has had seven years of same restaurant sales growth, 1.4% in the quarter. Bahama Breeze would start significantly as some other competitors were with the weather in the north east and loosing -- we lose a lot of our debt capacity, which in some of our restaurants in north east is 30% capacity. And so I also think when we look at how we think about this and we look at our advantages of scale and gotten insides. These brands can add to that and they\u2019re getting incredible leverage of the Darden platform. These are great brands and they provide us a lot of growth and lot of opportunities. As far as accelerating Cheddar's growth, I think it's -- what we\u2019ll have to wait and see and understand is; we\u2019re their human resource capabilities; we\u2019ll be able to trying sites for them, it's just a matter of when do they have the human resources to be able to ramp up growth; and we need to really spend the next 12 to 18 months focusing on integration. This is our fourth one. We understand the importance of getting the integration correct and then try to grow once we have done that. So our focus here in the next 18 months is to get this integration completed correctly and build human resource capabilities, so we can grow this brand. This is a powerful brand. It's doing 6,300 guests a week. There is no one out there in casual dining doing that kind of volume. This is exciting for us. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. Brett Levy : Can you share a little bit on your use across the casual -- across the competitive landscape between promotional, regional and also what you\u2019re seeing on labor? And also what kind of impacts do you think Amazon\u2019s move into Whole Foods can have either directly or indirectly in the restaurant industry? Thank you. Gene Lee : I would say a couple of comments on the industry. I still say there is pockets that there\u2019s some real strength, there is some pockets where there is some weakness. We\u2019re still seeing an upscale where we used in. You\u2019re seeing real weakness in New York City, which has had a little bit of impact on capital growth. But overall, I haven't seen a whole lot of change in the competitive landscape. The consumer in our view is not as reactionary to short term incentives, they come in and eat. They're looking for everyday value, and that's something that we continue to promote. If you look at our promotions, they've been actually a little bit higher priced than they have been historically. We're using other ways to get at the value consumer, so that I have nothing new to report on the environment. Again, if you look at the indexes, because of the calendar -- a little bit because of the calendar swing you had some more strength in our fourth quarter versus where we were in our third quarter. Labor, we continue to see some pretty good inflationary pressure. We're thrilled that we're able to think or actually improve our retention rates right now; our team members are staying with us; they're engaged, but there is some inflation; there's 3% to 4% wage inflation in our labor number, right now; we're able to offset some of that with productivity enhancements. But labor continues to be something that we're focused on. And lastly, the question on Amazon, the only way Amazon's in our world right now is through Amazon Prime delivery; we have a test going with them; we'll continue to partner with them and see if we can make that work; we constantly sit around here thinking about how does Amazon have an impact on our business. Our research tells us that guests still want to come to restaurants. Believe it or not, millennials still want to come to restaurants. I know you all don't think millennials go to casual dining restaurants, but 30% of all of our guests are millennials versus the 24% -- they're 24% of the population, so we over index. Cheddar's really over indexes with millennials as does Olive Garden. People still want to come to restaurants and have that experience. And we just got to provide them the right experience and the right value. And I think that's what we're doing at all our brands today and that's why we continue to win. Brett Levy : Just one follow-up on that, on the indirect side. Do you feel that, as we're starting to see the narrowing of the CPI gap, if this leads to a little bit more of a promotional cadence at the grocers and they're not actually going to push price up? Do you think that there's any risk to what could happen at the restaurant level margins? Thanks. Gene Lee : No, I mean I haven't been a believer in that philosophy from the get-go that the deflation in grocery stores has impacted the restaurant business. I mean we have, we just haven't seen that correlation. And when we look at the industry data, we have a few grocery people in our ranks now that know a little bit about that business. I'm just not a believer in that thought. And so I think it\u2019s imperative for us to keep our value equation in line with what the consumers' expectation is. And if you look at -- I think go back and look at Olive Garden's menu today, I mean four years ago we didn't have a $999 price point, I think we have soup, salad and bread sticks. Today, we have all-day Cucina Mia at $999; we have Lunch Duos starting at $699; we have the Early Dinner Duos staring at $899. You look at the face of our lunch menu and you don\u2019t see a whole lot over $999. And I think that\u2019s what -- I think we got to continue to find ways to take cost out of the business so that we can keep our value equation in line with what the consumer wants. Operator : Thank you. Next we have David Tarantino of Baird. Sir, your line is open. David Tarantino : Just first a clarification question Gene on that last points. Did you mentioned the level of pricing that you have embedded in your guidance for this year, the 1% to 2% comp guidance? Rick Cardenas : What we've said in the past and we\u2019ll just reiterate here is we expect to take pricing in between 1% to 2% a year. We usually try to get on the on the lower end of that range, probably the same thing next year so probably the lower end of that. David Tarantino : And then I guess my question is about Cheddar's, and Gene and Rick you shared some additional metrics. And I was just wondering what your thoughts are on your ability to grow the volumes or the average unit volumes at Cheddar's given how strong the traffic trends already are, do you have capacity to grow? And where do you think those can go overtime? Rick Cardenas : Well, I think that's a very good question, David. And Cheddar's is underpenetrated in its markets today. And they've historically been really concerned about cannibalization. We don\u2019t believe that's the right thought process. We believe in relative market share as a way to drive overall profitability. So we will continue -- as we grow this, we think we\u2019re going to backfill our markets, the gains from efficiencies. And so I don\u2019t know whether the play here is to see average unit volumes go up or is it really an total sales play and to improve overall profitability with better relative market share inside the market. Now with that said, top cortile restaurants are at $7.5 million -- $5.5 million. And so as you think about, there is capacity but I'm not going to be afraid of cannibalization, I mean for me it's the same argument. We have 500 Olive Garden's, we were doing -- our average unit volumes were higher, but our total sales were a lot less. And I think about this as total sales for the brand and overall total profitability. And I would urge everybody not to focus on what the average unit volumes are. My guess is the system they\u2019re going to come down overtime, because we don\u2019t need a new investment to do $4.5 million to get a great return on invested capital. And so we\u2019ll continue to build these things out just as we do with Olive Garden, volumes had to come down to get to almost $4 billion in sales. Operator : Thank you. Next we have John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. John Glass : Rick, first if I can just go to the guidance that you provided for 2018, if you backed out the accretion from Cheddar's, it's a mid-single digit EPS growth number. I understand taxes are going to be higher and there\u2019s a few other, and those shares are higher. Is that all there is? I mean, inflation looks benign. Is there is going to be more G&A investment required next year, is there another piece I guess that I'm missing? Rick Cardenas : John, you\u2019re not missing anything else. One of the things is we are going to be pricing below our inflationary impacts. And so we\u2019re doing this for the long run. As Gene mentioned, we\u2019re going to leverage Darden's advantages, leverage Darden's scale the price below, inflation in our competition to grow market share overtime. So next year, yes, we\u2019ll be in the higher single digit without Cheddars. But I don\u2019t think you can look at it just without Cheddar\u2019s. One of the reasons we bought Cheddar\u2019s is to continue to grow. And so taking Cheddar\u2019s out of the mix probably isn\u2019t the way to look at it. That said, yes, without Cheddar\u2019s we\u2019re close to the high single digits. And share count is a lot higher than you guys would have had in your models for a couple of reasons; one, as you saw, we ended the year with 127 million shares roughly; even our average share count for the year was 126 million. And so one of the thing that\u2019s happening to us next year is the change in stock comp accounting is going to add another half million shares to our share count, will be offset by our share buyback. So that\u2019s why our share count is higher than what your model says. We\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase, but we have between 100 million and 200 million in share repurchases in the plan next year. John Glass : And then now on Cheddar\u2019s, you talked about POS integration and that takes a year. Is that largely going to be a cost benefit you\u2019d be able to manage their P&Ls better with that information, or is a sales driving tool? I guess, asked another way, what I'm driving at is what are the tools you can bring to Cheddar\u2019s to drive better comps? I know you said it's not an easy game, but at the same time, better comps get better margins and this is a brand that\u2019s under comping your other brands. How do you bridge that if you desire to drive higher comps? How do you do that? Is that a POS item or what are the leverages that you give them? Rick Cardenas : The POS is the backbone, John. It really gives us the data and insights that we need to end up driving the business long term. The productivity tools labor, food cost management, all those -- what I call the productivity tools, will be added after we get the POS system. And we have to install the POS system to do that. Also, to grow productivity we\u2019ll increase because we\u2019ll be able to do online ordering. And so we know from doing these in the past, we\u2019ve got to get the POS system and then we can plug then into the rest of the Darden productivity tools to help run the business. We look at under-comping our business that\u2019s still beating the industry by 300 basis points. We\u20195re still doing 6,400 -- 6300 guests a week. There is still a lot for us to learn on what's the right balance between guest counts and price. We have to really lay out what the long term strategy is to maximize the brand. I wouldn\u2019t be concerned about the comp level, at this point. This thing is powerful. We\u2019re probably six to nine months away from fully realizing everything we have with this brand and what's the best strategy going forward. Operator : Next we have Will Slabaugh of Stephens. Sir, your line is open. Will Slabaugh : I had a question on real estate as it pertains to Cheddar\u2019s, and then more broadly, if you would. It seems that with Cheddar\u2019s large AVs and industry low ticket, the foot traffic has been pretty impressive, which implies you need to be bid on with the site selection. So as you look at the total store count in your slide deck for Cheddar's, it looks like it\u2019s only grown a handful of net stores over the past few years. So wonder if you could talk about the Company's history there, and how you feel about your ability to continue to find the right sites that can put up those types of volumes? Gene Lee : Yes, sites aren't a problem, okay. We can find the sites. We could give Cheddar's 30 sites tomorrow with our systems and what we have. And if you look at the Cheddar's footprint, it reminds me a lot of like the Texas Roadhouse footprint where they\u2019re in second third tier suburban type areas, I mean those sites are a lot easier to get and trying to get a Yard House site. The sites aren\u2019t the problem here. When you look at their history, they had a rapid growth period where they outran or outgrew their human resources. I keep come back to this. And we continue to learn this lesson sometimes the hard way and we learned it with seasons. We outgrew our human resources and we paid a price for that. Before Cheddar's can grow, we need to ensure that they're culturally strong with a strong bench of general managers who can run these recipes, high volume complicated restaurants. And it's going to be a purely when management tells us that they have the human resources to go, we will stock the pipeline and they can open as many restaurants if they have the human resources to do. I'm committed to not force this management team to get out ahead of itself. I've learned this lesson over last 20 years too many times. I'm not going to learn it again. We're going to only open restaurants that we have great management to open these restaurants. And they\u2019re, at this point in time, they're still recovering from that fast growth phase. Ian's only been in for a little around two years, and he is incredibly focused on building that. Now, can we use some of our resources in our vast pool of restaurants to go over and maybe help them, yes. But you still have cultural challenges that people have to understand that Cheddar's culture before they can go in and run one of these businesses. We can't just transform from one of our other restaurant to say, hey go run this 6,500 guest count restaurant that's got a much lower check average and different employment phase started out. And so work to be done here, but sites will not be a problem at all. I mean right now I'm just holding back our Chief Development Officer to say we have people, we'll let you know. Will Slabaugh : Then a quick follow-up, if I could. Have you given the average check most recently for Cheddar's? Gene Lee : Well, I'd say about 13.50. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open. Gregory Francfort : Just maybe one quick housekeeping one. On the 35 to 40 openings, how many of those are going to be Cheddar's this year? Gene Lee : Greg, it's going to be four to five this coming up year. Gregory Francfort : And then just on the margins, on 2% overall inflation, I guess, does that mean that if you comp above 2%, there's margin upside and if you comp below 2%, there's margin downside. And I guess my question asked another way is are there more cost savings opportunities you guys have to drive additional margin upside from here, and I guess where will those programs be focused? Rick Cardenas : Greg, it's not as simple as the comping above 2% or below 2%, because we do have some cost saves that we have identified. But we're not to announce how much they are, because normally when we talk about cost saves, we say this is going to be the net P&L impact of them. What we\u2019re doing now with our cost saves is we\u2019re going to continue to invest in pricing below our inflation and pricing below our competition. So that's one of the investments that we\u2019re doing with these cost saves. We're also going to invest in quality, enhancing quality like we've done with LongHorn and Olive Garden, continue these investments to drive market share in the future. That said, what we have mention in our long-term frame work in the past is we still expect to be within our long-term framework of EBIT expansion year-over-year. So our long-term trend will be 10 basis points to 40 basis points. We expect to be in that even with pricing at the below inflation line. Gregory Francfort : And maybe if I can speak one last one, and just on the technology platform changes, or not the changes but the changes you\u2019re putting into Cheddar's. I guess what are the competitive advantages around the technology you have and how do those show-up operationally in the stores? Gene Lee : Greg, I can tell you about a lot of competitive advantages but let me start with the backbone, which our POS. Because we own and operate our own POS and we develop all of the things we can pull all the data and keep all of the data and match that to check level information, match that to demographic information match that to even operational information. So we\u2019re able to find out who the best people to run a shift are based on all of the data that we have. And an ancillary benefit of moving them to our backbone is we don\u2019t have to pay for the POS, I mean that's something that we've developed overtime and it's now spread across Cheddar's as well. So I can probably name of many when we any of -- on a one-on-one call, we can talk about them, we've talked them before. I'll give you a couple of more; labor management, when we put them on our labor management system it's not just a scheduling tools it's a management tool; how do you manage labor; how do you manage in and out times; how do you manage breaks, et cetera. And those are the things that we've built overtime that other people try to copy and it's hard to do. Operator : Thank you. Next we have David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. David Palmer : First, a follow-up on to go, it looks like you are approaching 600,000 per restaurant in to go. Are you still thinking you'll get to the 1 million or maybe that's changing, and how important do you think delivery is going to be for you to get there? Rick Cardenas : We still believe we\u2019re going to get them. We have restaurants already over 1 million and takeout. And we continue to look at our processes and procedures, maybe even dedicating little bit more stake internally to be able to fulfill this demand. On the takeout -- on the delivery, we\u2019re focused on -- right now, we're focused on large party delivery. We see the opportunity there versus moving $10 meal here and $10 mean there. We can do a large party with an average check of approximately $300 that's where we need to focus, and that's what we decided the opportunity is. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Peter Saleh of BTIG. Sir, your line is open. Peter Saleh : Gene, I think you mentioned guest satisfaction scores at Olive Garden were an all-time high. Can we just take a step back and just remind us again when do we see the trajectory on the guest satisfaction scores start to really improve and what were you guys doing at the brand, at that time? Gene Lee : We start to really improve was probably about 18 months ago, they were improving but it was more of trajectory. And then since we've introduced Ziosk we\u2019ve seen -- that's really been a better way to measure if we\u2019re getting real feedback from a lot more guests. The key here is simplification. We\u2019ve made these restaurants easier for our managers to run and easier to execute the food where we\u2019ve brought the menus in a little bit. And one of the keys as you design menus is to be able to move a lot of products, you develop reputation. And so you focus the demand in on fewer items, you become better at delivering them, and you are much faster. And simplification has been the key and I have been saying after three years. We\u2019re not done yet, we still think we can make these operations simpler. It's going to take a while because there are ramifications from a profitability standpoint as you simplify. The smaller the menu the less stuff you sale. But we have to try to figure that out. But I am confident that it\u2019s a simplification of the operation that\u2019s driving guest satisfaction. Peter Saleh : Then just a follow up, the Cheddar\u2019s brand is that also have the Ziosk or is that something you guys are considering? Or is that -- are we too early in this conversation? Gene Lee : It's too early in this conversation. I think that it's something that we could consider down the road. But there is no way from a technology standpoint that we could support that implementation right now. And as Rick talked about, a lot of things that we\u2019re doing to bring Cheddar\u2019s up to speed and get on our platform means that there is other work to support our other businesses that aren\u2019t getting done this year, they\u2019re getting pushed back a little bit. And so right now it's just a matter of technological resources. Do I think Ziosk could be a good option Cheddar\u2019s down the road, yes. But it's not in the immediate future. We don\u2019t have the work, the capabilities, to do that. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Two questions, the first one is just a follow up perhaps for Rick on the fiscal '18 guidance. I think previously you had said prior to Cheddar I think the total shareholder return would -- it\u2019ll be reasonable that you\u2019d been within that 10% to 15% range. Now, it looks like -- we\u2019re talking about maybe 12% to 15% total shareholder return with Cheddar\u2019s. I am just wondering if there was anything that might have changed in recent months, or whether it's just conservatism that now we\u2019re not at or above the high end with that $0.12 accretion, and then one follow-up. Rick Cardenas : Let's start with what we said our long term guidance is. Our long term framework is 10% to 15% total shareholder return. We did say that\u2019s over the long run, and there will be years it will be above that and below that. That said, the biggest reason that our TSR the way we\u2019re talking about it the implied TSR is at 11.9% to 15%, which is what our guidance would imply is because our share count is diluting because of stock comp and other things. If you go and you look at our guidance and the way we\u2019ve implied our sales growth and our margin expansion, you can back into an e-growth that is above our long term framework. And so remember, e-growth is part of that TSR and e-growth is above our long term framework if you do the math you can figure that out. The only reason that we have TSR at the lower end or within our framework is because of the share count dilution that we have for one year. One more point on share count. Every year, our share count has declined year-over-year at the end of the year. The only reason it\u2019s changing next year is because we bought most of our shares early this year. We're assuming that we're going to buy them evenly throughout next year and because of the change in accounting rules for stock comp that automatically adds close to 0.5 million shares at the beginning of the year, which will be there for the whole year. Jeffrey Bernstein : Second point was just -- a question maybe more for Gene. Just looking back to the last quarter or two, you had mentioned when you think about the industry that you would characterize the consumer as stable. I was wondering, I think you guys said you really don't see much change in the promotional activity. I'm assuming that means you still think the consumer's stable. But the widening gap versus the industry I mean, wondering I think you've given some color as to how you think that's happening. But maybe if we could just talk about the buckets of the industry, I get the feeling bar and grill is sitting in the bottom quartile, and you guys need to be sitting at the top quartile. But just wondering what you think perhaps their biggest issue is that you guys are avoiding to just see that widening gap? I just can only imagine the width of the gap if you guys are as high as you are. Gene Lee : Jeff, the only thing I would say, I'm not going to comment on what I think our competitors are doing. I would say that we have some large competitors out there that are donating significant share. And we're stealing, I would say, we're stealing that share because I think that we've got a more compelling offer; Olive Garden is really after that value consumer; Longhorn is pivoted, I think appropriately and put a lot of the quality back into the product, and that seems to be resonating with their guests. And so I know it's not fancy or sexy, but it really comes down to just pure execution and those who continue to execute at highest level continue to win. And you got to have a promise that consumer wants. And I think that's where we really focused and we delivered against that. And I go back to -- I think our team members are more engaged than ever; I think our value is stronger than ever; and I think that our guest experiences continue to improve; and all our research tells us that. And so we just need to stay on our plan, which is to under price inflation, take cost out of the business to cover that, and win market share each and every year. And I think that's the plan we started off on three years ago and we've executed against that. Operator : Thank you. Next we have David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. David Palmer : Just building on Jeff's question a little bit about the grill and bar killer that could be Cheddar's, I mean, I'm wondering how you're thinking about things from a trade area perspective. And I'm wondering if you're sort of pivoting a little bit in terms of where you're growing. The specialty brands were lighter than your other brands in terms of comps, particularly Olive Garden, which has to go. The retail go dark risk seems to be intensifying, and mall traffic trends are already pretty bad. Cheddar's might be a way for you to grow away from those trade areas and then maybe benefit from some of the struggles that are going on in grill and bar. Is that a little bit of a pivot as to how you're going to grow, going forward, particularly at the Amazon risk is upon us? Gene Lee : Well, I think you've highlighted some strengths of the Cheddar's brand where it's not a brand that we put. Historically, they put in a tier 1 trade area sit in front of a mall, the use of always been a little bit off more in a second or third tier trade area in a city or town. They've been very good on what they\u2019re willing to pay for real-estate, and so I do think that this brand does view to a lower demographic. And therefore, you\u2019re not going to really find a lot of Cheddar's and LongHorn's in the same trade area. They might overlap with an Olive Garden, but we've got a different target with Cheddar's. And I think this gives us the opportunity to take advantage of real-estate that some of our other brands can't utilize today. And you\u2019re looking at a real-estate site, you\u2019re not deciding between Cheddar's and Yard House. Those are two totally different sites. And so I think you\u2019re right on. We can continue to use this brand differently than we've used our other brands. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Andy Barish of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. Andy Barish : Couple of quick margin questions, just on the labor line, overall. Do you still have enough productivity improvements to be able to offset that 3% to 4% inflation? And then just in terms of folding in Cheddar's for this year. Are there any particular line items that defer from Darden previous Cheddar's that we can give it call it out with the low check maybe impacting food cost or the significant amount of prep activity, fresh prep impacting labor cost. Just anything we should think about from a margin perspective at Cheddar's. Gene Lee : Andy, first question about labor and do we have enough cost saves or enough productivity enhancements, we still believe we have productivity enhancements to help keep our labor reasonably flat year-over-year as even with the pricing a little bit below inflation. But it's still pricing it will help us cover some of that labor. In regards to Cheddar's and their margin, I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail on the individual margin line items. But I will tell you, their EBITDA is about restaurant level of 17%, which is essentially the way we calculate segment profit. Yes, they have a little bit more production in their restaurants because they\u2019re a scratch kitchen, so you would expect labor would be a little higher than what our normal brands are. You would expect cost of sales to be little bit lower. But if you think about their overall margins at 17%, still strong in the industry, maybe not strong compared to Olive Garden, which is hard and top and they will be in our other segment. And so because of that and because of the competitive reasons, we don\u2019t want to get into too much more detail about the individual line items. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Ma'am, your line is open. Karen Holthouse : The comment earlier on the long-term framework intend of 40 basis points of EBIT expansion, and fiscal '18 still falling within that. Would that be -- is that on a standalone basis prior to any mix shifts you would want to think about for Cheddar's or at all in number, thinking about fiscal '17 to fiscal '18? Gene Lee : That is an all-in number, 10 basis points to 40 basis points includes bringing Cheddar's in and their actual decline in total margin across Darden. So without Cheddar\u2019s, the margin expansion would have been higher than what we\u2019re going to show. But we\u2019re still 10 to 40 basis points with Cheddar\u2019s added to the mix. Karen Holthouse : And is there any sort of ballpark way to think about synergies for what would hit at the store level versus G&A? I know its Yard House, at the time you talked about I think 60% of synergies at the store level. Is that the rate framework going forward, or is there a reason to think about that differently? Gene Lee : It's pretty close. It's just a 50-50, so probably 50% of them are going to hit at the restaurant level and 50% at the G&A level. Now, not all of the synergies are going to accrue to Cheddar\u2019s, there will be some of those synergies in the G&A. For example that will accrue to the rest of the brands as well but about 50% of our total synergies will be in G&A and about 50% restaurant level, which actually demonstrates the power of the Darden platform and how much we can go out and purchase at a lower rate than others. So Cheddar\u2019s actually had a really good supply chain team. They did great purchasing and we\u2019re still able to find significant synergies bringing them into our system. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Andrew Strelzik : Two questions for you. The first one the bump in the CapEx relative how you outlined it last quarter, seems like it's more than just the bump in the development phase; so wondering what else is in there, number one and number two, from a food cost perspective within that flat to plus one, how should we think about the cadence kind of story here. I noticed the mid single digit these decline that you got in there. So I am wondering how to think about the cadence of that throughout the year? Gene Lee : Andrew, in regards to the food cost cadence throughout the year and we talked about what our first half of the year is going to be. Our first half of the year slightly deflationary, very slightly, maybe flat and then the back half of the year is going to be somewhat inflationary. So it will just start to grow overtime. And as we said in the past, we tell you what we know and then when we don\u2019t know it we assume a normal inflationary period. So as we get farther in the year, we\u2019re going to assume more normal inflationary period. And I completely forgot your first question. Can you remind me? Andrew Strelzik : Sure. That was on the CapEx side. It seems like the increase in the dollars, how you outlined it last quarter\u2026 Gene Lee : The CapEx, the difference is basically Cheddar\u2019s. In the first guidance we gave, back in March, we didn\u2019t have Cheddar\u2019s in the guidance and now we\u2019re including Cheddar\u2019s. So when you add their restaurants and you add their maintenance CapEx, you\u2019re talking about $40 million to $50 million and that\u2019s really the difference. Operator : Thank you. Next is John Ivankoe of J. P. Morgan. Sir, your line is open. John Ivankoe : Just a couple of questions on the industry, if I may; firstly, have you seen any change or softness at any locations you have that are very specifically located with retail and maybe around some of the bigger retailers that have closed. Just wanted to get a sense how sensitive or insensitive those types of locations have been for your business? Gene Lee : John, I can't isolate Macy\u2019s or J. C. Penny closing, or Sears and having an impact on any of our businesses at this point in time. John Ivankoe : I mean, you certainly can\u2019t see it in the comp. And looking at supply and demand across the industry, where are we in terms of rate of change maybe as we\u2019ve been over the last six or 12 months? And do you see that being potentially changing the slate in the cycle? Gene Lee : I think demand for casuals is about the same. I mean we\u2019re growing a little faster than population growth, the last numbers I saw from Crest. Where we're seeing growth in more in the upscale; the cycle is getting a little lengthy here and everybody that's got a little bit of money wants to be in the Ssteakhouse of the upscale business. So we are seeing some local growth in upscale restaurants, but that has a way of washing itself out over time. John Ivankoe : And secondly, the industry does have easier comparison -- does have easy comparisons for a long time, but easier comparisons in the first half of your fiscal '18. I mean what type of industry assumptions are you making for your 1% to 2% comp in '18? Gene Lee : No change to the industry. We're assuming that it's basically been doing what it\u2019s been doing the last 12 months. John Ivankoe : So industry still remaining negative, and you still remaining positive? Gene Lee : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Steve Anderson of Maxim Group. Sir, your line is open. Steve Anderson : With regard to your continued -- rather the integration of the Cheddar's operation; do you contemplate that buying back any of the 25 franchise restaurants during that period, or is it something you might want to delay till after that 12 month activation period? And should we assume -- what assumptions should we make about those stores? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : We're in the middle of integration with Cheddar's. And actually we're really in the middle of two integrations, because Cheddar's bought their largest franchisee, Greer in January. So we're really doing two and we'd rather not have to do three. So we'll keep being a great franchisor to these franchisees and let us get through this integration before we start talking about what we do with the 25. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Jordy Winslow of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line's open. Jordy Winslow : Just had a couple of questions on Cheddar's; first, on the margin profile. Where do you see those store level margins potentially going over time? Is it possible in your mind that they could reach the level of Olive Garden potentially? And if not, are there any structural differences between the two brands that you see that would prevent that type of convergence? And then I have one follow up. Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes, I think the way to think about Cheddar's isn't the absolute margin for each restaurant. This is a total growth story. And to me it's about overtime -- we're just a brand in upward totals, total sales and total margins. And if our goal was just to try to maximize these restaurant margins, we'd never open another restaurant. And so we're too early in the game to determine what we think the long term target of these margins are. We know this is going to be a value player. We see this as a way to really put pressure on the industry and keep pricing down, and we will. In short term, if we have to, we'll sacrifice margin to do that, to grow this business. So give us a little bit more time to understand this business in more detail, understand as they plug into our platform what the real opportunities are and then we'll talk about what the margin potential is later. But you have to remember, if you\u2019re going to try to grow a brand and make it a mass brand, you got to have a legitimate restaurant level margin target for you to be able to keep the value equation where you want to keep it and continue to grow sales. And we look at Cheddar's and we look at the returns on new restaurants, even at the current margin level. And we're excited about that. We\u2019re excited about the value we\u2019ll create for our shareholders by building these restaurants, and trying to maximize the margins on the existing base. It\u2019s a onetime bump for that. Real shareholder value is going to come from us being able to grow this brand and get great returns on our invested capital. And we believe that's a huge opportunity for us with this brand. Jordy Winslow : And then more of a clarifying question on the openings. I thought that last call you had spoken about eight Cheddar's restaurants in the pipeline through fiscal year '18. Has something changed going from that to four to five, or is there any kind of timing difference going on with that? Jordy Winslow : Nothing has changed. It's really timing of fiscal year differences, and we\u2019ve talked about their pipeline. It was more in the calendar year basis, not necessarily fiscal year basis. And based on our fiscal years, it would equate to about four to five in fiscal '18 for us instead of eight which was kind of calendar \u201818. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Ray. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you all that we plan to release first quarter results on Tuesday, September 26th, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question and answer session of today\u2019s conference. To ask a question, you may press star, one on your phone and record your name at the prompt. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you, you may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Shawn. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO, and Rick Cardenas, CFO.  As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings on December 19 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business insights, Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the first quarter, and then Gene will have some closing remarks before we open the call for your questions. During today\u2019s call and for the remainder of this fiscal year, all references to Darden\u2019s same restaurant sales only include Darden\u2019s legacy brands since Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen Restaurants are new to Darden.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. As you\u2019ve seen from our press release, we\u2019re off to a solid start to our fiscal 2018. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.9 billion, an increase of 12.9%. Same restaurant sales grew 1.7% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.99, an increase of 12.5% from last year\u2019s diluted net earnings per share. I\u2019m pleased with our same restaurant sales growth of 1.7% considering the overall industry performance along with the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which Rick will quantify during his remarks.  Olive Garden\u2019s business remained strong. Same restaurant sales grew 1.9% and we were pleased with these results, particularly given a change to the marketing calendar which resulted in one less promotion in the quarter. These results outperformed the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 490 basis points. This was Olive Garden\u2019s 12th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. Olive Garden continues to maintain a significant gap to the industry as we drive frequency among our most loyal guests. Our core menu and promotional strategy are successfully working together to create value, and our restaurant operators\u2019 focus on flawless execution of the basics continues to drive all-time high guest satisfaction scores. Convenience remains a focus area. We\u2019re making meaningful progress, improving our to-go processes to handle increased volume, enhancing IT support, and redesigning our to-go stations to improve the guest experience. Overall, to-go sales increased 12% in the quarter. In addition, we ran our Buy One Take One promotion during the quarter, which guests view as the ultimate convenience.  Longhorn Steakhouse had a solid quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 2.6%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 560 points. This was Longhorn\u2019s 18th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. The investments we have been making in our food and service over the last two years are contributing to industry-leading guest satisfaction scores, which is driving our outperformance. Additionally, we are seeing strong same restaurant sales growth in our newer markets as guests discover Longhorn\u2019s value proposition. This upward sales trend in newer markets is consistent with past performance of the brand. The Longhorn team is relentlessly focused on enhancing the guest experience. We will continue to invest in food quality, look for additional ways to simplify operations, and leverage Longhorn\u2019s unique culture to enable strong sales growth. Turning to Cheddar\u2019s, we continue to make good progress on the integration. The planning process is behind us and we are now focused on execution. We are making significant non guest-facing changes over the next year which we know will have an impact on our restaurant teams. It will take time for the restaurant managers and team members to familiarize themselves with our systems and processes. I\u2019m confident they will master these new tools, which will help improve performance over time. Same restaurant sales for the quarter outperformed the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, but declined 1.4%. Cheddar\u2019s is heavily penetrated in Texas, and they were impacted more by Hurricane Harvey than Darden overall. Also, during the quarter we exercised our right of first refusal to acquire the 11 restaurants owned by the Cheddar\u2019s franchisee in Georgia as well as the development rights they held for Cheddar\u2019s in Georgia and Alabama. This transaction, which closed on August 28, gives us the opportunity to enhance our presence in two states that we believe will have strong growth opportunities for the Cheddar\u2019s brand. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning everyone. Total sales grew 12.9% this quarter driven by 11.2% growth from the addition of 141 Cheddar\u2019s and other new restaurants and same restaurant sales growth of 1.7%. First quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.99, an increase of 12.5% from last year\u2019s earnings per share. We also returned approximately $180 million of capital to our shareholders with $100 million in share repurchases and approximately $80 million in dividends.  Looking at our results in the first quarter, it\u2019s important to note that Hurricane Harvey made landfall on the last weekend of our quarter. The day before Harvey made landfall in Texas, same restaurant sales quarter-to-date were running plus 2%, 30 basis points higher than where we ended the quarter. This sales impact along with other Harvey-related costs negatively affected first quarter EPS by approximately $0.015.  Now turning to the P&L, let me comment on profit margins before delving deeper into each line item. Restaurant level EBITDA margin was equal to last year\u2019s results. Adjusted EBIT margin was 10 basis points lower, driven by asset sale gains last year of $8 million, which we categorize in the impairments of disposal of assets line, and the addition of Cheddar\u2019s, which I will refer to as brand mix, impacted EBIT margin unfavorably by approximately 40 basis points in the first quarter versus last year. Over time, we expect this brand mix impact to be closer to 20 basis points as we move past integration and fully capture synergies. As a reminder, we expect to have between $22 million and $27 million of run rate synergies and expect to achieve this run rate by the end of fiscal 2019. Excluding the headwinds from last year\u2019s gain on asset sales and the brand mix impact of Cheddar\u2019s, EBIT margins expanded approximately 70 basis points in the quarter.  Now on to the expense detail, food and beverage costs were favorable by 10 basis points as pricing of approximately 1.5% and cost savings more than offset commodity cost inflation. Restaurant labor was unfavorable by 40 basis points compared to last year due to brand mix and wage inflation that was at the high end of our expected range of 3% to 4%. Restaurant expenses as a percent of sales were equal to last year despite a headwind of 10 basis points in pre-opening expenses. Marketing expenses were favorable by 30 basis points due to brand mix and the promotional shift at Olive Garden that Gene mentioned. Finally, G&A was favorable by 40 basis points due to quarterly timing and sales leverage. Sales increased in every segment, driven by same restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden, Longhorn, and the fine dining segment, and by the addition of Cheddar\u2019s to the other business segment. This sales growth drove strong segment profit margins particularly at Olive Garden, where segment profit margin was 20.1%, 70 basis points higher than last year. However, our other business segment profit margin was 200 basis points lower than last year due to two things : the addition of Cheddar\u2019s to the segment, which altered segment profit margin mix, and moving consumer packaged goods out of the Other segment beginning this fiscal year, which reduced this segment\u2019s margin by roughly 100 basis points. The primary beneficiary of this shift was Olive Garden with a 20 basis point improvement in their margins. This morning, we also reaffirmed our full-year fiscal 2018 outlook. This outlook includes the expected impact of Hurricane Irma, which was in our second quarter. We anticipate the impact of Hurricane Irma to be approximately double the first quarter impact of Hurricane Harvey in terms of both same restaurant sales and profit impacts. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.38 to $4.50, total sales growth of 11.5% to 13% including sales from all Cheddar\u2019s restaurants and same restaurant sales growth of between 1% and 2% for the full fiscal year. Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks. Gene Lee : Thanks Rick. I want to take a moment to thank the teams in both our restaurants and our restaurant support center that have worked tirelessly over the past month dealing with Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana and Hurricane Irma in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. Both storms had a devastating impact on numerous communities that are home to our guests, team members and restaurants. In the field, our restaurant teams did a tremendous job of getting our restaurants that had to close back open again, and our teams here at the support center provided outstanding support before, during and after the storm hit. This ensured we were prepared to deal with the impact operationally while helping our team members in need and the communities we serve.  Additionally, our thoughts go out to the citizens of Puerto Rico and Mexico City, as well as our franchise partners in these communities, who are still dealing with the impacts of Hurricane Maria and the earthquake that took place last week. I am very proud of the response from everyone across Darden. Moments like these, as difficult as they are, highlight the strength of our culture and what makes our people, our restaurants and our brand so special. With that, we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Brett, your line is now open. Brett Levy : Good morning. Would you be able to share a little bit more detail on what you\u2019re seeing across the competitive landscape, whether it be from direct casual diners, QSR, people who are getting more into the delivery world as well as just at-home players? Do you have any thoughts on why Olive Garden put up an astonishingly good number still, if not quite up the market share gains you\u2019ve seen in recent quarters? Do you think that\u2019s the result of promotional cadence? Just lastly, what are your thoughts on pricing for the rest of the year? Thank you. Gene Lee : Okay, good morning, Brett. There\u2019s seven questions, I think, in there, but great way to frame that up as one question. Let me start with Olive Garden, because I think that\u2019s where everybody wants me to start, then I\u2019ll make some comments on the overall environment. I\u2019m super excited about the quarter we put up in Olive Garden. I think the focus ought to be on the improvement in margins. I thought we had sales growth. We ran one less promotion during the quarter, which in our effort to simplify our operations we thought was a really smart move. It eliminates one all-team meeting, it eliminated bringing in extra product. We\u2019re lengthening the time we run our promotions. We\u2019re trying to re-energize them during the middle of the promotion. I thought it was incredibly effective. We had a lot less targeted digital incentives in the marketplace. We made a major change to our strongest traffic driver, which is soup, salad, and breadsticks at $5.99, and we moved that to $6.99 which drove less traffic, however was significantly more profitable. So I think everybody needs to focus on the 7% growth in operating income in Olive Garden at a segment profit level, just absolutely impressive when you think about the size of this system and the performance of the overall category. The other thing I\u2019d add on the Olive Garden is the traffic gap was greater than the sales gap as we continued to under-price inflation and we think we\u2019re under-pricing our competitors to improve value. Lastly on Olive Garden, I would just say that the team is doing an incredible job. They\u2019re just running better restaurants today - our throughput is up, our satisfaction is up, our engagement with team members is up. So when I put this quarter in perspective for Olive Garden, it was short of a target that the analyst community put out there, but we didn\u2019t put that sales target out there, and if you take the last three days out of the quarter, we would have been at 2%, so I\u2019m thrilled. As far as the overall environment goes, it was a choppy quarter. We had a lot of activity around storms, we had a holiday switch with the Fourth of July - just a lot of noise in the quarter. I would say the environment feels fairly good. The consumer is there with the right offer. Value has never been more important and value, depending on where you play and where your price point is, can be derived through different things. I think at Longhorn, we\u2019re deriving value with increasing the quality and improving our service; Olive Garden, we\u2019re playing a little bit more around with price to get that value across, so I think people are offering strong value consistently and provide it every day. I go back to looking at our Olive Garden menu at lunch - all the price points are $6.99, $7.99, $8.99, $9.99, and I believe that we\u2019ve got great value out there with an abundance in portion. As far as pricing, Rick, I think that you can answer the pricing question. Rick Cardenas : Yes, and let me clarify one other point. Gene mentioned Olive Garden would have been at 2%. Actually, Olive Garden would have been at 2.2% without the hurricane, so strong first quarter for Olive Garden. In terms of pricing, we had 1.5% pricing this quarter, and as we\u2019ve said before, we want to continue to maintain our value leadership position and price, and using our scale and our advantages to be able to price below our competitors and price below inflation when appropriate. This year, we expect to price between 1% and 2%, and we\u2019re solid in the middle of that right now. Brett Levy : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is now open. Brian Bittner : Thanks, good morning guys. One for Gene, one for Rick. Gene, you\u2019ve started to talk a lot more about Darden in general as a platform company that has the strength to make more accretive acquisitions to create shareholder value going forward. Our math suggests by the end of this fiscal year \u201918, you would easily have the capital ability to acquire something over a billion dollars if you so wanted. I know you\u2019re really laser focused on integrating cheddar\u2019s, but how do you think about this strategy going forward and potential timing of doing something else? Gene Lee : Brian, I think about it very sequentially, and right now you\u2019re right- we are laser focused on integrating Cheddar\u2019s. We think Cheddar\u2019s is an incredible opportunity for long-term growth, and so we are not even contemplating or thinking about doing anything else until that brand is fully integrated, it is firing and has really a good growth platform where it\u2019s contributing at a much higher growth rate than Olive Garden and to add to our overall growth rate, so that\u2019s the focus. Once we have visibility that that has been done successfully, then we\u2019ll look at the platform and determine what our next move is. Brian Bittner : Okay, and just for Rick, following up on that pricing question, you have said you were going to price closer to the 1% range. You were at 1.5% this quarter. Should we expect that to fall down towards the 1% range, and you held restaurant margins flat this quarter, would that make that more challenging? And if you have any initial thoughts on Hurricane Irma, that would be helpful as well. Rick Cardenas : Yes Brian, the 1.5% we did say we\u2019d be at the lower end of the 1% to 2%, so 1.5% is kind of at the high end of the low end. We still think somewhere in the 1.5-ish range is where we\u2019ll end up for the year, but between 1 to 2%. It all depends on what we see in commodities and other things, but we also took most of our pricing already, so unless we take other pricing actions, we should be done with our pricing for the year. In terms of Irma, as I mentioned on the remarks, we expect the impact of Hurricane Irma to be double the impact of Hurricane Harvey; and remember, Hurricane Harvey was about 30 basis points in comps and $0.015 in EPS, so think six points in comps and $0.03 in EPS. I\u2019d like to remind everybody that we kept our earnings guidance right where we said at the beginning of the year, so we\u2019ve really kind of eaten $0.045 in this guidance. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is coming from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Will, your line is now open. Will Slabaugh : Yes, thanks guys. I had a question on the Olive Garden to-go business. That\u2019s been growing at a pretty rapid clip for a while now. Can you talk about where you are in that growth evolution, if you will, and if you think these consistent improvements that you\u2019re making--you know, you mentioned a few including packaging, etc. earlier, that you\u2019re making can keep that business growing at a double-digit rate in the future. Gene Lee : Yes, you know, we saw a good 12% growth in the quarter on a four-year run rate of approximately 70%. We are starting to really think about this as a separate kind of business. Dave and the team are making some great changes. We think technology can continue to help. We know in our higher volume restaurants that we need to build more space to handle the volume, and we\u2019ve done a few of those remodels with a lot of success. As long as the consumer demand is there for this product, I think we can grow it, continue to grow it close to double digits. Now, when the percentages are--it\u2019s getting harder to grow at double digits because the denominator is much higher than what it was when we first started, but I still think this is a growth driver for us. The consumer satisfaction of our to-go product is extremely high, and that\u2019s one thing that our team is really, really focused on, is how do we make the experience better for the consumer, and the repeat business and the loyalty inside a to-go is also very high. Will Slabaugh : Got it. If I could just follow up to that, can you talk about the learnings that you\u2019ve gotten from Olive Garden with that to-go business, realizing that Italian simply just carries better than most other forms of food, but is there any learnings you can take and translate into other businesses and if there is a big growth opportunity you see in to-go in any other concepts that you have? Gene Lee : Yes, I think to-go is growing organically in the other businesses because the consumer wants it. However, the big opportunity for to-go in Olive Garden is the bulk meals and being able to do a tray of lasagna or a pan of fettuccine Alfredo. We just don\u2019t have that. We have a little bit of that in Bahama Breeze - we\u2019ve got some products that we do some large party stuff on, but we really think about the other mass brand, Olive Garden. It\u2019s really growing with the consumer demand and it\u2019s a nice piece of business, but it will never have the same opportunity as Olive Garden does because of the bulk size and really the business piece. Will Slabaugh : Got it, thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Tarantino from Baird. David, your line is now open. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Gene, I wanted to ask you to clarify your comments on the Cheddar\u2019s integration. It sounds like--I think you mentioned that it\u2019s going to take some time for the team to familiarize themselves with your systems and processes, so could you maybe give us an update on how you think that\u2019s going so far and whether that comment was meant to imply that this is maybe proving a little more difficult than you thought originally? Gene Lee : No, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not proving more difficult. We knew that this--we knew that this had been under-invested in and that the systems were lacking, that there wasn\u2019t much to work with, and so in our past acquisitions we\u2019ve had to change systems, here we\u2019re implementing systems that never were there, which makes it a little bit different. But when you think about the magnitude of this and none of the integration has really started - it\u2019s starting in the next couple weeks for the most part, all-new distribution, food, small wares. We\u2019ve got a new HR system that\u2019s going in the first of the year, we\u2019ve got an all-new POS that\u2019s starting to go in. Every back office system is going to be new. These restaurants don\u2019t have KDS. Seventy percent of the restaurants still have a ticket, just one ticket coming into the kitchen, they don\u2019t even have remote printers. I haven\u2019t worked in an environment where we haven\u2019t had remote printers since the 1980s, so there\u2019s a lot of work to be done here. We\u2019ve got great management out there, it\u2019s just a lot for them to take in, and we know through our past history with integrations that these become distractions and you\u2019re not as focused on the basics of the business. So I\u2019m pleased with where we\u2019re at, there\u2019s just a lot of work to do. David Tarantino : Got it. Does your guidance for the year assume that you don\u2019t make progress on improving comps from where they are, or maybe even take a step backwards? How are you thinking about the business performance as you make this transition? Gene Lee : Yes, our guidance anticipates the performance the way they\u2019re performing right now and the synergies we\u2019ve already talked about.  David, one other thing and for everybody on Cheddar\u2019s is that we are doing multiple integrations. As you remember, they purchased their largest franchisee prior to us purchasing them, which is making that part of it more complicated. We are also in Cheddar\u2019s starting to run negative check average as we standardize the menus across the system, and we believe this is--this was not something in our calculus, but we think this is the right thing to do for the business, is to standardize all these menus and processes and procedures. The largest franchisee that we acquired, what we refer to as the Grier restaurants, are running negative check because of this standardization. David Tarantino : Great, that\u2019s helpful. If I could squeeze one more in, did you quantify the impact of having one less promotion at Olive Garden this quarter on the comps? Gene Lee : No. We actually--we don\u2019t think that that had a major impact on it. We do think the lack of TDIs may have had an impact on the top line, but it significantly helped the bottom line. David Tarantino : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is coming from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is now open. Karen Holthouse : Hi. Another one on Olive Garden. The dynamic that we did see this quarter with less promotion, less marketing expense but beneficial to profits, maybe a little bit of a traffic headwind from the change in soup, salad and bread stick pricing, is that how to think about things going forward, or when do you think you get to a little bit more of a normal run rate of the level of promotion that you want to be at? Gene Lee : I think that\u2019s dynamic. I think that we look at having a toolkit of levers that we can pull, depending on what\u2019s happening in the external environment and maybe good our top line promotional activity is. Just a reminder to everybody, we\u2019re out there with three levels of media - we\u2019ve got a promotional media message, we have a secondary message out there, and then we have a lunch or a catering business, the business-type message out there. We continue to transition to more online video as we learn more about that and we become more effective, and so we\u2019re going to continue to play with the media mix to try to optimize traffic and profitability, but it is dependent on what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. That\u2019s what we really love about the Olive Garden business, is that we have a lot of levers to pull.  As we think about going forward, everything is factored into our guidance. Karen Holthouse : Then one quick one on the commodity outlook. Beef inflation or beef deflation went from mid single digits to low single digits for the year. As we\u2019re thinking about the cadence of that through the year, does that actually imply getting back to inflation by the end of the year? Gene Lee : On the beef front, no, not necessarily. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, we still expect commodity inflation to be between flat and 1%, and based on where we are today, we still think that number makes sense. Karen Holthouse : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John, your line is now open. Chris: It\u2019s actually Chris on for John, so thanks for the color so far. Wanted to ask a little bit more about the full-year guide. So quantifying the impact from both of the hurricanes, it\u2019s about $0.045, but I just wanted to ask if there were an potential offsets or strengthening of the business that you\u2019ve been seeing recently to help offset that impact (indiscernible) reaffirm today. Gene Lee : Yes, that\u2019s all included in the guidance. We\u2019ve taken in what\u2019s happened in the last couple weeks and included that in the guidance going forward. Chris: But just in terms of your confidence in the guide to help offset that $0.045? Gene Lee : You know, as we think about what we guided, we feel really confident in the 438 to 450 that we mentioned. As we see more of what\u2019s been going on with the hurricanes and the impact that we said the hurricanes have, including cost saves that we\u2019re doing for the year, we feel really good about the 438 to 450. Chris: Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is coming from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, the line is now open. Stephanie Ng : Good morning, this is actually Stephanie Ng, representing Sara. I had a follow-up on to-go but more on the promotions side. Part of that growth seems driven by ongoing promotions, so your Buy One Take One Home and the discounts, which makes sense if you\u2019re attempting to drive traffic to a new channel. But at what point do you pull back on the promos or discounts, and the specifically for to-go, how do you think about incrementality versus just incentivizing customers to shift from off-premise to on-premise? Gene Lee : Yes, first clarification - Buy One Take One does not get into the to-go numbers at all. That\u2019s an in-restaurant promotion, although it\u2019s the ultimate convenience because the consumer gets to take a to-go meal home with that, but that\u2019s all logged in restaurant. Part of what we\u2019re doing from an incentive standpoint on the to-go is we think it\u2019s an area we need to remind the consumer we do that in a cost effective way, and it\u2019s incredibly valuable for us to be able to engage a new consumer because through to-go, we pick up a tremendous amount of personal information that helps us market more effectively to that person, so we\u2019ll continue to use promotional activity, and we feel the margin structure is fairly strong because especially we get them to engage online. We think that this is somewhat incremental. These are different visits. These takeout visits are different. I don\u2019t think people sit home and decide whether they\u2019re going to eat in restaurant or they\u2019re going to eat takeout - they\u2019ve decided they want to have a takeout experience and therefore they\u2019re using Olive Garden for that, so again we go back to what we\u2019re trying to do in Olive Garden. We\u2019re trying to feed our most loyal guests where and when they want Olive Garden food. Stephanie Ng : Okay, thank you. Then a quick question on Longhorn. So we tracked Longhorn promotions over the quarter and we observed the introduction of value offerings - think of the $10 burger and drink combo. What was the reasoning behind introducing this product and this price point, and then how does it fit into Longhorn\u2019s broader strategy? Gene Lee : Well, I think when we looked at it, it was just a cross promotion with Coca Cola. Every year, we have so marketing dollars to use with Coca Cola, and it was a way for us to do a cross promotion with them that I thought was a value add without having to use dollar discounts. Longhorn\u2019s overall TDIs for the quarter were down, their incentives were down, so I feel good about--you know.  I do think just in fairness to the way you guys are counting how we do the TDIs, you\u2019ve got to be careful because a lot of those TDIs are exploding offers that are very short in nature and we\u2019re trying to stimulate traffic. I think on Longhorn, the burger and a Coke one, I thought that was a great offer. We have to figure a way to market lunch as effectively as we can because we know the big negative trade down if we trade a dinner into lunch from the margin standpoint really hurts us, so we\u2019ve got to come up with creative ways to keep lunch fresh. At Longhorn, I thought that was actually the best lunch promotion they ran all quarter. Stephanie Ng : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Matt, your line is now open. Matt Kirschner : It\u2019s actually Matt Kirschner on for Matt DiFrisco. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the two Cheddar\u2019s acquisitions, and what is your long-term philosophy on franchisees going forward? Gene Lee : Both the Cheddar\u2019s acquisitions, the one done before we purchased Cheddar\u2019s corporate and the one that we did at the end of the quarter, were rights of first refusal. We\u2019re not actively in the marketplace trying to repurchase our franchisees. We want to be a great franchisor. We want to make our franchisees as successful as they possibly can; however, when the opportunity arose to buy especially the CMP franchise, we wanted that territory back, we wanted to control that territory - it\u2019s one that we knew, and we were able to buy that on very, very good terms. Matt Kirschner : What do you kind of expect as far as the impact of buying back some of these larger franchisees going forward? Gene Lee : Well first of all, the impact of buying CMP is pretty immaterial for this fiscal year, and after that there\u2019s, I think, only 14 restaurants that are franchised, so there aren\u2019t many big franchisees left, and all of those impacts would be contemplated in the guidance that we gave. Matt Kirschner : Understood, thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open. Jason West : Yes, thanks. Just a quick one and a follow up. Can you guys give the mix on to-go sales in the quarter? And then big picture, as we\u2019ve seen the industry numbers be so weak here this last few months, even outside of the hurricanes, just love to get your thoughts on why you think the industry traffic is so weak as we\u2019re lapping some pretty weak numbers from last year, and the decision to pull back on that value promotion at lunch in this environment. Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes Jason, I think I missed your first question - oh, the to-go mix? Jason West : To-go - yes. Gene Lee : We\u2019re not breaking that out at this point in time. We\u2019re giving you the overall percentage growth, but we\u2019re not getting into what\u2019s coming from catering and what\u2019s coming from third party, so on and so forth.  As far as the overall environment, I continue to look at the stronger players that I think are well positioned, who have good value equations. They continue to take market share. I think I said in the last call that if you took out the bottom 25% of the indexes, the players that are pretty weak, you have flat to slightly--a little bit of growth in those benchmarks, but at the end of the day it keeps coming back to there\u2019s a lot of competition for the discretionary dollar, and we\u2019ve got to fight not just amongst ourselves to provide value to the guests but we\u2019ve got to provide value against other options for them to spend their discretionary income. I think it\u2019s a total focus on value, and I think that gets back into our strategy, which is to use our scale and our platform to our advantage, under-price inflation and under-price our competitors, and operate better to create a better value equation for our guests, and I think that\u2019s what we continue to do. I expect the environment to pretty much stay the same in the foreseeable future. Jason West : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question is coming from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. John, your line is now open. John Ivankoe : Hi, great. The question is on delivery, not the $100-plus catering delivery but other options that you have to maybe do smaller meals or individual. What are you currently seeing in your current tests? Is this something that you want to do nationally? Do you feel that you have an economic model design that can be profit additive to you as the incremental units offset presumably what may be a lower margin on sales? Just whatever commentary that we can have. Gene Lee : John, we\u2019re in test with multiple vendors to see how this is going to play out. It\u2019s in the early stages. We\u2019re trying to learn, we\u2019re trying to understand what the check average is. We\u2019re trying to understand how good these third parties can execute, because that\u2019s a big part. The consumer\u2019s perception is always going to be the supplier, not the person that\u2019s in the middle delivering the product that\u2019s going to get blamed for good product, cold product, product that\u2019s been shaken or whatever, so we\u2019re going slow with this. We\u2019re analyzing it. It\u2019s a unique opportunity. Let\u2019s see whether this is a phase or a fad, and we\u2019re positioned to continue to analyze it. I mean, one of the options is doing it ourselves. We\u2019re not sure we want to go there, but we\u2019ll continue to figure this out. There\u2019s too many players in this space right now for it to work. There\u2019s not enough profit for the third party people to survive, and so we\u2019ve just got to let this whole thing play out, and right now I think our focus is on a bigger pie, which is B2B and B2C at over $100. John Ivankoe : And that to some extent was my question as well - is there any thought internally about maybe broadening some of the constraints that you\u2019re currently asking the consumer in terms of ordering delivery? I think it\u2019s $100-plus and 24 hours. I mean, is there a thought of just giving them more options to where it still can be profitable for you to deliver it yourself? Gene Lee : Yes, we have a test going on right now with that, to see how that works and for us to really analyze to make sure that there\u2019s enough profit for the effort and understanding the risk. I mean, you have to remember for Olive Garden, the majority of our restaurants are in suburban neighborhoods where there\u2019s not a lot of desire for this. This is an urban concept - it\u2019s not New York or Boston or whatever. In Omaha, there\u2019s no desire for this on a large scale. I mean, you\u2019re not driving into suburbia. In some of these places, not even Uber\u2019s cars drive around, so let\u2019s--we want to go slow and we want to be thoughtful about this. John Ivankoe : Understood, thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Steve Anderson from Maxim Group. Steve, your line is now open. Steve Anderson : Yes, thank you, and thank you for providing some of the commentary on your impacts from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma (indiscernible) regarding the victims. Wanted to go a little more deeply into Harvey, given that the extent of the closures related to flooding likely extended into the first week of your fiscal second quarter. Do you anticipate any impact on your second quarter EPS from that? Gene Lee : Yes Stephen, you\u2019re right - pretty astute. We did have more closed days in the second quarter for Harvey than in the first quarter, but that we have contemplated in the double the impact of Harvey, so the Irma plus any impact of Harvey in the second quarter, including any pent-up demand that happens in Houston and other areas is all contemplated in our double the impact of Harvey in Q2. Steve Anderson : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Andrew, your line is now open. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning. So my question is actually on development. You mentioned Longhorn performance in new markets, very happy with that, and I know if you look at the long-term targets, obviously it does imply an acceleration from a development perspective, so I guess I\u2019m just wondering what are the vehicles that you really see in terms of the brands to getting to that? When do we really start to see it play out in the numbers here, getting towards those long-term targets? Gene Lee : Yes, we\u2019ve been at the lower end of the long term target for growth, and I think as we build up the pipeline for new restaurants, hopefully we can slide that upward. We\u2019re very pleased with our new restaurant growth right now. We\u2019ve opened some very strong Yardhouses, Olive Garden and Longhorn. Let me just clarify my comment on Longhorn and newer markets. When I\u2019m referring to these newer markets, really non-legacy markets, we\u2019ve been in these markets for three or four years. Historically, it\u2019s taken time for Longhorn to really develop a following and for people to really get the value equation, and we\u2019re really starting to see that as we continue to grow, so that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the same restaurant sales growth. When you look at the Longhorn footprint, there\u2019s not much room - these are small, small buildings, so 6,000 square feet, some of them are closer to 5,000, and you get great average unit volumes out of Florida and Atlanta. You don\u2019t have a lot of growth, so if you\u2019re going to get same restaurant sales growth, they\u2019ve got to come from some of these newer markets that opened a little bit slower. One other thing on the long term framework. When we talk about our 2% to 3% over a longer period of time, we are considering acquisitions in that, and so adding our new Cheddar\u2019s restaurants to that has a big push in this fiscal year, but think about what the impact is of that over a five-year horizon. Andrew Strelzik : Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Then if I could just add one on the margin side, labor dollars per store stepped up year-over-year more than they have in the last couple quarters. Is that entirely related to Cheddar\u2019s or is there anything else in there, and also could you quantify for Olive Garden margins what the CPG shift, what that impact is? Thank you very much. Gene Lee : Sure. On the labor dollars per restaurant, yes, a big impact of that is Cheddar\u2019s. If you think about their AUVs or average AUVs for Darden, that $4.5 million with higher labor as a percent of sales, and we did have some labor inflation, so that did drive labor costs on a per-restaurant basis up a little bit, but it was probably 50/50. In regards to the impact to Olive Garden or the CPG shift, it was 20 basis points to Olive Garden, 20 basis point improvement in margin to Olive Garden. We\u2019re talking about less than a couple million dollars, maybe, in a quarter on CPG sales. Andrew Strelzik : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is coming from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Joshua, your line is now open. Joshua Long : Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on your commentary on the newer markets for Longhorn. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re happy with that progress or if the comment was meant to say that there might be something you could do to help spur additional consumer awareness, or if really just, as you mentioned, Gene, kind of fleshing out how the newer markets are performing. Just curious if that\u2019s something that could be pressed a little further or if it\u2019s really going at the right pace right now. Gene Lee : No, I think it\u2019s going at the right pace. I\u2019m thrilled with some of these markets. When you\u2019re busting in as a third or fourth steakhouse in a trade area, people have to have a reason to try you, and you have to work the Longhorn menu a little bit to really understand the value. We tried to move that along through different processes, different marketing campaigns, but history tells us it\u2019s just time. Over time, Longhorn has a pretty good growth spurt, and many of these markets--you know, we don\u2019t have a lot of penetration. There\u2019s no TV in those markets. It\u2019s just something that\u2019s been organic for the brand for the last 20 years, and I\u2019m thrilled with it because I know there\u2019s great value in Longhorn. Joshua Long : Thank you for that, that makes sense. Then I wanted to see if you also might be able to update us on where we\u2019re at with the remodel-refresh effort and how that\u2019s progressing. Gene Lee : Yes, we\u2019re making great progress. We\u2019ve got 116 done to date - 23 were completed in the first quarter. We expect to do almost another 100 in fiscal \u201918. I do think that number, we didn\u2019t look at that number after the two storms. You can only imagine that there is some labor shortage out there from that skill set, so we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to be impacted, but we\u2019ve got plans to do a lot more in the back half of the year. Joshua Long : Great, thanks for the time today. Operator : Our next question is coming from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Gregory, your line is now open. Gregory Francfort : I had two questions. The first one is just on the labor cost. One of your major competitors is testing shifting their model to where they\u2019re adding runners in the restaurant to potentially reduce hours. Is there something that you can test along those lines? Is that something you\u2019ve explored, and maybe how are you thinking about the current labor model? Gene Lee : For the past 20 years, we\u2019ve looked at different ways to run our dining rooms. Some of our businesses use runners; some of our businesses don\u2019t use runners. At the end of the day, trying to cut back labor that is dedicated to taking care of your guests is not a smart move, and we will continue to improve and try to enhance the service that we\u2019re providing our guests. So we believe in three-table stations, when we\u2019re really busy we have runners behind them, but we are focused on trying to improve the service, and we talk a lot about it at Darden, we want to put the full back into full service. Gregory Francfort : That makes a ton of sense. The other question was on Cheddar\u2019s. How meaningful is the switch of the distribution business from an external party onto the Darden platform, and can you help us understand the timing of that and maybe what goes into those changes? Gene Lee : Yes, it\u2019s a big part of the synergies that we\u2019ve given you. It\u2019s probably half of it just getting on our platform, so the timing, I think it starts next week or the week after. Hopefully it\u2019s going to be seamless. They have to order differently than what they have in the past, with a little bit more of an electronic ordering process. They probably might have to think out a day further ahead than they had in the past, so there is some operational complexity there, but this is a big part of putting anybody on our platform. We work extremely hard to ensure that our supply chain is efficient as it possibly can be, and this is a big part of us getting our synergies. Gregory Francfort : Got it. That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jake Bartlett from SunTrust. Jake, your line is now open. Jake Bartlett : Great, thanks for taking the questions. First, I had a question about the inflationary environment. You mentioned that you\u2019re in the high end of the labor inflation guidance in the first quarter, you expect that to continue throughout the year. I might have missed it, but if you could tell us what the commodity inflation was in the first quarter? Gene Lee : Yes, we didn\u2019t specifically point out what the commodity inflation was in the first quarter. We did say that for the year, it\u2019s zero to 1%, and the commodity inflation in the first quarter was within that range, so it was inflationary where in the past we were deflationary. Jake Bartlett : Okay, and then on wage inflation? Gene Lee : Wage inflation, we said it was at the high end of our 3% to 4%, so assume around 4%. Jake Bartlett : Okay. Is the environment such that you think that\u2019s going to continue? Are you still seeing the kind of wage inflation that we-- Gene Lee : You know, we\u2019ve been seeing this wage inflation roughly around the 3% to 4% range for a while, and we don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that says that is going to come down. That said, we have the industry leading turnover, so we\u2019re able to offset some of the wage inflation by spending our time training our folks to get better and to be more effective and more efficient than maybe training somebody to learn our systems, so we think that helps our productivity in the long run. Jake Bartlett : Okay. I had a question about the promotional environment and how you play into it. It looks like for the past couple years, your market share gains have accelerated as the environment became much more promotional or more value oriented. I don\u2019t think this is your view, but if the environment got less value oriented, how do you think you\u2019d fare? Would that imply some market share narrowing of that gap, or do you think you can kind of maintain your outperformance even if the promotional environment was less value oriented? Gene Lee : You know, I think we have levers to pull and are nimble enough to compete effectively in any type of environment. If the environment was a little bit better, maybe we\u2019d take a little more price. I think that we\u2019ll continue to compete effectively. The loyalty between both Longhorn and Olive Garden with our guests, and especially Olive Garden, what Olive Garden means to the American cultural fabric is just incredible. I mean, we just did the pasta fast promotion - the amount of participation in that, the amount of comments that were posted, the amount of press coverage, Olive Garden is an important brand in American society, and I think it\u2019s going to compete effectively now and for a long period of time. Jake Bartlett : Great, thanks for that. Operator : Our next question is coming from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Peter, your line is now open. Peter Saleh : Great, thanks for taking the question. I believe last quarter you had mentioned the guest satisfaction scores at Olive Garden were at an all-time high. Can you give us an update on where the guest satisfaction scores are today and maybe where your value scores are in relation to last quarter? Gene Lee : Yes, overall quarter to quarter we were flat; however, service did tick up. I think about the drivers of that, we\u2019ve got to continue to simplify the operation. These are very high volume, complex restaurants, and the more simplicity that the team can bring to it, and you think about just doing one less promotion inside that last quarter, that improved our--you know, that simplified things for the restaurant managers dramatically by not having to do one more rollout. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on, is the simplicity of it, and hopefully that will continue to lead to better execution. Was there a second question there, Peter, I missed? Peter Saleh : No, I was just curious as to the value scores this quarter versus last. Gene Lee : Yes, value scores have ticked up just a little bit. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s significant, but they are already fairly high. When you do come off your TDIs a little bit, your value is going to take a little bit of a hit too, but I look at--you know, you can\u2019t look at one metric. You have to look at all the metrics together to inform you to make good decisions. If you\u2019re just trying to get one metric, I hate to use a sports analogy, but it doesn\u2019t matter how many first downs you get in a football game. You\u2019ve got to put the most points up on the board, so we\u2019ve got a lot of data coming in. We think we\u2019ve got a competitive advantage here. We look at all that data and that helps inform us to make decisions that we think are good for the long term for that specific business, not what\u2019s good for the first quarter or for the quarter that we\u2019re in, what\u2019s good for the long term. Peter Saleh : Got it, great. Thank you very much, I appreciate that. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is now open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great, thank you very much. Two questions - one, just when you think about the cost savings or productivity enhancements, I\u2019m just wondering what are the dollars assumed within the fiscal \u201918 guidance? It sounds like you\u2019re reiterating the 10 to 40 basis points of EBIT margin expansion, but I\u2019m just wondering what the dollar expectation is and where we are on that ultimate opportunity from a cost savings perspective. Rick Cardenas : Yes Jeff, it\u2019s Rick. We stopped talking about what the dollar impact was probably about six months ago as we wanted to make sure that we talked long term about our margin enhancements of 10 to 40 basis points coming from cost saves. The reason we\u2019re not talking about all the dollars is because we may reinvest some of that, right, so as we think about what our cost saves are, and whenever we tell you a number, we want to tell you what the net P&L impact of that was, and so the zero to 1% inflation may actually end up being less than that if we have cost saves, and we\u2019ll talk about that at the end of the year what our total was when we give the cost saves at the end of the year. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. Just on the cash usage, it looks like you had $100 million in repo on the first quarter. I think when you gave initial guidance for fiscal \u201918, you thought it would be $100 million to $200 million in repo for the year, but it would be a more evenly paced repurchase throughout \u201918. So I\u2019m just wondering if the guidance is for it to be evenly split, it would seem like you\u2019re going to run well above the 100 to 200, should we assume that that\u2019s possible or whether we should assume a big pull back in repo the rest of the year. Rick Cardenas : Yes, I\u2019ll start by saying that, remember, the long-term framework was $100 million to $200 million a year, and there will be years we\u2019ll be above and years we\u2019ll be below. We did anticipate somewhere in that range, but we also said that when the market gives us opportunity, we\u2019ll be aggressive, and we think the market gave us some opportunity in the first quarter and so we were aggressive in the first quarter and bought $100 million. Most of that was at the end of the first quarter, though, so it shouldn\u2019t really have had an impact on Q1. Most of that purchase was at the end of Q1. That said, there will be a possibility that we\u2019ll be above the $200 million this year, and as we know more of that, we\u2019ll let you know. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great, thank you very much. Operator : We show no further questions in queue at this time. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to you, Kevin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Shawn. That concludes our call. I would like to remind you all that we plan to release second quarter results on Tuesday, December 19 before the market opens, with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect at this moment.",

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you, you may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Gene. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO, and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release which was distributed this morning and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings on March 22nd before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights, Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the first quarter, and then Gene will have some closing remarks before we open the call for your questions. During today\u2019s call and for the remainder of this fiscal year, all references to Darden\u2019s same restaurant sales only include Darden\u2019s legacy brands since Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen Restaurants are new to Darden. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. Let me start by saying I\u2019m very pleased of our performance during the quarter. Our teams did a great job managing through some difficult circumstances recovering from the hurricanes. Total sales from continued operations were 1.88 billion, an increase of 14.6%. Same restaurant sales grew 3.1% and adjusted net earnings per share were $0.73, an increase of 14.1% from last year\u2019s diluted net earnings per share.  Given our consistent positive results, I\u2019m more convinced than ever that our success has been driven by the strategy we implemented three years ago. Our intense focus on improving the food, service and atmosphere in our restaurants combined with relevant integrated marketing remains a winning strategy for our brands. The long-term investments we have made and will continue to make and these areas are paying-off and we will work hard every day to better execute in these critical areas. This back-to-basics operating philosophy is coupled with Darden\u2019s four competitive advantages; one, leveraging our significant scale to create a cost advantage, two, using extensive data insights to improve operating fundamentals and to better understand our guests and communicate with them more effectively, ensuring our brands systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process, and four, cultivating our results oriented people culture to enable growth. Together our operating philosophy and competitive advantages give me confidence in our ability to continue to deliver our long-term framework overtime. Turning to Olive Garden. Same-restaurant sales grew 3% outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 400 basis points. This was Olive Garden\u2019s 13th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth driven by our focus on simplification and flawless execution, which continues to result in high guest satisfaction scores. Our promotional strategies and core menu are working together to create everyday value, and drive increased frequency for our most loyal guests and our strong-to-go performance which grew 12%.  During the quarter, we ran our two most popular value promotions, Buy One Take One, which appeals to our guest need for convenience and Never Ending Pasta Bowl which highlights our brand pillar of never ending abundance. Both promotions leveraged brand equities and were supported by strong integrated marketing campaigns highlighted by Olive Garden\u2019s most anticipated event of the year The Pasta Pass. This year in addition to making 22,000 pasta passes available we introduced the first of its kind Pasta Passport which included all the benefits of the Pasta Pass plus a trip of a lifetime to Italy. Once again, all pasta passes were claimed online immediately. The volume of social media and PR buzz surrounding this event illustrates the strong emotional connection our fans have with the Olive Garden. LongHorn Steakhouse had strong quarter as the investments we have been making for last two years are significantly improving consumer perceptions and motivating guests to visit more frequently. Same restaurant sales grew 3.8%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 480 points. This was LongHorn\u2019s 19th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. The emphasis LongHorn\u2019s leadership has placed on simplification like reducing their menu items by nearly 30% has led to higher levels of execution. At the same time, they continue to enhance the quality of guest experience with strategic investments in food, service and atmosphere.  As I mentioned last quarter same restaurant sales at LongHorn\u2019s new markets continue to grow at a higher rate than in the established markets. Consumers in these new markets are discovering what makes LongHorn special, while at the same time fully realizing the value proposition that inherently exists in the brand. This performance trend is not new to LongHorn. We have seen it play out over the past 20 years as I have been associated with the brand.  Now I will update you on the Cheddar's integration. The Cheddar's team is doing a great job managing the complexity of this integration which also includes integrating the two largest franchisees which were recently acquired. Merging three different operating systems into the Darden network isn\u2019t easy but is going exactly as planned. We are at an important point in the integration progress as we transition from planning to execution. Integration related activity is peaking as we transition distribution networks including our main line distributor, produce suppliers and smallware suppliers, convert point of sales systems in 10 restaurants per week which also includes two weeks of training for restaurant prior to conversion, fully transition Cheddar's payroll system on to the Darden payroll platform and finally, we just completed open enrollment and Cheddar\u2019s team members will be transition to Darden benefits at the beginning of the calendar year. It is our intent to integrate Cheddar\u2019s and the two acquired franchise systems as fast as possible in order to position the brand to take advantage of the scale, synergies another benefits of Darden infrastructure.  We realize this is having a short-term negative impact on sales momentum, but we believe the long-term benefit will far outweigh the short-term impact. Rick will provide an update on synergies in his remarks in just a moment. I want to thank the integration team for this outstanding work on this project. They have developed a comprehensive plan and are executing that plan at high levels. The more we learn about Cheddar\u2019s the more excited we become of the long-term growth prospects. They are the undisputed value leader in casual dining with a large loyal guest base and average approximately 6,300 guests per week, per restaurant. Let me close by saying the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they help our guests celebrate with co-workers family and friends. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 175,000 team members for all due to create memorable guest experiences during the special time of the year. We remain focused on getting better every day and I look forward to making even more progress in the new year ahead.  And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter with total sales grew of 14.6% driven by 11.5% growth from the addition of 153 Cheddar\u2019s and 28 other new restaurants and same restaurant sales growth of 3.1%. Second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.73, an increase of 14.1% from last year\u2019s earnings per share. We paid $78 million in dividends and repurchase $89 million in shares. In total, we returned approximately $167 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter and 346 million fiscal year-to-date.  Turning to this quarter\u2019s P&L. Restaurant level EBITDA margin was 20 basis points higher than last year as cost savings and leverage from same restaurant sales growth more than offset overall inflation pressure and the addition of Cheddar\u2019s, which I will refer to as brand mix. Adjusted EBIT margin was flat as G&A expense as a percent of sales was 20 basis points higher than last year due to an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter this quarter. Excluding this matter, G&A would have been favorable by 10 basis points. This unfavorability in G&A was completely offset in income taxes due to the resolution of certain prior year matters.  So, for the quarter, our adjusted EBIT margin increased 10 basis points versus last year. Looking more closely at the details. Food and beverage costs were favorable by 20 basis points as pricing of approximately 1.5% and costs savings more than offset commodity cost inflation of just under 1% and our continued investments in food quality. Restaurant labor was unfavorable by 30 basis points compared to last year due to Cheddar\u2019s brand mix. Restaurant labor in our legacy Darden brands was in line with last year due to continued productivity gains and sales leverage despite inflation of about 4%.  We opened more restaurants this quarter than the same period last year, which increased our pre-opening expenses. As a result, restaurant expense as a percent of sales was unfavorable 10 basis points versus last year. Marketing expense was favorable by 40 basis points due to sales leverage and favorable brand mix from Cheddar.  Finally, G&A expense was unfavorable by 20 basis points due to the legal outcome I mentioned previously.  Olive Garden, Longhorn and Fine Dining segment all grew sales in the quarter driven primarily by strong same restaurant sales. Segment profit margin increased in each of these segments by leveraging the same restaurant sales growth and managing cost effectively while still investing in a great guest experience.  Looking at the other business segment, sales grew 71.7% mainly due to the addition of Cheddar\u2019s as well as same restaurant sales growth at Yardhouse and Bahama Breeze. Similar to last quarter, segment profit margin was 200 basis points lower than last year due to the brand mix impact of adding Cheddar\u2019s and for moving consumer packaged goods out of this segment primarily to Oliver Garden.  Turning to the Cheddar synergy update. We continue to expect total run-rate synergies of between $22 million and $27 million. Based on the speed of integration and the great job our teams are doing to realize these synergies, we expect to achieve them a little faster than we originally anticipated. We now project to realize just under $10 million in synergies in the current fiscal year and achieve our targeted run-rate no later than the middle of fiscal 2019 instead of the end of fiscal 2019. And finally, this morning we increased our full year fiscal 2018 outlook. We now anticipate same restaurant sales growth of approximately 2%, new restaurant growth of approximately 40% and total sales growth of approximately 13%, each of these are at the high end of our original annual outlook.  Our full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are now anticipated to between $4.45 and $4.53. This is an increase from our previous outlook of $4.38 to $4.50. We are anticipating an effective tax rate of approximately 25% and a diluted average share count of approximately 126 million shares outstanding for the year. Please note, this outlook does not contemplate any potential impacts from the pending tax legislation.  Based on the information we know today, we anticipate that the tax legislation will have a benefit to us in terms of our effect tax rate going forward. Also, in the quarter the bill is enacted we are required to revalue our deferred taxes. Since the bill has not received final approval there are still many details to be analyze and we will reserve comment on the specific impacts to our tax rate overall.  Given the complexity of the pending legislation, we will not be providing any other detail in the Q&A session. Again, neither the expected reduction to our effective tax rate nor the onetime differed tax adjustments are included in the outlook we have updated today. We plan to update our fiscal 2018 outlook in early January to reflect the impact of tax legislation.  In closing I want to wish you all a great holiday season. And hope you will celebrate with family and friends in one of our restaurants. And with that we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brett Levy : Good morning and thank you. Can you share a little bit of color on what you\u2019re seeing across the competitive landscape? Obviously, you\u2019re still generating significant market share gains but the rate of growth seems to have slowed a little. Where are you seeing pockets of -- I\u2019d have to use the word weakness and also just one quick question on tax. I know you said you won\u2019t say much but are you under the impression that there will be no change to tip credit and how it would impact casual diners? Thank you. Gene Lee : Brett as Rick said, we are making no further comments on the pending tax legislation. We will update our guidance in January once the bill is passed. So, for everybody else who wants to ask as a question on it, we\u2019re not going to answer them.  As far as the consumer landscape, I think you were referring to that our GAP to NAV or our GAAP to benchmarks may have shrunk a little bit and we\u2019ve been pretty clear and we said we preferred to operate in an environment with a stronger industry and if our GAAP shrinks a little bit, that\u2019s okay with us.  As I said in my prepared remarks, I think we had a great quarter considering everything that transpired, we saw strength in all our businesses, we started in a pretty big hole in September. I think it feels pretty good out there. I would say when I look at the benchmarks, I\u2019m seeing about 3% growth in what the consumer is paying. So, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s still the environment all that promotional right now. I know they could be getting that in a couple of different ways where they\u2019re getting it through price or mix. But I feel like it\u2019s fairly positive out there right now and I just feel good. I think the consumer is using the whole menu, they\u2019re not all that reactive to what people are doing from an incentive standpoint. So, it feels good. Brett Levy : And then just one follow-up, your guidance rates on both the topline and the comp, is that implying just to what we\u2019ve achieved in the first half of the year or is there something that you are seeing in the second half that\u2019s giving you greater confidence? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Hey Brett its Rick. The guidance implies what we know in this in for the first half of the year and just some estimates of the economy or the industry is not going to get much better. We don\u2019t assume that it\u2019s going to just get better until it\u2019s gets better. So, the guidance we\u2019ve given is prudent based on where we are today. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. David Palmer : Thanks, and good morning. I\u2019m thinking ahead to calendar \u201918, I\u2019m struggling a bit to create an outlook for what the casual dining industry same store sales would look like for that year and obviously given the fact you have an empire that slices across various concepts and you can see how the consumer is behaving across the menu. This is an easier comparison quarter for the industry than what will have perhaps coming up. Do you feel like this is a sustainable improvement that\u2019s going on lately and is there any key leaves that you can see in terms of behavior that gives you confidence that there is an improvement going on even before tax reform? Thanks. Gene Lee : Hey good morning David. I continue to see -- when I look over the landscape the brands that are well positioned have strong value equations are continuing to take share. This is approximately $100 billion category that has been growing approximately 2%. And for those that are well positioned, I feel like they are going to continuing to do well. If your value propositions are little off and your offering is not resonating with the consumer, it could be a struggle. I think focusing on the overall industry benchmarks is somewhat dangerous because it\u2019s been such deviation in the performance of the people that are doing well compared to the people who aren\u2019t. So, I can\u2019t comment and give you guidance on what we think calendar \u201818 might look like. We\u2019ve given you what we think guidance is for the back half of our fiscal year, we always get a little nervous in December, January, February and March because weather is out of our control. We can\u2019t control that. And if we have a bad winter, that could put pressure short-term on our same restaurant sales. But we don\u2019t think that has any impact on the overall momentum of the business. So, as I said earlier to Brett\u2019s question, we feel pretty good about how the consumer is reacting to our brands right now. Operator : Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. John Glass : Thanks very much. Rick, may be first, can you just may be split the guidance to your previous expectations, you raised sales expectations for both units and for comps and you raised earnings but it would seem like tax and share count were responsible for that but you\u2019re also observing some hurricane impacts. So, what -- are those the right puts and takes or how do you -- is there anything else that moves for example in G&A or something that is not explained by that? Rick Cardenas : Yes, John a couple of things. One, as I said earlier we did have a little bit of a legal settlement that we had this quarter, not settlement but an outcome that we had this quarter that we didn\u2019t anticipate. We also -- as we talk about the G&A -- no I am sorry -- G&A cost of sales in food and beverage, we are still saying that our cost inflation in total is going to about 2% when you include labor. But every tenth of that move is about $0.03 a share. So, we\u2019re still saying approximately 2%, it\u2019s just closer to the 2%, right at the 2% than may be a little bit lower than the 2%. And also, we are going to continue invest in our consumer and invest in value. So, as we have said before if we do get some incremental revenues, we may have some of that that we hold back and invest in our consumer for the long-term. So that\u2019s why we still believe that the high end of our range at $4.53 is the right place to be, even though we did increase our sales and we did have a little bit of benefit in tax which was offset in legal. John Glass : And you last quarter talked about being conservative in pricing in the middle of the 1% to 2% range, you\u2019ve been a little bit higher than that at Olive Garden may be at but may be slightly above it, a little lower in LongHorn\u2019s. So, can you may be just update what your thoughts on pricing are, if the industry has bettered, do you feel like that gives you a little more license to be little higher in that range or do you still want to maintain that lower than competitors\u2019 value proposition? Rick Cardenas : Yes, a couple of things. One is, our long-term framework and algorithm, as always said -- in our strategy of leveraging Darden\u2019s cost advantage, we\u2019ve always said that we want to price below our competition which generally prices that inflation. Even if inflation goes up and competitors start to price, we believe that somewhere in that middle of between the 1% and 2% is the right place to be. And Olive Garden you mentioned, I think it was a 1.7 [ph] this quarter, Longhorn is below 1% this quarter. Even though, our commodity cost inflation was 1%. Olive Garden had much more inflation than Longhorn, because of Dairy [ph]. So, as we think about Olive Garden over the year, it\u2019s also a timing thing. We still think Olive Garden will be about 1.5 for the year and Longhorn will be below that. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Nicole Miller : First question. Could the industry be benefiting from a sale and could that be a permanent benefit as we enter the calendar year? And then specific on that point to Darden. When you look at what you\u2019re doing in test [ph] how do you look at the price point breaks and what should be out-source and in-source. For example, if you get over $100 or maybe $200 or $300. Is that something you\u2019re still in sourcing and when you outsource there is a lot of delivery test place, a lot of marketplaces you are testing. So how you\u2019re starting, who\u2019d go to and when? Thanks. Gene Lee : A lot in there Nicole. Let me start with the off-price sales. I take back to where, we identified a couple of years ago that the consumer needs data of convenience. The consumers are still looking at that for convenience. We\u2019ve got some brands that really can satisfy that express the Olive Garden. We\u2019ve done a great job with that. I think that\u2019s probably, a more permanent part of our equation today. I don\u2019t see that need state going away, I see that need state increasing. And I think we\u2019ll continue to come up with innovative way to meet that need. As far as, we start thinking about delivery and as we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve got multiple tests going on in the marketplace, we are trying to learn. We believe that someone is going to rise up and create some scale in the space and we\u2019ll watch those third-party delivers. We\u2019re also watching competitors that are doing it themselves. We have a small test, we\u2019re doing ourselves. And we\u2019ll watches whole space kind of develop. And we\u2019ll decide, how we\u2019re going to participate in that. We are still very attracted to the large party delivery catering in Olive Garden where average order is over $300. That makes a lot more sense for us to market and pursue than running around delivering $10 entrees at this point in time. So, for us, it\u2019s a wait and see. We\u2019re very engaged in the process, where all the third-party delivery companies and we\u2019re very engaged with our own activity around that. So, to us, so what see how these things develops. Nicole Miller : And just a quick follow-up on a separate topic. I believe, I saw Olive Garden recently showed up as one of Glassdoor's ranked best employers. And what I want to understand, is that a function of the return to basic strategy, there are topics that you have in place now or is there even more to come? Thanks. Gene Lee : We have a filter that we run every decision through. And the first question we ask is how does our team member win if we make a decision. The second is how does our guest win if we make a decision and we believe one of our four competitive advantages is our culture even as the employee market has tightened, our retention rates have not moved it all, they actually improved a little bit. We\u2019ll continue to invest in our team members, we believe we have great training programs, 50% of our management comes from our team member ranks which we believe are offering growth opportunities to our team members. And I think we\u2019re doing the right thing, we\u2019re not trying to manage to when these awards were \u2013 we\u2019re just doing the right thing for our team members every single day and then if we then get an award that\u2019s great. But I think you can see it in our results, we\u2019re doing a good job taken care of our guests and we take care of our guests, we win. Operator : Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is now open. Will Slabaugh : Yeah. Thanks, guys. Want to ask about Cheddar's and other lot of moving pieces there as you integrate to business, but can you talk a bit about positioning with such a valued end to concept probably a little bit more than the rest of your concepts. Does that leave it more vulnerable to improve quality and/or better value messaging from QSR or fast casual? Or do you think we are simply just seeing the pure dislocation of integration that you mentioned earlier? Gene Lee : No, I don\u2019t think, I think the exact opposite. I think this is a way for people to trade in the casual dining and having an experience for under $14 -- under a $14 check average was made from scratch food that is at a higher quality than most comparable operations they are competing against.  We look at the data and the research, we\u2019re just really impressed with the loyalty, we\u2019ve been out doing what we call dine arounds, where our team goes out and dine with guest. And we continue to learn more and more about the admiration they have for our brand. And the accessibility the brand provides for people who probably couldn\u2019t go out to eat in a full service casual dining environment except they can go to Cheddars and make it work inside their budget. This is a very strong brand, when I think about -- I know there is a little bit of concern about where the comps are and this doesn\u2019t surprise us at all, it happened at Yardhouse, it happened at Longhorn and I believe the only -- Longhorn only ever had one negative full year of same restaurant sales decline and that was during the integration in its 30 some year history.  The other thing I would add is that, we\u2019ve acquired two large franchise operations inside of Cheddar's that make up approximately 35% of the system. Those restaurants, there are 54 of them I believe or approximately 54 are a significant drag on the base Cheddar restaurants that were the real base of the company owned operations that we bought. Those restaurants are dragging it down, well over percent. As we standardize the menus, because the menus were somewhat different and their pricing philosophies were somewhat different, as we\u2019ve standardize the menus we are getting some negative check, that\u2019s drag and it sound to. These are decisions we have to make for a long-term.  And lastly as I mentioned in my remarks, integration is hard and we believe, when we look back on our couple of our last acquisitions, we didn\u2019t go fast enough, we let integration drag on too long. And so, we made the determination during this fund that we\u2019re going push hard and get to the other side quicker and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and we actually integrated the two franchise systems first, so they\u2019ve actually had the most activity because their systems were so weak. And I will close up by just saying the most important thing for us to do is to get our POS systems in these restaurants so that we can start getting the data that we get to analyze our other businesses to help us make the right strategic choices as we move forward to drive this brand. Let\u2019s not get hung up on short term quarter-to-quarter comps, this business does 6,300 guests a week, has incredible loyalty and is the undisputed value leader. Once we get to the other side of this which will be another 6, 9, 12 months, this business will be a good growth driver for Darden. Will Slabaugh : Got it. And one quick follow up if I could on the off-premise question from earlier, did you give what Olive Darden growth was in the quarter? Gene Lee : 12%. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Bittner : Hey guys thanks and happy holidays to you. As you start to think about 2019 just the synergies from the accretion are significant and they are accretive. What\u2019s going to be the strategy with that extra money as you think about it today? Is there something that you\u2019re going to let flow through the P&L and be accretive or is this something where you\u2019re looking to possibly reinvest it back in the price or value? Gene Lee : Yeah, I think Brian, every year we start off with a detailed plan for each of our business. The first thing that we look at it is what investments do we even make into the business, either through employee, experience into the guest and already be able to grow our market share and compete more effectively.  We look at our advantages and we\u2019ve always come back to that and how do we make scale work for us and that\u2019s really, really important and so we\u2019re not really talking about next year or next fiscal year but we\u2019re constantly looking at how do we make our experience better? Brian Bittner : Thanks for that Gene and just following up with a lot of the other questions, I mean you have always said throughout the last couple of years and at least conversations with me for sure that when industry trends do pick up that we should all expect your outperformance gap to narrow, but it didn\u2019t narrow much and you\u2019re clearly participating in this improvement that the industry is seeing. So, I mean I\u2019m just trying to -- I just like to kind of get your thoughts on that because on one side it does appear you\u2019re benefitting with the rest of the industry with the Olive Garden brand but on the other token I feel like you kind of want to, kind of expect the gap to narrow versus the industry as the trend remains the sustainably healthy. So, can you just maybe talk a little more to that, I appreciate it? Gene Lee : I mean you\u2019re really asking me to look into a crystal ball and try to project what\u2019s happening, I mean what\u2019s going to happen. We think our advantages and if we continue to make the right investments, whether it\u2019s underpricing and inflation, whether that\u2019s improving the food quality, whether that\u2019s improving the employee experience. The way we look at it how do we increase our share of the $100 billion category, both through same restaurant sales growth and new restaurant growth. And we look at the value equation for each of our businesses and we look at Cheddar's and Olive garden. The price value relationship is really important, as we move up the continuing [ph] the we experience becomes more important.  So, I am not sure -- if the overall industry does continue to improve, I\u2019m telling you right now, we\u2019re working as hard as we possibly can to get as much of that share as possible. And however, it plays out, it plays out. But we are not all that -- we look at the benchmarks, we report them out to you guys, but we are not sure that\u2019s always the total opportunity because we look at the top five or six players in the industry and say if they\u2019re doing something that we ought to try to be able to beat them not just the benchmark. Operator : The next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Your line is now open. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Gene, may be a high level philosophical question about the tax reform. I know you don\u2019t want to give specifics on the impact. But it does look pretty likely that you are going to see a meaningful benefit from that. So how do you think about reinvestments when it comes to the potential benefit you might get from tax reform? You talked about a lot of reinvestment so far. But is there -- are there big opportunities or being chunks of investments you think are out there that you might pursue if you get a big windfall from factors? Gene Lee : Well, I think the biggest thing that we constantly think about is the employee experience and how do we ensure that we have the best team members out there to bring our brands alive. Great brand management is much more difficult in the restaurant space than it is in consumer-packaged goods where you just put your brand up on a shelf and you do some advertising. We have employees that -- team members that bring our brands to life every single day. So, when I think about the investment -- if we think about investments in general, they have nothing to do with what\u2019s going on with legislation. We think about how do we improve the overall experience? And the competition for team members I think is going to be the most important element moving forward. How do we get great team members to bring our brands to life? David Tarantino : I guess -- just so I can you clarify, if you do get a benefit or a windfall from the tax reform, do you think there are meaningful offsets to that or -- in this investment cycle or can you embed those investments in what you\u2019re already doing? I just want to understand kind of philosophically how you look at savings? Gene Lee : I mean we are not going to talk about anything that has -- you tie this to meaningful benefits of tax reform, we\u2019re not talking about anything I am sorry David, about tax reform. We will talk about general investments and how we think about it but I think I\u2019ve already answered that question. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is now open. Peter Saleh : Great, thanks. Just wanted to ask, on wage inflation it sounds like your wage or labor inflation is running around 4%, yet you only have some modest deleverage on the labor line. Can you talk a little bit about the productivity gains that you are seeing, what brands are you seeing these productivity gains and what kind of gains are they -- are they going to be going or should we expect those to lessen as we get through the end of the year? Rick Cardenas : Yes, it\u2019s Rick. We are seeing productivity gains across the Darden system. I\u2019m not going to tell you by brand how much productivity, we\u2019re getting. Although, if you think about what we\u2019ve been doing over the last few years, we continue to simplify our operations and the brands that are simplifying are getting the most productivity gains.  And also, as I mentioned earlier, we did have some same restaurant sales leverage that helped. And finally, our turnover really hasn\u2019t moved much. As you think about turnover what happens when you have turnovers, you have to train a lot more. What we\u2019re doing with our training dollars is we\u2019re investing in training and getting our team members better at their job to become more productive than just learning their job, which is what happens when you\u2019re hiring new folks.  So, when you think about all of that, we feel really great about the productivity gains we\u2019ve made over the last few years. There are some brands that still have more To Go. Some brands that actually have actually been further along in the cycle. So, they might have a little less. But they\u2019re not stopping looking for productivity in the future. And you did mention, we did say that we had about 4% wage inflation, which is a pretty high inflation, but we were able to offset that with these productivity gains and with the moderate pricing we took. Peter Saleh : And then just on the go [ph] side of the business. I think historically, you had a lot of, I guess phone-in orders for To Go. What do we stand say, I guess on phone-in versus online orders coming in. Are How you seeing more of that growth coming from online orders? Gene Lee : Yes. We\u2019re approximately 30% online now and it continues to grow. And we do incentivize people to do that. Because we get a lot of data when they we get via online. And so, that\u2019s an important part of the process, it just helps to simplify the operation and we\u2019ll continue to try to migrate as much of that business over as possible. At the end of the day, we got a lot of people calling in orders, when they are driving home. That\u2019s hard to do those online, while you\u2019re driving. But we\u2019ll continue with more people over the best we can. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Matt, your line is now open. Matt Kirschner : Just had a couple of follow-up questions here. I just want to be clear. Did you say them at the negative two at Cheddar\u2019s was of the full based including the franchise stores and was negative check, more than negative check, so traffic was positive? Gene Lee : No. Let me clarify. Those negative two is inclusive of the two franchise systems that we -- what they call the Grier restaurants that were purchased by Cheddar\u2019s right before we bought them. And then we purchased their next largest franchisee, which we refer to as a CMP shortly thereafter. They make up 35% of the overall system. So, in essence, we\u2019re doing 3 integrations at once and their system has grown dramatically. Now what I said and maybe I wasn\u2019t clear, was that, the 35% of the restaurants that were franchised and now company owned are dragging same restaurant sales down by 100 basis points. And\u2026 Matt Kirschner : Were they in 1Q as well? Gene Lee : Yes. CMP wasn\u2019t just a Grier restaurant. And we have negative check in the approximately 45 Grier restaurants that we brought, because we had to standardize the menu. So that negative check is part of the drag. And this franchise -- these are great restaurants, great people but our franchise system that was run a little bit independently of the core company owned restaurants. So, there is going to some effort and energy to get them up to the operating standards of the company restaurants. Matt Kirschner : Completely understand. So, it wouldn\u2019t be correct to compare it down 1.4 to down 2 and you had a little bit of a different composite of the base? Gene Lee : Yes, that would be correct. You could do that. Matt Kirschner : Okay. Gene Lee : Because the CMP restaurants are a drag. Matt Kirschner : And then you mentioned that the middle of FY 2019, is now the target -- ahead of schedule for the integration correct? Gene Lee : Yes. Yeah, it is fiscal 2019. Sorry, Matt it\u2019s for the synergies not the integration. So, the integration, we expect to have most of the integration work done on the system side by the end of this fiscal year, but we do expect them to have to continue to learn how those systems works and then take those systems and use the data that we have to help improve the performance in fiscal 2019 that\u2019s fair. That\u2019s where I think we were saying the integration is going to take 18 months, it\u2019s the integration, the system is going to take less time than that, it\u2019s just the learning and the understanding the data is going to take a little longer. But we do expect that the synergies on a run-rate basis, we will get by the middle of fiscal 2019 versus the run-rate basis we thought will be at the end of fiscal 2019. So, sorry messed up the question there. Matt Kirschner : So, I guess if everything is moving forward, would it be correct to assume that potentially you could be looking to reaccelerate growth of the Cheddar\u2019s brand or bring it back to a little bit more meaningful growth perhaps sooner than maybe what you would have thought say six months ago? Gene Lee : Yeah. Matt, just because the integration is going a little bit faster, it\u2019s still takes time to find sites and other things and when you\u2019ve got a site pipeline that could be 18 months, it will take us a little longer just to rebuild that pipeline. We do expect to open restaurants in FY 2019, and we\u2019ll talk about the number of openings et cetera when we give you the fiscal 2019 outlook. But it\u2019s just going to take us a little while to build up that pipeline. Again, using the data that we use to help find the greater site. So, I would still expect us to open restaurants at least at the pace that we\u2019re opening them today in fiscal 2019, but we\u2019ll tell you more about that when we talk in 2019. Matt Kirschner : Understood. And then last question, is there anything that you wanted tell us about the hurricanes as far as on the cost structure, did they impair, did you have any waste of food in the quarter that should be noted or called out that was meaningful to the margins or disparity in same store sales as far as recovering happening a little maybe regionally seeing a little bit of stronger strength in pockets. Or is it pretty much a -- or everything that you reported is sort of national trends? Gene Lee : Yeah. Matt, thanks for that. What happened for the quarter, when we originally talked about the quarter we thought it would be down 60 basis points in the same restaurant sales and down $0.035 in - or $0.03 I\u2019m sorry in EPS. What it turned out was the restaurants that we had in Florida, impacted and they were closed for quite a while so that impacted us in total by about 50 basis points in close days. And those are higher volume restaurants in the system average. But then we did get some bounce back in Florida. And so, each brand was impacted differently, but for the company for Darden it was slightly negative in comps for the entire quarter. So, it wasn\u2019t negative 60 basis points, it\u2019s was just slightly negative.  On an EPS basis, it turned out to be about $0.02 unfavorable instead of $0.03, because the comp impact wasn't as bad. Now, the $0.02 is primarily proactive things that we did to make sure that the restaurants were boarded up and so they were -- they didn\u2019t have any as much damage. We did have some food inventory write-off, we had some restaurants that were closed maybe a week and so that food has to be written-off. But we\u2019re also very proactive before the hurricanes come to help mitigate any food write-off. So again, it was about $0.02 for the quarter instead of three and it was about slightly negative in comp instead of 0.6. Operator : The next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups if I could. First on the 12% growth instead of same as that quarter. I was wondering if that\u2019s signaled the outcome of what the steady state pace of growth might be or if you have any sense of where you think To Go mix might max out overtime. That\u2019s the first question.  And then I wanted to ask about LongHorn and the SKU reduction that you were talking about, I guess I hadn\u2019t recognized that it was 30% reduction in menu items. You know sometimes we see that at club [ph] restaurants and it has a negative impact on comps that doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s been the case. So maybe you can talk about where those menus came out and what do you think the key is to sort of reducing the menu size without impacting traffic? Thanks. Gene Lee : Alright. So, let\u2019s start with Olive Garden, the 12% quarter I thought was I think is a really strong To Go quarter. We think about the future; the consumer need state is going to continue -- is going to need to continue to increase for the convenience for us to continue to growth that. We\u2019re doing well over $0.5 million on average inside an Olive Garden box and To Go we\u2019ve got restaurants that are doing well over $1 million To Go. So, as we think about going in into the future, you know we need consumer needs state to continue to grow. We\u2019ll continue to innovative. I think one of the biggest things we can do on Olive Garden to Go is improve our operations as the business has improved, Dave and Dan and the team continue to work on coming up with better systems to handle the volume.  It's actually an interesting business because I do a lot of pickups like at 11 :15 and 11 :30. And so they can use the [indiscernible] before it fills up to handle the volume. So, I think there is some operational improvements that we can make. We can continue to improve the offering to stay relevant to the guest and continue to remind the guest that its available. We have said -- we\u2019re publicly on the record saying that we think overtime if the consumer need state continues to grow that this can be 20% of our business.  Primarily because the type of food travels so well and we can do it more so than just entrees that we can do bulk and bulk is where we want to be.  Let me move to LongHorn, we\u2019ve been making great investments in LongHorn for the last two years, Todd and his team has done a great job of -- we\u2019ve increased the size of the stakes, we\u2019ve removed complexity in the kitchen and as we\u2019ve mentioned we\u2019ve taken the SKUs down, some of that through the menu, some of that through the promotional activity that we\u2019ve done, reducing the number of new items that we introduced on a quarterly basis. And what we\u2019re finding is we had a lot of stuff on menu items on our menu that really were duplicative and what the feeling -- the need they were feeling for the consumer, and we removed them and it just helps us operate much more efficiently.  I believe all our businesses, all our brands, our menus are too complicated, too complex, we have items that continue to work and do the same thing over and over and over again versus having one great fried appetizer instead of having three great fried appetizers. And the more we can simplify the operation, the better the execution gets, the quality increases and the overall value the consumer is having an impact.  And LongHorn historically has been a high food cost low labor cost operation. And we have simplified that operation to be able to bring the labor cost down and increase the productivity while improving the overall quality of the food product. And even as much as we\u2019ve reduced it already, I think there\u2019s still further reduction to be done in the LongHorn menu to improve the -- to simplify the operation. Those are very small kitchens that have to stay simple in order to cook the great steaks in a timely manner. Operator : The next question comes from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your line is now open. Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning guys. Gene, how do you ensure that all the changes that are occurring at Cheddar's do not create a difficult work environment for employees and it could eventually impact the guest experience? Gene Lee : That\u2019s fairly easy. The systems having been invested in, in those restaurants, they are working on very old POS systems and so big difference in this integration than some of the others where the Cheddar's team is actually pulling from us to get this information in restaurant where some of our past integrations, there\u2019s been a little push back because they had good systems and we are just the changing systems to change the systems. Here our systems are superior. They want the systems as soon as they can get them and they have just been -- they have been great to work with. We believe overall the benefits package is going to be much stronger for those team members. We think there\u2019s a huge upside in Cheddar's in increasing their retention. Right now, their employee retentions are above the average of the industry and we believe that if we can take them from 120% team member turnover down to our norm of 70% it's going to have a huge impact on the overall operation. So, we believe and all indications are that they like the systems that we\u2019re bringing. Ian has done a great job working with his teams and talking about the systems that we are implementing and getting feedback. So, I think this is going to really enhance their performance overtime. Chris O'Cull: So, you have not seen any changes to the guest satisfaction scores at Cheddar's with this process? Gene Lee : No. Chris O'Cull: Okay. And then just one last question clarifying the menu changes at LongHorn. You mentioned the reduction in SKUs. But in terms of consumer facing menu items or what the consumer would experience, what is the percent reduction that you\u2019ve taken on the menu or through promotional items? Gene Lee : Yes, it's almost 30% and we\u2019ve got different tests out there and we\u2019ve got different products in different market. So, it\u2019s somewhere, it\u2019s approximately 25% to 30%. We\u2019ve done a really good job; the management is done a really good job there of getting back on our pathway. Delivering that brand in the consumer differently than how Olive Garden delivers their brand to the consumer. And it has a lot to do with the promotional cadence and new product introductions. Chris O'Cull: And my question was, has that going through enough purchase cycles, so you can see whether there has been a change to frequency of those guests at many reductions? Gene Lee : Yes. We were definitely seeing an increase in frequency in LongHorn. We measured that every quarter with our tokens. Operator : Next question comes from Jason West from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jason West : Just one given the upcoming holiday shift. Can you guys quantify how that impacted you last year or how you think it impacted the current quarter with the movement in holidays and any other shifts like [indiscernible]? Gene Lee : Yes, Jason, the holiday impact is minimal versus last year. The holiday shift moving Christmas basically from a Sunday to a Monday, it\u2019s really not going to be much different than it was last year. Rick Cardenas : Let me just add though. There are key days in our fiscal third quarter that cannot be weather impacted or also have a major impact, could have an impact on the quarter. I mean, so we got New Year\u2019s leave and Valentine\u2019s Day, which are big, big days in our quarter and a major weather event that covers a large geographic area could have impact. Gene Lee : Yes. And last year's holiday shift was about 20 basis points unfavorable. So, it shouldn\u2019t be much different than this year. So pretty much flat this year. Jason West : And I know Gene, it\u2019s hard to get, what\u2019s going on with the consumer from month-to-month. But we have seen a decent pick-up in the industry in the last couple of months and I don\u2019t know if you had any thoughts what\u2019s driving that and overlapping some of the election cycle stuff from last year but I don\u2019t know if there is anything else that you have seen or do you see in your regional data that a lot it is driven by the hurricane bounce backs or is it look broader based? Thanks. Gene Lee : The industry is fighting for consumers, their consumers discretionary dollars. And I\u2019ve said on this call before, we\u2019re not just fighting amongst ourselves, we\u2019re fighting for those dollars that have been spent in other places. I do think that overall, the industry is being a little more rationale. I think there has been some okay innovation and I think we\u2019re attracting consumers again. I don\u2019t think there is a macro trend out there that says that we\u2019re pushing people and I think the industry is doing a better job. Operator : The next question comes from Greg Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Gregory Francfort : I have two super quick questions. One is just on the 2% comp guide. Is that for the legacy brand, or is ex-Cheddar\u2019s or does that include Cheddar\u2019s. And my other one is for Gene. It seems like the high-end category specifically has had a pretty big improvement in the last couple of months and I think you definitely saw it in your businesses. What do you think is driving that and what is the reason for the improvement, particularly at the high-end steakhouse and also Eddie V's? Rick Cardenas : The 2% comp is for the legacy Darden brands, as Kevin mentioned on the beginning of our call, anytime we talk about comps for this fiscal year it will exclude the Cheddar\u2019s restaurants. Gene Lee : Good observation on the high-end category because our high-end brands with the hurricanes travel really came to a halt and they were disproportionately impacted and they had -- they really came back strong both Cap Grille and Eddie V's.  I would also say that Texas has not stopped being a drag. That business was for 18 months, we had pretty good presence in our high-end restaurants in Texas and that had really been a constant drag and that\u2019s kind of flipped for us now. And the Texas restaurants are doing better and not dragging so, on a high end the consumer, it feels really good out there, the consumers out there people are celebrating, I think our brands are very well positioned, Sean Martin is doing an incredible job leading Eddie Vs, and really maximizing those restaurants and put up a great number, very, very excited about that. And we\u2019re opening a few restaurants in Eddie Vs, which is really good growth for us. Operator : Next question comes from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeff Farmer : Thank you. I did hear you guys loud and clear on your reluctance to discuss tax reform, but just having quickly said that, should reform become a reality by the end of this week, by the end of this year. When would you guys expect to be able to share any form of assessment of what reform might means to your business. And specifically pointing to either ICR in January. Or is this the situation where we might have to wait till late March when your next reports to get some more details to what tax reforms could mean to your P&L and cash flow? Gene Lee : Hi, Jeff. Yeah, we expect to analyze the bill when it\u2019s signed. We\u2019re beginning to analyze it now, but we expect to have the impact of tax reform in early January ahead of ICR. Operator : Next question comes from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Andy Barish : Hi, guys. You are bumping up pretty close to your $200 million buyback here in the first half. Just any thoughts or further comments on cash to shareholders, free cash usage? Gene Lee : Yeah. Andy, we are as you said bumping up close to our high end of our long-term framework. And it's just that, as we\u2019ve said there are years that we could be above it, years where we can be below it. Right now, we have given you our share count for the year, which is 126 million shares. So, you could probably see that we don\u2019t anticipate buying a whole a lot right now. But we did last year go over our $200 million. So, as we think about our return of capital, we\u2019ll see what other uses we have for that capital and whether we\u2019re going to go ahead and buyback shares. But right now, we\u2019ve given you I guess the best indication of what our share count will be for the end of the year. Well, actually for the average for the year. Operator : The next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Karen Holthouse : Hi. We\u2019ve had a couple of quarters now of more positive commentary on comp trends in Longhorn outside of core markets. Also, you\u2019ve pretty strong profit growth there. How should we think about that tying into plans for unit growth? And you are sort of two years or 2.5 years out from a pretty proactive decision to pull back on unit growth. How far would you want to be in this process and maybe tying in simplification and what not before you would potentially really reaccelerate. Rick Cardenas : Hey Karen its Rick. In relation to LongHorn unit growth, a couple of years out, what we have talked about over the last few years is that our long-term framework for Darden is about you know 2 to 3%-unit growth, sales from the unit. I mean, some of that will come from LongHorn. We\u2019re very reluctant to talk about accelerating rapidly any one brand because we know that speed kills and we opened 40 LongHorns two years in a row and we\u2019re you know kind of catching up to that right now. So, as we think about LongHorn in the future, I think we\u2019ve talked this year is going to be in the teens, the high teens, numbers of openings.  I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that getting way out of line from there, but we\u2019ll give you a little bit more about FY\u201919 in a few months or actually by the end of the June. But right now, we\u2019re looking at pipeline, we\u2019re looking at filling in sites and markets that we already have restaurants in. We think that\u2019s a really good strategy for LongHorn and then continuing to find new markets where we can generate a beachhead and grow from there. Karen Holthouse : And then a question on guidance, if you look at the midpoint of EPS growth and then account for that legal settlement you saw this quarter. It would seem that pretax profit growth is decelerating from sort of high teens in the first half towards something that\u2019s more mid-teens in the second half despite what I would think would be more of a benefit from Cheddar synergies into the back half. What are the other drivers of that? Are there individual line items of inflation we should be focused on or just to think about that cadence? Gene Lee : Couple of things, one is we\u2019re ramping on a really strong last half of last year as you think about growth and inflation as we said for the year is going to be 2%, around 2 and it's just slightly higher than where we had anticipated. It's still around 2 but slightly higher on to be around 2 range and before. But we still have you\u2019ve done the math, somewhere in the double-digit growth rates in the back half of the year. So, we don\u2019t -- while we consider that a deceleration, it's still above our long-term framework growth rate if you think about earnings after tax and our long-term framework we say 7 to 10% and that would still be above that. Operator : Next question comes from Howard Penney from Hedgeye Risk Management. Your line is now open. Howard Penney : Hi and thank you so much for the questions, I have two if you don\u2019t mind. First one, you attributed your success at LongHorn through the smaller menu, increased execution and increased frequency. One of your largest competitors in the casual dining space Chili's is also deploying a similar strategy. I was wondering how you view that competitive dynamic as they go from down 7 to a plus 2% or 3% as a fairly good market share shift in casual dining. Thanks. Gene Lee : Yeah, I think one thing about LongHorn, we\u2019re finetuning the menu as we pull it back. I think it\u2019s a little bit different than the competitor that you mentioned. You know we had a lot of menu items that really weren\u2019t working that hard for us and we\u2019re introducing a lot of new products on a quarterly or every six weeks basis that weren\u2019t working hard. And you\u2019re very familiar with LongHorn Howard and a great LongHorn experience is a forceful way in a hot baked potato with sour cream and real butter. So, as we simplify our operation, we\u2019re executing it at a higher level. We need to get the stakes cooked correctly, we need to get the food out faster and that\u2019s what simplification has done for us. And I am really not going to comment on our competitors\u2019 strategy. Howard Penney : I just wish you had a LongHorn closer to where I live. My second -- and I am just trying to understand your hesitation towards delivery and some of the work that we\u2019ve seen on delivery suggest that the biggest opportunity of what consumers are seeing, they are using delivery for is a replacement from a meal at home. So that would obviously be very incremental to the casual dining industry. So, I detected a hesitation if I am wrong about that, you can correct me, but is it that you don\u2019t know who to go with delivery or you want to do it yourself or maybe you just don\u2019t see the opportunity as being that big? Thank you. Gene Lee : Well I think the answer -- there\u2019s two parts to your answer, we don\u2019t know who we are going to partner with yet and number, I don\u2019t like the current economics of the partnership. And so, I am trying to understand -- we are trying to understand their profit model and we are trying to understand our profit model doing internally. And once we get a pretty good understanding of both those models and they are well developed I think I will have some leverage in negotiating this with a third-party or doing it ourselves. So, I am not hesitant on the business. I think the business is a good business. I am just not going to live with that current economics. We will do ourselves before we live with their economics. Howard Penney : Got it. So sorry to keep coming over to you. So, it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t see the growth in delivery as taking share from other categories, you just don\u2019t understand the economics? Gene Lee : I understand them. They are not favorable enough for me. And I am not going to give them their discount and there\u2019s too much profit in there because they don\u2019t have scale yet. And so, we are trying to understand what that model looks like and what it looks like for us from a profitability standpoint, and we can pinpoint what their profit is and got to get to a better resolution if they want to do it for us. If not, we will do ourselves. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Mergard from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Alex Mergard : I have a follow-up on how the pipeline is shaping up, and I heard your comments on LongHorn. Would you consider exceeding your long-term guidance for 2%, 3% new restaurant growth? I mean, do you consider that more of a self-imposed cap in order to execute on that growth? Any colour there would be helpful. Gene Lee : Yes, Alex. The 2% to 3% is the long-term framework we have for a couple of reasons. One is people. We have to make sure we have enough people to open these restaurants and open them strongly and doing a great job with it. We think if we get too high above the 3% across Darden, it puts a strain on the people that we have in knowing the brand. There are some brands that are going to be above the 3% range and some brands are going to be below the 2% range but across Darden we think 2% to 3% is the right investment. And we do know that all of these restaurants on average are creating significant amount of value. But we also have other ways to return capital and to spend our capital, whether it\u2019s in dividends or share buyback. So, we want to balance all of our capital spending including new restaurants, we think 2% to 3% is the right amount. Alex Mergard : All right. I appreciate that. And then one final follow-up. And that is on the strength of independent restaurants versus chain restaurants. It's a trend that we've been seeing for some time now. Are you seeing any changes to that dynamic? And how it may or may not be impacting your business? Gene Lee : Yes. I think the independent growth is happening in more of the big cities. And we see that, more of a real issue for our upscale brands. In Yard House and Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze whether they\u2019re located more in these upscale suburban areas or urban areas. We\u2019re not seeing an influx of casual dining restaurants in suburbia that are privately owned. This is an urban phenomenon and not really impacting LongHorn and Olive Garden. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Your line is now open. Andrew Strelzik : I just have one quick one here. These outlets that you provided through is a pretty attractive low-single-digit deflation. But we\u2019re seeing in some of the stake that you\u2019re seeing some inflation now. So, I guess, I\u2019m wondering in terms of the outlet. Is that due to the coverage that you have currently or is there something that you see in the beef market or what\u2019s you\u2019re hearing that, that makes you more optimistic going forward? Gene Lee : Yes. We\u2019re fairly long right now in beef. So, we\u2019re covered and our teams are making good decisions along the way. Andrew Strelzik : Okay. I guess, so when I think about, when I look at the LongHorn margins you\u2019ve talk a lot about some of the initiatives and things that are going on there. But we did see a nice sequential step-up in the face of margin expansion. Is it reasonable to assume then that we might start to see that moderate or do you think you reached a point in terms of the initiatives that this is a more sustainable type of margin growth at LongHorn? Thank you. Gene Lee : Andrew, we\u2019ve had a lot of work at LongHorn and Simplification to improve labor productivity. And again, they\u2019ve also had some deep deflation over the last few years that help margins. We still think there is margin improvement for LongHorn going forward. Maybe not to the level that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, because eventually the beef deflation is going to become beef inflation and we\u2019re going to continue invest in quality at LongHorn. And we\u2019re just not ready to talk more about individual brand margins going forward. Although, if you look across Garden compared to our competitors we are the only ones drawing margins to really overtime, over last few years or actually the last six months.  So, we feel good about where our margin is. We don\u2019t want to go too high on our margin, because we think value is important and that getting too far out of line with what the consumer is willing to pay. But we still have costs that we can go after, we saw our productivity gains that we can do to continue to expand our margins across Garden 10 to 40 basis points, which is what\u2019s in our long-term framework. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Anderson from Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Steve Anderson : Most of my questions have been answered. But just from modeling purposes. Just want to ask, when your next 53-week of fiscal year will take place? Gene Lee : Give us a second to find that out. It\u2019s probably in a couple of years, but it\u2019s not next fiscal year, I\u2019m pretty sure. 53-week, I think it\u2019s. We\u2019ll get back to you on that. Operator : We show no further questions in queue at this time. [Operator Instructions]. Gene Lee : Thanks. And I think we\u2019re ready to conclude the call. I want to remind everyone that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday March 22, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thanks everyone for participating in today\u2019s call. And have a happy holiday season. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Good morning everyone and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO, and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings on June 21st before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and Rick will provide an update on our financial results and outlook for the year. During today\u2019s call and for the remainder of this fiscal year, all references to Darden\u2019s same-restaurant sales will only include Darden\u2019s legacy brands since Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen restaurants are new to Darden. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you see from our press release this morning, we had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.13 billion, an increase of 13.3%. Same-restaurant sales grew 2%, despite the negative weather impact, which Rick will address in his remarks. And adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.71, an increase of 29.5% from last year. I am proud the ways our teams have executed against our strategy we rolled out three years ago, our operating teams remain focused on foods, service and atmosphere and at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on our four competitive advantages. Leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages, using extensive data and insights to improve operating fundamentals and to better understand our guests and communicate with them more effectively, ensuring our brands systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process, and cultivating our results-oriented people culture to enable growth. Olive Garden had another solid quarter. In fact, December was the highest total sales month in the history of the brand. Overall, same-restaurant sales grew 2.2%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 310 basis points. Same-restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 440 basis points. During the quarter, Dan Kiernan was appointed President of Olive Garden. I am excited to have an outstanding operator like Dan leading the team. His passion for our team members and guests coupled with his deep understanding of the brand makes him the perfect leader for Olive Garden. Olive Garden continues to consistently deliver strong results, which I attribute to the brand\u2019s strategic focus on driving frequency among our most royal guests. This begins with flawless execution of the guest experience, and we will continue to focus on simplification to improve execution of our standards. We were also able to drive more frequency by introducing craveable menu items that create excitement among our core guests. We introduced the new appetizer loaded pasta chips, and a new lunch entr\u00e9e, the Meatball Pizza Bowl, during the quarter and both were supported with successful integrated marketing campaigns that drove overwhelming PR buzz. Additionally, our focus on off-premise sales is doing more than just meeting our guest needs for convenience. It\u2019s also enabling us to capture dining experiences that guests would not have previously considered for us. During the quarter, off-premise sales grew 13% and were approximately 15% of total sales for the quarter. Building loyalty also means that we need to continue to deliver meaningful value to our guests, every day. During the quarter, we launched our new advertising campaign to build awareness for everyday value, highlighting our Lunch Duo starting at $6.99, Early Dinner Duos starting at $8.99 and [indiscernible] pasta starting at $9.99. The work we are doing is resonating, as industry data shows that Olive Garden has seen the largest improvement in our value ratings versus key competitors over the last year. Our focus on everyday value and simplification has also allowed us to reduce the number of promotional offers we\u2019ll run this year. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we will not offer our one of our most popular promotions, Buy One Take One that we ran during the fourth quarter last year. Buy One Take One is a strong promotional platform for us. And to assure its long-term effectiveness, we don\u2019t not want to risk over exposure. However, not running this promotion may have a short-term impact on our traffic in Q4. I am encouraged by Olive Garden\u2019s momentum and we\u2019ll remain focused on making decisions that ensure our guests win. LongHorn Steakhouse\u2019s same-restaurant sales grew 2%, the 20th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 290 basis points. Same-restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 420 basis points. The team at LongHorn continues to make solid progress against their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging LongHorn\u2019s unique culture to increase team member engagement. We think about investing in the guest experience across all three guest touch points, food, service and atmosphere. While we\u2019re making investments across all three areas, our primary focus has been on increasing the quality of our food. In fact, we\u2019ve increased the size or improved the cut of nearly every one of our steaks over the last two years. Our focus on simplification by producing a number of new items needed to support our promotional offers is driving more consistency leading to higher levels of execution inside our restaurants. That\u2019s evidenced by the fact that LongHorn ranked the top of its competitive set on food quality scores. And while LongHorn\u2019s team member management retention levels lead the industry, we remain focused on team member engagement. During the quarter, we kicked off our third annual Steak Master\u2019s competition. This program provides intense trading for our culinary team members, while creating excitement and increasing engagement with our entire team and each restaurant. And finally, our new LongHorn openings continue to exceed our expectations, and we\u2019re building a strong pipeline for future growth. Now, I\u2019ll update you on Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen and our progress with the integration. Same-restaurant sales decline 2.2%, and that decline was driven by the 52 restaurants in the two franchise systems that have been acquired over the last 14 months. Same-restaurant sales at the 91 legacy Cheddar\u2019s restaurants were essentially flat. Operations leadership is focused on strengthening the restaurant management teams and working to improve operational excellence with the concentration on the previously franchised locations. Cheddar\u2019s is a strong brand that serves more than 6,000 guests per week. These high guest counts create some unique operational challenges that we will address, primarily through simplification. This will take time as we manage to the amount of change taking place across the system. Turning to the integration. It\u2019s been less than a year since we acquired Cheddar\u2019s, and I\u2019m pleased with everything the integration team has accomplished in that amount of time. We are now in the final stages of our systems integration. All restaurants are utilizing our full distribution network. And we successfully transitioned Cheddar\u2019s on to the Darden payroll platform in December. The last major milestone is the rollout of proprietary POS system, which we expect to complete by the end of the fiscal year. Our restaurant managers and teams are still familiarizing themselves with our systems and processes, and it will take time before they\u2019re fully comfortable using them. But, we\u2019re pleased with the insights and feedback we\u2019re receiving from the restaurants that are fully integrated into the Darden infrastructure. As I\u2019ve said previously, this is a complicated process. We know, we\u2019re throwing a lot at the restaurant teams and we know it\u2019s distractive. But we\u2019re confident the long-term benefit will be worth the short-term impact is this having on the business. Now, let me provide a quick update on the restaurant we just open in Washington D.C., called The Capital Burger. This retardant is a brand extension of The Capital Grille in D.C., which is a very busy restaurant with limited capacity. The Capital Burger is a way for more of our guests to enjoy bar-centric Capital Grille with a limited menu featuring our signature burgers. The Capital Burger leverages The Capital Grille\u2019s steak and wine expertise as well as their exceptional service to create an extraordinary burger experience. I am excited to see how our guests in that market will respond. Finally, I want to congratulate all the restaurant management teams at Olive Garden and the Capital Grille for winning the People Report\u2019s 2018 Best Practices award. Being recognized as having the best workplace culture in the casual dining and fine dining, is a tremendous honor. We know it truly sets apart as our people and I am proud of the work each one of our eight brands does can ensure our results-oriented culture remains a competitive advantage for Darden. Now, I will turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter with total sales growth of 13.3%, driven by 11.3% growth from the addition of 154 Cheddar\u2019s and 34 other net new restaurants, and same-restaurant sales growth of 2%. Adverse winter weather negatively impacted same-restaurant sales this quarter by 70 basis points. The negative impact was experienced in January and February. Weather for the quarter was in line with the average over the last five years. However, we were wrapping on unseasonably mild winter weather in the third quarter last year. Second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were a $1.71, an increase of 29.5% from last year\u2019s earnings per share. We paid $78 million in dividends and repurchased $19 million in shares, returning approximately $97 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter and over $440 million fiscal year-to-date. Additionally, during the quarter, we further strengthened our financial position by issuing $300 million of new 30-year debt at 4.55%, replacing $311 million of our outstanding notes tendered that had a higher interest coupon rate of 6.8% and 6.0%. We funded the approximately $100 million of premium and fees, associated with the tender, with cash on hand and commercial paper. Looking at the margin analysis, I am going to focus on food and beverage, restaurant labor, G&A and tax, as variances for all other lines on the P&L were relatively small on a year-over-year basis. Food and beverage expense was 50 basis points favorable to last year as pricing leverage, cost savings, and synergies more than offset commodities inflation of below 1%. Restaurant labor was 130 basis points unfavorable last year due to several factors. First, we continue to see elevated wage inflation of approximately 4% that was only partially offset by the favorability we picked from pricing leverage and productivity improvement. Second, we are still experiencing negative brand mix from Cheddar\u2019s. Next, there were headwinds related to mark-to-market expenses for General Manager and Managing Partner equity awards, which I\u2019ll explain in further detail in a moment. Last, in January, we announced the $20 million investment in our workforce this fiscal year and we incurred approximately $9 million of that amount this quarter, most of which impacted the restaurant labor line. General and administrative expense was elevated this quarter, driven by mark-to-market expenses related to significant appreciation in the equity markets this quarter. The mark-to-market of our deferred compensation liability and other equity based programs, increased expenses, primarily in G&A, consequently reducing our EBIT. However, due to the way we hedged this expense to reduce the volatility of earnings after tax, it is almost entirely offset in the tax line. In the quarterly presentation that is posted on our website, we show the third quarter details of this hedge. Market-based compensation increased general and administrative expense by $5.5 million. Including the impact in restaurant labor I previously mentioned, total mark-to-market expenses reduced EBIT by $7 million and EBIT margin by 30 basis points this quarter. Our hedge reduced income tax expense by approximately $6 million, resulting in a net earnings after-tax impact of $900,000. In quarters in which the overall equity market and/or our stock price declines, the inverse relationship would be true, EBIT would have a positive benefit, while the tax line would be unfavorable. But, overall, earnings after-tax should be relatively flat. Turning to income tax expense. We had an abnormally low performance-adjusted effective tax rate of 4.4% this quarter due to several factors. First, the application of the new lower tax rate in Q1 and Q2 earnings reduced our rate by 7 percentage points in the quarter. Next, the resolution of other tax matters reduced our quarterly rate by 4 percentage points. Both of these favorable impacts were contemplated in the updated guidance we provided in January. Finally, the impact from the deferred compensation hedge I just explained lowered the tax rate by approximately 4 percentage points. This was not contemplated in our January guidance. After adjusting for these three factors, our normalized tax rate for the quarter would have been approximately 19%. Now to our segment performance. Olive Garden, LongHorn and the Fine Dining segment all grew sales in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurants. Segment profit margin increased in each of these segments, even at the incremental workforce investments by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing cost effectively. Sales grew 71.4% at the other business segment, primarily due to the addition of Cheddar\u2019s and new restaurant growth at the other brands as well as same-restaurant sales growth at Yard House and Bahama Breeze. Similar to last year, segment profit margin was 250 basis points lower than last year -- last quarter, I\u2019m sorry, similar to last quarter. Segment profit margin was 250 basis points lower than last year due to the brand mix of impacting of adding Cheddar\u2019s and for moving consumer packaged goods out of this segment, primarily the Oliver Garden. Additionally, with this morning\u2019s announcement, we increased our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook to between $4.75 and $4.80 from the previous $4.70 to $4.78. This assumes approximately 126 million average shares adjusting for the year and is driven by same-restaurant sales growth of approximately 2%. New restaurant growth of approximately 40, not including the 11 Cheddar\u2019s franchise restaurants we acquired into Q2 and total sales growth of approximately 13%. We also updated our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 16.5%, down from approximately 18%. Finally, we brought our annual CapEx guide to the bottom end of the previous range at approximately $400 million. Looking ahead, we wanted to provide some preliminary guidance for fiscal 2019. We currently anticipate total capital spending of between $425 million and $475 million, of which $225 million to $260 million is related to gross new restaurant openings of between 45 and 50, and $200 million to $215 million is related to ongoing restaurant maintenance, additional Olive Garden remodels, technology and other spending. In addition to the CapEx and new unit guidance we typically give during our third quarter announcement, we are providing a few additional items for fiscal 2019, given tax reform and other unique modeling challenges. First, we anticipate our annual effective tax rate to range between 12% and 13%. We also expect to make an additional $15 million of investments related to the savings from the Tax Act. This is in addition to the $200 million of workforce investments we are making -- $20 million -- to the $20 million of additional workforce investments we are making in fiscal 2018, for a total annual run rate of $35 million in P&L investments. Finally, we expect diluted average common shares outstanding for fiscal 2019 to be approximately 125 million. And with that, we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator : Thank you, speakers. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Your line is now open. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. Gene, I just wanted to ask about your views on the current environment within casual dining and how you\u2019re viewing the underlying momentum in the business in light of sort of factoring out some of the weather issues as you noted. And then more, specifically, on Q4, you do have what looks like a tougher comparison, especially for Olive Garden. And you mentioned that you\u2019re not going to repeat the Buy One Take One promotion. So, just wondering about your thoughts on how we should expect the fourth quarter to play out and your ability to sustain positive momentum despite the tough comparison in eliminating that promotion? Gene Lee : Yes. Good morning, David. Let\u2019s start with the industry. We are seeing a little bit of momentum there, little bit uptick in traffic. But, the real change that we\u2019re seeing, as we analyze the benchmarks is that the check average appears to be growing and has picked up some steam. And as we look at that, we\u2019re trying to analyze whether that is the industry taking more pricing, is it a pullback on some discounting, is it change in promotional strategy. At this point, we really don\u2019t have a good feel, but we do see that check average is up over 3% and it\u2019s been that way for almost the last 90 days. So, that\u2019s a significant move up. And we\u2019ve seen a tick up in traffic but not at the same rate as overall sales. As far as the fourth quarter, I mean, we gave our guidance -- we think that we\u2019re comfortable in that range. We do have some tough laps. But, we think that we\u2019ve made -- we\u2019re making good long-term decisions. We think there\u2019s value in the menu. We think we\u2019re operating and executing at a high level. So, I think we\u2019re -- obviously, we\u2019re very comfortable with the guidance that we just put forth. You know you did make the comments to introduce the fourth quarter weather issue. We have -- we\u2019ve been -- in this quarter and every week, we had a major snow impact for at least one day. I will add and I think added this during the hurricanes is that weather impacts today are greater than they were 5 or 10 years ago, because of the media hype around the situation. And so, kind of tough for us to -- and this would be the only common I\u2019ll make about fourth quarter. It\u2019s been tough for us to get any type of read around fourth quarter, because of the weather impacts in March. David Tarantino : Just a follow-up, Gene. On the elimination of the Buy One Take One promotion, are you planning to run something else in place of that or is it a situation where you\u2019re not going to have a major promotion like that in the fourth quarter. And any way to gauge what the level impact from that factor alone would be\u2026 Gene Lee : No. I think we believe that we -- actually, we\u2019re going to run promotion. I mean, we have taken the promotional calendar; we\u2019ve gone from 9 to 6 promotions this year. We think that\u2019s a huge operational benefit. So, our promotional timing is not lining up exactly with last year. We do have great promotions at the start in two weeks. So, we think that will be really strong. As we change the promotional cadence or we also change on media cadence, which makes our ability to analyze our business week-to-week a little bit more difficult. But, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve got a group promotion for the back half of the fourth quarter. And we think we\u2019ve got the right media plan. And so, that\u2019s all but incorporating the guidance we gave you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brett Levy : Is there a number where you look at your same-store sales gap and outperformance where you start to get concerned? If you look at what we\u2019ve done -- if we look at what we\u2019ve seen for Olive Garden, it seems to be back to the beginning of your run about 10 quarters ago. And I\u2019m just -- when you think about labor, what can you do aside from just trying to drive greater retention? What can you do to offset the creep, either incremental training, incremental technology to try to help us get a better sense of what the leveragability is on that line? Thank you. Gene Lee : As far as the gap would, I would point you back to our long-term framework and say that we\u2019re focused on trying to deliver between 1% and 3% same-restaurant sales on a consistent basis. And I know, there is a lot of attention and a lot of concern about our GAAP. I would point -- I\u2019d go back and look at a two-year stack, we didn\u2019t lose that much momentum on a two-year stack, also we lost a lot less momentum on the guest count. We appear to have a lot less price in our menu compared to our competitors, which we think is a really great thing and will play out over the long-term. As far as labor goes, I think the key to labor is simplification. And we\u2019ll continue to try to simplify our menu, simplify our processes. And we\u2019ve done a good job. I thought the graph that Rick showed in his prepared remarks, shows that we are getting some productivity improvement to offset some of the wage rate increase. It\u2019s a line that I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to leverage here in the near-term. But, we\u2019re trying to keep it as flat as we possibly we can. And I look at our businesses. I\u2019m not so sure that there is a piece of equipment out there that\u2019s going to help us improve, or any technology is going to help us improve our efficiencies back there. My belief and my belief always be that it starts with your menu and it starts with all your processes and procedures as your products come in your back door. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to focus on. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Anna Papp : Good morning. This is actually Anna Papp, representing Sara. So, I\u2019m surprised that how modest food inflation has been across the industry despite what appears to more significant increases in commodity prices. Can you remind us about how contracting plays into this and how we should think about the type of lag there might be between the commodity markets and your inputs? Because it seems like the industry is taking checkouts aggressively, as you say, and typically we\u2019d expect that to happen if costs [ph] are up. Gene Lee : Yes. Anna, thanks for the question. On the commodity front, we contract at different times of the year. We\u2019ve got a great supply chain team that decides when the right time is to buy, looking at forward rates et cetera. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of commodity inflation. As we\u2019ve said, we were slightly below 1% in the quarter. What I would say is more of the pricing you\u2019re seeing from some competitors is probably to cover the labor, not necessarily the commodities. What we also know is that as demand has picked up, supply has picked up. So, it\u2019s helped keep the commodities from inflating dramatically. And we also in our presentation show that we\u2019ve got inflation expected in the back -- in the last quarter in the low single digits. We\u2019ve got an appendix back there. The one place we are seeing a little bit of inflation in the food is on the distribution side. It\u2019s getting a little bit tougher and tougher to find people to drive trucks. So, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of distribution expense, but that\u2019s driven by labor, not necessarily the food cost. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Rick, I appreciate the initial look into 2019 on several line items. You highlighted the incremental investments of $15 million from the tax savings redeployment. But as we put all the pieces together for 2019, you didn\u2019t say anything regarding the Cheddar\u2019s synergies. What\u2019s the year-over-year benefit now expected related to that for 2019? And I have a follow-up. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. In relation to Cheddar\u2019s synergies next year, what we said last quarter was we expect to be close to the run-rate by the fourth quarter of this year and we expect to have $22 million to $27 million of total synergies. So, doing the math, we\u2019re going to be a little below $15 million next year in incremental synergies. But we also now expect to be closer to the high end of our synergy range of the $22 million to $27 million. Hopefully that answers your question. Brian Bittner : Yes. And just on the labor line, when you back out the investments in the mark-to-market stuff, the deleverage was close to like 90 basis points. That\u2019s more deleverage than we\u2019ve seen recently on that line. Is there something changing there, is inflation picking up relative to past quarters or anything else you can point to, just kind of changing the trend in that labor line? Rick Cardenas : No, Brian, nothing is changing in the inflation. We\u2019re still seeing in the 4% to 5% wage inflation. And we did have a little bit of Cheddar\u2019s mix in there, more than we might have seen in the past, as we as we bring in more franchisees or we brought in the franchisees in Q2. But, other than that, there\u2019s really nothing dramatically different. We did have a little bit lower check growth and pricing in the quarter than we had in the past. Operator : Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is now open. Will Slabaugh : A question on Olive Garden. Did you more recent advertising campaigns around $8.99 dinners impact the mix of Kachina Me [ph] at all or even the rate of what you\u2019d call overall value mix? And if so, just curious on your thoughts, if you\u2019re okay with that and is that\u2019s the direction you want to go here? Gene Lee : Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s had a lot of impact on Kachina Me [ph]. It\u2019s only rolling offering from 3 to 5. I mean, we see that -- Early Dinner Duos is just an opportunity to attract the clientele that is looking for value during really the only time when Olive Garden has some capacity. So, we see it as. Obviously, there is some people trading and they were coming in at 5.30, they\u2019re now coming at 4.45. But we think this is -- over the next couple of years, we think this is a real growth opportunity for us just to build this value visit for people who aren\u2019t really time-sensitivity around when they\u2019re eating. And we hope that over time, we\u2019ll just backfill anybody that we shift down into an earlier time zone. So, we think, this is a great way to offer value to our consumers in a period of time when our restaurants aren\u2019t very full. Will Slabaugh : And just a quick clarification on the guidance, if I could. So, on the tax rate, I just wanted to clarify what you\u2019re implying for the fourth quarter. It looks like it\u2019d be closer to 20% and curious what the reason would be if it did climb that high? Gene Lee : Well, if you hear the prepared remarks, we talked about what our normalized rate would have been in the third quarter. It was about 19. So, if you\u2019re doing the math to get to the 16 to 16.5 and you\u2019re getting to around 20, it\u2019s not really that different from what our rate would have been in Q3. Operator : The next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. John Glass : I wanted to just go back to the change in the promotional cadence in Olive Garden. I guess, one, specifically, if you can talk about what you think that promotion or change in the promotion specifically might do to impact sales and you called that out. And maybe just more broadly, as you move from 9 to 6 promotions. Does that create -- is that the right number now as you think about 2019? And does that change for example the first half of 2019 as you think about lapping or uneven laps around promotional activity? Gene Lee : I\u2019ll answer the last part of the question first. I mean, we\u2019ll not change the first part of next year. We\u2019ll have completely lapped this. We\u2019ve been working this all year. We haven\u2019t talked too much about it primarily for competitive reasons. We did want to call it out this time, because Buy One Take One is one of our most successful promotions. And we\u2019re not sure how we\u2019re going to be able to really -- how well we\u2019re going to be able to offset that. As far as giving some guidance into the fourth quarter, all I\u2019d point you back to is our guidance. We\u2019ve taken into account what we think the headwinds will be from removing that promotion, and it\u2019s in our full guidance. I\u2019m not going to give any more color on that. John Glass : And Rick, just two modeling questions, if you will. One is this mark-to-market program. Is this new? I haven\u2019t heard about it coming to be bear to before and there hasn\u2019t been market volatility before. So, is there a new program, we should just anticipate this from time-to-time or is this just the first time that surfaced as a call out? And then, I just want to make sure I understand the workforce reinvestment this year. You said $9 million this quarter, so an anticipated $11 million next quarter, the fourth quarter and then $15 million in 2019? I just want to make sure that is correct. Rick Cardenas : Yes. The workforce investment was $9 million this quarter and it would be about $11 million in Q4. As far as the mark-to-market, it\u2019s not new -- it was just with the with the run up in the equity markets for our quarter was pretty significant on a one quarter basis and our stock price at the same time caused a lot more impact than mark to market that we\u2019ve seen before. We\u2019ve had this program going on for years but this was just a significant impact for us in this quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeff Farmer : Thank you. Did you guys comment on the potential refi impact on interest expense as you head into FY19? Was that lower interest rates? Just trying to figure out; I think you gave us some interest rates, but what that might mean to actual interest expenses as you move into 2019 versus 2018? Rick Cardenas : Yes. We didn\u2019t call it out, but if you do the math, it\u2019s about a $5 million net reduction in interest expense for next year when you include the fact that we had to take on a little bit of commercial paper. Jeff Farmer : Okay. And then, just one unrelated question. Turn appetites or philosophy toward pursuing acquisition of additional concepts in coming years. Any updated thinking on that? Gene Lee : Yes. I think right now, we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re really focused on continuing the integration. And Cheddar\u2019s building the solid foundation for that brand and ensuring we get it on the right growth path before we consider doing anything else. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Matt DiFrisco : Thank you. I just have a follow-up and then a question. With respect to the fourth quarter change in the promotion also, I guess, it sounds like for lack -- for simplifying it you\u2019re losing a customer that was probably overly discounted in the first place. So, would that have a favorable affect to your labor margin? So, if you go back to Brian\u2019s question about the 90 basis points of deleverage, would the fourth quarter be set up to in theory have less deleverage because you\u2019re getting less promotional activity? Gene Lee : No, that\u2019s exactly the opposite. Buy One Take One is a very, very profitable platform and it\u2019s not heavily discounted, because it is a prepared meal that\u2019s going home with the consumer and it goes home without soup, salad and breadsticks. So, the overall package -- it\u2019s very additive actually. So, it\u2019s a powerful driver -- guest driver and it\u2019s also on average, I believe it\u2019s an average type promotional construct. Matt DiFrisco : Glad I asked the question. With respect to the $15 million in 2019. Can you give us a little bit of detail on where that will be deployed? Is that just purely higher wages or in what -- or is it more hours in essence or more service for the customer? I\u2019m wondering what type of customer facing things are sales driving benefits they could have with that $15 million investment. Gene Lee : Yes. We\u2019re not -- as last quarter, we\u2019re not going to talk about the specifics of where those investment dollars are going to go. They\u2019re going to go to improve our overall experience for our guests or our team members. And for competitive reasons, we\u2019re not going to talk in a whole lot of detail about that. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Gregory Francfort : I had two questions. One is just on the -- I think, you gave a labor bridge in the presentation. And one of the components was just the productivity of new restaurants. Are your new stores, I guess mixing significantly lower on labor and maybe what are they doing differently than your existing stores are doing? And maybe can you apply some of those learnings to the existing stores? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Greg. This is Rick. The productivity is net of new restaurant. So, productivity was higher. We continue to add new restaurants into the mix. And when they come on board, they are not as efficient as they normally will be, as they move forward. So, productivity without new restaurants would have been higher than the 0.3 that we showed. Gregory Francfort : And then, maybe Gene a question for you. Just on the Cheddar\u2019s comps, I remember you\u2019re saying at ICR, the Cheddar\u2019s comps would probably be negative for a while. But, it seems like this is mostly driven by franchise stores coming on the books and you guys maybe taking the average check down. Can you help me understand how you\u2019re thinking about how the Cheddar\u2019s business plays out in terms of comps? And maybe when this drag goes away from the franchise stores that have come on? Is that sort of early \u201819 sort of a dynamic or is that kind of an ongoing process? Gene Lee : I think, it\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s an ongoing process. And when I look at the overall system, I think there is -- and I tried to allude to this in my prepared comments. This is a complex business; it\u2019s doing a lot of guests. And we believe after being involve now for almost the year, simplification is the key. We\u2019ve got to simplify the processes. In the restaurants that we\u2019ve recently acquired, I think we\u2019re really focused on the fundamentals. We\u2019re focused on getting -- continuing to develop great general managers in these businesses. We have some staffing challenges in the restaurants that we\u2019ve acquired recently. So, I think about getting back to basics and making sure we have the right management team in place, we have the right number of employees scheduled at the right time. I think one of the things that we\u2019ve learned in this is when you buy a small franchisee where their owners aren\u2019t financiers, but they\u2019re really the operating owners and they operate the business and there is a lot of a motion is a heart and soul of these businesses. And when you remove them, you might have a little bit more turnover than you thought. You have a little bit -- you have some cultural issues. And it\u2019s going to take time to rebuild out and integrate those restaurants into a traditional corporate system. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re really going through. These restaurants that we bought, I think there is 10 or 11 of them in Georgia. These are really high volume restaurants. And even with the significant decline, they\u2019re still at the system average after this. So, we\u2019re really excited about the opportunity to get in there. We have excess to resources in Atlanta, because of our huge base in our other businesses. So, it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. But, I would say that when we look at it, we\u2019re more optimistic today than were we bought the business about the opportunity. So, we believe we can have a significant impact on basic restaurant operations and improve the overall delivery and get the experience to the consumer. I can\u2019t put a time table on it for you. You just need to know that we\u2019re working really hard doing these basic things. As I say, we\u2019re almost through the integration. Next year, we won\u2019t be talking about the integration. The management won\u2019t be even referring to integration of the restaurants. They\u2019ll be going to systems they know. So, I think we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. But, we\u2019re really excited about where we\u2019re at and what the opportunities are. Operator : The next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Fred Wightman : Hey, guys. It\u2019s actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. In the past, you\u2019d taken sort of a wait and see approach to any consumer benefits from the tax reform. Now that we\u2019re starting to see some increases in paychecks and take home pay and you\u2019ve talked about sort of that higher check average across the industry, do you think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re seeing a tax benefit at the consumer level? Gene Lee : I think, it\u2019s way too early to say that. And I would, again, based on the fact, the last three weeks we haven\u2019t had a week where we haven\u2019t had a significant interruption into our business because of weather. And so, I think it\u2019s my belief it\u2019ll take time for this extra incentive to get into -- get into our overall system, into our economy. But it\u2019s got to be good news as how much of it flows to us. And I\u2019ll go back to the well-positioned brands with great value equations are going to benefit. And I think that when I look at our portfolio, I think we have the opportunity to benefit from this. Fred Wightman : Great. And then for that $15 million of investment next year, what\u2019s the cadence going to be like? Should that all hit in 1Q or should we see a 50-50 split, sort of like we saw this year? Rick Cardenas : Fred, it\u2019s Rick. It should be spread pretty consistently throughout the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Penney from Hedge. Your line is now open. Howard Penney : Thank you for the question. My question is also in the Olive Garden promotional change. In the past, when you\u2019ve changed promotion for previous -- the other brands and I\u2019m thinking about LongHorn, you may have compromised traffic trends in a certain quarter, but it significantly improved profitability because of the change in the promotional cadence, would you expect that too for Olive Garden? Gene Lee : No. I think, we\u2019ve seen some of that throughout the year as we\u2019ve changed the cadence. I wouldn\u2019t expect at this point in time anything dramatically to change. LongHorn was a little bit different. We were coming off a deep value platform and going to a different type of offer. This is -- we\u2019re still in the same value range, it\u2019s just a different type of promotion. And we\u2019re -- we know that Buy One Take One was very, very successful. We believe that we are overexposing it. And just like Neverending Pasta, we only run that once a year. We need to run Buy One Take One once a year. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect the big swing in profitability because of this change. Now where the profitability does come into play, as we move from 9 to 6 is from a labor standpoint. A0nd we\u2019re moving less product around. We\u2019re having less all team meetings to roll out new product. So that\u2019s been embedded in our P&L throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel. Your line is now open. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I had a follow-up to that last question. Gene, what have you seen in the data that causes you to be concerned that the Buy One Take One could be at risk of being overexposed? And I believe we are lapping that promotion right now. So, is that true and are there any other comparison issues we should think about for the quarter? Gene Lee : No, we are -- you are correct. We\u2019re lapping that promotion from last year. I think it was more just our intuition that told us that long-term you\u2019ve got to protect the integrity of these promotions over time. And this is a great promotion. And we wanted to have its traffic drivability to continue on. And if you -- we know if we run it 16 weeks a year, it\u2019s going to lose some of its effectiveness. So, to me it\u2019s -- when you think about Neverending Pasta Bowl, it\u2019s a great promotion, but you got to run it once a year and you\u2019ve got to enjoy it once going on. And then, you\u2019ve got to take it away. To make it powerful, it\u2019s got to -- it can\u2019t be there all the time. Chris O\u2019Cull: And then, Rick, thanks for the explanation on the G&A increase year-over-year. But, it looks like it\u2019s still -- you\u2019re running higher than the trend would suggest. Any other explanations for the G&A increase in the quarter and how much of the G&A increase do you expect to reoccur in the fourth? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Chris. As we said, mark-to-market was about $5.5 million. And the workforce investment didn\u2019t just impact the restaurant labor line, it also impacted G&A $2 million to $3 million. So, if you take those things out, we\u2019re pretty -- we weren\u2019t that off where we were in Q2. So, we can\u2019t predict the stock market. So, we can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen in the fourth quarter on mark-to-market. But the workforce investment in the fourth quarter should be similar to what it was in the third quarter in the G&A line. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Andrew Strelzik : I wanted to ask a question on the in-store business at Olive Garden. If I kind of back out the numbers you gave on off-premise, it seems like the in-store business was relatively flat, which is similar to the industry. Is that something that you\u2019re okay with? It just seems like -- I know you\u2019re taking less price but it seems like relative to the industry, the in-store business has been, the gap has been narrowing. And have you seen any change to the trade-off among in-store and off-premise as you saw -- continue to see the strong growth there? Gene Lee : I would say that -- obviously, we\u2019re thrilled in-restaurant business is continuing. I think it actually grew, they\u2019re holding up all sign across the table here saying our in-store restaurant actually did grow a little bit, which is fantastic. And I think the analysis that you made was compared to the industry -- were equal to the industry. Well, the industry has got a lot of takeout growth in it too. So that\u2019s really not a fair comparison. However, we\u2019re focused on it in its totality. And when we think about Olive Garden, our goal is to deliver Olive Garden experience to people when and where they want it. We understand convenience is a big need state today. And so, we look at it in its totality. So, I guess, I would go to a day like Valentine\u2019s Day, when there is no room to dine in Olive Garden, because we\u2019re so busy; it\u2019s our busiest takeout day of the year. And so, we\u2019re able to deliver an Olive Garden experience to the consumer in a way they want it. They can\u2019t get into the restaurant; they\u2019re going to take it home. So, I think trying to isolate the two different need states is I think on the stake. And we got to look at it in its totality. There is definitely a continued focus on off-premise. We\u2019re trying to maximize our opportunity there. But, we are really focused on making sure we\u2019re creating a great in-restaurant experience because that\u2019s the biggest part of our business. And our research tells us, the consumer is still looking for a great in-restaurant experience; and those who provide it, will continue to win. Andrew Strelzik : I appreciate the perspective on that. If I could squeeze one more in on LongHorn actually. You\u2019ve seen price increases have been a bit lower the last couple of quarters, at the same time the mix has been ticking up. Is that a conscious decision on the pricing to manage the check growth and should we expect kind of a similar construct of check growth kind of as we progress... Gene Lee : We are definitely trying to continue to create value to increasing the quality of the product in LongHorn and also watching what we\u2019re doing from a pricing standpoint. The mix is coming from a couple of components. It\u2019s coming from our simplification and we\u2019re actually selling more add-ons. But, the biggest part of it is a reduction in discounting. And as we reduce our discounting pressure, our menu mix goes positive, which is just another form of creating value for the guest. So, when I look at the LongHorn mix for the quarter, 2%, 0.7 [ph] price, flat guest counts and I\u2019m doing -- we\u2019re doing this with a lot less discounting, I feel really good. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. I was curious about that the chain versus independent share dynamic. What you guys are seeing? And I asked this question in the context of there being some significantly conflicting data that\u2019s out there of whether -- who\u2019s taking share versus who\u2019s chains or independent. So, I wanted to get your thought on that. And also, if there\u2019s somewhat of an outlook on 2018 and 2019 as you guys have been through many different cycles before which side the pendulum switches in your opinion, chains or independents? Gene Lee : Yes. I am been briefed recently on the recent CREST data. And again, CREST data is directional. But, what we\u2019re seeing is large chains and independents picking up a little share and small chains actually donating that share. And so, that\u2019s the most recent trend. Not a huge swing. I mean, we\u2019re talking 10, 15, 20 basis points. There is not a lot of movement. But, it does seem like it\u2019s coming on the small chains with large chains and independents growing. As far as -- as we look into the future, I mean, that\u2019s hard -- I do think that the large players continue to have an advantage from a cost standpoint, from an advertising standpoint and will continue to -- should continue to take share, if we manage our businesses effectively. John Ivankoe : And I asked this question also, Gene, just in the context of smaller, even one-off restaurants that have a better ability to market before and there is also a lot of discussion about there being some generational preferences for -- like the truly independent owner operator type of restaurants. So, but again, just relying on your experience in this case. Do you think that\u2019s true in 2018 or 2019 or if there\u2019s still a broadened swap of that population that appreciates a high level of consistency that just the overall industry, not necessarily Olive Garden and LongHorn can hold on to that share? Gene Lee : Yes. Two thoughts, first of all, the independent growth, there\u2019s a coastal problem. It\u2019s happening on the coast; it\u2019s not really happening as much in Middle America. And secondly, I think that we\u2019re also at the top end of cycle. I think we saw this in \u201805, \u201806 and \u201807 where there\u2019s a lot of capital out there for people to open independent restaurants. And usually, independent growth slows down as that capital slows down. And a lot of these restaurants cannot withstand any type of shock. And as we saw in 2009 and 2010 and most a lot of them fell out. So, I think as we look forward, I think a lot is going to depend on the overall economic environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Anderson from Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Stephen Anderson : Yes. Good morning. I wanted to discuss Cheddar\u2019s. And I thought you gave guidance on fiscal \u201819 CapEx. Do you have any kind of estimate as with regard to what you would like to spend to renovate some of the older Cheddar\u2019s that are out there? On the franchise side, there is still a lot older units that may not up to the current prototype? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes. I think, one of the things that we\u2019re most impressed with Cheddar\u2019s is the durability of their buildings. They\u2019ve got a great design that\u2019s been able to stand the test of time. And I don\u2019t think that -- there is not any type of remodel program that is needed. There is a little bit of refresh. We got to do some signage, changes. But for the most part, the buildings that we have bought are in great condition. We do have some transformational work in the kitchen with some new equipment that we\u2019re reporting into some restaurants and there will be some capital there, but that\u2019s minimal. Operator : The next question comes from Jeremy Scott from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Jeremy Scott : Maybe just high level. I was wondering when we have a quarter like this with so many different weather events, how your takeout business performs and maybe you can -- I realize the 70 bps impact is across the board. But, just wondering, your comment that weather has in fact bigger impact today than it is five years ago, because of the media focus, some of that offset by the fact that you\u2019ve now laid the pipes primarily at Olive Garden to reach the customer\u2019s home. And then any changes in your thought process around delivery? Gene Lee : Yes. First of all, I\u2019ll -- a lot in that question. But, I always say that weather hasn\u2019t helped us from a takeout standpoint either. I mean, it\u2019s -- we get to a certain point with this weather pattern that we\u2019re in where restaurants are close. We can\u2019t do takeout of a close. We take the safety of our team members very, very seriously and we close our restaurants, so that the takeout is not there. The second part of the question around our attitude towards delivery. I would say that we have focused on Olive Garden on a large party catering. We see that as a huge opportunity. We\u2019re in the beginning parts of really starting to develop that. We are, again, as I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re focused on these. The average order side is $300. As we continue to grow that business, it has some impact. We\u2019re still talking with a lot of third-party delivery companies trying to understand how this is all going to shake out. And we\u2019re testing, doing our own delivery. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of things happening right now. And we\u2019ll continue to analyze it and we\u2019ll make the right decision for our business. And we have the right -- we have enough information that leads us to a conclusion. Jeremy Scott : Have you seen takeout growth in any of your other brands? I think, LongHorn the last time you mentioned was half of Olive Garden. How is that trended in the last couple of quarters? Gene Lee : Yes. We\u2019re obviously seeing good takeout growth in all of our brands, especially LongHorn as the consumer demands convenience. And so, it\u2019s a significant part of the growth story in all of our businesses. But we\u2019re focused -- we still believe, we\u2019re focused on maximize the opportunity in Olive Garden, because the food travel is so well. And we have unique packaging. We have a unique product offering. And so, there is a lot more focus on really growing that. I would say in other businesses, we\u2019re going with the demand of the consumer and we think that\u2019s the place to be. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Brian Vaccaro : Thank you. Good morning. Gene, I wanted to follow up on John\u2019s industry question and also get your perspective on industry supply growth. It seems to be some indications that we\u2019re finally seeing some rationalization in recent quarters. And curious if that\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019re seeing and hearing from your teams in the field, and also your view on supply growth over the next couple of years. Gene Lee : On supply growth, I think what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re seeing some rationalization and we\u2019re seeing some good growth. So, we\u2019re -- the last CREST data, I saw and it was recent was that we\u2019re basically a net -- no increase in restaurant growth year-over-year. But what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re seeing the weaker players start to close some restaurants; we\u2019re seeing some independents fall out; then, we\u2019re seeing new restaurants come back in. And the restaurant brands that are growing are strong and they are growing for a reason. So, the example I like to use is when you open a yard house and we do $8.5 million in sales, we didn\u2019t create $8.5 million in sales in that marketplace, we stole that $8.5 million; it\u2019s been redistributed. And so, as we see these stronger players continue to open, it does put some additional pressure on the business. I will tell you that the one thing I\u2019ve noticed in the last 12 months or so which gives me confidence that the environment is somewhat improving is that our new restaurants are performing better. And it does feed into our belief that we\u2019ve got to continue to build restaurants closer to where people live. They may be a little less likely to travel distances that they used to travel, especially to some of these malls, lose their drawing power. But, we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised to the upside how well our new restaurants are opening. And that tells me a little bit about where we are economically. Brian Vaccaro : That\u2019s helpful. And then, just two quick follow-ups, if I could. Rick, the cadence of the tax savings reinvestment, clearly we saw $9 million in the third quarter, $11 million expected in the fourth quarter. As we think about sort of the year on year impact, wouldn\u2019t the $15 million be sort of front-end loaded in fiscal 2019 or I\u2019m not thinking about that correctly? Gene Lee : The $15 million wouldn\u2019t be front-end loaded in 2019, but we had no investments last year or this fiscal year in Q1 and Q2. So, we will see an increase. So, if you think about the $20 million that we made this year, just assume that\u2019s going to flow naturally through next year and then the $15 million will also start flowing naturally through next year, so. Brian Vaccaro : Got it. Okay, perfect. And then, last one for me, the weather that you\u2019ve seen in March, if you assume to April and May sort of normalized year on year, obviously not knock on wood, but how much of a weather headwind for the fourth quarter would that equate to? Would it be\u2026 Gene Lee : That\u2019s all incorporated in our guidance today. Again, we\u2019re hoping that -- you all in New York saw your last storm yesterday. We said that last week too. Weather is out of our control and there\u2019s nothing we can -- we don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019re focused on running great restaurants; when we have a weather event, we\u2019re focused on ensuring our people are safe. And I think, as Rick said in his statement -- his comments, we saw more of a normalized winter through the third quarter. I mean -- and when get to the end of February and we looked at it, this is a normal winter. We\u2019ve got the benefit of a couple mild winters in the past couple of years. March may turn that upside down a little bit, but we\u2019ll give you some color in that in the fourth quarter when March is done. Operator : The last question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Matt DiFrisco : I just had a question with respect to the off-premise sales. I think you said it was about 13% or so. Is that got delivery in there? I\u2019ve seen you guys pop up a little bit more on Grubhub with Olive Garden and Yard House and some other brands, just curious, if you can give some comments on that. Gene Lee : Yes, Matt. That\u2019s inclusive of all off-premise. And, yes, you are seeing us pop up either via test or we don\u2019t know that we\u2019re participating with them. They have a way of just taking the menus and marketing products. So yes, that\u2019s inclusive of anything, 13%. And I thought the number that\u2019s impressive was 15% of our total sales for the quarter were from takeout. Matt DiFrisco : So, you don\u2019t have an agreement then with Olive Garden and Grubhub? They are just taking you and listening you on there? Gene Lee : Well, it depends. In some markets we do. And yes, I mean, there is a little Wild Wild West out there right now. Operator : Thank you, speakers. We show no further questions at this time. Kevin Kalicak : All right. Thank you. That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 21st before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Aubrey. Good morning and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO, and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings on September 20th before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will discuss our quarterly performance and business highlights and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from both the fourth quarter and the full year before providing our outlook for fiscal 2019. During today\u2019s call, all references to Darden\u2019s same-restaurant sales only include Darden\u2019s legacy brands. We will begin including Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen restaurants and our blended same restaurant sales figure in the first quarter of our new fiscal year. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. As you see from our press release this morning, we had another solid quarter to wrap up a strong fiscal 2018 for Darden. Total sales from continuing operations during the quarter were $2.1 billion, an increase of 10.3%. Same-restaurant sales for the quarter increased 2.2%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.39, an increase of 17.8% from last year. Our strategy remains unchanged. Our operating teams are focused on becoming brilliant with the basics. They continue to create exceptional guest experiences by delivering outstanding food, drinks and service and an inviting atmosphere. And at the Darden level, we continue to strengthen and leverage our four competitive advantages; one, our significant scale that creates cost advantages, two, our extensive data and insights that improve operating fundamentals and help us better understand our guest and communicate with them more effectively. Three, the rigorous strategic planning process that our brands cycle through on a regular basis and four, our results oriented people culture which enables growth. All of Darden had a very good quarter. Total sales grew 4% and same restaurant sales grew 2.4%, the 50th [ph] consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden by 190 basis points. Same-restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 270 basis points. For fiscal 2018, Olive Garden total sales increased 3.7% to $4.1 billion. Congratulations to the Olive Garden team members for achieving this significant milestone. Olive Garden\u2019s momentum as a result of our strategy to drive frequency among core guests. The success of this strategy is driven by flawless execution of the guest experience and continued simplification in our restaurants, craveable Italian food and beverage that appeals to our loyal guests, marketing that reaches the right target at the right time on the right channel with the right message and our ongoing commitment to improving convenience for our guest by focusing on the off-premise experience. Our simplification efforts have allowed us to reduce our promotional calendar, which limits the amount of new activity in our restaurants, enabling our management teams to spend their time focused on execution. As a result, our restaurant teams continue to drive guest satisfaction to new all-time highs. The promotional calendar simplification also enables us to increase our marketing efforts beyond limited time offers and into long-term growth drivers. During the quarter, we continued our everyday value advertising and emphasized week-day lunch messaging that strengthened our lunch trends. Additionally, this quarter we showcase craveable Italian food that appeals to our loyal guests with our big Italian classics promotion. Giant Stuffed fettuccine and the giant meatball provided compelling value and were well received by our guests. Finally, off-premise sales grew 9% and represented 13.8% of total sales for the quarter, further demonstrating the momentum in this area, Technomic recognized Olive Garden with its 2018 consumer\u2019s choice award for best take out experience in the full service segment. Overall, I am very pleased with Olive Garden\u2019s performance. The business momentum is strong, driven by a strategy that is working and we will continue to make the appropriate investments in our team members and our guests. LongHorn Steakhouse had a strong quarter as well. Total sales grew 4.9%, four times the rate of growth of the industry excluding Darden. Same restaurant sales grew 2.4%, the 21st consecutive quarter of growth outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 190 basis points and same restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 280 basis points. LongHorn\u2019s performance is being driven by the team\u2019s inherence to a long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging LongHorn\u2019s unique operating culture. The impact of this strategic focus was recognized when LongHorn received the 2018 consumer\u2019s choice award from Technomic for having the most loyal customers in the full-service segment. This recognition is a strong testament to the great work our operations teams are doing to drive consistent execution and create memorable guest experiences. The LongHorn team continues to make meaningful stride reducing operational complexity. This quarter, we made more reductions in our core menu offerings and our operating processes were further simplified. Additionally, we made our limited time offers less complicated and easier for our teams to implement. This continuous improvement is resulting in better execution. Finally, our emphasis on the culture and focus on team member engagement continues to pay off as evidenced by LongHorn\u2019s industry-leading retention rates at both the manager and on a team member level. Our Fine Dining brands, The Capital Grille and Eddie V's delivers strong quarter with same restaurant sales growth of 2.6% and 3.6% respectively, both brands have distinctive positioning and consistently deliver exceptional dining experiences. The Capital Grille\u2019s increasing capacity in select restaurants to provide additional flexibility for large parties, while Eddie V's is focused on developing the talent needed to support growth. And we remain excited about its future growth potential. Yard House had another good quarter with positive same restaurant sales of 1.4%. The team increased its focus on operational simplification to create consistently great experiences and made significant improvements in both cost of goods sold and labor productivity. And we are pleased with the performance of our new restaurants and believe in continued growth of this brand. Yard House is broadly appealing with four distinct day parts that allow us to meet a variety of guest occasions. Bahama Breeze delivered positive same restaurant sales growth of 0.6%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth. Our guests come to Bahama Breeze for fun, which is why our restaurant teams continue to create a fun island experience amplified by events such as the successful VIVA LA 'RITA event that took place during the quarter. The brand is uniquely positioned in the marketplace and continues to resonate extremely well with millennials. Seasons 52 generated same restaurant sales growth of 0.4% during the quarter. We took steps to broaden our appeal by improving the value perception. For example, we featured a limited time three course offering that allowed guest to choose a starter, an entr\u00e9e and a mini indulgence for a fixed price. This improved our value perceptions and contributed to a 2.1% traffic increase for the quarter. As we continue to enhance value, the value equation, I am confident that this entr\u00e9e brand is poised to capture more guest visits over the long-term. Now, I\u2019ll update you on Cheddar\u2019s. The Cheddar\u2019s restaurants that we own and operate today were fragmented into three different businesses a year ago, each with different systems, policies and pricing structures. While same restaurant sales declined 4.7 for the quarter, the original company restaurants were down 3.3%, while the acquired franchise restaurants were down 7%. During the fourth quarter, integration activity peaked as we transitioned the Darden proprietary point-of-sale system. As we push the integration process to completion, it became apparent the team was losing focus on the basic operating fundamentals; therefore we decided to spend -- to spend marketing and promotional activities. We believe this was the correct decision even though we are rolling over a period of heavy promotional activities last year prior to and immediately after we closed the acquisition. With the integration now complete, we are fully focused on rebuilding the operational foundation and the team has three priorities. One, staff our restaurants, there\u2019s an opportunity in many restaurants to increase management and team member staffing and scheduling more effectively; master the new tools, although the integration is complete the team now has to learn how to use these tools to improve operational effectiveness. As with past acquisitions, this will take time; three, simplify. This is a complex operation that must be simplified in order to improve execution. The team is making progress quickly, but we need to test these changes to ensure we get the desired outcome. We recently asked Paul Veri [ph], a veteran operations leader who experienced first-hand the process of mastering the Darden systems during the LongHorn integration, to lead the operations team at Cheddar\u2019s. With his in-depth knowledge of the Darden systems and his track record of operational success, we are confident he will have a positive impact quickly. Cheddar\u2019s is the value leader in casual dining, and the average restaurant serves more than 6000 guests per week. I believe the leadership team has the right plan in place to improve operating fundamentals and I remain extremely confident that Cheddar\u2019s will add significant value to Darden over the long-term. In closing, I am very pleased with the progress we made against our strategic initiatives throughout fiscal 2018 and our performance continues to reinforce our belief that we have the right strategy in place. I want to say thank you to our 180,000 team members who bring our brands to like every day in our restaurants and who support our restaurant teams from here and our restaurant support center. We know our team members are our greatest asset and I\u2019m confident we will continue to win our remaining focus on being brilliant with the basics as we pursue our mission to make, of making every guest loyal. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter with total sales growth of 10.3%, driven by 8.1% growth from a full quarter of Cheddar\u2019s sales and the addition of 35 net new restaurants at our legacy brands, and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.2%. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were a $1.39, an increase of 17.8% from last year. This quarter, we paid $79 million in dividends and repurchased $27 million in shares, returning a total of $106 million of capital to our shareholders. Looking at the P&L this quarter compared to last year, food and beverage was favorable 60 basis points as pricing, cost savings and synergies more than offset commodities inflation of just below 1%. Restaurant labor was unfavorable -- favorable 90 basis points as continued wage pressures, workforce investment and Cheddar\u2019s brand mix offset pricing and productivity gains. Restaurant expense was 40 basis points favorable due to sales leverage and workers compensation expenses. G&A was favorable 40 basis points driven by sales leverage and a reduction in the mark-to-market of our deferred compensation liability and other equity programs. And we recorded a $4.5 million impairment during the quarter, the bulk of which were attributed to certain restaurant locations. As a result, EBIT margin expanded 30 basis points above last year and absolute EBIT grew 12.9%. Our 20.4% effective tax rate in the quarter was 290 basis points favorable to last year\u2019s rate due to tax reform, partially offset by the tax impact of our deferred compensation hedge. Turning to our segment performance, Olive Garden and the Fine Dining segment both grew sales this quarter, driven by a positive same restaurant sales and net new restaurants. Segment profit margin increased in these segments even after the incremental workforce investments. By leveraging same restaurant sales growth and managing costs effectively. LongHorn\u2019s segment sales also grew this quarter, driven by positive same restaurant sales and net new restaurants. Segment profit margin was 19%. Adjusting for the workforce investments, LongHorn\u2019s segment profit margin would have been 30 basis points higher than last year. Looking at the other business segment, total sales grew 38.9% due to a full quarter of Cheddar\u2019s sales in both same restaurant sales and new restaurant growth at the other brands. Similar to last quarter, segment profit margin was 170 basis points lower than last year, due to the brand mix impact of adding Cheddar\u2019s and for moving consumer packaged goods out of this segment, primarily to Olive Garden. Fiscal 2018 was another great year of progress as our brands continued leveraging the power of Darden\u2019s competitive advantages resulting in double-digit total sales EBIT and EPS growth. Total sales grew 12.7% to $8.1 billion, and EBIT grew 10.2%. These results coupled with tax reform resulted in adjusted EPS growth of 19.7% while investing $20 million into our workforce. Other accomplishments during fiscal 2018 included, returning over a $0.5 billion to shareholders consisting of $314 million in dividends and $235 million in share repurchases, realizing approximately $10 million of cost synergies from the Cheddar\u2019s acquisition, completing the rollout and integration of systems to all Cheddar\u2019s location and issuing $300 million of new 30 year debt at 4.55% replacing $311 million of our outstanding notes tendered that had higher interest coupons. This morning, we also announced that our board approved a 19% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $0.75 per share, which results in a yield of 3.2% based on yesterday\u2019s closing share price. And finally, yesterday our Board of Directors also approved a new share repurchase authorization for up to $500 million of Darden\u2019s outstanding common stock. This replaces the previous plan and does not have an expiration date. Now that we\u2019ve wrapped up another year, I want to take a moment and remind you of our long-term value creation framework we introduced in December of calendar 2015. This framework called for a 10% to 15% total shareholder return assuming a constant earnings multiple. Looking back, investors who bought our stock at the beginning of fiscal 2016 reinvested all dividends in Darden\u2019s stock and held to the end of the fiscal 2018 earned an average annual total shareholder return of 18%. And looking back over any 10 fiscal year period, since becoming a public company, we have consistently achieved or exceeded our targeted total shareholder return range. As we look to the future, we will still target a 10% to 15% total shareholder return, but are making two minor modifications to the framework. First, we are updating the targeted EBIT margin expansion range to be 10 to 30 basis points. This reflects the fact that we\u2019ve already expanded EBIT margin by more than 200 basis points in the last three years. Second, we increased the share repurchase range to be between $150 million and $250 million. This change reflects our growing free cash flow and the significant share price appreciation since the introduction of our framework. Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2019, we anticipate total sales growth to be between 4% and 5% driven by same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 45 to 50 new restaurants. Capital spending between $425 million and $475 million, total inflation of approximately 2% with 0% to 1% commodities inflation and 3.5% to 4.5% of total labor inflation, which includes approximately 5% hourly wage inflation. Total run rate investments of $35 million related to tax reform primarily in our workforce. Incremental synergies related to the Cheddar\u2019s acquisition of approximately $13 million and annual effective tax rate of between 11% and 12% and approximately 125 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulted -- resulting in a diluted net earnings per share between $5.40 and $5.56. And with that, we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please proceed. Sara Senatore : Great, thank you very much. Just a couple of questions about more on really about the demand environment and then maybe LongHorn in particular. You know it feels like there\u2019s obviously a lot of really dramatic price point promotions out there. You talked a lot about being brilliant at the basics, but given that you were lapping Buy One, Take One, can you just talk a little bit about what you saw in terms of your mix at Olive and then perhaps at LongHorn very good comp, but the other, some of the other big Steakhouse\u2019s maybe comped a bit better, so could you talk about the dynamic in that category as well? Thank you. Gene Lee : Good morning, Sara. You know I think about the demand in the space right now, we saw some improvement in April in the benchmarks, maybe fell off a little bit. I would describe the environment as volatile week-to-week, but overall, the demand has been fairly good for the casual dining brands that are well positioned with strong value propositions. In your question you brought up the fact that there are some folks, other brands out there heavily discounting and are being very promotional. We\u2019ll see, we think that that\u2019s not the right place to be right now. We are very pleased with how we \u2013 we lapped Olive Garden in the fourth quarter. We thought they had a very very strong quarter. On the LongHorn side, the LongHorn two year stock was approximately 6%, and one of the things that I like where we are in LongHorn right now is we\u2019ve been able to really pull back on some of the incentives that we\u2019ve been, we\u2019ve had in the marketplace not really like our profitability. I really like our margins structure comparative to the other Steakhouse players. So you know sometimes the headline same restaurant sales numbers not all -- all is not the entire piece of the puzzle. I like to look at the whole business model. I am thrilled with LongHorn\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter and a two year stack and you have to remember in LongHorn these are very small boxes that our strategy is that we maximize the blocks and then build another restaurant three miles down the road and that\u2019s how we ended up with 45 restaurants in Atlanta, Georgia. Sara Senatore : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please proceed. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning and congrats on another good year. My question is about -- I have a couple of questions about the guidance for 2019. So first on the comps outlook of 1% to 2% I think your long-term range when you shared originally it was comps of 1% to 3% and you consistently either have been in the middle or maybe towards the higher end of that, and just wondering why the guidance for 2019 kind of anchors on the path of that range in light of your comments about the environment being better. And then secondly, yes it doesn\u2019t -- I guess given your tax rate guidance it doesn\u2019t really seem to suggest that at least at the midpoint that you are expecting much margin expansion or you know relative to that 10 to 30 basis points targeted. I\u2019m -- just explain kind of why you might not get a lot of margin expansion in 2019? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yes, David this is Rick. On the comps, the reason that we are at the lower half of our guidance range is as Kevin mentioned on the beginning of the call we are including Cheddar\u2019s next year in our total comp. And as Gene mentioned, we still have some things to go through on the learning of the integration. I mean, we would expect Cheddar\u2019s to be on the lower end of that range, so that would bring us down from what we\u2019ve finished this year a little above 2%. So that\u2019s where we on the comp side. On the margin side, the real difference, the real reason that we be either at the lower end or have very little margin growth next year is the additional workforce investments we are making and based on the tax reform, which actually helps on the tax line. So we\u2019ve got those two things, we\u2019ve got the workforce investment, and actually we are pricing well below our inflation, as you think about what we talked about our pricing ranges normally, and our inflation ranges so both of those things should cause our margins to be at the lower end of our range. David Tarantino : Great, great. And Rick, just one follow-up, the workforce investments. I think the incremental amount is around $50 and did I hear you correctly that the shutters integration savings would be roughly in that same ballpark. So I guess is it more the latter factor that you mentioned around that pricing to cover inflation that\u2019s driving that outlook? Rick Cardenas : Yes, it\u2019s more of the latter. If you think about pricing and as we\u2019ve said our strategy is to -- is to leverage Darden\u2019s scale, price below inflation, which we\u2019ve done for the last few years and we expect to do that next year. David Tarantino : Great. Makes sense. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer & Company. You may now proceed. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning. In the quarter, now that it\u2019s over and you can go back and look back at the results. Is there any way you can tell us what the effect of not running the promotion had on sales and on COGS margins? And then I have a follow up. Gene Lee : Very purposely on this, you know, we all I will say is that our team did a great job of implementing a new promotion to laugh over the Buy One, Take One. And as you can see by our results, we had, we had a very strong quarter. The other comment I would make about the quarter and the promotional strategy and the advertising strategy is that and I said this in my script. We have made the choice to invest some dollars into brand marketing away from promotional activity, which we -- where we believe will drive overall, enhance the brand overall, but is not as effective as your pure promotional advertising. And we think we saw some of that benefit in the quarter of the investments we\u2019ve been making in, the value platforms and advertising that. And so, again I\u2019m very pleased. I think the team did a great job getting you know of lapping one of our most popular promotions, which we had run for an extended period of time earlier in the year. And so the total number of weeks of exposure for that promotion were down, but not down real significantly. So \u2013 the team did a great and we're very pleased with the overall results. Brian Bittner : Okay. Thanks Gene. And Rick just two questions for you. One on the quarter; the OpEx on a current unit basis was actually down year-over-year. Can you unpack that a little bit more for us? And then, on the 2019 earnings guidance, following up on David's question, is there like specific operating margin range you want us to think about for 2019? Is it like flat to 20 basis points instead of 10 to 30? Any help on that would be great. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Brian, I'll start with the second question. I would say you're probably closer to flat to 20 basis points than on the higher end of that range as the follow-up to the question. And if you look at our restaurant expense line, it's primarily workers comp difference versus unpacking anything else. But the big driver of the drop in restaurant OpEx is workers comp and the synergies that we've gotten from the Cheddar's acquisition. Brian Bittner : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays. Please proceed. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two just broader questions on the industry. One, Gene, I'm just wondering as you get to look at so many different brands and you said you seemed like the casual dinning industry is seeing some healthier demand trends. And I'm just wondering maybe you could talk a little bit about the sustainability or what you think of the drivers? I know in the past you've talked about when the consumer gets a benefit from whether it would be tax reform are lower guest prices that end up seeing the benefit in mix. But yet seems like this go around, mix is relatively flat. You saw a nice uptick in traffic. I'm just wondering if you kind of parse through what you think are the drivers of that? And the second question was just on the industry. As we look to 2019 I know you're guiding to 1% to 2%, I'm wondering what you're assuming in that for the broader industry, because it does seem like your comp gap has narrowed over the past number of quarters. I'm wondering whether you see that narrowing further in fiscal 2019 or how comfortable you are with the potential gap as we think about 2019? Thank you. Gene Lee : Jeff. This is a lot in there. Again, it's hard to predict the future demand in our space. We have tendency to want to look back at the past as a predictor of the future. More discretionary income for the consumer should be good for restaurants, and I'll keep coming up to. Should we good for the well-positioned that have strong brand propositions and have strong value equations all throughout the menu? I still think that the consumer does not want to be told what they have to purchase in your restaurant to get value. They want value in everything that they purchased and that's why these promotional constructs are somewhat \u2013 I don't think it's as effective as they have been in the past. Now, as far as our gap and how to think about that, I think that we've had a very good sustained performance of \u2013 out performance of the industry. And when we think about it what we're really focused on is how do we invest in our businesses to ensure that we can hit a long-term framework over time of 1% to 3% same restaurant sales growth. And were not trying to maximize the quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year, and there are times when we really need to make investments to ensure that our value perceptions improving and is better than is better than our competitors. And that's what our focus is. When we think about our guidance for next year, I'll just reiterate, I think what Rick was trying to get across is, we expect Cheddars to be a little bit of a drag to our other brands and have an impact. And that's why that we're down at 1% to 2%. And at this point in time we believe we have the right recipe, no pun intended to really improve the operations in the Cheddar's system and drive same-restaurant sales. But we all know that trying to drive same-restaurant sales to operational improvements takes more time than coming up with an advertising promotional and advertising gimmick to the drive sales. We want to build the foundation that can move this business forward and sustainable for the long-term. And that is our plan and we're going to stick to it. And so that's how -- that's when we think about our guidance. That's what's was impacting it. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Palmer, RBC. You may now proceed. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a follow-up. About Olive Garden, assuming that comp gap to the industry has been hit by not running not only the Buy One Take One, but fewer promotions throughout fiscal 2018. I know you're trying to simplify and improve everyday value. But could you maybe give us some numbers or anecdotes about why this strategy has been good or will be good for Olive Garden heading into fiscal 2019? And then I have a quick follow-up. Gene Lee : All right, David. I don't believe that going from nine promotions to six promotions had any impact on our comparable store sales throughout the quarter. We believe that simplifying a promotional construct allows us to execute at a much higher level, at the restaurant level. We believe that it takes some cost out of the overall system from a training standpoint, from a supply chain standpoint. Our belief that we as restaurateurs sometimes get bored with our own messaging faster than the consumer does when you look at the frequency of our consumer. So we believe this was a really important move in our simplification effort and we believe it had no impact on our overall same-restaurant sales for the year or the quarter. David Palmer : And then, back to Cheddar's, I know you're talking about using new tools and the staffing up and the simplification there. Lot of that sounds like stuff you've done before even at a greater scale with Olive Garden. What is your thought about the rate of improvement you can get with just these tools and the learning curve? Is it something of a six to 12 months nature? Gene Lee : Yes. I'm not going to put a timetable around it. Our challenges are significant here especially in the acquired franchise restaurants. And we had to weaken the base of the base restaurants by pulling human resources out of those restaurants that help staff, the acquired restaurants. I would say around this is you know they're in their 14th month of integration, which is really the low point. And even I think about where I was at and how I felt at the 14 month of integration when we were acquired. It wasn't a great place. And I talked, there's a few others on my team around what it was like. And we're thinking about that and trying to help the Cheddar's team really focus and get back to what we call, brilliant with the basics. We got a great team. We got great people. They all want to do the right things. We just need to ensure that we can help them, get those basics. And we're going to start with staffing. The turnover rates are too high. We're not fully staffed before we can make meaningful improvement in the overall guest experience. We're going to make meaningful improvement in the team member experience. So we're focus on those basic things. How long that's going to take? I don't know. Obviously when we start wrapping some of the weaker comparables, hopefully we can get back positive at that point in time. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort, Bank of America. Please proceed. Gregory Francfort : Hey, Gene, I just had a follow-up on the Cheddar's integration. Can you maybe walk back through your overall process of integrating the brand? And then just any expectation on like how you think about the relationship between total sales and comparable sales on a go forward basis? Gene Lee : Yes. At a high level when we think about integrations, it's really the first few months is you're assessing the work that you need to do. You bring a third-party to help manage the process and then you design the system. You got to design are our proprietary POS system which is the major change, which in the fourth quarter we had the biggest impact and the biggest impact was on the original own Cheddar's. We've done the franchise restaurants first. And then you start with the real \u2013 the first disrupter is the supply chain integration into our supply chain network, which is pretty invasive because when we think about it\u2019s the same product coming in, but the package size is different, the delivery times are different, how you account for, it's different. So there's just a lot of change. And then the big one is the POS system. And then from there when you implement the POS system you implementing all our productivity tools, and that's when you really impact the management because it's all brand new to them. And even though we partner them up with our other local restaurants; that's take time. It's going to take a year for them to become proficient on these new tools which are significantly better than the tools that they had and should improve productivity. And there was also -- we also have to make changed to all the benefits and programs and put them on our programs, which is disruptive. And I think from a human standpoint during this process what you think about is how this is going to impact you and you're really concerned about that. And that takes your focus away from everyday taking care of guests and taking care of team members. So that's really that the process. Remind me the second part of that question? Gregory Francfort : Second part was just, how you talked about total sales and comparable sales is playing out? How you think about that relationship going forward? Gene Lee : Yes. On that relationship going forward, I think that we believe in the relative share model and Cheddar's relative share in the markets in which they compete in is very low. And prior management had a \u2013 I was really adverse to adding a lot units into the marketplace because of the headline comp number. And the example I like to give is that we've got \u2013 we're doing over a $100 million in sales in Olive Garden in Orlando Florida and we're doing close to 22 or 23 million in Cheddar's. So the opportunity is for us to be able to do a lot more volume there which is going to put pressure on the headline number in these markets that we're growing out. And so we think long-term that the real focus on Cheddar's for us is going to be how do we grow top line sales by adding units and maintaining a relatively healthy comp number, but we can add 15 units to the Orlando market and expect comps to be solid. But we think by becoming more \u2013 by having a bigger relative share we will increase the overall profitability of the overall business. Gregory Francfort : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thanks you. Our next question comes from John Glass, Morgan Stanley. You may now proceed. John Glass : Thanks very much. Gene, at one time I'd heard you talk about LongHorn potentially being a national brand if you could sort of get the West Coast and California markets to work in particular. Where are you in that process of discovering whether that is feasible, and that you're able to more rapidly expand our West in particular? Gene Lee : I think we're within 24 months of having a couple restaurants open in the great state of California. John Glass : Okay, great. Thank you. And then, Rick, on the guidance and the reduced long-term framework of 10 to 30 basis points versus 20 to 40 in the past or 10 to 40 in the past. Is that just the function as you framed that is doing so much margin expansion you can get in this business? And you've already achieved a lot. Are you also factoring in just a higher level of reinvestment necessary in this business? You're factoring in that wages are structurally going to be in that four plus percent range? Are there other factors I guess, just what you've already done that impact your view on the lower margin expansion opportunities in the future? Rick Cardenas : Yes. There are a few other factors. As I said, we have taken -- we have increased our margins couple hundred basis points since we announced that framework. We've also taken significant cost out of our P&L. We continue to find other costs to take out, but we have been reinvesting a lot of that. Just to frame it, it's only a 10 basis reduction in the top end. So it still \u2013 it's only going from 40 basis points to 30. But as we've mentioned we continue to price below inflation. We put our price below our competition which is our strategy that put pressure on margins. And we use the Darden scale advantages to find other cost saves to help that. Wages are, as we said our hourly wage we have inflation of around 5% in our guidance for this year. And so that's why we're bringing that down. There's nothing structurally different other than wages are little bit higher. We are continuing to go after our strategy of pricing below our competition and pricing at a range that doesn't drive a whole lot of top line margin at the restaurant level. John Glass : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Will Slabaugh, Stephens Incorporated. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thanks for taking my question guys. And this is actually [Indiscernible] on for Will. And my first one is kind of around -- you continue to simplify operations at both Olive Garden and LongHorn, and specifically thinking about kind of LongHorn and removing the good amount of SKUs the last couple of quarters and yet comps have remained pretty impressive in the loyalty factor as well. And so, at many restaurants we've seen something similar done and it's become a drag on those businesses. What has allowed you to implement kind of these streamlining initiatives and continue grow same-store sales without bringing disruption to the in-restaurant operations? Gene Lee : Well, the way we think about this is the process from the back door to the table. How do we simplify all the procedures? How do we simplify the processes between the grill and the expediting station, and how we quickly get the food to the table? So we break it down into those areas. I think as we think about pure menu simplification, it's the art not the science. It\u2019s the art of being able to put a menu together that covers all the significant areas that your guest want to be covered without having a lot of products doing or working in the same ways and ensuring that you have unique interesting products in each of those categories. And if you do that, I think that you can create -- artfully create a menu that meets the consumer needs, but yet allows you to simplify your execution, so that you can execute that product at a really, really high level. And when we think about our industry no one has done this better than Hillstone. And for many, many years they've had a very limited menu and executed extremely high level. But if you ever study their menu, they do a wonderful job of hitting every possible area our consumer might want to dine. And I think that's what we're trying to do is, remove the duplicity in our menus with similar products really providing an opportunity for our guest to eat what they want but without having two choices in the same particular area. And that's where we're focused on. And we think there's still \u2013 we believe there's still lot of work to be done here. And so, at the end of the day, we need it to deliver on the food side, a product that's executed the way it's been designed to be executed with and being delivered extremely hot and favorable to the guest. And that's what we're obsessively focused on. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Appreciate that. And then just one quick one on kind of the progress at Olive Garden on third-party delivery, I know in the past you've been more focused on the opportunity of large party catering. But is there any update on either of those fronts? Gene Lee : Let me provide an update on this. We have met with and have test going on with all third-party delivery services of scale. There continues to be significant hurdles that we need to work through, such as how do we ensure that these delivery services will enhance our brands? Can it be flawlessly executed for our guests and our team members? Can we create a sustainable incremental growth at scale that's additive to our company? Can we agree on viable economics? And lastly, can we ensure that we own the data? Now, those are the things that we need to really work through in order to get to a place that we are -- we can partner with one or two of these organizations. We're still testing, doing small order self delivery. We'll continue analyze what the opportunity is there. We also recognize that we have 400 plus restaurants out there that are participating on a local basis with some of these companies. Those aren't what I would call sanctioned tests, but they are part of what's happening. We think this is an interesting space. However there's a lot of hurdles to get over also including how do we deal with a $0.5 billion we're doing in Olive Garden take-out sales today and how would that's be impacted and what the margin impacts are of that? So that's our update on where we are with the third-party delivers. We are continuing to meet with them and try to understand what opportunities are. Unidentified Analyst : Sure. That's it from me. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Jon Tower, Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Olive Garden on a two-year basis the traffic trends were pretty solid. And I'm just curious if you could breakdown where you're seeing the growth? Is that coming in earlier parts of the day? I know one of the promotions you did in the fiscal third quarter was focused on that three to 5 O'clock time window? Or you're seeing greater growth during the weekdays or weekends? If there's any kind of breakdown you could provide for us that would be helpful? Gene Lee : The overall business in Olive Garden is strong in all periods. We continue to focus on value at lunch. We continue focus on value from three to five. And with Cucina Mia! platform and some of the other value platforms that we're running when this Giant Meatball was a hit, and the Stuffed Fettuccine was a big hit. That was right in the sweet spot of what we're doing of our core guest. So we're seeing strength all throughout growth of business. I wouldn't point to one particular period. Jon Tower : Okay. And I know a primary objective of management has been to drive frequency of core guest at Olive Garden and pretty much across the brand. So, is there any chance you could give us a breakdown on how the frequency of those core guests have change over the past several years, maybe frame it somehow? Rick Cardenas : Yes, John. This is Rick. I'm not going to give specific numbers, but we segment our consumers into different groups. And the ones that we are focusing on and the ones that are high-frequency and most recent, and that group of consumers is growing faster than any other group that we have. Jon Tower : Okay, great. And then, lastly just a clarification. I know today you had some new compensation agreements announced. And I was wondering if that's included in that 15 million of incremental tax saving reinvestment into the business in fiscal 2019? Rick Cardenas : No, John, that's not part of the 15 million. Jon Tower : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Greg Badishkanian, Citi. Please proceed. Fred Wightman : Hey, guys. It's actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. We saw a large casual dinning franchisee file for bankruptcy earlier this quarter. Is that something that you think is meaningful from an industry perspective? And then if so, what you think that sort of indicates for unit growth or closures across the category going forward? Gene Lee : Yes. I don't think that's meaningful. I think that's more about someone reorganizing their balance sheet. I think there'll be continued store closures and there'll continue store openings as the weak continue to struggle that aren't as well-positioned, they maybe overexposed. But I don't -- I still think that we're going to see a net positive unit growth going into the next couple of years. Fred Wightman : Thanks. And then can you just remind us how you're evaluating the returns on that $35 million of employee spending if its turnover or crew satisfaction. Is there anything that you can sort of give us early days or early reads? Gene Lee : No. That's something \u2013 this is \u2013 I mean, I truly believe that we need to invest in to 180,000 team members who bring our brands to life every single day. We continuously evaluate our position in the marketplace from a benefits and overall employment proposition. And we believe these were the right things to do in order for us to maintain our leadership from a retention standpoint. And I believe we have the best team members in the business and I want to continue to reinvest with them when I have the opportunity. I'm very thankful for what they do every single day. There's no one sitting around me here that serves one meal or cooks one meal. These people do it. And I want to continue to reinvest in them. Fred Wightman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull, Stifel. Please proceed. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Gene, the company has argued that if it gets organized to successfully add brands to its portfolio and benefit from synergies. And I know you guys are getting the synergies in the Cheddar's acquisition. But do the integration issues with Cheddar's caused the company to rethink its approach to acquisitions? If so, kind of what have you learned and what things would you change? Gene Lee : No, not at all. I mean, I think that the -- I would call the acquisition indigestion we're having with Cheddar's today was the exact same that we had with LongHorn 10 years ago. I mean, I think we've got -- I've got a very long-term approach to this. And I look and I understand that we are going to have some issues as we integrate brands, but I look at where we are with Yard House today and Eddie V's and in LongHorn and Capital Grille. Cheddar's is going to work its way through this, and its going to be a dynamic brand. And not all these are going to move at the same level. We continue to do it what we call post-game analysis after we do these acquisitions. One of things we did this time is, we moved a little faster with integrating into our systems. We think that was helpful. Hopefully that will play out that we'll recover a little bit quicker. But this has no impact in if anything would make me more confident in our ability to do it. Chris O\u2019Cull: Okay. And then just secondly, can you quantify the impact to Cheddar's same-store sale of pulling the promotions? And will the promotional activity would be more comparable going forward year-over-year? Gene Lee : No. We can't give you the impact of it, but we just know that before we owned it that they were promoting extremely heavily to keep their same-store sales positive, so we didn't have an opportunity to retrieve the deal. And we know that before we got into really the integration, they were continuing to keep those \u2013 that promotional cadence alive. We believe like other brands that compete in this space that promotional activity and marketing is not key. We want to put those dollars on the plate. We want to create value where the consumer can see it every day. And I think we all know that there's another competitor out there that does that extremely well and we want to take that strategy and implement that strategy and keep the strategy with this brand. We will continue to focus them on the basics. We believe that we have great competency and in executing the basics of the restaurant operation that we're going to focus this team on doing that. Chris O\u2019Cull: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole Miller, Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. Nicole Miller : Thanks. Good morning. In our research we saw corporate bonds [ph] go towards the low income or low middle income demographic. And they also have an improved personal finance outlook. Is this anything you could attribute to your same-store sales growth? I would say especially at Olive Garden and maybe at LongHorn? Gene Lee : I think all those types of things are contributing. I wouldn't point to one specific demographic indicator. I think there is multiple indicators out there that are contributing to the overall growth of the well-positioned brands. And so that's definitely not hurting. But I wouldn't I would attribute it singularly for Olive Garden's strength. Nicole Miller : And then just second question on the Olive Garden off-premise, I think you said up 9%, 14% of sales. Could you talk about the pieces to go, catering delivery etcetera and how that each perform just quantitatively if possible? Gene Lee : No. We're not going to talk about for competitive reasons for that kind of detail. The one I'd say, I'll get this in is that over three-year period we were up 50% in our off-premise. So our teams have done an extremely good job of ramping up the experience and improving the overall satisfaction of our take-out -- our off-premise consumer. Our guests love the experience. Our team has done a great job with it. They're going to continue to improve their capabilities as the business grows, but a job well done by the Olive Garden team, 50% over three years is fantastic. Nicole Miller : Thanks Gene. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco, Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. I have a question and just a couple quick follow-ups. I guess in the past, Gene, you've been somewhat not so much enamored with a quick casual category inciting that the demographic seems a lot more narrow or smaller than the casual dining audience out there. I wonder -- have you seen a beginning in the industry of the lunch I guess the assault that the quick casuals had on the casual dining lunch business. Has that sort of tapered off for the industry? I mean, I know you guys have improved your value at lunch, but I'm talking more so for the industry. And has lunch strengthened a little bit or the share loss, has that sort of slowed? Gene Lee : Yes. I think the way we would describe it is that it was a headwind with the amount of units, fast casual units being added. That headwinds probably been diminished somewhat as the unit growth for that segment slowed. And I know I think that categories economics are difficult and we've been able to actually come in and give the consumer better value with full service experience. So that's how we think about. We think that the headwinds been removed. Matthew DiFrisco : Okay. And then Rick, with free cash flow guidance is anything we should read into that as far as the return to shareholders that you're guiding towards as far as a signal on your appetite for acquisitions going forward? Or is that still something on the table if you look very long-term as far as the growth model for the Darden portfolio? Gene Lee : Yes. I think as you look at the guidance we've only increase the CapEx by \u2013 well, not the CapEx, the share repurchase by $50 million year-over-year. So it's not a significant change. But we do know that because our share price went up we needed to do that. We have plenty of debt capacity if something comes along that makes sense for us, but we're not going to talk necessarily about specific acquisitions or doing acquisitions. We know that our long-term framework works with or without those in acquisition. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. And then just the last question with -- going back to the delivery question; off-premise being around 13 or 14 for Olive Garden, does that represent an opportunity and something that signals delivery could raise the ceiling? Or some people get concerned sometimes that when you flip the switch delivery, its going to cannibalize the existing off-premise business and add a layer of service to it and cost. So would this be 13% than success you've had with off-premise. Would that delay your rollout of delivery or is this something that says you need to raise the ceiling and delivery might come sooner? Gene Lee : Well, I would go back Matt to the significant huddles I described. We need to get comfortable that we have solved for these, especially in our \u2013 its going to be brand enhancing. And so our goal was to meet the consumer needs state of convenience. We're going to continue to focus on that. There are no limitations on a number. We believe through our research that we're capturing up a lot of occasions in Olive Garden. We wouldn't capture the people that using our off-premise services that would probably not come into our restaurants. We believe that people are from the most part the decision-making is and my taking out or dining in tonight, and then they decide where they're going to go. So I'm not as concerned about what the number is. I've said in the past, I think if the consumer \u2013 the need state continues grow Olive Garden's off-premise could go to 20%. How we get that, that still yet to be determined. We are focused right now \u2013 continue to be focused on large party catering, over $100 with 24 hour notice. We like that business. And we're being -- it's been very well received by the consumer set. Matthew DiFrisco : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Andrew Strelzik, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Andrew Strelzik : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I hate to belabor the point on the off-premise business. Obviously growth is still healthy, but at 9% it was a bit lower that we were use to seeing and it's obviously become lot more competitive with others getting involved there. So is there anything that you're considering doing any levers at your disposal to support that growth going forward? And I guess more broadly as we're seeing a lot of concepts talk about incremental growth from off-premise. Where do you think those eating occasions are coming from primarily? Gene Lee : Yes. On the first part of the question I think that we're going to continue to execute our strategy and try to drive the off-premise business. The 9% number does not bother me at all. I think at a two-year stack at 25 and we got a three-year stack of over 50 on an annual basis. So that's healthy. And where is this coming from? I think its trading out of grocery and with some extent, I think for the first we've seen \u2013 I saw a chart recently where food, out of home, eclipsed the grocery sales. I might not have that full accurate, but it's pretty darn close. So I think people are just thinking about convenience differently. And we also \u2013 let's not forget we have a demographic wave with millennial's coming our way, which could benefit us over time. And there's a lot of good data out there about this demographic wave. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Karen Holthouse, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Karen Holthouse : Hi. Going back to Olive Garden, the promotional strategy, I know last year was nine promotions or two years ago, I guess at this point with nine promotions. Last year it was six. And I think you kind of framed it is a little bit of testing year to see sort of the cost in terms of traffic versus the benefits in terms of executions, simplicity. How do you feel about sort of those different levers or the puts and takes this year? And how should we think about the promotional calendar headed into next year? Gene Lee : I will get into some dangerous territory here for me to speak to too openly about this as our competitors would love to know what our promotional cadence was going to be next year. All we'll say is I think that our team has executed six promotions extremely well. They kept them fresh for a longer period of time. They use some innovative tactics to do that. And I want to continue encourage them to be creative and to be able to run our promotions on a longer scale and try to reach more consumers through innovative, integrated marketing opportunities. But I'm not going to signal what our promotional calendar is for next year. Karen Holthouse : Thanks. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan. Your line is now open. John Ivankoe : Hi. Great. Thank you. Gene, we've kind of \u2013 you talked obviously lot about your outperformance relative to the industry. But the industry itself same-store traffic in your May quarter, in your fourth quarter were still negative. So, can you comment, I guess why you think casual dining same-store traffic is still negative at this point in the cycle and if there's any insights that we can have maybe on a market by market basis that stuff may be some markets that you think maybe have leading indicators with a positive or negative that may influence the rest of the country in terms of future segment trends? Gene Lee : I'll take the latter part of that first. We see nothing when we look across the individual ADIs. Sales are little weaker in New England in that marketplace, but for the most part it's fairly similarly as we look across the country. Why do I think casual dinning in general is struggling to grow traffic? It\u2019s a mature industry that is somewhat over-restauranted and in an environment like that it's going to expose the weaknesses of brands that aren't positioned well. And that's exactly I think where we are as an industry. And those who have been willing to do less guests, charge more money and try to make additional profit that way are going to end up paying a price. And the brands that are focused on maintaining their guest counts and even driving their guest counts and willing to give up short-term margin and pricing below inflation and competitors will continue to take share. And I think there is some really good brands out there that are really well-positioned that continue to do that. And I think we have a lot of them in our stable. I think we're better positioned than most because of our scale and what we're doing with that and insights. And we'll continue to stay focused on that. But we see an opportunity in a mature market to gain share. Rick Cardenas : All right. Aubrey, I think we're ready for the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Anderson, Maxim Group. Please proceed. Stephen Anderson : Yes. Good morning. And not to belabor the point about the post integration efforts over at Cheddar's, but in the past calls you've mentioned about maybe rolling out some sales building initiatives and including things like up off-premise sales. And do you think at this point it maybe a bit premature to discuss that as something that you might consider even in the first half of the fiscal year? Gene Lee : No. We're going to be focus on staffing our restaurants, simplifying our operation and improving and mastering the new systems that we put in. Right now these restaurants on average do over 6000 guests a week. I want to delight those guests with a great experience and that's our focus right now. Stephen Anderson : Okay. And then now regard to some of the menu price rationalization that you've done in a number of markets. Has that process now been completed? Gene Lee : In the Cheddar's system, yes, we've got them fairly much aligned on the right -- on the similar pricing structures and it\u2019s a good question, because that was painful but it was the right thing to do. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Brian Vaccaro, Raymond James. Please proceed. Brian Vaccaro : Hi, thanks and good morning. Just wanted to circle back on the Olive Garden advertising. Notice that their reported marketing spend overall was up about 8% year-on-year. Was that a meaningful driver of Olive Garden comps during the quarter that was maybe able to offset the Buy One, Take One lap and given the intensely competitive environment we are still in, should we expect ad spend as a percent of sales to be up perhaps in fiscal 2019? Gene Lee : First of all, we're just verifying, but our advertising spend in Olive Garden was not up for the quarter or the year. And so I don\u2019t know what you are looking at, but I believe it was actually probably a little less. Rick Cardenas : Yes, I think you are looking at the actual income statement which didn\u2019t have Cheddar\u2019s in all of last year. When you look at total marketing spend, as we said as a percent of sales, our marketing was down 10 basis points. We are at favorable 10 basis points, so that would have been mainly adding another brand with other sales. Brian Vaccaro : Okay, understood, understood. And I guess any comments on fiscal 2019 overall ad spend as a percent of sales. Gene Lee : No comments specifically on marketing spend, just take \u2013 go back to our framework and where we are going to be, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate marketing as a percent of sales to be significantly different year-over-year but no comment on specific ad spend. Brian Vaccaro : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then also if I could just shift gears to the food cost during the quarter. Rick, can you quantify the savings that you achieved in the quarter and how we should think about sort of the food cost savings specifically into fiscal 2019 and then last question from me just thinking about your fiscal 2019 EBIT margins if it\u2019s I think you said closer to flat year-on-year, what does that assume in terms of G&A in fiscal 2019? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes, so we mentioned total synergies for the year. I\u2019m not going to go specifically for the quarter, but total synergies for the year were about $10 million and about half of those are in cost to sales. And, that helped price \u2013 offset pricing below inflation. The other part of your question on G&A, we would anticipate as we\u2019ve said before to leverage G&A every year maybe by 10 basis points, so if we are at zero next year that would imply zero EBIT margin, that would imply that our restaurant level margins were down 10 basis points, but we are not saying we are going to be at zero, just assume we probably will get about 10 basis points of leverage in G&A. Brian Vaccaro : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Scott, Mizuho. Please proceed. Jeremy Scott : Hey thanks. Just had one follow up there. Just wanted to ask about your food basket, everything we are looking at within the case that you are likely to see more deflationary tailwinds especially on approaching in dairy and of course you mentioned the supply chain benefits of your many simplifications. So I was just wondering what\u2019s behind conservatism in fiscal 2019 assuming that\u2019s the way you are contracted or can we see some relief in the back half of the year or into 2020? Or is there something we\u2019re missing? Gene Lee : Yes, you\u2019ve got to understand about when we take contract and when we buy, we have in our presentation that\u2019s out on the website our coverage this year is about, we\u2019re about 65% covered from for the first half of the year which is about where we were last year within 5% plus or minus and all of those we believe will be at low single digit inflation primarily. So that\u2019s why we think for the year the inflation number we have given is appropriate. Jeremy Scott : So I guess when you are thinking about maybe the portion that\u2019s not covered, you will likely lock in prices that are well below what you are currently experiencing, right? Gene Lee : Well we are talking about single digit -- 0% to 1% inflation in commodity. So, it\u2019s really a function of when we buy we are pretty much covered as I said 65% and it\u2019s also a function of where we are last year and what last year\u2019s cost. Now, if costs come in lower, and we take coverage when we do, we\u2019ll let you know but right now we still believe that our commodity inflation assumption is accurate. Jeremy Scott : Great, okay thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Penney, Hedgeye. Please proceed. Howard Penney : Thank you so much. Gene, I wanted to go back to your answer to the delivery question and why you think it\u2019s so important for you to own the customer data as a part of your delivery assessment? Thanks. Gene Lee : Hey, Howard we think it\u2019s really important because these delivery services are net neutral sites. However, their goal is to sell as much food as possible. On their platform we will ensure that we own our data and our data is not used against us. And that\u2019s very very important in this whole negotiation and we want to be able to benefit from our own data but we want to ensure that our data is not used against us and we believe on our platform we talk about data being one of our competitive advantages and we have over the last decade, we have been behind a lot of trends because we\u2019ve built our own proprietary systems so that we can own the data. And we believe that that\u2019s going to be key going forward. So it\u2019s an important part of this negotiation. Howard Penney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jake Bartlett, SunTrust. Please proceed. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Rick, I'm hoping you can give us an update on what your cost savings were for the full year in 2018. In the third quarter, there were some pieces kind of given in the Q on the COGS side, but also on the labor productivity in your slides. So I'm wondering what the overall result was for the year? And then it sounds like you're not expecting really material savings in 2019. Just to confirm that, just given your guidance. Rick Cardenas : Yes Jake, we haven\u2019t specifically called that cost savings over the last year or so, because we\u2019ve generally been reinvesting those savings. And so the only savings we\u2019ve been talking about are synergies from the Cheddar\u2019s acquisition. We did get cost savings in the fiscal year that just ended. We reinvested those as Gene has mentioned in the past, we have reinvested in food quality, in people and other areas. So we are really not ready to talk about any other cost savings. Jake Bartlett : Got it. But when you say reinvest, you also mean reinvest in pricing? I mean that allows you to keep the pricing low? Rick Cardenas : Absolutely. That is one of our reinvestments. We did price below inflation, when you include labor and food cost, we price below inflation and if you look at check growth in the industry, our check growth was well below the industry for this fiscal year and the last quarter. Jake Bartlett : Got it. Okay and then quick question on Cheddar's. Part of the deceleration in same-store sales this quarter was pulling back on promotions as you got the integration going and working through that. Do you expect to quickly reignite those promotions? Or is this one reason why you expect kind of weaker results and kind of Cheddar's bringing the whole same-store sales down for the year for the whole company? Rick Cardenas : Jake, I mean you\u2019ll start to see us slowly bring back some promotional activity. But right now our focus is on getting our restaurants staffed and ensuring that we are scheduling properly and that are we creating great guest experiences in all of our Cheddar\u2019s-- I mean this is really back to basics and the system has been through a lot, we got \u2013 they are all great people. Myself, Dave, George we are fully aware. We went through this, we are fully aware what they are going through and we want to help them get back to doing basic things and when is the right time to start adding some more promotional activity we\u2019ll add some more promotional activity. We have great people trying to do great things. We are just here to try to help them get accelerate that. Jake Bartlett : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no questions in queue. Back to you speakers. Gene Lee : Thank you. That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday September 20th before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Marsha. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings on December 18 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights, and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from both the first quarter and update our outlook for fiscal 2019. Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that our Blended same-restaurant sales figure now included Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen as we are wrapping on the first full-year that the brand was part of the Darden portfolio. Additionally, all references to the industry benchmark during today\u2019s call refer to estimated KNAPP-TRACK, excluding Darden. During our fiscal first quarter, industry total sales growth was 1.5%, industry same-restaurant sales grew 0.8%, and industry same-restaurant guest counts declined 1.4%. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. As you have seen from our press release this morning, we had a great quarter to begin our fiscal year. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.1 billion, an increase of 6.5%, significantly outpacing industry growth. Same-restaurant sales increased 3.3%, and diluted net earnings per share were $1.34, an increase of 35.4% from last year\u2019s adjusted earnings. We remain focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy to ensure we're delivering exceptional guest experiences, while strengthening our four competitive advantages. Olive Garden had a very strong quarter, which resulted in its 16th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 6.3%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 5.3%, and 1% growth from new restaurants. Same-restaurant guest counts grew 1.5%. Olive Garden significantly outperformed the industry benchmarks across these metrics. This strong performance is a result of four years of consistently improving the value proposition at Olive Garden. We continue to strengthen value and convenience, which was reflected in our two promotional offers during the quarter; Create Your Own Lasagna and Buy One Take One. Both of these promotions, which offered our guests the opportunity to upgrade the premium entree selections, coupled with fewer incentives and an increase in preference in our Mediterranean dishes drove menu mix growth of 1.9%. Additionally, the Olive Garden team continues to improve the off-premise experience. Off-premise sales grew 13% and represented 13% of total sales for the quarter. Our strong guest count growth as a result of the team's focus on simplification and flawless execution inside our restaurants, culinary innovation that appeals to our loyal guests, creating relevant and integrated marketing, and meeting our guests\u2019 desire for convenience. Our strategy is working and as reinforced by the fact that our key satisfaction measures including value remain at all-time highs. LongHorn Steakhouse had another strong quarter, outperforming the industry benchmark and leading to its 22nd consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 6.4%, driven by 3.3% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 3.1%. Same-restaurant guest counts declined 0.3%, primarily driven by the fact that we ran a non-price pointed promotion during the quarter compared to a price-pointed promotion last year. That combined with increased add-ons and fewer incentives led to menu mix growth of 1.8%. LongHorn's focus on their long-term strategy continues to enable profitable sales growth while they further invest in the guest experience. During the quarter, we implemented several initiatives to improve the quality of the guest experience, simplify our operations, and protect our unique culture. One of the ways LongHorn team continues to leverage its unique culture is through its annual Steak Master Series, an internal grilling competition and highly engaging training program. This year's program began with more than 6,000 culinary team members competing and ended with Grill Master, Michelle Cerveny from our Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio restaurant being crowned the Steak Master Champion. Finally, the LongHorn team continues to improve its off-premise experience as consumer demand grows. Overall, I am very pleased with the progress the team is making, executing their long-term strategy. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen had total sales growth of 6.5%, driven by organic new restaurant growth and franchise restaurant acquisition growth of 10.5%, and offset by same restaurant sales decline of 4%. The original company restaurants were down 2.3% and the formerly franchise restaurants were down 6.7%. We remain focused on rebuilding the operations foundation at Cheddar\u2019s and improving execution. Having the right leaders in the right place is fundamental to bringing our back-to-basics operating philosophy to life at Cheddar's. We spent a significant amount of time during the quarter evaluating and evolving the leadership team. As a result, we named John Wilkerson, President of Cheddar's eight weeks ago. A 25-year Darden veteran, John is a proven leader and the right person to lead the Cheddar's team. Most recently, he served as President of Bahama Breeze. Additionally, Dave George our Chief Operating Officer will continue to dedicate a significant amount of his time working side by side with the Cheddar's team to improve the performance of the business. It\u2019s important for me to reiterate that we are committed to improving the foundational elements of operations, stabilizing our management teams, ensuring we\u2019re hiring and retaining great team members, and developing and executing consistent standards are critical to Cheddar's success. We remain focused on long-term brand building strategies rather than short-term tactics. We acquired Cheddar's because it was the value leader in casual dining with tremendous growth potential, and that is as true today as it was 17 months ago. The power of this brand is reflected in its ability to maintain average weekly guest counts of approximately 6,000 per restaurant, even in the face of extraordinary change. There is a significant amount of work ahead, but with the focus and strong leadership we have today, I\u2019m confident Cheddar's is on the right track. Each year during the first quarter, we hold our annual leadership conference which allows us to get in front of every general manager and managing partner across all 1,753 restaurants to discuss our plans for the year and generate excitement. These restaurant leaders hold the most influential role in our company and I value the opportunity to engage with them and listen to those closest to the action. I was pleased to see the alignment and focus on simplification and flawless execution driven home as a central theme at each conference. In closing, we had a great first quarter, our strategy is working. We continue to grow our sales, increase market share, and improve margins, while making meaningful investments in our people and brands, all while being able to return capital to our shareholders. Our team members enable our success and our teams are the best in the business. So, I want to say thank you to our 180,000 team members who continue to create memorable dining experiences for our guests. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter with total sales growth of 6.5%, driven by 3.2% growth from the addition of 52 net new restaurants, and same restaurant sales growth of 3.3%. First quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.34, an increase of 35.4% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. We paid $93 million in dividends and repurchased $31 million in shares, returning a total of $124 million to our shareholders this quarter. Before I get into the margin analysis, I want to mention that we adopted the new accounting standard on revenue recognition at the beginning of this fiscal year. One of the requirements of this new standard is to recognize revenue for sales of food and other products to franchisees with a corresponding increase in our cost of sales by the same amount. While the impact of this change is immaterial to Darden EBIT and EBIT margin overall, it does impact certain aspects of our results. At the Darden level, it increases food and beverage as a percent of sales by approximately 20 basis points. This increase is subsequently offset in all other categories of the P&L, resulting in a minimal impact to Darden EBIT margin overall. In addition, this change reduces the segment profit margin of our other segment since this is the segment in which all of the impact is recognized. Now, looking at the P&L. Food and beverage costs were favorable 40 basis points as pricing of 1.9%, and continued cost savings initiatives more than offset continued investments in food quality, and the negative impact related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Commodities inflation was essentially flat this quarter. Restaurant labor was unfavorable 70 basis points, despite continued productivity gains and sales leverage. The increase was driven by hourly wage inflation of approximately 5%, previously announced workforce investments, and headwinds related to mark-to-market expenses for General Manager and managing partner equity awards. Restaurant expense was favorable 30 basis points as sales leverage more than offset inflation. And marketing expense was favorable by 20 basis points. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.2% was 20 basis points favorable to last year. G&A expense was 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily driven by mark-to-market expenses related to the significant appreciation in the Darden share price this quarter. As a reminder, due to the way we hedged this expense, it is mostly offset in the tax line. Page 11 of the presentation we\u2019re broadcasting online and posted on our website, illustrates the impact mark-to-market had on our P&L in the first quarter. Restaurant labor was higher by $2.9 million and G&A expense was higher by $7.6 million. In total, mark-to-market reduced EBIT by $10.5 million and EBIT margin by 50 basis points this quarter. Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $7.6 million, and the net impact of mark-to-market this quarter was $2.9 million reduction to earnings after tax. Due to the change in tax rate from tax reform, we were not fully hedged, resulting in approximately $0.02 of EPS unfavorability this quarter. Looking at income tax expense, we had an abnormally low effective tax rate of 4% this quarter, due to two factors. First, tax benefits from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned reduced the tax rate by 4.3 percentage points. Second, higher than normal stock option exercises in the quarter, drove approximately $6 million of excess tax benefits, reducing the tax rate by approximately 3.4 percentage points. After adjusting for these factors, our normalized effective tax rate for the first quarter, would have been approximately 12%. Turning to our segment performance. Olive Garden, LongHorn, and the Fine Dining segment all grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same restaurant sales and net new restaurants. Segment profit margin increased in each of these segments, even after the incremental work force investments, by leveraging the same restaurant sales growth and managing cost effectively. Sales for our other business segment grew 7.1%, driven by net new restaurants and the purchase of 11 Cheddar's franchise restaurants in the second quarter of last year. Segment profit margin declined 120 basis points in this segment, due to margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales, primarily at Cheddar's, incremental workforce investments, and the adoption of revenue recognition, I previously mentioned. Finally, in this morning's press release, we announced an increase to several components of our fiscal 2019 financial outlook. First, we increased both our total sales outlook to be between 5% and 5.5%, and same-restaurant sales outlook to be between 2% and 2.5%. Next, we updated our effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11% for the full fiscal year. We also increased our outlook for diluted average common shares outstanding for the year to approximately 126 million, related to higher than normal stock option exercises and increased share dilution, due to our stock price increase. All culminating in an increase in diluted net earnings per share to be between $5.52 and $5.65. And with that, we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Okay. The first question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is now open. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a great start to the year. My question is on the Olive Garden comp and specifically on the mix components, looks very positive, and I know Gene you mentioned that people were upgrading to more premium offerings. So, I wanted to ask you about the sustainability of that trend, was that something you would attribute to the promotions you ran this quarter or do you think that that is something that can continue as you look forward? Gene Lee : Yes. Good morning, David. It is our intention to moderate this positive mix as we move forward. We will continue to make investments into the menu. I really don't want to talk about what we're going to do there, but I would say contemplated in our guidance as we look forward is a moderation of that menu mix. I think this quarter was a confluence of a few different things as I said in my prepared remarks. I mean, we had a good promotion. We had some real high-value options that were a little bit more expensive that people could trade up to that we felt good about people trading up to inside those promotions. We changed some merchandising on our menus, and we saw the increase in our Mediterranean platform. It drove some mix and our ability to pull back some incentives. So, it was a combination of a few things, and we would like to see that moderate a little bit as we go forward, and I think that\u2019s definitely contemplated in our outlook. David Tarantino : Great. That\u2019s helpful and if I could squeeze one in on Cheddar's, I guess at a high-level Gene, I know you mentioned, you are focused on sort of fixing some of the longer-term operational and brand elements there, but I guess, how would you encourage us to think about when you would start to see progress on the topline? I know it could be a slow process, but just to the level set, when do you think you might start to turn the dial? Gene Lee : I think Dave, I think that is a good question. And I think that we're starting to see progress on a daily basis. We measure the number of restaurants every day that are positive. That number is starting to increase. We\u2019re very pleased with the restaurants that have really strong leadership. We can see the retention numbers are stronger at the employee level, the execution numbers are higher. Those restaurants are growing. And so, as we think about it, this is really about trying to improve the fundamentals, and the framework that we\u2019re using to try to drive improvement in this business is based on the whole notion of strategy or process measurement, and I\u2019d say that we're pretty aligned.  We have got the right strategy for this business. We spent the last 90 days really working on the organizational structure and to make sure we had leadership in the right place. I think the team now is going to focus on process, and they are going to focus on trying to simplify the operation and standardize it. With the acquisitions of the two franchise groups, there is a lot of differential on processes and procedures, and we need to standardize it and we think there\u2019s some opportunity inside the original Cheddar's to standardize, and then once we get that set, then we will figure out how we're going to measure it.  I think one of the big opportunities in this business is to increase accountability. I think it\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s a lot of great people working in this brand, and once we get them aligned on what we want them to do and give them the tools to do it well, I think we're going to see some improvement. I'm not going to tell you that\u2019s third quarter, fourth quarter, or first quarter next year. What I\u2019m looking for every single day and I meet with Dave every day on this, and I get a report, are we getting better day-to-day, week-to-week, and I would tell you that we are seeing that happen right now. David Tarantino : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Gregory Francfort : Gene, I had a question for you, kind of on the macro, it seems like casual\u2019s doing a lot better right now and everything we\u2019ve been hearing out of the quick service backdrop that it is a little bit softer. Are you seeing trade up from lower income consumers to middle income consumers or do you have any other diagnosis for maybe what might be driving that sort of broader based industry shift? Gene Lee : Yes. We\u2019re not seeing anything that\u2019s conclusive that I can make that statement right now. When I think about what\u2019s going on with the consumer, you know obviously, consumer confidence is in an all-time high. People are feeling good. However, I don't think this is a tide where all the boats are rising. I think well-positioned brands that are executing are performing really well and I think you are continuing to see that as others announce their results. I do believe moving forward the biggest challenge in the industry is going to be the war for talent. Brands that can hire, train, and retain front-line employees to bring their brands to life are going to win, and the dynamics inside the industry are changing dramatically, and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused, and that\u2019s I think where the winners will be focused is, how they continue to invest in their team members, and how to ensure that you are properly staffed to execute against this increased demand, but back to your original question, I\u2019m not in a position to make a conclusive statement on that at this time. Gregory Francfort : Maybe just going back to that, how much of the wage pressure right now in the industry do you think is coming from the labor reinvestments that are being made on tax reform, is that a big driver of the current, the 5% step-ups that you are seeing, and I guess the follow-on to that would be, once that sort of rolls off for a year, do you expect that level to come back in at all? Gene Lee : No. I mean, I don't think the 5% really is being driven by the investment. I think the 5% really is being driven by the investment. I think the 5% is being driven by just a situation where as the employment environment gets better historically less employees come out of the restaurant space and into other opportunities. So, there is just a shrinking of a workflow here, and we\u2019re committed to staying, you know hiring the best possible people who bring our brands to life. Our retention rates are actually improving, and I think part of that is because that we are willing to make the appropriate pay decision to keep our people. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve instructed our operations teams to do. I firmly believe that to win in this environment you are going to have to have great team members and we\u2019re going to do what we need to do to maintain and keep our team members, but I think the wait for us is going to be there for a while, and we\u2019re going to continue to find ways to offset it, but first and foremost we have to have the best team members on the closest to the action to bring our brands to life. Gregory Francfort : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Will Slabaugh : Hi, thanks guys. I have an Olive Garden question to start, and then maybe a broader topic to hit on. So, this is your best Olive Garden comp since 2008 from what we can find, and I realize Gene you weren\u2019t CEO at Darden then, but can you talk about what you are seeing in guest behavior from your perspective now versus what you saw back in the industry? And to what degree is there any euphoria in the amount of consumer versus simply healthy consumer and a strong better positioned Olive Garden that\u2019s just capable of putting up these one and two-year comp numbers? Gene Lee : Yes. I think overall it\u2019s a healthy consumer, and I think the work that we have been doing for the last four years since Dave took over Olive Garden and our focus on the core consumer and continuing to put value back into the menu has just all kind of come together, and we\u2019re able to put up a great quarter, and I think what I\u2019m most excited about is that we\u2019re continuing to find new ways to improve the value proposition for the Olive Garden consumer, and do it in a way that is engaging and relevant, and the brand continues to really be well-received by many different cohorts, consumer cohorts out there, especially millennials. This is a brand that\u2019s very social that performs very well in social media. So, I think this is just a culmination of a strong consumer and four years of really focused work on trying to improve our value proposition to our core guests. And I think staying true to who we are is probably the most important thing that we\u2019re doing. Will Slabaugh : Got it. And if I could follow-up on the comments you made on Cheddar's earlier, it\u2019s good to hear you're seeing some improvements at the brand as you mentioned. My question is around eventual acceleration in unit growth, what are you looking for from a metric standpoint may be outside of same-store sales or whether it be team feedback or whatnot before you would be ready to ratchet up to growth of that brand? Gene Lee : I want to see the retention numbers that management and [indiscernible] level getting much closer to Darden norms. You know, what I have been doing this long enough to know that we can't grow rapidly without strong management retention and having an employee proposition that the employees stay with us. That\u2019s the key to driving sustainable growth. Will Slabaugh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. John Glass : Thanks very much. Just on your comments on the labor inflation this quarter kicking up, I think earlier in the year or the beginning of the year you talked about a little bit less labor inflation is that now your base case that remains at 5% in your new guidance or do you think this quarter was maybe an anomaly turn over at Cheddar's or whatever else that may have driven it specifically? Gene Lee : Hi, John. Yes, when we guided earlier in the year we said that our total labor would be 3.5% to 4.5%, but wage inflation would be approximately 5%, and that hasn't changed. So, this is really right on where we guided in the beginning of the year. John Glass : Okay. And then if you could just, what was the impact to overall restaurant margin from Cheddar's specifically. In other words, how could we think about where restaurant margin could go if Cheddar's was back on its game and comps were positive again? Gene Lee : John, we are not willing to talk about the actual margin for the brand itself. We did talk about the overall margin for the other segment, but they did have negative same-restaurant sales growth, so you would anticipate a little bit of a decline in margin at Cheddar's for this quarter. John Glass : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Nicole Miller : Thank you, good morning. So, it\u2019s clear you have an advantage in value, could you talk about the benefits of the advantages still on the current environment? And I'm thinking about some of the comments you have made about not being, but we\u2019re on labor and maybe also as it relates to on premise specifically delivery? Thanks. Gene Lee : I'm sorry. You were breaking up a little bit Nicole, could you just repeat your question? Nicole Miller : I'm sorry Gene. I wanted to ask about the advantage of scale. So, you talk a lot about the advantage of value, but I want to ask about the advantage of scale in the current environment as it relates to things like marketing and labor, off-promise and delivery? Gene Lee : Scale is one of our four competitive advantages and I think that we continue to focus on becoming more efficient with everything that\u2019s a non-consumer facing that allows us to make investments into the consumer facing side of the business. I also think one of the big advantages of scale is, the perspective we have on the industry and we can see how consumers behave all the way from Cheddar's to Capital Grille. And I think we can make investments that others can't make, and I think we have some better insight and where to make those investments. So, scale is an important part of what we\u2019re doing. I think it\u2019s a very important part of the employment proposition. We talked a lot about scale and what it does for the consumer proposition, but scale provides our employees a lot of value. And we will continue to find new and innovative ways with our scale to improve the employment proposition. We are making sure that we're spending as much time talking about the employment proposition as we are talking about the consumer proposition. And I think that\u2019s different than maybe where we were 3, 4 years ago in a different environment, and so I really want to go back to a statement I made earlier. The brand's that can hire and attract and retain the best people are going to win \u2013 are going to accelerate their success in this environment. Nicole Miller : And given the strength of Capital Grille and Eddie V's could you talk about the Fine Dining trends and is check or traffic really the driver behind that performance? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes. Fine Dining continues to perform fairly well. You\u2019ve got both a little bit of traffic growth and some check growth in there. We always have trouble reading our upscale brands on check in traffic because the consumer, you know our traffic numbers are generated from entree counts and both businesses do a lot of bar business and generate a lot of traffic that\u2019s not always related back to an entree count, but those businesses feel healthy, there is no geographical differences. We\u2019re excited about some opportunity in capital growth and increase some capacity in restaurants that are at full capacity right now and so we\u2019re really excited about the performance of our upscale businesses, and they continue to do really well. We think they\u2019re really well-positioned and we\u2019re looking forward to being able to grow Eddie V\u2019s a little bit quicker in the future as that base gets bigger. Nicole Miller : Thank you. And congrats on a great quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. Last year I think you said, there was a hurricane drag of 30 basis points in fiscal 1Q and 60 basis points in the second quarter, how much hurricane noise do you think there was this quarter, this fiscal 1Q this year, net of last year and knowing about last year's drag in performance this year, how much do you anticipate for fiscal 2Q? Gene Lee : Yes, last year we did say 30 basis points in Q1. I think what we said in Q2 was the impact of the hurricane net of any bounce back was pretty much negligible in Q2. It might have been an initial shock and the bounce back caught up. So, this year we basically have a hurricane that happened in the earlier part of our quarter, but we should anticipate some bounce back over time. All of that had contemplated in our guidance. So, the 2% to 2.5% same-restaurant sales includes the impact of the hurricane for the quarter. David Palmer : Okay. And for Olive Garden, that wider gap to the industry, how much of that was Buy One Take One being more effective and perhaps running a little bit longer in the quarter versus what you see as other drivers in that brand? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes. David, again I go back to Buy One Take One ran, I don't know if they ran any more weeks during the quarter because I think it bridges first and second quarter. I think the big thing is that there may have been some pent-up demand because we didn\u2019t run it in the fourth quarter last year, and so we had one extra week in the quarter for Buy One Take One. I think it was the excess demand and I would caution anybody to point to one thing that drove the overall Olive Garden acceleration in comps and improved gap. I want to keep coming back to. This is confidence of a lot of hard work, a little bit extra increase in mix, strong promotions with good add-ons, but overall, I wouldn't want to point to just promotional impact. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One just on the restaurant margin. I mean it seems like it was relatively flat this quarter, despite the North of 3% comp, and obviously a very strong comp at Olive Garden, just wondering how you think about that going forward? What perhaps is implied in your guidance, and what type of comp and/or price might you need to actually see expanding margins or should we just assume that with labor of mid-single digits flattish type margin would be considered success? Gene Lee : Hi Jeff. Just to remember our margin did include 50 basis points of unfavorability from mark-to-market this quarter, which was significant. Even with that, we had 20 basis points of margin improvement at the restaurant level this quarter. We did anticipate the wage rate that we had in our initial guide, and we still anticipate our labor \u2013 I'm sorry, our wage inflation to be about 5%. And also, this year in the first quarter, we had workforce investments that we didn\u2019t have last year. Now those were previously announced. So, we're really happy with where our restaurant level margin came in, and I\u2019ll take you back to our long-term framework. Our long-term framework is 10 basis points to 30 basis points of EBIT margin expansion, and we still anticipate to be somewhere in that framework this year. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just thinking about from a modelling perspective, 53rd week is that something we should be anticipating in fiscal 2020 and factoring into our models at this point? Gene Lee : Yes. I believe the 53rd week is fiscal 2020. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. I just had two questions. One on, I know you said on prior calls you were looking at testing delivery. I think we\u2019ve seen you test a couple of stores and brands on both Uber and Grubhub, just curious if you can give us some updates on that what you\u2019ve seen in early indications such as greater off-premise sales et cetera. And then also Gene I had a question with respect to value, I guess OG rewards has been out there for a little while, can you talk about that? Is that something that in Casual Dining could be something that could be of a next leg of value, and are you seeing that grow at an accelerated pace faster than the rest of the sales? Gene Lee : Let\u2019s start with third-party. We continue to test with the third-party delivery services of scale. We\u2019re monitoring, we\u2019re learning as this business starts to mature, but for us there is significant hurdles that we still have to work through. We\u2019re not sure that it enhances our brands. We\u2019re concerned about how it\u2019s executed. We\u2019re concerned if they can create incremental growth at scale. We\u2019re not happy with the economics. We still have the issue of the data. And lastly, we have to get our arms around how we protect the profitability of our large and growing current off-business premise, which would be difficult to deal with.  So, for right now, we don't anticipate entering into a third-party delivery space in a meaningful way. We\u2019ll continue to analyze and look at our option\u2019s going forward. But we have a very large off-premise business today that\u2019s growing double-digits that the consumer rates us extremely high on, and we're going to continue to make sure that experiences is the best it can be, and we\u2019ll look at third-party. We just don't see this as something that we want to get involved in today with the current way it\u2019s being executed. On OG rewards, OG rewards is a very small test in a multi-brand, in a market with all of our brands. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at. At this point, it\u2019s a test, and I don't really want to talk too much further about the test and its results. And if and when this becomes something that is worthy of further discussion and roll-out we\u2019ll talk about it at that time. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Your line is now open. Fred Wightman : Hi guys. It is actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. I think a few weeks ago it came out that there was a cyberattack at Cheddar's, just wondering if there were any reserves for that that showed up in the quarter? Rick Cardenas : Hi, Greg. First of all, I just want to make sure that we understand. We take this privacy and security of our guests\u2019 personal information very, very seriously and regret to think that it occurred. Important to note that this incident occurred on a Cheddar's former POS system that was permanently disabled in April, and we completed the implementation of our proprietary POS system and Darden\u2019s systems and networks were not impacted. I will say that we did reserve what we believe will be the cost in the first quarter and that is included in our G&A expense. Fred Wightman : Okay. And could you quantify that specific price? Or do you want to leave it a little bit more vague? Rick Cardenas : I will just leave it, as it is in our G&A expenses for the quarter. Fred Wightman : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull of Stifel. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi good morning guys. This is actually Mitch [ph] on for Chris. Just on Cheddar's in a follow-up on an earlier question on its unit growth, could you just discuss your strategy to grow that brands unit base once you iron out all the integration work? Do you expect to materially accelerate the pace? Gene Lee : You know, I think once we get the fundamentals in place and we\u2019ve got the employment situation, what I would call in-line with our other business is we will start to grow it. We will ramp it up from where it is at today. We're going to use a backfill strategy and we will get, we really don't know how fast we can go. We\u2019ve got to learn more about the growth potential of the business and we will grow as fast as our human resources allow us to grow. We think that getting up towards that 7% to 10% unit-growth this kind of a barrier, and we will give you more guidance as we get to that point in the cycle. Unidentified Analyst : Okay great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Neil Vasquez in behalf of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Neil Vasquez : Thank you. I have a question on the 2019 forecast, and then a follow-up in LongHorn. So, on the forecast, is it to assume that a top line trend you saw in first Q have persisted? Or was it just meaningful enough that even if the rest of the year reverse your initial forecast, you can still meet updated guidance? Rick Cardenas : We\u2019re not going to talk about where we are for the quarter to date. I will just say that all of the information we know as of today is included in our forecast. And as you remember \u2013 as you recall Gene said in his remarks, the mix growth that we had in the first quarter, we\u2019re going to have some things to help moderate that so that we can continue to improve our value proposition and again that\u2019s why that\u2019s in our guidance. And I do want to make a clarification on Jeff Bernstein's question on labor or on the restaurant expense. Our restaurant margin unfavourability from mark-to-market and workforce was 40 basis points. So, with the 40-basis point reduction, we still had a really good restaurant labor. I just want to make sure that I clarify that. Neil Vasquez : Thank you. And on LongHorn, if you could give a little bit more clarity on the LongHorn components because same-store traffic was more negative than we would have expected given the use of the compressions and we were wondering at what point do you prefer towards more of a traffic driven strategy? Gene Lee : Yes. As I said in my prepared remarks, the primary drive driver of the slight decrease in guest traffic was driven by not running a price point or promotion, and we also have less incentives out there. So, our overall profitability improved significantly throughout the quarter. So, I think our strategy is working where we continue to remove or eliminate a discounted consumer that\u2019s taking out space on our busy night, and I\u2019m thrilled with the components of the LongHorn business and to be able to get those incentives out and pull back on the price point of promotion. So, I know it was a great quarter for LongHorn. Neil Vasquez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is on the 2019 EPS guidance, if I could just look at what you \u2013 you increased the same-store sales guidance, but the EPS guidance isn't up as much as I would have thought. I believe some of the difference is going to be the mark-to-market, maybe the stock options, but if you could just clarify what the moving pieces are to mute the EPS guidance kind of growing with the same-store sales? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jake. Basically, if you think about the guidance that we have for the year for EPS growth of [5.52 to 5.65] it is impacted by a couple of things. One is, we are increasing our same restaurant sales as you mentioned, but we have higher share count than we had in our original guidance of 1 million shares roughly and that actually impacts us by about $0.04 unfavorable. And we had such a great tax rate in the first quarter at 4%, while our annual guide tax rate is going to go down by 100 basis points of still an increase in tax rate from this first quarter. Jake Bartlett : Got it. So, when we think about the mark-to-market in the first quarter for the restaurant level margin, is that affect going to flow through for the rest of the year and the same, I guess goes for stock comp kind of going up pretty significantly, is that also a meaningful headwind for \u2013 on G&A? Rick Cardenas : Jake, the mark-to-market all depends on what happens with the stock price and what happens with the market price of just basically the general market. So, we aren't really necessarily forecasting what\u2019s going to happen to our stock price. We adjust and in regards to our option exercise, we just had a lot of options exercise in the first quarter, much more than we typically do. And the majority of those were exercised by retirees. Not necessarily be built here. And so, as we look at the option exercise for the rest of the year, we would anticipate it to be a more normal rate than it was in the first quarter. Jake Bartlett : Got it. And then Gene just a question about the environment. We\u2019re seeing restaurant sales if you look at the kind of the government retail numbers, up 10% year-over-year in July and August, it seems like that would imply some of the smaller change or some of the independence are gaining share. Are you seeing that and how do you, kind of, how does that jive with this need to retain talent and attract talent? I would think that the larger chains have a better ability to do that, so I am just trying to understand when the dynamic of whose gaining share and this kind of very strong demand environment, and then also why there might be? Gene Lee : Yes. Actually, no evidence that says independence or small change are gaining share. I mean our data on that is a little lagging, but I believe that when I look at the data and the industry, again the well-positioned bigger players are continuing to really outperform, and I think that\u2019s going to continue to be true as we move forward. Again, I haven't seen anything that says that where the large players are losing share. I just think that, when we think about employment, I think it is really hard for lower volume businesses to attract great team members because there is just not enough income to share at the service level and freedom in the business model to pay what you need to pay to attract really good talent in the back of the house. And so, I think our brands have a distinct advantage there, where our business model enables us to create an employment proposition that works for our team members. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thank you, very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. I think you said that, off-premise was 13% of sales and was growing around 13%. So, how much of that growth is incremental to the business? You know how much can off-premise grow as a percentage of sales without delivery? And Gene, I know you\u2019re being dismissive [ph], at least in the near-term around some of the delivery services, but how far are you thinking about may be leveraging some of Olive Garden particular scale and doing some in-house delivery yourself, especially for some of the smaller more individual size or family size deliveries. Gene Lee : Yes. And as you know, we do delivery for catering for minimum $100 order, 24 hours in advance is a very, very good business for us with a great check average and incredible satisfaction scores. We\u2019ll continue to look at whether $100 is the right place to be on that. Right now, we have no interest in delivering a $10 meal to \u2013 an individual meal to an individual household. That\u2019s just not a business that we think we want to be involved in right now. As far as where do we think to go and off-promise can go to, and there\u2019s a lot to do with what the consumer or what the consumer demand is for. We will continue to comp with innovative product offerings. We\u2019ll make the process have less friction in it through technology. We think we\u2019re doing an exceptional job in Olive Garden with packaging, and process are on time and correct orders continues to improve. So, we're feeling really good about where we are at. And my goal, our goal, and the team's goal is to create a compelling offer to that consumers, so they are still willing to come pick it up at our restaurant, and our growth in this business is reinforcing that we are doing a good job with it. And so that\u2019s where I want to be. And I have said publicly, if the consumer goes, wants to continue to go there, we could see Olive Garden get to 20% off-premise sales over time. John Ivankoe : And that is largely without delivery. So that\u2019s still with the $100 minimum delivery that you are current at? Gene Lee : Yes. And as I said John in my \u2013 I don't anticipate entering into a third-party delivery system agreement in a meaningful way. There are things that I really don't like about that business. John Ivankoe : Understood. And of that 13-point growth in this quarter, how much incremental business do you think that growth is giving you? Gene Lee : Well it was about 30% of our total growth for same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden this quarter. So, remember we still grew in restaurants significantly to determine what exactly how much is incrementality. It is a difficult proposition, but it was only 30% of our same restaurant sales growth. John Ivankoe : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO. Your line is now open. Andrew Strelzik : Hi, good morning. I have two questions. The first one, I\u2019m wondering about the relative margin progression at Olive Garden versus LongHorn with Olive Garden, obviously out comping LongHorn by a reasonable degree, they both expanded margins at the same rates. So, I guess I\u2019m wondering is there anything, kind of with respect to the models or maybe the mark-to-market that was disproportionate or even if there was any investments or anything like that that limited or drove the convergence of the margin progression this quarter? Gene Lee : Yes, Andrew. The easy answer is, Olive Garden had higher food inflation than LongHorn did. LongHorn\u2019s inflation was lower than Olive Garden. So, food cost favorability at LongHorn was greater than Olive Garden\u2019s. Andrew Strelzik : Okay. That makes sense. And then my other question, you know maybe Cheddar's is in exactly where you want it to be right now, but you have made a lot of progress on the integration, and I saw yesterday in the press release about the change to the board, comments outing the M&A expertise there, you know kind of what are the signposts you're looking for before you\u2019re ready to make another deal or maybe if you could comment on the M&A environment right now it would be great too? Gene Lee : Yes. We\u2019re focused right now on stabilizing and really getting off the Cheddar's business where we are not interested in doing anything else at this point in time. I\u2019m not sure, I'm not going to comment on the M&A environment, I'm not really involved in it. So, I don't really know. I don't have an opinion of it. Our focus is, we made an investment to get to bring Cheddar's into our portfolio, to take advantage of our platform. I actually believe in my heart that the operational challenges we\u2019ve had to face are making us really go back to the foundation of this business, and get it right. And if we didn't face these challenges and things may have been a little bit better, we may have gotten to the growth aspect a little quicker and not been able to sustain that into the future because there were real cracks in the foundation and we\u2019ve uncovered those cracks and now we will fix them to build a sustainable business.  So, that\u2019s what \u2013 I'm really excited about that, but our focus right now is, let\u2019s get Cheddar's moving in the right direction. When that\u2019s going in the right direction, we\u2019ll pull back. We\u2019ll look at our opportunities from an M&A standpoint, and we\u2019ll decide what we want to do. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you, very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Karen Holthouse : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Another question on guidance for the year. It does embed a little bit of a deceleration in comps as we move through the year. I know you mentioned the sort of intentional play to try and pull back on check mix or the check contribution at Olive Garden, is there anything else we should have on our radar, either in terms of compares or you know some conservatism around weather and winter or anything that would also be kind of impacting the cadence through the year on guidance? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Karen a couple of things. One, we did have the hurricane this quarter that offset last quarter's hurricane impact from last year of 30 basis points. Gene did mention the check moderation that you are trying to go forward with. And then we do have a little bit of a tough [ph] comparing the back half of the year. But our guidance is still in the higher end of our long-term framework. It\u2019s 2% to 2.5%, including Cheddar's, the drag on Cheddar's that we\u2019ve had so far. So, we feel really confident in the guide that we have and feel like it\u2019s actually an appropriate number. Karen Holthouse : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Stephen Anderson of Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Stephen Anderson : Yes. Good morning. And I wanted to follow-up with the [prior questions asked about] food cast at both Olive Garden and LongHorn. Last [indiscernible] you talked about 2% at food cost inflation, looking at some of the areas actually, poultry of well below year ago levels, as corn prices down, maybe a little bit lift in beef, but overall are you still looking at any change to your 2% overall inflation outlook? Rick Cardenas : No. We\u2019re not seeing any change to our overall 2% inflation, but remember that our outlook was 0% to 1% for food and beverage cost. Stephen Anderson : Great. Thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you. Right now, speakers, we do not have any questions in queue. You may now proceed. Gene Lee : That concludes our call. Thank you for participating and I want to remind you that we plan to release second quarter results on Tuesday, December 18 before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question and answer session. [Operator instructions]. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Sue. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2019 third-quarter earnings on March 21st before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights, and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the second quarter and update our outlook for fiscal 2019 before we take your questions. As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated Knapp Track excluding Darden. During our fiscal second quarter, industry total sales growth was 2.1%, industry same-restaurant sales grew 1.2%, and same-restaurant guest counts decreased 0.2%.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we had a solid quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.97 billion, an increase of 4.9%, same-restaurant sales grew 2.1%, and diluted net earnings per share were $0.92, an increase of 26% from last year's adjusted earnings. As industry sales continue to improve, we made the strategic choice to further reduce our incentives during the quarter, recognizing it would likely put pressure on our same-restaurant sales and traffic. This resulted in our gap to the industry narrowing. However, it enabled us to build a stronger guest base and contributed to our margin improvement, which Rick will discuss later. We continue to focus on the relentless execution of our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service, and atmosphere and strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages. Olive Garden had a solid quarter, which resulted in its 17th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 4.9%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 3.5% and 1.4% growth from new restaurants. Same-restaurant guest counts declined 0.8%, which was a direct result of reduced incentives during the quarter. Check average increased 4.3% this quarter, driven by 1.9% pricing and 2.4% menu mix. Menu mix was driven primarily by shifts in consumer preference and, to a lesser extent, a price increase for Never Ending Pasta Bowl and a reduction in incentives. During the quarter, Olive Garden's restaurant teams flawlessly executed their two most popular and strongest value promotions of the year : Buy One, Take One and Never Ending Pasta Bowl. Never Ending Pasta Bowl was supported for the fifth year in a row by the sale of the Olive Garden Pasta Pass, which once again met with enthusiasm and media buzz. Much of this excitement was driven by the introduction of the Annual Pasta Pass, which entitled 1,000 annual passholders to 52 weeks of Never Ending Pasta, resulting in all the passes being claimed in under a minute. Overall preference for Never Ending Pasta Bowl and value ratings were strong, even though the price was increased for the first time in five years. Olive Garden's off-premise business grew 10.3% and represented 14.6% of total sales for the quarter. They continue to focus on providing a great takeout and catering experience for their guests. I'm very pleased with this performance and their continued progress in this area. Finally, the Olive Garden team made investments to strengthen everyday value. First, they redesigned their menus to more prominently showcase two everyday value platforms : Unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks and the Cucina Mia create-your-own pasta. Second, they enhanced the value of one of their highest-preference entrees -- chicken alfredo -- by adding 50% more chicken. And finally, they launched their 5 for $5 beverage platform. I remain excited about the strategic investments the Olive Garden team is making to compete effectively while continuing to highlight their everyday value proposition. LongHorn Steakhouse also had a solid quarter. Total sales grew 6.4%, driven by 3.5% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.9%, their 23rd consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. The LongHorn team continues to make the right investments in the business, focused on quality, simplicity, and culture. That is why they have gone to the extraordinary lengths to continually train, test, and certify their grill masters, which has significantly improved their steaks' Grilled Correctly scores. They also continue to look for ways to simplify their operation. This quarter, they worked to reduce complexity in their recipes and improve culinary processes to ensure their team members are able to execute every time. Finally, strengthening LongHorn's unique culture is critical to executing this strategy. Their senior leadership team just concluded field visits with every manager in order to solicit feedback on how they can improve their guest and team member experience. These investments have resulted in a higher level of execution in their restaurants, which drove strong sales and profit performance during the quarter. This also led to all key guest satisfaction measures significantly exceeding the prior year. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales declined 1.4%, driven by a same-restaurant sales decline of 4%, which was partially offset by sales growth in new restaurants of 2.6%. While I am disappointed by the lack of progress in the top line, I am pleased with the progress that Cheddar's management team was able to make during the quarter. This included making a significant operational realignment to unify three different cultures with inconsistent operating procedures. As a result, the majority of their restaurant operators received a new leader, which created a short-term disruption, but was necessary to position Cheddar's for long-term success. I'm also pleased with the progress against the three strategic priorities : Staff to win, master the tools, and standardize and simplify. To support team members staffing, they have introduced consistent and more effective methods to attract, hire, train, and retain the right talent, and their teams have made meaningful progress increasing their staffing levels. Today, the restaurant management teams are using our proprietary tools to forecast their business with much more accuracy, enabling them to staff their restaurants properly to better serve their guests. And, we have introduced standards to create consistency across the brand. For example, during the highest-volume periods, restaurant managers are now positioned properly with one manager at the host stand, one managing the dining room, and one managing the kitchen, resulting in much better throughput. With this laser focus on the strategic priorities, they are seeing higher guest satisfaction scores, and those scores continue to improve each month, and in time, they should see better team member and management retention levels. The Cheddar's team is also working on culinary process improvements that we phased in over time. These efforts will lead to increased quality, consistency, and speed of service. There's still work to be done at Cheddar's to simplify the operation and consistently improve restaurant-level execution. They have a strong management team in place, and as they continue to implement our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy, they will make significant progress throughout this year and years to come. Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to close by saying thank you to our 180,000 team members. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they create exceptional experiences and lasting memories for our guests, so on behalf of the management team and the Board of Directors, thank you for all you do to help our guests celebrate this time of the year and for making our company successful, and I wish all of you a wonderful holiday season. Rick? Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we were pleased with our results in the second quarter, as total sales grew 4.9% from the addition of 40 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.1%. More importantly, with this sales growth came strong flow-through, resulting in expanded margins for the quarter, with restaurant-level EBITDA growing 40 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.92 grew 26% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. We also returned a total of $154 million to our shareholders this quarter, paying out $93 million in dividends and repurchasing $61 million in shares. Turning to the margin analysis for the quarter, food and beverage costs were favorable by 40 basis points as pricing of approximately 2% and cost savings net of investments more than offset both commodities inflation of under 1% and the unfavorable impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which we detailed in our last earnings call. Total labor inflation of over 3.5% and incremental workforce investments drove restaurant labor 50 basis points higher than last year despite continued sales leverage and productivity gains. As a reminder, Q2 was the final quarter of the incremental workforce investments we introduced last January. Restaurant expense was favorable 40 basis points, as sales leverage more than offset minimal inflation. In fact, our total restaurant expense in dollars per operating week were equal to last year. Marketing expense was favorable to last year by 20 basis points, driven by sales leverage, all resulting in restaurant-level EBITDA margin of 16.7% this quarter, 40 basis points better than last year. Below the restaurant level, general and administrative expense improved 20 basis points, as we lapped an unfavorable legal settlement from last year, which was partially offset by incremental workforce investments. We recorded $2.7 million of impairments during the quarter, which is included in our $0.92 diluted EPS. This impairment is related to a planned Olive Garden restaurant relocation and one future closing, also in Olive Garden. Taxes were favorable to last year as a result of tax reform. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.3%, which is higher than our annual expectation of between 10% and 11%. Turning to our segment performance, Olive Garden, LongHorn, and the Fine Dining segment all grew sales, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurants. Segment profit margin increased in each of these segments with strong flow-through and cost management, even after the incremental workforce investments. Sales for our Other Business segment grew 3.6%, driven by net new restaurants and incremental franchise revenue related to the adoption of the new accounting standard. Segment profit declined 110 basis points in this segment due to margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales, incremental workforce investments, and the adoption of revenue recognition. In this morning's press release, we increased our fiscal 2019 same-restaurant sales growth outlook to approximately 2.5% from the previous range of 2% to 2.5%. We also increased our EPS outlook to be between $5.60 and $5.70 from the previous range of $5.52 to $5.65. All other metrics in our financial outlook remain unchanged. Finally, and most importantly I want to wish all of our 180,000 team members and each of you a happy and safe holiday season.  Now, we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. You may go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Gene, just a question on the Olive Garden traffic and mix. I know you mentioned that Olive Garden made a choice to reduce the incentives this quarter, so could you elaborate on what exactly that means? And I think this quarter was one of the first in recent memory where Olive Garden did not outperform the industry on traffic, and I know that incentive adjustment might have been part of it, but just how do you think about that gap versus the industry and the importance of maintaining a positive or stable gap on the traffic side? And then, I have a follow-up related to the mix. Gene Lee : Okay. We headed into the quarter feeling like the industry was in fairly good shape, and we made the strategic choice to reduce our incentives, which primarily was coming through email. We ran 16 fewer weeks during the quarter. That included some weeks we had multiple offers out there last year. We really didn\u2019t have any offers out there this year. We felt it was with the demand environment being strong, it was a good opportunity to remove some of that incentives so that in the future, if needed be, we could add it back in. We also thought it was an opportunity to really, as we think about growing our sales profitably, we just felt like the environment was right, and we can basically get to the guest count for the reduced incentives, which was more than what we were down for the quarter. So we would have, if we had the same incentive level as we had the prior year, which has been consistently what we\u2019ve been running, we would have beat the industry. So we\u2019re not that really concerned about that. What we\u2019re really focused on is building a really healthy guest base and trying to ensure that we create some opportunity in the future if need be to put back some of these incentives into the business. I will add that I think the overall industry continues to perform well. The dynamics are changing. Large, nationally advertised brands are taking share with the advertising budgets being increased, and the industry is growing more promotional as check averages growth is less than 2% for the first time in a while. It will be interesting to see whether these large brands will continue to give up margin to advertise and promote in the intensity they\u2019ve been promoting at. David Tarantino : Yeah. And, that\u2019s maybe the nature of my follow-up, Gene. On the Olive Garden, check growth has been fairly substantial for the last two quarters. And I think I understand the dynamics there. But are you seeing anything in your data that would suggest the change in the perceived value equation at Olive Garden in a negative way related to that check growth? Gene Lee : No, we\u2019re seeing the exact opposite, David. We\u2019re seeing value go up. So, just a little more color on the mix change, we did make a couple menu moves halfway through the quarter to mitigate the mix growth. However, our investment in the chicken alfredo dish, we saw some significant increase in the mix there, and because the promotional calendar had the value promotions there, we saw a lot of trade up out of the promotional items into that item. We also saw -- with the increase in Never Ending Pasta Bowl from $1.00, we saw some trade out of that into regular higher-priced menu items, and then when you throw the dollar on, that had a little bit of contribution to the mix, and with less incentives that also contributed a little bit to the overall mix. So, we're seeing our value scores increase. I think the consumer is healthy; they're making those choices. We're giving them plenty of optionality. We\u2019re also focused on highlighting a couple other value options on our menu, made those more prominent, so I think right now, I feel really good where we're at. I think the dynamics will change a little bit in the back half of the year as our promotional calendar changes, and we'll have some more full-price promotions, and the trade will be a little bit different. So, I feel really good right now about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning, Gene and Rick. Question on the same-store sales guidance for the rest of the year. It implies that over the next two quarters, your business will trend as good or maybe even better than it just did in the second quarter, and this is really happening at a time when many expect the environment to soften in the next year, so what's driving your confidence in this forecast from the angle that you have? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Brian. Our forecast for the year of approximately 2.5% is driven by a few things. One is our confidence in what we've been doing for the last four years in improving our execution in the restaurants. If you look at our year-to-date, same-restaurant sales, it would basically assume it's a slightly lower number than what we are today, and if you look at a few other minor things, we've got weather. Last year's weather was a typical-year weather, and we expect it to not be dramatically worse than last year, so that should help versus what we've seen in the past. And, we've got just slight -- just slight improvements because of holiday shifts, not major, but those are the slight differences with where we were before. We feel really good about our same-restaurant sales estimates for the rest of the year, and we're looking forward to hitting them. Brian Bittner : Thanks, Rick. Last question is on Cheddar's. Gene, can you just talk about any progress you expect to see there moving forward? I know during the quarter for the first time, you got all the store-level management positions filled across the portfolio, which I would assume is a pretty big deal. Is this starting to drive any type of tangible improvement in the operations that you can speak to? Gene Lee : You know we're seeing -- as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're seeing for the first time a leading indicator that we're heading in the right direction, which is guest satisfaction. These scores are improving significantly each month, and we can point to things that we've done. We're seeing significant improvement on Friday and Saturday night now that we have managers positioned in the right place. Our throughput is up significantly. We're closing the gap on same-restaurant sales on those nights. So, we can see operationally some results. Now, they're just not manifesting themselves into the overall same-restaurant sales number. I will say that we've had a couple discrete issues in a couple restaurants that have really hurt the trend in the last couple weeks of the quarter. Those things will work themselves out. But, I am extremely optimistic right now with what I'm seeing. I think operationally, we had to make this reorg. We held off, but we had to unify these operating cultures, and our teams are really focused on the right things, and for the first time, we've got 98% of the restaurants have a managing partner or general manager in there. We're getting close to fully staffed. We're stopping the churn. We still have the 10 restaurants that we acquired in Georgia that are still down double digits. We expect that to lessen as we moved through the years. We've stabilized those restaurants with leadership. So, overall, I think that we're moving in the right direction, and I'm excited that J.W. and his team -- J.W. has only been in there just over three months, so he's still just getting out there, and listening to people, and trying to really hone in on the operational plan, but I think we're moving directionally in the right direction. I'm seeing something for the first time that gives me confidence with these guest satisfaction scores. The next big thing is can we see some improvement in the human resource metrics? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens, Inc. You may go ahead. Will Slabaugh : Yeah, thanks, guys. You mentioned this is the last quarter for the incremental workforce investment. Could you talk about what that headwind has been, if that's been different quarter to quarter, and maybe what we should expect a headwind would look like going forward? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Will. The overall incremental investments are about $9 million a quarter in the first quarter and in the second quarter. And if you recall, we started that last year in Q3, so we shouldn't have incremental investments in the back half of the year. So, the run rate investments are about $35 million, and if you recall, we did about $20 million last year, so we should be wrapping on that with no problem. Will Slabaugh : Okay, I appreciate that. And, just following back up on the Cheddar's comment, it sounds like you're pretty pleased with what's happening behind the scenes, and obviously, you want that to come through on the top line eventually, but I'm curious if you think at some point that may require additional investment of some sort. It sounds like much of that has been made, but just curious as we think about these investments going away if there might be needing to replace that or not. Rick Cardenas : No, I don't think there's anything additional from a big investment standpoint. We do think that some of the very large brands that are promoting real heavily right now and advertising is having a little impact on Cheddar's top line. So, we're trying to figure out maybe how we might market the business maybe a little bit differently to increase our share of voice where everybody else is out there pretty loud right now, but we don't see anything major. One of the things that's also exciting I didn't mention is cost managements improving dramatically with our tools in place. We're seeing food waste come down, we're just getting a labor management system up and running, so we think that we're going to see some cost benefits as we move forward in the next 12 months. The teams are really doing a good job in getting accustomed to our tools, so...another thing that we're excited about. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead. David Palmer : Hi. Quick follow-up on the price promotions over at Olive Garden. You mentioned that heading into the back half, you have some full-price promotions coming up and you feel good about those. Are you generally implying that you\u2019re going to have a little bit more comparable promoted price points and perhaps a little bit different and more even balance between traffic and check in the coming months? Gene Lee : I don't know if I, my point that I was trying to make there was the big change we made with our chicken alfredo dish and the positive mix change that had in Q2 was primarily because we had lower-priced promotions. As the promotional calendar goes up and the price point goes up in the third and fourth quarter, you\u2019ll have less trade, the trade will be less beneficial. And so, that was the point that I was trying to make. I feel good about our promotional calendar in the back half of the year. We\u2019re usually not, we\u2019re usually starting at price point to headline our promotions versus the deep value promotions. I think lastly on that question, David, as we try to develop our incentive strategy in the back half of the year, these levers are pretty easy for us to pull and we can do it pretty quickly, but if demand stays strong in the industry and we can achieve our same-restaurant sales targets. We will still not be using this lever a whole lot in the back half of the year. David Palmer : Got it. And just a quick question on delivery you can see everybody\u2019s grabbing a digital delivery partner these days. You still have double-digit off-premise growth at Olive Garden, but how is your thinking shifting with regard to delivery for those not catering delivery, but ultimately, individual delivery for Olive Garden? Thanks. Gene Lee : David, I have really no update on third-party. We continue to test a small group of restaurants and monitor the results. All I\u2019ll say is the economics of this have to change along with the execution. The execution of a third party has to improve dramatically. The satisfaction of the guest is not great using these services and we\u2019re focused on creating a great off-premise experience for our consumer. We\u2019ll encourage them to come pick it up. We\u2019re still growing at a good rate. I really like what\u2019s happened in that business. The satisfaction of our consumer using that experience is really high. And so at this point, we have no additional update really on third-party. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. You may go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Gene, one the industry, the competitive landscape, I\u2019m surprised to hear you say that despite the broader industry being better that you think you\u2019re seeing maybe a ramp up in discounting of the competition. Just wondering if your expectation over the next couple of quarters maybe is that you would start to expect the industry to pull back on the incentive similar to what you did, and perhaps where you see the industry comp over the next six months relative to what seems to your forecast to be in the 2.5% range. And then, I had one follow-up. Gene Lee : Yeah. I mean, as we look at what the industry\u2019s doing, we see increased advertising spending significant increase in advertising spending. The products that they\u2019re promoting are pretty aggressive in price and therefore, you\u2019re seeing check average for the industry get below 2%. We haven't seen that in a long time for any extended period of time. And so, we'll continue to monitor -- this is putting tremendous pressure on their margins, and we'll see how long they're willing to eat into their margin growth to have this kind of intensity out there. We think we're nimble enough that we can adjust to what's happening, and it'll be interesting for us to see what they do. We feel we have levers that we can pull, and we can compete effectively against them. Right now, we think the consumer is in a really good place. We're operating at our lowest unemployment in 50 years; confidence remains high. As we watch the guests, they're continuing to buy across our menus. They're adding on to their entrees, they're buying up -- it feels like it's a really good environment, so we think it's prudent to have the strategy that we have right now. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then, in terms of future potential tailwinds, there's a lot of talk about expectations in terms of tax refunds over the next few months, which I guess could be a significant tailwind for some, maybe not for others. I'm just wondering -- with your diverse brands across the consumer income spectrum, what are your thoughts in terms of how tax refunds will have an impact? Separately, I think fiscal '20 for you has a 53rd week. I was wondering if you would offer any directional color on the potential EPS impact. Thank you. Gene Lee : I'll let Rick answer the 53rd week. That's too complex for a CEO. So, what was the first...? Jeffrey Bernstein : The tax refund potential impact across your brands. Gene Lee : So, tailwinds -- Jeff, we do know that there's going to be -- we've heard any number -- $60 billion out there in the first quarter of tax refunds. We'll see how that plays out. Obviously, that's a positive. I think that...we don't have the same tailwinds that we had going into our fiscal '19 -- the first half. In the second half -- we got some on the first half -- I just think overall, the biggest tailwind of all is sub-4% unemployment, which is a real positive. As long as the consumer feels confident that they're going to keep their job and that wages are going to grow, I think that the restaurant environment should be pretty positive. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, and as it relates to the 53rd week, that is our last fiscal week of next year, and it's roughly about a 2% increase in EPS. It's one week out of 52, and that's really how it flows. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim. You may go ahead. Matt DiFrisco : Thank you. I just have a follow-up question on some of the margin questions here. I know you had on the slide here on your presentation the labor, and you broke that down -- that's very helpful. Just curious, Rick -- on the 1.2% inflation for Q2, what's embedded in your outlook for the remainder of the year? Rick Cardenas : For the remainder of the year, we still expect total labor to be about 4.5%-5.5% for the year, so if you just get the midpoint of that about 4% -- which is what we've been running, so, as we said, a little over 3.5% for the last quarter, so we don't expect it to dramatically change, and we haven't changed our outlook for overall inflation. Our overall total inflation outlook is still 2%, which includes labor and commodities. Matt DiFrisco : Okay. So, when you look at the labor line when you have the 1.2%, you're netting that number, then. So, the 4% -- you're just netting that versus the comp, basically? Rick Cardenas : No, the 1.2% is the labor percent impact of inflation. Matt DiFrisco : Got it. Rick Cardenas : So, that was the impact, and again, with a little over 3.5% labor inflation, that shows up to 1.2% labor percent. Matt DiFrisco : Understood. And then, just looking at the productivity in Other, assuming that those are related more so to ongoing things and momentum behind the business, or were those somewhat related to specific to this current period with less incentives and less discounting, or are those new processes in place that you think continue throughout the year? Rick Cardenas : No, those are things that we've been working on for the last few years. All of the productivity enhancements -- as you remember, we've done a lot of work at Olive Garden, we've been simplifying the menu at LongHorn, we're starting to do some work at Cheddar's. We would expect that our productivity would continue to improve. Whether it's 40 basis points going forward, or 20, or 60, I can't answer that question, but we do expect to continue productivity improvements going forward. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. You may go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thanks. I have a question on Olive Garden comps, and then a quick follow-up on the other segments. On Olive Garden, obviously, you seem very confident in the comp drivers through the year, but I wonder if you could put it into context in the last few years in the sense that you noted 17 quarters of positive comp, which roughly corresponds to when you took the helm and refocused on value. So, is there any risk that there was a lot of low-hanging fruit on that front, and then, perhaps it just gets more difficult from here, or just about basic blocking and tackling in the sense of improvement in customer scores or satisfaction is somewhat asymptotic and you've kind of leveled out? Just trying to get a sense of how you think about this run of very strong comps in historical context. And then, again, I have a follow-up question. Gene Lee : Good morning, Sara. You brought up a lot of good points there. We have done a lot over the last four years with Olive Garden to reestablish the brand as the value leader. However, this still -- I still believe today there's a lot of opportunity for us to improve across our fleet of restaurants. We think that scale gives us a competitive advantage in Olive Garden. We're able to continue to find productivity enhancements. We think there are future investments that we can continue to make to increase value. I think the big difference between where we are today in this cycle versus where we were seven or eight years ago when Olive Garden was into a good growth cycle is that we're making investments back into the business. When I studied the history last time, Olive Garden started to drift maybe a little upscale and really didn't focus on what gave them the great advantage. I think the decision the management team made to increase the chicken alfredo portion by 50% in protein is an example of what we'll continue to do to be able to increase value and drive guest counts and sales into the future. We think we have some other opportunities. We're being innovative from a marketing standpoint. I think our marketing is as relevant today as it has been in a long time. And, more importantly, I think the younger consumer -- the millennials -- they really enjoy Olive Garden. They enjoy the value in it. They enjoy the communal piece of it, of coming together and enjoying a meal, so I think it's really well positioned, and we're going to continue to double down on simplification and value. And so, we think that we\u2019re well positioned to continue to compete effectively into the future. Sara Senatore : That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And then, just on the other business segment, I notice that Yard House is obviously small. It had a negative comp in the quarter, which we hadn\u2019t seen in a while. I was just trying to understand if there\u2019s something about varied menu that\u2019s particularly competitive, or is there any risk that maybe Cheddar\u2019s is taking managerial attention or resources away from the other brands. Just trying to understand if there\u2019s anything to read into that. Gene Lee : Yeah. Let me be very clear about this. Cheddar\u2019s is not taking any managerial focus away from any of the other brands. I mean these other brands have full presence, full management teams that have nothing to do with Cheddar\u2019s. I would just say on Yard House, we had a positive two year comp. We had a couple high-volume restaurants that had some pressure. For those who are familiar, the Link in L.A. had scaffolding all around our building as they were building a zipline in from some place to drop people off in front of our restaurants, which had an impact. California was a little soft. We had some restaurants in Florida that were a little soft toward the end of the quarter. I\u2019m focused on total growth on Yard House, and we\u2019re opening a lot of restaurants, which also creates some churn inside the system. Overall, Yard House is an extremely strong brand and I do think that from time to time, we\u2019ll fluctuate, especially with some of these high-volume restaurants. They can swing the comp a little bit. But, I feel really good about where Yard House is positioned. We\u2019re opening some great restaurants and I\u2019m really excited about their future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. You may go ahead. Peter Saleh : Great, thanks. Gene, I just wanted to come back to the Cheddar\u2019s commentary. Is this the first quarter that you\u2019re seeing the guest satisfaction scores improve at Cheddar\u2019s and is this the highest they\u2019ve been since you guys acquired the brand? Gene Lee : They\u2019ve been improving for the last six months, but right now they are at the highest they\u2019ve been since we acquired them. Our value ratings are still extremely strong in this business. And so, we feel really good about where we are. We know hour-to-hour today, we\u2019re running these restaurants better than we were six to nine months ago, and we can see it in the results. Peter Saleh : And then historically, when you look at your other brands, what has been the lag between seeing the improving guest satisfaction scores and then starting to see the top line starting to trend better as well? Gene Lee : Well, I\u2019m not so sure that there\u2019s a perfect correlation in any of that because there\u2019s marketing; there\u2019s other things in the environment. All I know is that in all my years of experience, once we get the leading indicators going in the right direction, sales will follow. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. John Glass : Hi. Thanks very much. First, just on the off-premise business, it\u2019s been growing strongly for a number of quarters. It didn\u2019t grow quite at the same rate quarter. Is that just a function of the base effect, it\u2019s just a bigger business, so compounding is harder? Did some of the changing in promotional activities maybe impact that business as well as the dine-in business? Can you just talk about your current views on the incrementality of that business? Is that still a very strong different customer, different occasion, or how do you measure incrementality of the off-premise business? Gene Lee : Yeah. Hi, John. I think the answer to your questions are yes and yes. I think as this gets bigger, it\u2019s going to be harder to continue to grow it at a compounded growth rate. I\u2019m thrilled with 10%. This is a big business now. Yes, we did pull back on some incentives that had some impact on off-premise. This time of year, off-premise gets to be pretty strong, so we definitely want to make sure that we're taking advantage and that we're getting full price. The incrementality of this business is always hard to really measure. We do know by looking at the demographics of the people that are using us that a lot of these off-premise customers are only off-premise customers, and they don't really dine inside an Olive Garden all that much. They're probably using a chef-driven restaurant or a higher-end restaurant. So, we believe all that\u2019s incremental. But, the bottom line the way I think about it is you're in the top of mind for that occasion, and you need to win the occasion -- as many occasions that you possibly can, and whether that impacts you into the future -- I don't know, I just think those are two totally different occasions, and what we work hard at is being top of mind in each of them, and we'll never know for sure what's incremental and what's not. We just know we want to play, we want to be very good, the best at off-premise, and try to create a frictionless experience. We want to be the very best of in-restaurant that we can possibly be, and that's what we're working hard at. John Glass : Thank you. And then, just to follow up, what is the current state of the estate for the two major brands? We've seen a lot of capital go into the limited-service restaurant industry. I think some of our competitors are continuing to upgrade their assets. How do you feel relative to the competitive set and relative to your own expectations about the estate, both at Olive Garden and LongHorn, and remodel possibilities if there is one over time? Gene Lee : We feel pretty good. We've been working hard at the Olive Garden. We've done approximately 230 remodels to date in the last four years; we did 28 in the quarter. We've got a few more to do -- we've got another 70 to do to get that fleet up to speed. Then, we're going to start just freshening the Farm Houses, which will not take nowhere near the capital that the RevItalia restaurants needed, so we feel like that fleet's in really good shape. We think LongHorn has got a little bit more of a timeless d\u00e9cor. The capital that we're putting into LongHorn right now is really to upgrade the off-premise experience, so we're putting a little bit of capital in there to create a space for the consumer to be able to make the experience a little less frictionless than it has been in the past. So, we feel good. We think our buildings have stood the test of time. The other thing I would add -- and, this is pre-this management team, and we've been able to continue it on -- is Darden has always done a great job with its maintenance capital and keeping its restaurants looking fabulous. There's times I walk into an Olive Garden that's 25 years old that really hasn't been remodeled recently, and I'll look around and say, \"Boy, this place looks great. We've got good furniture, we're well painted, it looks clean.\" And so, our team has done a great job keeping these buildings in outstanding condition. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Greg Francfort with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Greg Francfort : Hey. I had two margin questions. The first one is for Rick. I think in the first quarter, you had said wage inflation was 5%, and this quarter, it was just over 3.5%. Are those comparable numbers, and what are you seeing in terms of that step-down in terms of your wage pressure? Rick Cardenas : What we said in the first quarter, I believe, is that hourly wage inflation was about 5%, but total inflation was closer to 3.5%, so these are comparable -- a little over 3.5% is very comparable to what we've been seeing before. Greg Francfort : Understood, thanks. And then, Gene, one thing we've seen that I think has been a multi-year story for Olive Garden and Darden has been marketing dropping as a percent of sales. I guess, what's the strategy there, and what level are you looking to see or trying to get to in terms of marketing, and where are you cutting back, and where are you reinvesting? Gene Lee : You broke up a little bit. I hate to ask -- can you repeat the question? Greg Francfort : No worries. Marketing as a percent of sales has been dropping for a few years. What's the overall strategy, what's the long-term goal, where are you trimming back, where are you reinvesting on that front, and where do you see that going over the long term? Gene Lee : Yeah. First of all, it's been dropping at the Darden level because of brand mix. As the smaller brands start to grow with a little less marketing spend, it's levering that down a little bit. We've worked hard over the last four years to decrease our non-working media. That was an area I thought that was a big opportunity inside Darden, so we've been able to eliminate some of those costs, and some of those non-working costs we transferred to working, and some of them we've been able to just put back into the P&L. We're going to continue with our big brands really honing in our advertising, improving our messaging, getting our messaging in the right place at the right time. And so, we think that our current spending levels are appropriate to support these businesses. I think that's why new unit growth in Olive Garden is so important, because we get to leverage the advertising spend. In some situations, it's the same for Olive Garden, and we'll continue to find ways to appropriately spend for our smaller brands. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. You may go ahead. Chris O'Cull : Thanks, good morning. Rick, the earnings guidance seems to imply the growth in restaurant-level costs per operating week would be at a greater rate in the back half of the year than what you saw in the last quarter. I understand commodity costs may be higher, but why would labor costs and restaurant expenses per operating week start to grow at a faster rate? Rick Cardenas : Well, this quarter, the restaurant expenses actually were flat, so they didn't grow at all. So we would expect normal inflation to happen in the restaurant expense line. As we've said, we've had very minimal inflation on the food and beverage line, and we expect our inflation to tick up in the back half of the year. We're also making investments. Gene mentioned the investment that Olive Garden made in the chicken alfredo. And finally, we've got a little bit of timing in the marketing line. We would expect our marketing as a percent to lever year-over-year, but it might be a little bit higher than it was in the last quarter. Chris O'Cull : Okay, that's helpful. Gene, were the leadership Cheddar's recruited from within Darden or outside the company? And maybe can you discuss if you've made any changes to the operators' bonus metrics or how they're incentivized? Gene Lee : Everybody that's on the Cheddar's management team in senior levels are long-term Darden employees who understand our systems, understand our thought process, understand our branding. And, as far as bonus, Cheddar's this year is on the bonus program that all our other restaurant brands are on for the first time, which heavily incentivizes sales growth and profit growth. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. You may go ahead. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning. Two questions for me. Last quarter, you mentioned an improvement in the retention rates at Cheddar\u2019s and it sounds like maybe they took a step back this quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering what are some of the challenges that you\u2019re finding with respect to the HR metrics and retention specifically at Cheddar\u2019s. And number two, we all know about the cost environment in the restaurant space and you mentioned about the importance of advertising budgets with respect to driving sales. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment a little bit more about maybe what you\u2019re seeing in the independent restaurants. Are you seeing accelerated closures given the cost side or any change in behaviors there? That would be a helpful color. Gene Lee : Okay. On Cheddar\u2019s retention, it hasn\u2019t gone backwards; it hasn\u2019t made the improvement I was hoping for. I think what we\u2019re struggling with both at the team member and management level here is expectations, right. We\u2019ve come in, we\u2019re starting to put in some structure and some processes, the expectations are a little higher. And so, when you go through this kind of turnaround, you do end up losing some management along the way. A lot of some, of the management that was in the system was tethered to the old management. They had worked with them before and when you make those changes those folks leave. So, I\u2019m confident that we will start seeing the Cheddar\u2019s human resource metrics start to come toward the Darden norms. And when we see that, I think our operations will improve. It took us a couple years to make those improvements happen in Yard House. And I expect that we\u2019ll make progress here over the next 12 months. Its basic things and I know I keep coming back to this but we didn\u2019t have an effective way to train new employees. We don\u2019t have a great certified trainer program that we have in all of our other businesses. Now, we\u2019re developing that and we\u2019re implementing that. We have to ensure that everybody that we hire goes through a great training program. On the independent restaurant scene we know. Again, the CREST data has been saying for years that large brands are taking share from smaller brands and independent restaurants. We\u2019ve seen some closures out there for independent restaurants but as I said before most of the time once a restaurant is a restaurant, it stays a restaurant, it just flips its name and goes down for two or three months, and then someone else comes in and tries to make it work. So, again we\u2019re in an up cycle which is when a lot of people think they want to be in the restaurant business. So, independents are there. I think it\u2019s tough for them to compete in this environment. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brandon Sonnemaker with J.P. Morgan. You may go ahead. Brandon Sonnemaker : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just to clarify, labor costs in the quarter, it came in better than expected relative to our model. Obviously, you experienced 50 bps of labor deleverage this quarter. Once the 30 bps of workforce investment rolls off, you mentioned the productivity savings will continue to improve. Just to be clear, is it your expectation that the amount of labor deleverage moderates in the back half? Rick Cardenas : Yes, just a little bit. Brandon Sonnemaker : Okay, great. And then, you mentioned two promotions during the quarter, Buy One, Take One and Never Ending Pasta. I believe these were also run during the same period last year. Would you mind sharing if these were run for less weeks relative to last year. And could you also clarify your expectation for the back half of the year? Will you have more or less promotions relative to last year? Gene Lee : Yeah. You broke up again for some reason. Could you repeat that question? Brandon Sonnemaker : Yeah. Just Buy One, Take One and Never Ending Pasta Bowl during the quarter -- I believe those were run during the same period last year. Would you mind sharing if those were run for less weeks relative to last year? And then, your expectation for the back half, whether promotions will be up or down relative to last year. Gene Lee : Buy One, Take One and Never Ending Pasta Bowl were the exact same as last year, and we expect our promotional calendar to mirror pretty much what we did last year in the back half of the year. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. You may go ahead. Nicole Miller : Good morning. I wanted to understand a little bit more about the relatively higher-end concept, so could you talk about Cap Grille, Eddie V's, and the performance there? Is that driven mostly by check or traffic? And then, the second part of the question -- is it coming from the main dining room, or is there something in private dining that would account for those trends? And then, anything you'd be willing to share on the holiday progression so far? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yeah. We had another strong quarter in our upscale businesses. Capital Grille had a great quarter, continues to focus on driving guest counts. I would say there's guest counts and check in those numbers. Capital Grille is adding a little bit of capacity in a few restaurants, which has been helpful. We've got a lot of restaurants at full capacity, so we're managing full capacity and price, but the business is performing well. We're making meaningful progress in Eddie V's. We're real excited about the progress we've made there, especially on the income statement. That P&L is starting to look more like a Capital Grille P&L over time as the cost structure comes into line, so we think there's tremendous upside there. We've got a pretty good pipeline for Eddie V's, and we've got some good pipeline for Capital Grille in the future, which we'll discuss in an upcoming call, so we're excited about that. I'm not going to talk about private dining in December. Just know those businesses are healthy; they're running good. Let me sneak in a comment here about Seasons also because we're making great progress in Seasons. Although same-restaurant sales were down for the quarter, guest counts were positive. We've been making the strategic choice to bring check average down a little bit. And, I'm also thrilled with -- John Martin's overseeing that business right now, and he's taken a lot of costs out of the business that needed to be taken out, and year-over-year profitability is up. So, I'm excited about the direction of Seasons 52. We've got a good pipeline there, and I think that business is well positioned to really start to make a meaningful growth push into the future. Nicole Miller : And, just a quick follow-up -- when you talk about capacity, do you make additions at the bar, the main dining room, or private dining? Gene Lee : We've closed a few patios, which have given us an extra 25 seats in restaurants, so that gives us full utilization of that space year-round. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Stephen Anderson with Maxim Group. You may go ahead. Stephen Anderson : Yes. This is a follow-up to Nicole's question on Capital Grille. Have you seen any kind of -- with the recent volatility in the financial markets, have you seen any declines in the business in some of the walk-in business for Cap Grille, and maybe to a lesser extent, at Eddie V's? Just wanted to see your thoughts about that. Gene Lee : No, Stephen. We haven't seen any of that. Again, 3.7% Cap Grille for the quarter -- it's been strong, and we've got some restaurants in New York City, and it's been strong, so we haven't seen anything correlated to what's going on in the markets. Operator : Thank you. And, there are no further questions. I'll now turn it back to Kevin Kalicak for any closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Thanks again, Sue. That concludes our call, and I'd like to remind everyone that we plan to release third-quarter results on Thursday, March 21st before the market opens, with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. All participants may disconnect.",

Your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question and answer session [Operator instructions]. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Sue. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter earnings on June 20th before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the quarter before updating our outlook for fiscal 2019, and providing initial guidance for fiscal 2020. Then we will take your questions. As a reminder, all references to industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated Knapp Track excluding Darden. During our fiscal third quarter, industry total sales grew 2.1%, industry same-restaurant sales grew 0.8% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 1%. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.25 billion, an increase of 5.5%, more than double the industry benchmark. Lead by strong same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse Darden same restaurant sales grew 2.8% and diluted net earnings per share were $0.80, an increase of 5.3% from last year's adjusted earnings. This strategy we implemented four years ago is still a right strategy today and it continues to drive our success. Our operating teams remain focused on food, service and atmosphere while at the Darden level we continue to concentrate on our four competitive advantages; one, leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages; two, using our extensive data and insights to improve operating fundamentals and to better understand our guest and communicate with them more effectively; three ensuring our brand systematically go through a rigorous strategic planning process; and four, cultivating our results oriented culture to enable growth. I\u2019m really product of our teams and the results they to continue to achieve. It may sound simple but consistency and flawless execution are hard to accomplish day-in and day-out. Our leadership teams remain focused on simplifying the business and they continue to find more ways to do so. Olive Garden has strong quarter, which resulted in its 18th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 5.3%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 4.3% and 1% growth from new restaurants. Same restaurant guest counts grew 0.1% even as we continue to reduce incentives. Olive Garden outperformed the industry benchmark across all these metrics. Check average increased 4.2% this quarter, driven by 1.8% pricing and 2.4% menu mix. This mix was driven primarily by consumer preference as guest reacted positively to our promotions and our chicken alfredo entr\u00e9e that now have continued 50% more chicken. The reduced incentives also had a positive impact on mix. These results were driven by Olive Garden\u2019s focus on operational execution, everyday value, off-premise and a strong promotional lineup. The third quarter is highlighted by the busy holiday season and Olive Garden Restaurants' teams were well prepared to deliver exceptional guest experiences, which led to record sales and profit for the month of December. The restaurant teams also flawlessly executed two new exciting promotions Oven Baked Pastas and Never-Ending Stuffed Pasts, while reaching all-time highs for overall guest satisfaction. Olive Garden\u2019s value ratings also reached record levels as they continue to reinforce their everyday value platforms, such as lunch duals, early dinner duos and Cucina Mia across all just communication touch points. Finally, Olive Garden's off-premise business grew 13% and represented 15.9% of total sales for the quarter. On Valentine's Day, which is the second busiest day of the year, off-premise sales grew 20% and more guests took advantage of the convenience of online ordering with 52% increase in online orders. The Olive Garden team continues to operate at a high level and I'm confident that the strategic focus will enable them to continue competing effectively. Longhorn steakhouse had another solid quarter. Total sales grew 6.7%, driven by 2.9% growth from new restaurant and same restaurant sales growth of 3.8%, the 24th consecutive quarter of same restaurant sales growth. Same restaurant guest counts grew by 0.5%. Longhorn outperformed the industry benchmarks across all of these metrics. This performance was driven by improved operational execution, compelling promotions supported by Longhorn's \u201cYou Can\u2019t Fake Steak\u201d advertising campaign and their industry-leading retention. Longhorn team continues to manage business for the long-term anchored in their strategy of increasing the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging the unique culture to increase team member engagement. To ensure they deliver on quality, Longhorn continued focus on growing steaks correctly. Thanks to several efforts designed to simplify responsibilities across the restaurant teams, they once again achieved a record high steaks growth correctly scored during the quarter. Also during the quarter, Longhorn received the best practices award from the people report, which recognizes the best workplace cultures in casual dining. Longhorn continues to find unique ways to drive higher levels of passion and pride among its team members. During the quarter, they introduced Grill Master Legends, a program designed to celebrate culinary team members who have grilled more than 1 million steaks. The team at Longhorn is laser focused on this strategy, which is reflected by the strong sales and profit performance during the quarter. They continue to make sound business decisions and I\u2019m pleased with the momentum they have created. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales increased 1%, driven by sales growth from new restaurants of 3.7%, partially offset by same restaurant sales decline of 2.7%. The Cheddar's team remains focused on their three strategic priorities. They have to win, master the tools, standardize and simplify. They've been focused on establishing strong, stable restaurant leadership teams that strengthen culture and build team member engagement. And now for the first time, our manager and training pipeline is on par with our other brands, which will enable Cheddars to manage turnover and new restaurant opening more effectively. While I\u2019m encouraged by the initial improvement we saw in some of the HR metrics during the quarter, I want to see these improve at a quicker pace. During the quarter, the restaurant teams continue to build acumen with the tools that have been implemented this year. The Cheddars improve their skills with reporting tools that included discount forecasting and food waste management. These productivity tools are leading to better cost controls across the P&L. Finally, their focus on implementing consistent standards like having managers present in the kitchen, lobby and dining room during peak periods is having a positive impact. Ensuring managers are consistently engaged in the service experiences led to meaningful improvement and key guest satisfaction measures, including overall ratings, speed and service metrics. Cheddar's made meaningful progress during the quarter, and while I\u2019m encouraged to see the sales trend improved. While the work is far from over, I\u2019m confident that the team at Cheddar's has the right plan in place and I\u2019m pleased by the results we're beginning to see. Before I turn over to Rick, I want to close by saying thank you to 180,000 team members. As I noted in the beginning of the call, our strategy is working. And that\u2019s due to the commitment of our restaurant teams to be brilliant with the basics and to the tremendous support provided by the team here at our restaurant support center. So on behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, thank you all for everything you do to help us on every day. Rick? Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results were strong with total sales growth of 5.5% from the addition of 39 net new restaurants and same restaurant sales growth of 2.8%. We expanded margins again this quarter with restaurant level EBITDA growth of 40 basis points and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of the $1.80 was 5.3% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. As anticipated, this was our lowest quarterly earnings growth for the year as we lapped the year-to-date favorable tax true up in last year's third quarter related to the implementation of tax reform. During the quarter, we returned a total of $166 million to our shareholders paying out $92 million in dividends and repurchasing $74 million in shares. Turning to the margin analysis for the quarter. Food and beverage costs were 28.4% of net sales. Commodities inflation increased to just over 1% this quarter. This combined with unfavorable menu mix resulted in a 10 basis point increase in food and beverage expense. The menu mix impact was driven by guests choosing higher-priced items with the higher cost of sales percentage, providing our guests the better value. Restaurant labor of 31.7% was favorable 40 basis points, driven by several factors that more than offset overall labor inflation of just over 3.5%. First, pricing leverage contributed 60 basis points of favorability and incremental sales leverage from higher check mix and improved labor productivity contributed another 70 basis points of favorability. Next we gained 20 basis points of favorability as the labor performance in our new restaurants improved and new restaurant growth was skewed to brands with lower restaurant labor than the overall Garden average, primarily Longhorn resulting in favorable brand mix. Finally, we had approximately 10 basis points of favorability from year-over-year mark to market performance. Restaurant expense of 16.9% was favorable 10 basis points as sales leverage offset inflation and marketing expense were 2.8% and was flat on a year-over-year basis. This all resulted in restaurant level, EBITDA margin of 20.3% this quarter, 40 basis points better than last year. Below the restaurant level, general and administrative expense improved 30 basis points to 4.6% this quarter. Half of this favorability was related to sales leverage and strong cost management, while the other half was related to favorable year-over-year mark-to-market expense. We also recorded $1.6 million of net impairments during the quarter, which is primarily related to a future restaurant closing. This net impairment charges is included in our $1.80 diluted net EPS. Taxes were unfavorable to last year as we cycled through the implementation of tax reform in the third quarter of last year as I mentioned earlier. Turning to our segment performance. All of our segments grew both sales and segment profit dollars. Segment profit margin increased in the Longhorn, Olive Garden and fine dining segments, driven by positive same restaurant sales and cost management. Segment profit margin declined 30 basis points in our other business segments due to margin deleverage from negative same restaurant sales and the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards. Now, on to our outlook for this fiscal year and a few items of note for fiscal 2020. As stated in this morning's press release, we increased our financial outlook for fiscal 2019. We now expect total sales growth of approximately 5.5%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of between 2.5% and 2.7%. And effective tax rate of approximately 10% and diluted average shares outstanding for the year to be between 125 million and 126 million. This all results in an increased diluted net EPS outlook to be between $5.76 and $5.80 from the previous range of $5.60 to $5.70. Our new EPS outlook represents a growth rate of approximately 20% versus last year's adjusted diluted EPS. Looking ahead, we are providing some preliminary guidance for fiscal 2020. We currently anticipate total capital spending of between $450 million and $500 million, of which $240 million to $265 million is related to approximately 50 growth new restaurant opening. And $210 million to $235 million is related to ongoing restaurant maintenance remodels, technology and other spending. In addition to the CapEx and new unit guidance we typically give during our third quarter announcements, we want to highlight two unique items that will impact our fiscal 2020 earnings. First, as we mentioned on last quarter's call, fiscal 2020 is at 53 week year and we anticipate a positive impact on diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately $0.15. Second, as we've outlined in our filings with the SEC, we will be implementing ASC 842 the new accounting standard for leases in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. In our filings, we have indicated that we don't anticipate this standard having a material impact on our consolidated earnings. While we are still finalizing the effect of this new standard we'll have on our consolidated financial statements, we currently estimate this will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.05. In our fourth quarter conference call in June, we plan to provide more details on the specific impact of various P&L categories, as well as to our consolidated balance sheet. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Gene, I know you don\u2019t want to necessarily talk about inter-quarter trends on same store sales. But is there any reason to believe that as the consumers lapping the benefits of tax reform from last year, the consumption rates or spending patterns somehow have changed really in calendar '19 or not? Gene Lee : John, you guys giving me a warm up question this morning before you went there. Let me address it. I think the consumer environment today continues to be strong, confidence remains strong wages are growing across all different parts of the population. I think if we look back last year at this time, we were trying to quantify that the tax reductions were actually working their way into the business. And I\u2019m not sure that we were able to really say that. So I\u2019m not really worried about year-over-year changes based on was there little bit more tax money with the consumer where they feel is strong. I think the consumer today is really strong, and I really like the position that we are in. And I think we're seeing it in all of dining. When you look back at our last quarter with Darden, the industry grew approximately 3% total growth and that\u2019s a really good number. I'm excited about that. I think we're going to continue to be able to grow share in that environment. So I think the consumer is really strong at this point. John Glass : And then just on your other business brands they've comped negatively collectively for two quarters, and I understand Cheddar's has been well discussed. But is there any generalization, or any takeaway you have from that in terms of how those brands may have been impacted more from a competitive environment or do you think it's just idiosyncratic to those individual brands? Gene Lee : Well, I think there is three things that are happening. There is no doubt that large brands are taking share that are little bit more competitive. They have increased the advertising. I think the value propositions in the large brands have improved, number one. Number two, I think that we're taking a long-term approach in each of those brands to ensure that we're really making sure that our advertising is right we pull back on some incentives. And I think the third part of it is, especially with Yard House and Breeze, Yard House really suffered from the cold and wet on the West Coast. We lost a lot of capacity -- our outside dining an important part there. And we have the same issue in Florida. Florida was not as cold, but it was very wet during the quarter, and we lose a lot of capacity with Breeze and Yard House in Florida. So, I think there is some issues there. And as far as seasons goes, we've been readjusting that menu and bringing down the overall check average, which has been great. And the teams done wonderful job there. We've been able to improve the profitability seasons dramatically in the last year. So I\u2019m really pleased with where they're at. I think our other smaller brands are really healthy, making great long-term decisions and had some impact with things out of their control. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. You may go ahead. Sara Senatore : One question and then one follow up. I wanted to talk about value and competition. I think some of your casual dining competition is talking about perhaps taking more price, or relying more heavily on ticket just an offset to some of the inflationary pressures we\u2019re seeing. So to the extent that that you\u2019re seeing that more broadly, I was wondering if that\u2019s the case. And also is that an opportunity for you to take traffic share or would you approach it as more an opportunity to maybe the raise the pricing umbrella yourself and support margin. So just trying to think about that traffic versus margin trade-off is in fact we\u2019re seeing some of your competitors being willing to taka little bit more price? Gene Lee : I think it's going to be a combination of both. I will reminder everybody of our strategy is to try to use our scale to really under-price the competition long-term and being able to come up with some productivity enhancements to help offset some inflation, so that\u2019s really part of the strategy. Depending on what others do then we will react to that and hopefully it will be an opportunity for us to be able to maybe pass on a little bit more pricing than we have in the past, but maintain our strategy of under-pricing the competition but also uses an opportunity to gain some share. Sara Senatore : And then just the follow up is on Cheddar's. I know you're saying that you want to do some of the HR management and improve more quickly. I\u2019m just trying to figure out how you effect that change. And at what point we would expect to see that in maybe even a sharper inflection in the same store sales? Gene Lee : I think that what we're really looking for is we need to make really good decisions who we decide to be our managing partners of our restaurants, because they have such an impact on the overall stability at the teams. So as we continue to learn the people, learn their capabilities, our teams will start making better decisions on who they decide to leave the unit. And that is when I think about this business that is the most important decision we make, and has the biggest impact on our overall success is who we decide has to run our individual restaurants. And as our management team is developing some more tenure with JW being in now for little bit over six months, Paul's been there a year, they are learning the people and they've made some better decisions. And I think that will be the key to really, really stabilizing the team members and getting that -- getting the retention levels closer to Darden norms, which is what I\u2019m looking for. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens. You may go ahead. Will Slabaugh : First on Olive Garden, it seems like their range of everyday value options broaden a little bit I think with the launch in early dinner duos on top of Cucina Mia platform. So can you share how your value piece of transactions relative to historical quarters looked this quarter? And then at the same time, you continue to pick up higher than normal check. I was wondering if you could help us out with what's driving most of that, whether it's that lack of incentives that you talk about the past couple of quarters that you are offering or maybe the promotions that you're advertising driving more of it? Gene Lee : Will, I was only able to catch the last part of that question on mix, so I\u2019m going to address that. And I'll give you back the microphone, and maybe you can check your headpiece or whatever you speaking into, because you really muffled. But on the mix, a couple of things really driving that up. The promotional menus have been very strong and we\u2019re seeing this consumer that I described in the opening that's really strong is really been upgrading in the promotional constructs that we've offered. So that's been a significant part of the overall mix. Now there are a lot of little things contributing to the mix also, such as there is fairly significant win and when you add them up, you\u2019re getting that 2.5% or approximately 2.5%. You\u2019re getting benefit from less incentives, you're getting benefit from catering and delivery, you're getting benefit from the $5 beverage platform that we're running. And so we've got a lot of things going on that are all seem to work. We made a couple changes to what we call food and wine menu and what we picture that contributed. So overall, and as I mentioned, the chicken alfredo with the increased portion size of the chicken is doing extremely well to, so great promo offerings and a bunch of other little things really contributing to the mix. Will Slabaugh : I will give the first part one more shot, it seems like the range of everyday value options has broadened a little bit with the launch in early dinner duos on top of the Cucina Mia platform that you have been offering. So I was wondering if you could share how that value piece of our transactions look this quarter relative to historical quarters? Gene Lee : I think they all continue to grow especially we\u2019re starting to get into our second full year of early dinner duos, which we knew when we introduced that platform that that was going to take time, because we didn\u2019t really gotten heavily advertised that. We knew it's going to take time to build. We keep refreshing the lunch dual portion of the lunch menu to try to create excitement there that gives us price certainty at launch. And Cucina Mia is getting close to 10% of sales, which is we think about its four years old and have that kind of preferences is really strong. So, we\u2019re pleased with our value offerings but we\u2019re also pleased with how the consumer is buying up into some other areas of the menu. So in balance, we're very happy with how the Olive Garden menu is working. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. You may go ahead. Matt DiFrisco : I think there are was a comment there with respect to the new store openings being coming on a little stronger margin and being better contributors maybe than prior year cohort. Just curious why maybe you're not leaning into 2020 with some more openings seems to be similar pace to what you did in '19. So with Cheddar's coming around a little bit here, potentially a little better than your expectations maybe on previous calls in addition to the strong margins. Could we see maybe some ramped up growth and look to win market share further through maybe a point or so greater expansion of the portfolio overall? Gene Lee : I think we've led out this long-term framework, and I want to pivot back to that. We really think that 2% to 3% new restaurant growth is the right level of growth for Darden. I think that I always talked about the importance of human resource element of growth, and we believe that that is the right level for us. We also want to be disciplined in our approach to choosing real estate. We think that that\u2019s an important part of growth. So, I really believe that we want to stay in that 2% to 3% new restaurant growth as we've gotten our long-range framework. And we\u2019re trying to make great long-term decisions and have great real estate discipline. And so that's where we're at and that\u2019s why I think we\u2019re -- we talk about '20, I think that's what you will see us be. Matt DiFrisco : And then just a follow up, on looking at where you are in less incentives, if we look into '20, especially with the Olive Garden brand. How should we look at the benefit from less promotional activity going through '20? Are we at the end of that now and we will have maybe similar number of weeks of promotion or degree of discounting or promotional activity relative to the pressure of the check in 2019 or its certainly a tailwind? Gene Lee : I'd say that\u2019s eventually we\u2019re going to lap what the reduction. I think we got the fourth quarter and then we've got -- probably we pulled back a little bit last year in the first quarter. But let me just pull back and just say the incentives are just piece of our overall advertising and marketing strategy, and we will continue to try to optimize how we spend our advertising dollars and how we interact with our consumers. And so depending on the environment and the competitive situation, we will make adjustments as needed to try to continue to grow our share and increase same restaurant sales. But this is just one piece of our marketing and advertising strategy. Matt DiFrisco : But the first quarter and the first half would there be more opportunity, or is it going to be since you had\u2026 Gene Lee : I\u2019m not going to commit to that, it depends on the environment and depends on other things that we're doing. So obviously, the wrap in the first quarter is less than the rest of the year. So there is more upside that could be there in the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Brian Bittner : Question on margins and then I have a follow up. Rick, you expanded margins 50 basis points this quarter, which is unique for a restaurant in this environment. But more interestingly, this quarter you did it through labor, unlike COGS the last few quarters. And as you look into 2020, I realize there is no earnings guidance yet, Rick. But do you see any variables that\u2019s going to make it more difficult to achieve your long-term goals of expanding EBIT margins 10 to 30 bps? Or do you think your scale is going to allow you to navigate this environment again in 2020? Rick Cardenas : We don\u2019t foresee anything that\u2019s significantly different than what we've seen this year. We\u2019re not giving guidance for next year. But we feel comfortable that we will be able to be in our margin expansion framework for the foreseeable future, unless things drastically change. Brian Bittner : And Gene, your get to the industry did improve nicely this quarter. And it came at a time when you're pulling back on this incentive and you trying to drive better profitability. You talked a lot about the Olive Garden drivers in your prepared remarks. But can you just frame up some of the specifics behind your share acceleration this quarter given the backdrop in the industry? Rick Cardenas : I think I pivot to our operational teams. I think that we did a great job on improving our throughput in our restaurants. It's a very busy time a year for us. I think our folks really prepared for what we call the busiest days of the quarter. They maximized their opportunity during that. I think that we had good marketing programs. But I think our continued efforts to simplify operations is probably the biggest driver of our ability execute at a higher level. And I think our teams did a fantastic job. They are really focused on really getting back to executing some basics of restaurant operations that are paying dividends. And I think that's where we're getting the improvement. When you look at Olive Garden is doing an outstanding job of off-premise, creating experience where the guest wants to come and pick it up. And so I think that that's really where I\u2019m giving the credit to the momentum in the quarter was our operational execution. Brian Bittner : And just lastly To Go sales, I\u2019m not sure if I miss this or not. But can you just say what the growth of To Go was in the quarter? Rick Cardenas : 13%. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. You may go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : Two questions, one just following up on the labor line for the quarter. I think you said it was still greater 3.5% inflation, so your ability to leverage was very impressive. I\u2019m just wondering I believe this quarter we were lapping the tax savings that you reinvested last year. And I\u2019m wondering whether that have anything to do with it or as you look out to fiscal '20, whether there's any reason to believe its inflation was to stay at the similar level, why you couldn\u2019t perhaps continue to leverage the labor line specifically and then I had one follow-up? Gene Lee : Jeff, there are a few things that impacted this quarter we talked about in remarks. One was little bit of favorability in mark to market year-over-year and the other one was that new restaurant and brand mix that we had, which depending on the restaurant openings next year may not be an impact. But further we had 60 basis points of -- 70 basis points of check mix and productivity enhancements. Some of that was productivity but some of that was just significant mix we've been getting for the last couple of quarters that we wouldn\u2019t anticipate staying in our P&L for a very long time. We do anticipate our inflation to stay about where it is, and we will continue to find productivity enhancements to help offset. But this quarter was probably a little bit stronger in labor versus last year than we would anticipate in the future. Jeffrey Bernstein : So the mix component of it was a big help and that we should expect less benefit from as we look to fiscal '20? Gene Lee : Unless consumers continue to buy like they are buying, we would expect a little bit lower in favorability from mix. Jeffrey Bernstein : And then Gene just on M&A, I mean there has been lots of talk of portfolio companies I guess expanding their portfolio. And you mentioned in your opening remarks of leveraging scale and your cost advantages as a real competitive advantage. Just wondering do you feel the need to acquire another brand anytime soon, or is it just more opportunistic? I get the impression that\u2019s your hands full with your existing brands and I wouldn\u2019t think of you guys as eager to acquire anytime soon. But I just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. Gene Lee : I think what's important is our current portfolio can deliver the long-term framework for the foreseeable future. And I don\u2019t want to -- without repeating what you just said. I mean we\u2019re really focused on regaining momentum in CSK but the management and the board's current obligation to our shareholders to continue to evaluate, the situation in our current portfolio and look for opportunities to add over time. But I think it's important to reinforce that we do not need to do an acquisition for the foreseeable future to be able to achieve our long-term framework. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Gregory Francfort : I just had two quick questions. The first one was I think maybe it was a first question on smaller brands. Gene, your response was that you were seeing some greater whether pressure on those brands. But I also think you've been sourcing talent to the larger brands out of the smaller brand. How do you gain confidence or see confidence that you\u2019re not seeing senior level management churn that isn\u2019t impacting operation for smaller brands? Gene Lee : I think there was one brand that we took a lot of talent out of, which was Bahama Breeze. But we've installed some new talent at getting up to speed. And I feel really good about the work that we're doing. And we've got exciting brands in that other segment that are really making good long-term decisions by pulling back on some incentives. I mean the beautiful thing of the portfolio is that we don't have to make shorter term decisions to drive a comp number for a brand that is inside our portfolio. And I'm just happy with where those brands are positioned. I think it's well documented by a couple other West Coast companies that were impacted by the February weather in Southern California and losing that capacity, which is so important to us out there and we had the same problem in Florida, it was extremely wet here. And when you lose 40% of your capacity, you just can't make that up. So, I feel good about these businesses. I have good management teams, they are making good decisions. And I think they're going to compete very effectively in the future. Gregory Francfort : Thanks for the thoughts. And then maybe just on the quarter. I think you had another never ending promotion, you took off a $1. And how much was -- how much mix impact did that have? Is that -- was that a big enough component of preference that had impacted mix this quarter? Gene Lee : Yeah. It definitely impacted mix, it did -- it added it -- it impacted the mix on increased preference, but also the ad -- the buy up. There is a few opportunities to add protein to the dish that we've actually seen consumer preference there, much higher than we thought we would see. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mary Hodes with Baird. You may go ahead. Mary Hodes : The initiative there that I think you've talked about being in earlier and on simplification. So could you maybe just provide an update on the progress you've made on simplifying the menu or operating processes to date and then what's to come on that front throughout 2020? Gene Lee : I think that we've made a few process improvements in Cheddar's, but the focus has been implementing our productivity tools and figuring out how to improve the HR metrics. The management team has identified a few more significant process improvements that will be implemented through out fiscal '20, once we really lock into solidifying our progress on the other initiatives on staff to win and really figure how to maximize our productivity tools. We don't want to overwhelm this group, and there is -- so there is opportunity, and you'll see more process Improvement implemented throughout fiscal '20. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan. You may go ahead. Brandon Sonnemaker : Brandon Sonnemaker on for John. In the past you mentioned that once turnover levels at Cheddar's are at Darden norms, you'd accelerate growth at that brand to 7% to 10%, is that still the expectation maybe fiscal '21 that you'll eventually be able to grow that brand in the high singles or would you need a different concept to accelerate unit growth? Gene Lee : Well, I think that we've said, as we need to stabilize human resource metrics of this business that should lead to stay, improve sales and profit results. And then from there we'll be able to continue to grow this business. I think that we're going to, we'll continue to look at it, I don't want to put a number out there as a target. We have said that, we don't like to grow brands at greater than 10% unit growth. We think that puts tremendous stress on the human resources. So we'll evaluate Cheddar's growth each and every year. I would end this comment by saying we think Cheddar's is still a huge opportunity in the marketplace and we're more excited today than we were -- when we first bought this chain, the more we understand the consumer and the resiliency of the consumer, we get excited about the opportunity to growth this. But we're going to grow responsibly over time and we're excited about it. Brandon Sonnemaker : And just one follow-up, could you discuss whether you view the current mix driven check increases as desirable. And maybe if you could help at the first half whether we should still expect deposit mix contribution at Olive Garden and LongHorn. Gene Lee : Well, I think as we've said in the past calls, we've made some moves to try to mitigate the mix, but the consumer continues to utilize the full menu in Olive Garden and surprisingly in some ways -- bought up into the promotions and it's really been a confluence of a lot of small individual things coming together, that has drove the mix. Ideally, we don't want to have that kind of mix. We don't think that's sustainable for a long period of time, but in this environment right now, it's not one thing that we can point to this, driving the mix, it's a multiple of small areas that coming together are giving us this outsized mix growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. You may go ahead. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good morning. Off premise was up substantially, like you talked about at Olive Garden. I'm wondering what you attribute that to. Have you been marketing or doing something else differently, clearly effectively. And then, what does that signal, does that correlate to something for us to better understand? Does this mean you'd have consistent same-store sales momentum or accelerated same-store sales momentum? Thank you. Gene Lee : Well, I give all the credit to Olive Garden off-premise growth to execute the value in the offering and then the store level execution. Our consumers know they can count on Olive Garden to be on time and to be accurate. When you put that on top of an, of some value proposition to the consumer with its especially around its pans of lasagna, pans of fettuccine alfredo, a bulk solid, a bulk soup offering is compelling, and our execution is really high and that, what that tells me is the consumer is really engaged in that experience. We're doing a normal level of communication to our guests to remind them of the experience but there -- but their repeat business there is extremely strong. And it's -- it to me -- it's one of the best values out there in the marketplace and executed at an extremely high level. Nicole Miller : And then just a question around Cheddar's. It was much better sequentially and also much better versus expectations. Is this an inflection point for Cheddar's. First, you know, why was it better? And then I was just looking at the math, and I notice, not this simple, but comparisons ease now in this current quarter by about 250 basis points. If this continues at the back-end side territory, is this a fair expectation? Gene Lee : I think there is some logic around your statement. This business is -- continues to perform well, we have a few areas inside the organization and are still struggling primarily around, what we call the CMP restaurants, which was basic all in State of Georgia. We continue to have that way on the organization, but there's a lot of progress in the rest of the organization and a lot of momentum. I really don't want to call this an inflection point or predict exactly when the business may go, may stabilize and get back to flat but I will say that I am very excited about where the management team is, I'm excited about what they're focusing on, I'm excited about what they have accomplished. They just presented to the Board of Directors yesterday and really detail -- in a detailed fashion went through everything that's been they've accomplished in the last six months and it's getting to be exciting. And, but I'm not going to sit here and predict at this or say this was the inflection point to predict that, we're going to be positive. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Karen Holthouse : Hey, thanks for taking the question. One just quick clarification before my question. The comment on 2020's fitting within the long-term margin framework, is that including or excluding any benefit from the 53rd week? Rick Cardenas : I don't think it matters, either way, excluding we would still expect to be within the framework. Karen Holthouse : And then a different maybe way to ask the off-premise question, if you go back a year or so, there is pretty consistent commentary that double-digit growth was not likely to continue forever, and yet it has. So, doing a little bit of a post-mortem on that, do you think the continued strong performance is really just the execution and value in Olive Garden or was selective of the overall category kind of continuing to gain steam for the consumer. Gene Lee : Karen, I think it's a combination of both. I do think that consumer demand for convenience is continues to grow, and I think that we're meeting that need. And I do think that, again, the value proposition and what we do in Olive Garden is spectacular and the execution and the thought that went into this over the last four years, has helped them continue to gain market share, but there is definitely a significant growth happening in this part of the business. Karen Holthouse : What is within that, then would you still have that same sort of skepticism that double-digit growth can continue for the medium-term? Or is there just kind of a more optimism on the overall trajectory? Gene Lee : Yeah. I mean, I think right now we're probably a little bit more optimistic than we were a while ago, because we've been able to sustain that. And there's so much energy and effort being put on the whole industry into that space. I think we're benefiting from that too, right. So everybody is talking about it and pushing that part of their business. But yet, when you come back to, we've got the best value proposition. So we're benefiting, we're benefiting by everybody talking about it and trying to promote that part of their business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Scott with Mizuho. You may go ahead. Jeremy Scott : Just wanted to go back to that 70 bps of labor productivity, which is up from the 40 bps in the last two quarters, I know you mentioned mix and impacted simplification efforts, but to what extent is that being driven by that growing off-premise mix. I know, if it's not impactful, now, is it something you expect to extract as the business starts to normalize. In other words, because off-premise mix continues to grow with rapid clip, there may be some inefficiencies you're willing to live with, now that you will eventually start to draw from, where that means labor allocation or something else. Gene Lee : Jeremy, I wouldn't put much of our increase in off-premise growth, increase in mix, off-premise growth for labor. As we continue to grow off-premise we continue to need to add people in Olive Garden to help offset the growth in off-premise. So, I would say that as we continue to grow, if we're at 10% to 15% growth in off-premise sales that's going to provide us the opportunity to add more people to make sure that we actually get the food on time and accurately to the consumer as they walk in the door. Jeremy Scott : You talked about the contribution of mix coming from a variety of different places, customer spending more generally at the table, is that impacting your table turn at all and impacting traffic? Gene Lee : Not really impacting our table turns. I mean we've been really focused on improving throughput in our restaurants. So even though we're adding mix in Olive Garden may, remember most of that mix at Olive Garden is coming from entrees, not necessarily on the add-on sales side. So it's not extending the meal period, and at LongHorn, their mix has been coming from add-on sales, but they've always had a pretty good add-on sales business, our focus is to continue to drive better throughput in our restaurants and we're not seeing the impact of mix, lengthening that time in the restaurant. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Andy Barish : Thanks, guys. On your wage inflation I mean it's certainly lower than most of what the industry is seeing. Is there anything you'd like to call out in terms of what you've looked at, is it -- is it geographic? Is it retention? I would appreciate any comments there and then -- and secondly, I think you, Gene, you mentioned some productivity improvements continuing. Is there another layer at any particular brand. I imagine Olive Garden is pretty efficient given the margins you are showing currently. So is -- is that kind of cycling through any of the other brands, where it's making a difference to call out? Gene Lee : Well a couple of things, Andy. First of all, we talked about overall labor inflation of 3.5% to 4.5% in general. We're seeing hourly wage inflation higher than that, so above 4%, somewhere between around 4.5%. So, others are talking about inflation, but they're probably focusing more on the hourly inflation and we're seeing that. That said, we are being more productive with our team, because our turnover is so much lower. We don't, the money that we spend in training is actually spent to train our people to be even better, not necessarily, train them how to do their job, because of our turnover rates. The other thing, we continue to focus on productivity enhancements. We still have a lot more room to go in some of our other brands. Olive Garden still has room to go in improving productivity and improving their menu, in taking out steps and we've got some more to go in Cheddar's. We believe that as we continue to simplify our operations, we should be able to find productivity enhancements. Now, they may not be as high as we've seen more recently, but we still believe we have productivity enhancements. And then finally, I'll still mention the throughput. Olive Garden has some high volumes. Cheddar's has some high volumes. We still believe that there is room to improve throughput even in those brands. So, we would anticipate continuing to find those enhancements and to continue to help leverage or help offset some wage inflation. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Stephen Anderson with Maxim Group. You may go ahead. Stephen Anderson : Most of my questions have been answered, but I do want go back to Cheddar's. I know in past quarters, you've talked about once you've gone through a lot of the steps to improve productivity, maybe, work through some of these throughput issues you would maybe revisit, maybe some of the sales building layers perhaps doing something like increasing online and mobile sales and when do you think you could see this opportunity, I've seen that you've done very well in this regard at both Olive Garden as well as LongHorn. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Stephen. You know as Gene mentioned, we are focusing on making sure that we have the teams in place, the management teams in place before we start driving a lot of incremental sales, sales initiatives. That said, we have not turned on online ordering for Cheddar's. We have not turned on mobile ordering for Cheddar's, that's still a potential for us. And we will turn those kind of things on and those big sales building initiatives on when we feel it's the right time. We've got the team in place, they are trained and they're ready to execute flawlessly. We don't like to do anything until we are ready to execute perfectly. And we've got a little bit of ways to go before we get there. Stephen Anderson : Now, in terms of like, having that infrastructure in place, or have you done any testing to make sure that once you do decide that you want to turn those levers on that, it can be done in such a way that there can be as you've close to flawlessly as you can. Rick Cardenas : Well, we haven't done any testing on some of these new sales building initiatives. We're still focused on simplifying the operation, improving the menu. We just added a new another new menu at Cheddar's to making sure that we're fully staffed. That said, we've got a lot of learnings in our other brands on how to do this stuff, right. So if you think about Cheddar's, the Cheddar's guest is very -- is similar to the Olive Garden guest. We can, we've learned a lot from Olive Garden, how they do off-premise, how they do other sales building initiatives and to be able to move those things over to Cheddar's and have some really good learning from our other brands. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Andrew Strelzik : My question is on the other business segment margins. You talked about, I think, almost being negative in the quarter. But at the same time you were able to almost hold the margins flat in the segment. So my question is, was there anything anomalous in the quarter that helped the margins there. Are we at the point now where we could start to see those margins expand, understanding kind of some of the dynamics that have been going on at Cheddar's and the other brands, and do you actually need comps to turn positive in aggregate for the segment to start to see the margin expansion there. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Well, a couple of things I mentioned. One, we are showing as we mentioned, better cost management. I mean if you think about Cheddar's for example, those productivity enhancement tools that Gene talked about labor productivity, food waste. We're seeing those results and on their P&L and that's helping their margins. We've got a lot of improvement in margin at Yard House. So even though we've had a negative same restaurant sales in those brands, I'll give you an example for Cheddar's, Cheddar's has had negative guest count, but their productivity is getting better. And you don't normally see that when guest counts are down productivity improve. But we're seeing that right now at Cheddar's. So we don't, we would love to see all of our brands positive in same restaurant sales, but we react when we -- when we have to, if same restaurant sales are negative to find even more costs enhancements and find margin improvements if we can. That said, when all of those brands are positive, we would anticipate margin enhancements in those, in the other segment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. You may go ahead. Brian Vaccaro : I just wanted to quickly circle back on turnover, which seems to be a very important piece of improving options over the last few years, along with the benefits you mentioned, Rick of lower hiring and training costs. But could you just provide an update and manager turnover at each brand and how that compares to 12 to 18 months ago. And then I have a quick follow up. Rick Cardenas : I'm not going to get into the individual brands, but I would just say, our management turnover is actually lower today than it was 12 months ago. And I mean, to me, I think that's the key, we focus on, management turnover, we were really focused on this GMP (ph) turnover and that's less than, that's less than 10% in our system. Brian Vaccaro : And then on the LongHorn segment margins, the expansion a bit there despite comp, do you unpack some of the puts and takes there for that segment? Rick Cardenas : Can you repeat that? Sorry, can you repeat that? You kind of -- you broke up a little bit. Brian Vaccaro : It -- kind of long quarter, year-on-year expansion in those margins moderate despite comps rating. So just wanted to put some... Rick Cardenas : I think your question is LongHorn segment margin in the third quarter was kind of moderate, even with comps expanding. Let me, give you a little unpacking there, we don't necessarily get into detail, but as we mentioned inflation ticked up in the third quarter, which we expected that to happen. A lot of that was in beef and a lot of that impacted LongHorn. So their cost of sales as a percentage was unfavorable more than the entire Company's was unfavorable so the company, I believe was I said it was 10 basis points. LongHorn was worse than that, on the labor side, their labor was not as favorable as the Company. So, those two things offset, and so -- they just had slight margin expansion, but they've also made significant investments in food. We've been talking about over the last couple of years. They made significant investments in their food and this menu mix issue was in the right way -- menu mix impact that we're seeing at LongHorn, they're selling a lot more of their higher end steaks which have a higher cost of sales. So if you think about a bone steak, it's a higher cost of sales or percentage as a sirloin, and they're moving toward those, because they've made significant investments in those. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead. Jon Tower : Just across the industry, we're seeing growth of loyalty and rewards programs or playing a more prominent role in sales growth for a number of other players. So, given the strength of across your portfolio today, it doesn't appear that you need this in place, but I'm curious to learn where the Company is with respect to a cross brand loyalty program. And if there's one in place, what the current stats look like, and perhaps the usage and what would keep it from becoming a more prominent role in sales for the Company? Gene Lee : First of all, we do have a test in place right now. It's in less than 10% of our restaurants and it's been in place for well over a year. We've talked a lot about, what we would expect to see out of loyalty programs and what we'd want to see from them. It is a cross-brand program today, but we have been very clear that we want to make sure that a loyalty program drives profitable same restaurant sales growth. We see it, driving same restaurant sales growth, but we want to make sure that the discounts or whatever we provide or whatever incentive we provide our consumer to join that program is helpful. We do believe that there are some benefits in the data that we get, but we have more data in other sources. So we're still researching it, we're still testing it and if once we believe that it's the right thing to do. We will roll it out, if we ever believe it's the right thing to do. Jon Tower : And you have the systems in place that allow to plug in pretty much overnight across the brands? Gene Lee : Yes, I mean the system, the way we build our systems if it works in one restaurant or it work in any brand we have, and right now they have -- they are in place. What we don't have are things like an app for loyalty, which we're not even using that today. So if we ever go full blown with loyalty, we'll just have to update our apps and move forward from there. Operator : Thank you. At this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak for any closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Great. Thanks, Sue. This concludes our call. And I'd like to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 20th before the market opens, with a conference call to follow up. Thanks for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. All participants may disconnect.",

As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings on September 19th before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will discuss our fiscal year performance and quarterly business highlights and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from both the fourth quarter and the full year before providing our initial outlook for fiscal 2020. As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated Knapp Track excluding Darden. During our fiscal fourth quarter, industry total sales growth was 0.7%, industry same-restaurant sales declined 0.3% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 2.4%. For the full fiscal year industry total sales growth was 1.6%, industry same-restaurant sales grew 0.7%, and industry same-restaurant guest count decreased 1.2%. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you Kevin and good morning everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning the fourth quarter wrapped up a very strong fiscal 2019 for Darden. Total sales from continuing operations for the year were $8.5 billion, an increase of 5.3%, same-restaurant sales for the year increased 2.5%, and adjusted net earnings per share were $5.82, an increase of 21% from last year.  I want to start this morning by briefly talking about the industry dynamics we saw during the fourth quarter and also share some thoughts on the consumer. As you know the industry experienced sales volatility during the quarter. After a good March, April was a challenging month but the industry bounced back in May. A significant part of the volatility was due to the holiday shift which helped March but hurt April. Our business follow the same pattern and I was pleased to see that our traffic gap to the industry expanded each month throughout the quarter. As we think about the consumer and look at the macro environment the economy continues to be strong, unemployment is at the lowest levels in nearly 50 years, wages are growing at a healthy rate outpacing inflation, and the consumer confidence remains high. Turning to our brand highlights for the quarter, Olive Garden had a good quarter which resulted in its 19th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales of 3.7% driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 2.4% and 1.3% growth from new restaurants. Same-restaurant guest counts declined 0.4% but Olive Garden's gap to the industry expanded throughout the quarter even as they continued to reduce incentives. If you adjust for lack of incentives guest counts would have been positive during the quarter.  Check average increased by 2.8% this quarter comprised of 1.6% pricing and 1.2% menu mix. The reduction in menu mix compared to prior quarters was driven primarily by promotional offerings being similar to the prior year. Olive Garden's results were driven by the teams focus on flawless execution, everyday value, and their off premise business. During the quarter the restaurant team focused on flawless execution to help maintain all time high guest satisfaction ratings. A great example of this focus was on Mother's Day the busiest day of the year at Olive Garden when they recorded the highest Mother's Day sales ever. Olive Garden continued to strengthen its everyday value platform throughout the quarter. They refreshed their $5 value drink platform and increased awareness on everyday value through secondary T.V. advertising which highlighted their lunch duos starting at $6.99, every day early dinner duo starting at $8.99 and Cucina Mia starting at $9.99. Finally Olive Garden's off premise sales increased 9% representing 15% of total sales. The team remained focused on improving to go capabilities and executing at a high level while driving continued growth in our catering business. Olive Garden had an excellent year. They continued to gain share in casual dining market share as they grew total sales 5% to $4.3 billion which outperformed the industry benchmark by 340 basis points, and grew traffic for the fourth year in a row. The business remains strong and the team is doing a great job of executing against this strategy to drive frequency among their most loyal guests while making the appropriate investments. LongHorn Steakhouse had another strong quarter. Total sales grew 5.7% driven by 2.4% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 3.3%, the 25th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Same-restaurant guest counts grew 0.3%. The LongHorn team continued to successfully execute their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive executions, and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagements. They remain focused on creating relevant promotions by leveraging their guests favorite core menu items. Focusing on core items ensures their operators are able to execute at a very high level. LongHorn team also continued do a great job of supporting these promotions by telling a quality story with multiple guest touch points. Additionally during the quarter LongHorn launched a new beverage program that brought their focus on quality, simplicity, and culture to life. The program is focused on strengthening their growing beverage sales, initial guest feedback has been positive. Finally the LongHorn team has been focused on ensuring that to go experience equals their in restaurants experience for guests who choose this convenience. They're enhancing their capabilities and have a dedicated to go area in 40% of their restaurants. This ongoing focus has resulted in improvements and overall experience with high guest satisfaction scores for order accuracy and timeliness.  I'm very pleased with LongHorn performance this year. They continue to take share of the casual dining market as they grew total sales 6.3% to $1.8 billion which outperformed the industry benchmark by 470 basis points. These results reflect their commitment to execute their long-term strategies. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales increased 0.6% in the fourth quarter driven by sales growth from new restaurants of 3.8% and offset by same-restaurant sales decline of 3.2%. The magnitude of this decline was driven by the formerly former franchise restaurants which fell 6.1%. The original company restaurants were down 1.5%. I was encouraged to see a sequential improvement in guest count trends for Cheddar's from Q3 to Q4. At the beginning of the fiscal year the Cheddar's team established three strategic priorities, faster wins, master the tools, and standardizing and simplify with the goal of repairing fundamental elements of the business and shifting momentum. During the quarter they continued to make progress against these priorities. Overall staffing levels for both team member and managers are now on par with our standards, this better enables the Cheddar's team to focus on execution and while turnover has improved it is still significantly above the Darden norm. In addition the restaurant teams continue to build actively with our systems and tools. They improved the use of their guest count forecasting application which is critical to run efficient shifts. Finally the Cheddar's team made progress with standardization and simplification by deploying new culinary processes during the quarter. These improvements contributed to better execution, efficiency, and productivity while enhancing speed of service.  Fiscal 2019 was a challenging year for Cheddar's one that was filled with significant change. However, the team made meaningful progress throughout the year that helped Cheddar's deliver double-digit profit growth this quarter. And while I'm disappointed the work has yet to translate to top line sales growth I am encouraged that we saw 180 basis point improvement in guest count trends from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. These improvements indicate momentum is beginning to shift in the right direction. There's still a lot of work left to be done but I'm confident in the plan that Cheddar's team has in place and their ability to execute it.  Fiscal 2019 was a great year for Darden. Our restaurant teams demonstrated their commitment to getting better every day as they executed our back to basics operating philosophies and we continued to make meaningful progress in strengthening our core competitive advantages. I remain convinced that we have the right strategy in place and we are well positioned to achieve our long-term value creation framework over time. On behalf of our Board of Directors and Senior Leadership Team I want to thank our 185,000 team members for all they do to make our company successful. Now I'll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you Gene and good morning everyone. We're pleased with our fourth quarter performance. We grew total sales by 4.5% from the addition of 39 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 1.6%. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was a $1.76, an increase of 26.6% from last year. This quarter we paid $92 million in dividends and repurchased $42 million in shares returning a total of $134 million of capital to our shareholders. Looking at the P&L restaurant level EBITDA margin was flat versus last year and adjusted EBIT margins expanded 10 basis points to 11% this quarter. Food and beverage was flat to last year as pricing and cost savings offset inflation of just over 1% and unfavorable menu mix. Restaurant labor of 32.2% was unfavorable 10 basis points driven by mark-to-market while the 120 basis points of unfavorability from continued wage inflation was offset by favorability from pricing leverage, incremental sales leverage from higher check mix, and productivity improvements. Both marketing and G&A were favorable 10 basis points driven by sales leverage. Depreciation and amortization was unfavorable 20 basis points as we continued to invest in new restaurant growth, remodels, and technology. Impairments were favorable 20 basis points as we lapped $4.5 million of impairments last year for restaurants that were earmarked for closing as their leases expired. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 5.5%. This rate was approximately 400 basis points lower than we anticipated in March. Roughly half of this favorability was from a higher than anticipated benefit from stock option exercise and mark-to-market hedges. The remainder was the result of strategic tax projects that were completed in Q4. Turning to our segment performance, all of our segments grew total sales and segment profit dollars again this quarter. Segment profit margin held flat at both Olive Garden and LongHorn while the fine dining and other segments grew segment profit margins. Of particular note in the other segments as Gene mentioned Cheddar's significantly grew segment profit this quarter even with negative same-restaurant sales as they focused on running more efficient food costs and labor. Fiscal 2019 was another great year of performance as our brands continued to leverage Darden's scale and other competitive advantages. Our strong operating models generates significant cash flows and this year was no exception. This year's strong top and bottom line performance drove approximately $1.2 billion in EBITDA from continuing operations. We invested approximately $450 million of capital in the business and returned over a $0.5 billion to shareholders consisting of $371 million in dividends and $208 million in share repurchases. In fact since 2016 we've grown EBITDA 9% annually and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders each year in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before I share our outlook for fiscal 2020 I want to reiterate our long-term value creation framework. This framework calls for a 10% to 15% total shareholder return which is meant to be achieved over time assuming a constant earnings multiple. Our total shareholder -- our actual total shareholder returns have well exceeded our long-term framework since its introduction in 2015. In fact our annualized TSR over the three year fiscal period ended May 26th was approximately 25%. To achieve our long-term framework we anticipate earnings after tax growth of 7% to 10% which is made up of total sales growth of between 3% to 6% and EBIT margin expansions between 10 to 30 basis points. Additionally we expect to return another 3% to 5% to shareholders in the form of a dividend payout ratio of between 50% and 60% of our net income and share repurchases between $150 million and $250 million. As I mentioned on last quarter's call fiscal 2020 includes two unique items. First, it's a 53 week year and we anticipate a positive impact on diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of roughly $0.15. Second, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we are implementing ASC 842, the new accounting standard for leases. We currently estimate this will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.05. Roughly three quarters of this impact is in interest while the rest impacts EBIT. Now turning to our full outlook for fiscal 2020 we expect total sales growth of 5.3% to 6.3% driven by approximately 2% from the addition of the 53rd week, same-restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and approximately 44 net new restaurants. Capital spending between $450 million and $500 million, total inflation of approximately 2.5% with commodities inflation of 1% to 2% and total labor inflation of 3.5% [Technical Difficulty] to 4.5%. An annual effective tax rate of 10% to 11% and approximately 124 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $6.30 and $6.45. This morning we also announced that our Board approved a 17% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $0.88 per share implying an annual dividend of $3.52 resulting in a yield of 3% based on yesterday's closing share price. And with that we'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will be from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company. Sir, your line is open. Michael Tamas : Great, thanks. This is actually Mike Tamas on for Brian. You guys started talking about a pretty healthy consumer environment so when you think about driving sales in 2020 is the playbook the same, is there anything you think you need to do differently whether you're looking at a competitive environment and how you think about 2020 sales drivers versus say the last 12 months which is really healthy? Thanks. Gene Lee : I think we stay focused on our back to basics philosophy. I think it's getting more important than ever that we continue to ensure that our restaurants are staffed with the appropriate team members and that we're creating great dining experiences. We think there is still opportunity with throughput especially on the weekends in these high demand days and we are continuing to focus on how do we simplify our operations so that our teams can execute at a higher level. We're going to continue to win this at the 9 square feet. We've got to do a better job than our competitors do taking care of our guests and providing offerings that our guests are excited about. So I would sum that up by saying our playbook is not changing, we're focused on the exact same things. Michael Tamas : Yeah, thanks. And just on the cost side of things, your total cost basket is up a little bit more in 2020 versus 2019. So is there anything that you have to do a little differently there, is there little more productivity you need to squeeze out of the model or how do you think about that? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, we are working on productivity every year. We don't anticipate squeezing out a lot more than we did last year. We still anticipate productivity enhancements but we also have a great supply chain team that will continue to look for cost savings to help offset any incremental inflation. Michael Tamas : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Bittner. Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open sir. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Gene just a question about the industry environment, I appreciate your opening remarks but if I look at the last three or four months it does look like traffic in the industry has softened relative to what we were running I guess the prior 12 months so wondering if you have some thoughts on why were you seeing that softening trend even when you kind of normalized out for the calendar shift? And then as you think about that trend do you think you need to sort of normalize the value promotion or maybe tick back up the value promotion master maybe pulling back on some of the offers over the last 12 months or 24 months? Thanks. Gene Lee : David, good morning. We've been trying to tease out the changes in traffic trend. I will pivot just here for one second to say we're really pleased about is this. The industry traffic has softened a little bit, our gap has increased. And that has been really reassuring. We haven't been able to point to any particular thing that's causing this traffic softness in the industry and we've tried kind of from different angles. Overall I think our thought is that consumers are still in a really good place and we don't see that changing here in the near-term. Obviously we're living in a more volatile environment. I will say one of the things that we do see is day to day, week to week there's a little bit more volatility than there was -- there had been. And again hard for us to try to figure out what's driving that. As far as value I think that we'll continue to look for ways to add value to the consumer proposition. I think as we think about incentives right now we believe that we're still in the mode of withdrawing incentives based on the environment. I'd rather continue to find ways to invest in what we call everyday value in the businesses but there's no doubt we've taken a lot of currency out of the marketplace and we do have that available to put back in if we think that's the right thing to do. David Tarantino : And Gene maybe a follow-up on that last comment what would you need to see to add back some of those incentives or just more aggressive on the value side? Gene Lee : Well, I think if our traffic started to go the other way against the industry and the gap started to shrink and I think then we have to consider what's going on with the business model. I think one of the things that we focus on is protecting our business model and using our scale not to make short-term decisions that may drive a few extra guests here and there but really aren't that profitable. So, I think as long as our gap to the industry is healthy from a traffic standpoint we will continue to be very cautious with that. David Tarantino : Makes sense. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Tarantino. Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open sir. David Palmer : Thanks, good morning. Question on just the polished casual dining side, it does look like that's a little tougher than it has been in that segment. Wondering if there's a reason or insight there, tax season, stock markets might impact that segment more, also regionally bigger on the West Coast, and then separately on LongHorn is that brand picking up steam or was there in a way that feels like in the medium-term that it is widening its gap [to Knapp] [ph] or was there certain reasons within that quarter for that to happen? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : David great question on polished. I think I will sum that up as saying polished casual operates in some of the best retail trade areas across the country and I believe there's more good competition, smaller brands that are really good businesses that are expanding in those trade areas putting more pressure on our polished casual brands. And I'll use it, I think a very good example. I mean if you're going to grow True Foods where are you're going to put a True Foods today. You're going to put it right on top of the Seasons 52. And there are other brewery brands that are -- where are they going to put their businesses, they're going to put them right on top of the Yard House. And so those brands operate in very good trade areas and we are experiencing a little bit more competition there. So I think you asked a good question but I think that's the insight there.  As far as LongHorn goes we've been making I think since -- when Todd Burrowes came back under his leadership we were making great investments in LongHorn. And I think that they have been multiple year investments and I think we're gaining a lot of momentum in that business. We have increased the size of the stakes, we have simplified the operation, we've simplified the promotional constructs and our retention is incredibly high and we're executing in a really high level. So I think there's a lot of good momentum in that business.  And last thought on LongHorn is we had a pretty good growth curve there and really in the mid 2000 - between 2010 and 2015 we broke into a lot of new territories. And those new territories are really starting to mature nicely and we're getting good growth from them. Going in and being the fourth or fifth Steakhouse in a marketplace it's really tough to break in and get into the consumer routines. And over time we know that LongHorn will build loyalty in those years in their three to ten year cycle. So there's a lot of momentum in that piece of the business also. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Palmer. Our next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Your line is open. Chris O'Cull: Thanks, good morning guys. Gene several of the Bar and Grill and mid scale casual dining chains have been pretty aggressive with new promotional platforms and while Olive Garden clearly has a scale to compete is some of the other smaller brands like Cheddar's and Yard House, do they need to make any adjustments to their marketing strategy? Gene Lee : Chris, I think they've got to always reexamine where they are from a value standpoint. I would say that Cheddar is just the value leader. Maybe there's some opportunity as we move forward to highlight that value differently and to bring that to life. There's no doubt and I've said that the last couple calls that the large casual dining brands are being much -- are much more effective and disciplined today and advertising very effectively and their share of voice is up. That's making it a little bit more difficult for Cheddar's to compete effectively. And we may have to think about how we go to market to highlight that great value that we have. But your insight is relevant and it's a challenge that we face with the Cheddar's brand. Chris O'Cull: Is there any plans to test or introduce anything in the coming quarters? Gene Lee : Yes, but I'm not going to talk about them. Chris O'Cull: Fair enough, thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. O'Cull. Our next question is from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open sir. Gregory Francfort : Hey, I just had two quick questions. The first one was just a follow up to David's question on polished casual is there a difference in terms of the store growth capacity as it's happening in polished casual versus maybe casual dining more broadly because my understanding was casual dining store growth might be slowing a little bit? And a question just for Rick, just on the cash balance and where it ended at the end of the quarter I think the last time you ran a cash balance, posted a tie you made a pretty big acquisition, is there a reason why maybe you're not deploying that cash for repurchases and as you think about acquisitions how much does Cheddar's perform and you need to turn that impact, your thoughts on future acquisitions? Thank you. Gene Lee : You know I'll go first on the polished growth. I think that it's an attractive space and we have a lot of entrepreneurs out there that over the last decade have created some pretty good concepts that are starting to get to -- getting past that 10 unit area and starting to grow. It's obviously an attractive marketplace but it's also relatively small. It just happens when we are a smaller polished brands, when we have increased competition it has a bigger effect on the overall top line number. What we do believe is that we can fight off that initial competition over 12 to 18 months and our restaurants will get back to the sales levels they were prior to the competition coming in. So it's just something that you have to -- I think you have to continue to operate really well and you don't make an adjustment in the short-term for that increased competition. You just go back to winning a 9 square feet and your business will get back to growth. Rick Cardenas : As it relates to our cash balance even though we have significantly more cash than we had last year our teams are still focused on doing the things every day to continue to increase that cash balance. And one of the things that we did in the fourth quarter was we significantly improved our working capital position and we also did a few more sale leaseback. So that helped increase our cash balance and it talked to the team's ability to continue to find the best use of our cash and actually take as much cash in as we possibly can even though we have some cash. As it relates to what we're going to do with that we continue to speak to our Board to determine what the best use of that cash is, whether it's through share buybacks or dividends and as you have heard earlier we just increased our dividend by 17%. And we will find the right times to either buy back shares or acquisitions if they come to play. It has nothing to do with Cheddar's whether we're doing an acquisition right now or not, it just has to do with making sure that we have the right brand etcetera to target. Gregory Francfort : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Francfort. Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open sir. John Glass : Thanks very much. I know Darden's position on delivery has been clear but Gene do you see either one, that delivery is helping the overall industry in any way, it may not show up in traffic but maybe it shows up in check for example? And two do you think by not participating in delivery at this point that it anyways puts you at a traffic or a total sales disadvantage? Gene Lee : I don't believe -- I'll start with the second part of that, I don't believe it has put us at a disadvantage at all. I really like the way our premise business continues to grow. I think we continue to remove [indiscernible] from the process and we continue to offer great value without having to have any destruction to our overall margins. And so I like where we are, I don't think we're missing out on anything. I think there is still -- this is still an immature business, there is still lots to learn. There's a lot of discussion around whether it's incremental, it's non-incremental. Where I want us to focus and I want our teams to focus on is creating a compelling in restaurant experience that people want to come and visit. I think when you do that that helps create the demand for the off premise visit. And we know convenience will continue to be important to the consumer but we're focused right now is to is to create a compelling off premise -- in restaurant experience that drives in a compelling off premise experience in which the consumer still wants to come and pick up -- will still come and pick up because the value and the quality of the offering is so strong. John Glass : And just to follow-up, if I missed it I'm sorry, what was the Olive Garden off premise business this quarter and how much did it grow? And then just to the first part of my first question was simply do you see any evidence anyone is getting the real listed delivery or is this all talk and we haven't really seen the industry sales in fact benefit from this in total? Gene Lee : Yeah, so I missed that part John. I think that -- I don't think I have seen any real growth from it. I'm seeing margin destruction but that's just -- that's my opinion. We've got tests going on and we're not -- it's not -- the results aren't compelling enough that we're running out and doing something with it. I think with that I think it really indicates how we're feeling about it. Olive Garden's goal was 9% for the quarter, two years stack of almost 18%, it was 14.5% of sales. I'm just -- I'm really pleased with where we are with our off premise business. We continue to enhance those capabilities which is really important. And we continue to work with the adoption of digital and we think that's going to be a continued driver. And we've got some other investments that we're continuing to make and we will continue to make to remove some friction in the off premise experience. John Glass : Great, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Glass. Our next question is from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim. Your line is open sir. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. I just had a follow-up and then a question specific to the Olive Garden and I guess what could be perceived as a slight shortfall versus what expectations were and then LongHorn's topping. Did the Olive Garden brand -- was that the only one that saw basically less incentives and had somewhat of a drag in the quarter or did LongHorn experience some of that as well? Rick Cardenas : LongHorn didn't have the same drag as Olive Garden did. There was much more reduction in incentives in Olive Garden than LongHorn for the quarter. Matthew DiFrisco : And where are we in that cycle of reductions, are we going to expect that to continue into the first half of 2020 or are we starting to maybe now see more comparable year-over-year comparisons on incentives? Rick Cardenas : I think when we get to the middle of the beginning and beginning the middle of the second quarter of last year when we started to start to really pull back. It is going to be a little bit more time before we wrap that. Matthew DiFrisco : And then my last question you mentioned a lot about some of the competition coming in and where you would grow a store, the obvious place would be sort of where Capital Grille already sits or some other of your brands but as far as the real estate availability say for the next three to five years what are you seeing out there for the potential for the Cheddar's brand and those brands that are lower, that are positioned best for the lower income consumer or the broader consumer base. A lot of been said that there's not a lot of availability, do you feel the same or do you think the brand is something that can fit into more locations maybe than some other brands that I have commented about in tight locations? Gene Lee : Well I think we have a lot of green space right. So we're still relatively under penetrated so that gives you a lot more opportunity. So obviously a lot easier for us to find sites for Cheddar's than it is for Olive Garden. I don't see availability being an issue for Cheddar's long-term growth whereas Olive Garden now -- I mean everything that we do with Olive Garden we have to really figure out what the cannibalization is going to be versus we don't have that much of an issue with Cheddar's. So, I think it all depends on what's your size, what's your penetration level. I don't see that as a burden as we move forward with Cheddar's. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. DiFrisco. Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great, thank you very much. Two questions, one just on the fiscal 2020 guidance. I'm just wondering if there was anything in the fiscal fourth quarter just ended, whether it would be slower and more volatile comps or maybe higher than expected costs, anything there that might have led you to temper your initial fiscal 2020 guidance? I know if you look at past years like initial guidance was still a conservative allowing for a beaten raise which Gene I know that's critical component just to guide conservatively but looking back to fiscal 2019 comp at 75 basis point should be earnings growth by 700 percentage points so, just wondering as you think about your initial guidance for 2020 how that was impacted by the most recent trends in the industry and then I had one follow up? Rick Cardenas : Hi Jeff, this is Rick. Yes, I am assuming you are talking about our same-restaurant sales guidance of 1 or 2. Gene mentioned we are seeing a little bit more volatility in the industry and this is an annual guidance, this is 12 months ahead of time. And so we want to make sure that we're prudent and being at the lower end of our 1% to 3% range makes sense. We also have seen a little bit of a slowdown in discretionary spending in this calendar year versus last calendar year. So we feel like 1% to 2% is the right range at this time. Jeffrey Bernstein : And from an earnings per share perspective would you view that similarly in terms of a little more cautious to start the year? Rick Cardenas : I wouldn't say it's a little bit more cautious to start the year than we've been in the past. We have a few things, one is our same-restaurant sales of 1% to 2% with a little bit more inflation that we've seen in the past. And also a big difference in tax rate year-over-year will impact our EPS. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it and my follow-up was just on the unit guidance for fiscal 2020. On net basis we are looking at roughly 2.5% growth, I'm just wondering if you can give some color in terms of where Olive Garden and LongHorn will fall into that and confidence in Cheddar's maybe accelerating or is Cheddar's still in wait and see mode? Gene Lee : Jeff, first of all in the broad picture the total number of openings that we have this year will be very similar to last year. The difference is the openings will fall a little bit later in the fiscal year than they did this year just because of construction and developers not necessarily meeting the timelines that they had originally. So, well our openings will be about the same, our timing will be a little bit different. The total percent from Olive Garden and LongHorn is about a little bit over half of our total openings which isn't that different than we've had this year. Cheddar's will have about the same pace as last year. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got you, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Bernstein. Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open sir. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning, two things from me. First, a number of the casual diners that have pulled back on promotional activity are actually performing from a same store sales perspective among the best in the group. I am just wondering do you think the consumer sensitivity to discounting has made me lessen the bid or it is less disruptive than it has been in the past with more everyday value on menus across the group that's first? And second, the conversation on African swine fever has picked up and I saw that you increased the commodity inflation relative to last year, how did that play into your thinking, how comfortable are you with that and how it may impact Darden? Thanks. Gene Lee : You know on the everyday value question and then sensitivity promotions I think there has been a lot of good work done in the industry over the last couple of years to put more everyday value in. And we've been saying for a while that the consumer didn't want to be told what they had to do, what they had to buy to get that value. And I think a lot of people have rotated to more everyday value and to be able to do that means that you have to be less promotional like when you make that strategic choice. So, I think there's not much more for me to add there other than I believe we kind of lead the way with everyday value others have followed. I think it's the right thing to do and it tones down the promotional activity. Rick will talk about the other question. Rick Cardenas : As it relates to African swine flu a couple of things, one is pork represents approximately 2% of our total buy. So it's really a small impact and it has very, very small impact on our guide. It's going to take 18 to 36 months for this to work itself out. We're currently not seeing a huge increase in pricing but we expect to see some more of that in the back half of the year and that's already contemplated in our inflation numbers. Andrew Strelzik : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Strelzik. Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Gene, I wanted to ask a bit about the strength of operational execution at Olive Garden which you often identify as the biggest driver of the brand success and probably the largest sales driver. So, just wondering if you could talk more about ops execution in the quarter, if it remained as strong as what you've seen in recent quarters? And then I guess just more importantly if you could frame the runway from here for operations and throughput specifically to be a continued driver of performance as we look ahead through the balance of the year? Thanks. Gene Lee : The team continues to make progress on improving operational execution. There's always pockets in the system, the size of Olive Garden that has opportunities. There's always opportunities day-to-day, week-to-week to improve your overall execution. When you think about the size of Olive Garden and the number of servers that we have on each and every day there's always -- we always break down a little bit. So, every day that we break down a little bit less more guests have a better experience. The key to this long-term are continued simplification and I believe that management and the operating team inside Olive Garden is really focused on taking it to -- the simplification to the next level and that could drive even further improvements in overall execution for the next couple years. Throughput will always continue to be an opportunity. We were very effective from an advertising standpoint. A lot of our advertising drives people on Friday and Saturday night and we have long waits in our restaurants and that's -- we talk a lot about convenience and that's not very convenient. And consequently we've got to get better at making that experience more convenient for the consumer and we've got to get -- we have to get more people and guest through our restaurants each hour and shorten up those dining experiences. So we're going to continue to focus on this and we think it's a big upside. Dennis Geiger : Great, and then just if I could just recognizing you've given a lot of the key guidance pieces which is great, can you also just summarize your expectations thinking about EBIT margins for the year maybe relative to the long-term framework, if there's anything else you could add there specific to that item? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yeah Dennis, this is Rick. Our EBIT margin will be within our long-term framework and our long-term framework as a reminder is 10 to 30 basis points. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Geiger. Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. I wanted to go back to off premise for Olive Garden. Obviously at 15% of sales it's actually getting pretty big on a per store basis. Gene you mentioned enhancing capability, I think that was announced around off premise. How big do you think that can be on a first quarter basis, how much would you want it to be obviously considering that much of that business is going to come when you are the busiest on the Friday or Saturday night? Gene Lee : I think that that's always going to depend on consumer demand. I think improving our capabilities is going to be an important part of growing this. We just opened a new prototype in Orlando that has a full dedicated off premise area. We're learning a lot from that. We think that has tremendous upside for our higher volume off premise restaurants. We have restaurants now doing well over a $1 million off premise. A lot of this business comes in and it's out the door before 11 :30. And a lot of the catering that we're starting do now is really off -- it is pre the big meal period. And so that's really helpful. So we've got multiple projects going on today to improve our capabilities and then we think there's some attachment opportunities. Can we attach additional sales to the normal off premise experience, an example, if we start building these takeout spaces can we get some more beverage sale, can we get other attachment. We're still in the infancy of thinking about that but we think it's a fairly big idea which could grow that overall percentage over time. I think the way to summarize this is that we see tremendous opportunity in this space without sacrificing what we're really here to do which has created great in restaurant experience. John Ivankoe : Okay, and how big of a capital project would one of these dedicated takeout spaces be in an existing restaurant? Gene Lee : You know it's too early -- John, it's too early to really talk about that. But every restaurant we've got to figure out in the multiple and the different prototypes we have where we would add it, it has to be added in a specific place where you can staff it in your downtime without adding a lot of labor. You want proximity to the kitchen, you have the right heating and holding areas. And so I don't want to put a price tag on it right yet, we're still too early in that process. John Ivankoe : Helpful, thank you. Operator : And thank you for your question Mr. Ivankoe. Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open ma'am. Sara Senatore : Thank you. I have a follow up actually on Olive Garden and then a question on Cheddar's. On Olive Garden, I know you have said that in the past you are trying to reduce mix and also obviously you talked about planning [ph] and commercial activity. I guess margins seem fairly flat versus last year so I was just trying to understand a little bit about how to think about the tradeoff between your comp and margin or traffic and mix, however, you think about the complexion of the comp and how that associate to margin? And then I have a question on Cheddar's. Rick Cardenas : I think the margin impact in the quarter had a lot more to do with the investment we made with the Chicken Alfredo which ticked up with the 50% more chicken which ticked up our cost of sales. And then we had a promotional construct, it was pretty similar to last year at the same time. We didn\u2019t have the trade up opportunity that was driving a lot of mix. At the end of the day when you look at that Olive Garden margin there's no one out there in this space that has those types of margins and we're going to continue to invest in value which may limit the upward mobility of that. We don't expect margins to contract but I want to make sure that we're investing properly into that business. Sara Senatore : Okay, thank you. And then on Cheddar's a couple of comments just about -- you talked about maybe not having as much scale. You also talked about franchise businesses continue to be a much bigger drag certainly than the formerly franchised. And the rest I guess, as you think about that just -- one is I guess to be Darden scale was a big part of where the value creation could be, with respect to Cheddar's I am just trying to understand how you think about scale in the context of the brand that's smaller but as a part of a very large system like Darden? And then also do you contemplate -- would you ever contemplate being a bit more drastic with the former franchise restaurant, I assume they are still covering that cost capital but at some point does it ever make sense to close them or to think about them differently? Rick Cardenas : No, I mean I'll start with the latter part of that question. These restaurants that are driving the comp down are still extremely busy. They're high -- most them are very high volume restaurants that are leaking back down to more of the system average. So these are still great restaurants. On average they still produce good returns. They've been through the most change and that I think has created the most -- these have been the most disrupted restaurants. And I think that's why we're seeing a lot of the same-restaurant sales decline come from those restaurants. The destruction -- the biggest interruptions [ph] been total management change, total system change, everything that they do day in and day out has just changed operationally. And they've had some tough times adjusting.  But overall these are great restaurants and great territories so there's no drastic we're going to close these things. I think when you look at it and Rick alluded to it and I talked about it we made more money in Cheddar's this quarter than we did last quarter. And the thing I am really excited about in Cheddar's when we really look at it and dissect it our guest counts improve Q3 to Q4 against the industry, 160 basis points. As the industry weakens Cheddar's guest counts actually improve. So I mean we're making progress.  One more thing on Cheddar's that I didn't talk about in my prepared remarks but I think it's important to recognize is that we've been transforming these kitchens in the last year. We've done approximately 100 of them. We did 34 in the fourth quarter. This is a very disruptive process and the majority of the transformation this quarter were done in the formerly franchised restaurants. This transformation allows us to really improve the efficiency in labor, improve the speed of service with the food coming out of the kitchen. These were big, big moves. This is behind us and we're really excited about this and we think that this is going to have a big impact. One of the things that we do know is that there is a significant sales decline after we do transformation as the team struggled with this new operating procedure. But that works its way out. As far as scale goes I think my reference scale was more about just the overall size of the brand and the future growth opportunities. Today Cheddar's is definitely benefiting from our scale. It's plugged into our supply chain. It's been a huge benefit for them, it's allowed us to really continue to focus on value for the consumer. And so I think scale is working for them on that side. They're going to benefit from our data scale over time. And most importantly I think the thing that I can see you focus on is can we get these human resource metrics closer to our Darden norms. I think when that happens that's where we're going to see some really great growth. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Ms. Senatore. Our last question is from Stephen Anderson with Maxim Group. Your line is open sir. Stephen Anderson : Yes. Thank you. Wanted to ask about the rewards program you have in tests it is about 130 restaurants or so. I wanted to ask what progress you've seen, what you have learned from that experience, and perhaps any plan to expand that program? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : We continue to have the rewards program in test. We continue to analyze what's happening there. There's some really positive in that program. There's some challenges with that program. We're going to continue to observe this and figure out whether we can drive greater loyalty with it. If not we'll dissolve it. And at this point in time we have no plans to roll it out. We have no plans to dissolve it. We continue to observe that consumer behavior. Stephen Anderson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Anderson. We do have a question from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Your line is open sir. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks. Just wanted to -- just hoping to circle back on third party delivery. Gene we have seen some concepts that has been hesitant historically, sort of recently announced a launching delivery and it seems more broadly that the economics for restaurants and maybe people of those large chains could be improving. Would you agree with that and I heard your earlier comments but are we getting closer to the point where it makes sense to pursue that opportunity with the existing off premise growth moderating here? Thank you. Gene Lee : Well no, I think that the economics are -- the burden of third party delivery is being shifted to the company to the consumer. People are -- what I'm seeing is brands moving that burden away from themselves and on to the consumer. And at this point I'm just a little uncomfortable with that what percentage is the consumer long-term willing to pay off their overall check to have that convenience. And that has to be proved out to me over time if that's something that we want to do. We're still in a value proposition and I'm just not sure. I'm watching what everybody is -- we're watching what everybody's doing. We continue to believe especially in Olive Garden that it's much better for us to focus on the catering and delivery part of this. We've just made -- we've just changed how we think about that. We've put the size -- dollar size of the order now has move from $100 to $75 and we've moved from 24 hour notice to 5 o'clock the day before. We think that that is a strong move and we are very interested in delivering ourselves to people who want to have a food experience delivered over $75. And again the average order of that activity for us is well over $300. It's a highly rated from a satisfaction standpoint event and we want to focus on that more so than trying to move a $15 entree. And so, we're watching what's happening. We don't think that the economic burdens change that much. We think it's just been shifted from the restaurant to the consumer. Brian Vaccaro : Yes, understood, that makes sense. And then just back to the changes you made on your existing off premise to pricing and the order time, when was that put in place again literally like this quarter or was that partially through our fiscal 4Q? Gene Lee : It's just being put in place now. Brian Vaccaro : Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Vaccaro. I would now turn the conference back over to Kevin Kalicak for closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Alright, thanks Jill. With that that concludes our call. I want to remind everybody that we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday, September 19th before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks again for participating in today's call. Operator : That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great rest of your day.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode and we will have question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please take note that we'll only take one question and one follow-up. Now, let me hand the call over to your host, Kevin Kalicak. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Ray. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings on December 19 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the first quarter. As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated Knapp-Track excluding Darden, specifically, Olive Garden and LongHorn. During our first fiscal quarter, industry total sales growth was flat, industry same-restaurant sales declined 1.2% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 3.3%. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we had a solid quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.1 billion, an increase of 3.5%. Same-restaurant sales increased 0.9% and diluted net earnings per share were $1.38. Comparable same-restaurant sales for the industry continued to weaken during the quarter as the industry once again faced tougher comparisons. However, the industry comping negative is surprising considering unemployment remains at all-time low and there continues to be strong wage growth, which historically has been a positive for the industry. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, given the industry performance and their difficult comparisons over the first quarter of last year. We remain focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy and leveraging our four competitive advantages. And I'm pleased, we continued to take share and protect our margins. Turning to brand highlights for the quarter. Olive Garden had strong quarter, which resulted in its 20th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 3.6%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 2.2% and 1.4% growth in new restaurants. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales gap to the industry was 340 basis points this quarter, representing the largest gap to the industry since the first quarter of fiscal 2019. And on a two-year basis Olive Garden grew total sales by nearly 10%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 840 basis points. Olive Garden's results were driven by the team's ongoing focus on flawless execution, everyday value, and convenience. Guest satisfaction ratings remain impressive, and catering delivery metrics reflect the highest intent to recommend within the brand giving us confidence that our teams are delivering great experiences inside and outside the four walls of our restaurants. The Olive Garden team made a strategic decision to change the order of their first quarter promotions. This was necessary to separate their two strongest value promotions; Buy One Take One, and Never Ending Pasta Bowl to more evenly deliver the value messaging throughout the year. While this change along with associated media shifts and weakening industry trends resulted in lower traffic than last year, it was the right strategic decision for the long term. Recognizing the strength of Buy One Take One promotion, Olive Garden added $5 take-home entr\u00e9es to the Everyday value lineup, which was supported with national advertising to drive awareness. It has been met with strong guest demand, and it will be a catalyst to continue to grow the off-premise business. Everyday value was also strengthened with the introduction of a new weekday lunch menu with 21 options under $10, including guest favorites like Chicken Parmigiana and items from the Taste of the Mediterranean menu like Chicken Margarita. This initiative was supported by integrated marketing and resulted in stronger weekday lunch traffic and guest preference. Finally, the Olive Garden team remains focused on their off-premise capabilities to meet their guests' needs for convenience. A key part of that focus has been optimizing the digital sales channel for both mobile and desktop. During the quarter, digital sales grew by more than 30% and represented approximately 40% of to go sales. Overall, off-premise sales grew 12%, representing 14% of total sales. Olive Garden remains a truly iconic and broadly appealing brand and the team is doing an excellent job of focusing on this strategy and competing effectively. LongHorn Steakhouse had a strong quarter as well. Total sales grew 4.6%, driven by 2% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.6%, the 26th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. On a two-year basis, LongHorn grew total sales by 11%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 940 basis points. The LongHorn team remains focused on their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution, and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement. During the quarter, the LongHorn team ran two successful menu promotions; Grill Master Favorite and Fire Crafted Flavors, which were supported by their award-winning You Can't Fake Steak advertising campaign. They also supported these promotions by reinforcing their quality story through multiple guest touch points. The team also continued to focus on ensuring the to go experience equals their in-restaurant experience for guests who choose this convenience. The team simplified the online ordering process, which significantly reduced the order time. During the quarter, digital sales grew almost 50% and represented more than one-third of total to go sales. Additionally, they have now completed a dedicated to go area in more than half of their restaurants. These actions led to continued improvement in guest satisfaction scores for order accuracy and timeliness and helped to drive to go sales growth nearly 12%. Finally, LongHorn's industry-leading retention rates continue to even get better despite the tight labor market. Team member turnover during the quarter was 68% compared to approximately 120% for casual dining, and management turnover during the quarter was 13% compared to approximately 36% for casual dining. We know that engaged team members provide better guest experiences, and the LongHorn team's ongoing focus on retention and culture building is a key driver of the strong business performance. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales decreased 2%, driven by same-restaurant sales decline of 5.4%, and partially offset by sales growth from new restaurants of 3.4%. The trend change was driven by reduced marketing efforts and overall industry softness in the quarter. In addition, the same-restaurant sales decline continued to be more pronounced in the former franchise locations. These restaurants experienced significant disruption during the quarter as they were the last restaurants to complete the kitchen transformation project. While it's disappointing to see the sales trend decline, the Cheddar's team made significant progress against their priorities during the quarter. At the beginning of the new fiscal year, they established three new strategic priorities; create a people focused results-oriented culture, reduce friction in the guest experience, and build a brand people talk about with the goal of building on the progress they made last year repairing [ph] fundamental elements of the business and improving the sales trajectory. During the quarter, the Cheddar's team continued to see improvements in both the manager and team member turnover trends as they implemented initiatives that led to higher retention levels. Overall, staffing levels for both the manager and team members improved during the quarter. Because of the progress made this quarter in staffing and intention, the Cheddar's team was able to better execute operational improvements designed to enhance the guest experience. For example, they implemented standard that significantly upgraded their abilities to successfully serve large parties. With these and other improvements, they saw a better guest experience results compared to last year across all key metrics. Near the end of the quarter, Cheddar's introduced the new menu with more price diversity within categories and they launched their Quick Pick Lunch Combos starting at $5.99. These combos are generating strong preference at lunch and have led to higher value and intend to return ratings compared to last year. I recognized there's still a lot of work to do, but the progress the Cheddar's team has made operationally and their improved HR metrics are encouraging. Now that they feel they're moving in the right direction from an operation and staffing perspective, they will begin to increase their working media spend. Cheddar's has the highest guest frequency of any Darden brand and this investment is intended to build upon the strong position, improve brand awareness and drive trial. They will be leveraging Darden resources and best practices to implement the media plan. Finally, during the quarter, we acquired four previously franchise restaurant locations in Texas, and I'm pleased to say that each of these four restaurants is performing at a very high level. In closing, I\u2019m pleased with the progress our teams made executing against the strategic initiatives. Our strategy is working, allowing us to continue to grow sales, increased market share, improve margins and invest in our people and brands, all while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Of course, none of this would be possible of having the best people in the business, so I want to take this opportunity to thank you our 185,000 team members who continued to create memorable dining experiences for our guests. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We had another good quarter with total sales growth of 3.5%, driven by 2.6% growth from the addition of 40 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. First quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, an increase of 3% from last year's diluted net earnings per share. We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $95 million in shares, returning over $200 million to shareholders this quarter. Before I get into the detailed results from this quarter, I want to mention that we adopted the new accounting standard for leases at the beginning of this fiscal year. Consistent with the expectation discussed on last quarter's call, we estimate that this will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.05 in fiscal 2020. However, the more meaningful impact was to our balance sheet, as you saw from this morning's press release. This quarter, we also updated our segment reporting. Beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of segment profit now excludes non-cash real estate related expenses and fiscal 2019 has been restated for comparability. This change allows for more consistent evaluation of our business across segments and fiscal periods. Now turning to our detailed margin results. Food and beverage costs were flat to last year, as pricing of 2% and continued cost savings initiatives offset commodity inflation of approximately 1.5% and continued investments. I'm impressed with restaurant labor being flat to last year, particularly in light of same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. Total labor inflation of 4% was offset by pricing, check mix and productivity improvements in new and existing restaurants. Restaurant expense was unfavorable 10 basis points due to deleverage, as our comp sales growth was below inflation. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.1% was 10 basis points unfavorable to last year. General and administrative expense was 50 basis points lower than last year and favorable mark-to-market expense, which is generally offset in the tax line, lower management incentive expense and sales leverage. Our Q1 effective tax rate of 9.8% was slightly below the range in our annual guidance. We still anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11% for the fiscal year. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter and impressed with our strong EAT margin of 8.1%. Turning to our segment performance. Olive Garden grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin increased 40 basis points, by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing cost-effectively. LongHorn also grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased slightly, due to elevated beef inflation and continued investments during the quarter. Fine Dining grew sales and profit in the quarter as well, driven by a positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased because of higher pre-opening expense and inefficiencies related to three new restaurants. Sales for our Other Business segment grew 1.8%, driven by net new restaurants. Both segment profit dollars and margin decreased this quarter due to margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter. As you saw in the press release, we reiterated all aspects of our fiscal 2020 outlook. Looking ahead at our second quarter performance, there are two things I would like to address before we open up the call for questions. Both of which are contemplated in our annual guidance. First, the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday this year, relative to last, is shifting from the second quarter, into the third quarter. Since we are closed in the majority of our restaurants on this day, this shift should positively impact Darden's second quarter same-restaurant sales, by approximately 80 to 100 basis points with a corresponding offset in the third quarter. Second, given a prolonged media coverage and the storms duration, Hurricane Dorian had a meaningful impact on the first two weeks of our fiscal second quarter. We are currently estimating a drag of 20 to 30 basis points to same-restaurant sales in the second quarter. And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open, sir. Matt DiFrisco : Thank you. My question is with respect to the Cheddar's, I guess, lagging in difference between Olive Garden and LongHorn. Would you attribute that mostly, it sounds like to the marketing spend? Can you sort of bracket or compare how much pullbacks of marketing spend there was versus last year in either terms of dollars or in terms of weeks of support, so we could get a better understanding of that? Gene Lee : I'm not -- we're not going to get that granular with our spending in Cheddar's. I would just say that we now have enough transactional data to look at some things in Cheddar's we haven't had the opportunity to do before. And one of the big insights is that our frequency in Cheddar's is higher than any other Darden brand. And we married that up with some of the research that we were doing, and we recognized that our awareness for this brand is extremely low. And our primary advertising had been more driven towards a frequency play. And we decided, once we have this insight during the quarter, we were pulling -- we pulled back from that type of activity, and now we're going go out and we're going to test and learn and understand how to best increase our awareness in markets. We also recognize the fact that it's going to be more important than ever in this environment to continue to build out our markets, develop our -- become more efficient in those markets from a media standpoint, and I would say more -- use more traditional media to increase our awareness to drive this business. And so, it was a really good quarter from that -- from an insight standpoint for us to really recognize, and we decided we were going to change direction and that's where we pulled back a little bit of the media spend during the quarter. Matt DiFrisco : Okay. And then, I guess, is there something different to the menu that may be triggered a change in frequency to the heavy, heavy user from the past, or is it the change in ownership that they noticed or something like that? Gene Lee : No, it's just the fact that we actually now have the transactional data to be able to analyze and have that insight. That's why it's so important when we do an acquisition for us to put our systems in, so that we can get the data and then do our analysis. Matt DiFrisco : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. Sir, your line is open. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. Gene, I just wanted to talk to about the industry trends that you're seeing. It seems like your analysis in the prepared remarks that this was a little surprising that we've seen such soft trends, especially in the most recent months. So just curious to get your thoughts on why you think that's happening? And secondly, do you think you need to adjust any of your marketing or promotional strategies to the new environment so to speak? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yeah. Good morning, David. As I said in my prepared remarks, the backdrop appears to be very strong for the consumer. We have good wage growth. We have strong employment. Historically, that's been really good for us. As we look at the data and we when look at behaviors, when we look at confidence I have -- I personally believe that there's some uncertainty entering into the consumer, and it's impacting their confidence. How long? I\u2019ve got to believe there with all the media attention around what's happening, how long does this continue -- this environment continue? So, there's nothing structural that we see that's changed out there other than there appears to be a little bit more uncertainty today than there was in the future. As far as what do we need to do? We need to continue to create compelling guest experiences and come up with -- and reinforce our value propositions. I do think that we have to think about how we're going to market in our smaller brands and how do we advertise those brands in different channels and become more effective and compete more effectively? I think that's an important change that we need to make in the upcoming quarters. I think we have the luxury of being patient and test and learn and really make great long-term decisions as we try to figure out how to support those brands and compete more effectively in this marketplace. We're pleased that we're heading into Never Ending Pasta Bowl in Olive Garden, it\u2019s a great promotion for us. We had a lot of buzz around our Pasta Pass this year. And so, I think it's a good promotion going into this time of year and where the consumer\u2019s at. David Tarantino : And maybe just a follow-up Gene, does the current environment, or what you've seen recently make you think differently about the degree of difficulty in hitting your comp guidance for the year? I know you have maybe lesser fiscal [ph] comparisons coming up. And how should we think about the middle of the comp guidance or the upper end of the comp guidance relative to where you were three months ago? Gene Lee : Well, I guess, we reiterated our guidance today. We believe our same restaurant sales for the year will be somewhere between 1% and 2%. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is actually Neal [ph] on for Will. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick one here. Wondering if you can give any insights into commodity costs? You spoke to some elevated beef costs there. Just wondering how you're feeling about this going forward, whether you\u2019ve seen any effects from African swine fever? Ricardo Cardenas : Thanks, Neal. This is Rick. We were about 1.5% inflation in the first quarter, which is around where we expected it to be. We have seen a little bit of elevation in beef, but the boards are coming back down and are a little bit more in our favor. So, we still expect our inflation to be where we thought at the beginning of this fiscal year. As a result, or as an answer to your African Swine Flu question, we still haven't seen a very big impact in African Swine Flu. As we mentioned in the last call, pork is really only about 2% of our sales. So, it's a relatively small impact. And we haven't seen the downstream impacts of pork prices yet. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Joshua Long : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back to the trends you've seen here lately and maybe any sort of regional variations, or any regional variations you've seen across the system? And then, also, in terms of your initiatives and kind of the underlying trends you've seen, any sort of differences in the weekday, weekend trends? You've got some very strong lunch offerings in there, but didn't know if that was may be moving the needle like you expected or may be ahead of expectations? Gene Lee : No. I really don't have a lot to add to your question. We\u2019ve really not seen much from a geographic standpoint and there's really been no trend change to any of the weekday, weekday night, weekday lunch or a weekend business. I would say that, the trends have weakened in all areas of the business. Joshua Long : Great. Thanks. And then one follow-up, if I may, in terms of your work on the To Go business, the strength there is still very promising. Any sort of learnings you've had as you stuck with this and worked on the fulfillment internally, versus the thought process of working with external partners? I know, you're always testing and always learning. But curious on what you're seeing there, if there's any update. Gene Lee : I think, the biggest thing our teams are doing is, they\u2019re taking friction out of the process. And, I think, we're getting -- it\u2019s like anything else, repetition is a great thing. You continued to get better and better with it, as you do more business. So, I think LongHorn has made tremendous progress. We've seen their scores go up, their satisfaction scores go up. Olive Garden has really honed in on this process. They continue to find ways. Very, very impressed with the digital growth in both of those businesses. We think that's something to continue to look at. So to me, it's really about making that experience as compelling as we possibly can with great value, right. I think, it's -- and that's been our strategy is, to make sure that we have strong value on the off premise and not have the consumer be willing to come pick it up, versus it being delivered. Joshua Long : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Levy from MKM Partners. Your line is open. Brett Levy : Good morning. Thanks for taking the call, gentlemen. If we could just hone in a little bit more, I'm going to ask the consumer question a different way and hopefully get some sentiment of a different answer. When you think about\u2026 Gene Lee : We could try. Brett Levy : I'll try. When you think about the consumers right now, are you seeing any changes in how they're using you? Obviously, take-home is further building out your off premise, but are you seeing any changes in terms of full price value add-ons, size of parties, something like that? Thank you. Gene Lee : No, Brett. No, we haven't seen any change at all. And -- when I look at the quarter -- let me put it back to look at the quarter. Let's think about what Olive Garden has done in the last two years. Even though the industry has weakened, I'm incredibly impressed that we've grown our business approximately 10% at Olive Garden with two-year comp that I think is extremely impressive. And so the industry and a lot of the comments that I made today about the industry decelerating, I look at our two large brands; I think they're competing very effectively. The gaps are very, very strong to the industry. So, I think we have a way to compete very effectively with these two brands and I'm excited. And yes, we watch the industry and we give you some insight to it, but our job and our leaders' jobs are to find a way to compete effectively in any environment and I think that's what our teams have done really well in this first quarter. Brett Levy : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : Yes. Hi. Thank you. It\u2019s also just an industry question for you Gene. Obviously, Knapp all-store traffic has actually been negative and what I think you said to a previous question is a relatively strong underlying consumer environment, especially in terms of some of topline trending. Where do you see -- that consumer actually going? I mean where -- if that consumer is working and that consumer has higher income, where is that consumer currently dining -- whether it\u2019s in the house or out of the house is kind of the first question? Secondly, do you see independence -- being great cycle as we are as potentially taking care versus chains? And what would you look out to maybe a shake that some supply growth that\u2019s been added in the space over the last several years? And then the final point, I think, you kind of you mentioned a few times more value at Olive Garden and in Cheddar\u2019s. Is there any thought of bringing back couponing and doing other things that are going to be direct call to action for the consumer for you to maintain traffic and what you described earlier as any industry environment? Gene Lee : John, you get the award for most questions inside a one question. John Ivankoe : It's all related. I think you can do it in one paragraph. Gene Lee : I got independence, I got discount. What was the first? John Ivankoe : The first one was\u2026 Gene Lee : Where are people are going. John we are definitely seeing some strength in limited service both fast casual and quick-serve, there's no doubt about that. And you think about there is good income growth on the lower end of the curve and those folks seem to be trading or dining out a little bit more frequently. And I don't know where people are trading out of in casual when you look at a 10-year period, that's been a big question. I'm not sure we\u2019ve had -- we as an industry, you have an answer. Again, we focused on our brands and we seem to be getting more than our fair share. The data that we're looking at is saying that large chains are still taking more share and they're taking that share from independence. Where you see independence and small regional change are in really what I would call the better, better trade areas, the higher income trade areas, where they are having an impact and I think performing well. But I think on a national scale, when you look at it, independence are still donating share and large brands continue to do better and take share from both smaller probably a little bit older brands and independents. As far as discounting, we're going to continue to use, whatever levers we can use to grow our business. When you look at -- when we look at incentives, we don't look at just as one piece. We have to look at our overall advertising program. What is going on from a television standpoint, what's going on from a digital and online, what are we doing from an incentive standpoint. We have multiple ways to put incentives out there. And so we have a lot of leverage that we can pull over time depending on the environment. And we will use those appropriately to drive our business in a profitable way. The one thing that, I think that we are proud of, and I'm very proud of our teams is that we continue to drive our business, while protecting our margins. And we continue to invest in our business, invest in quality, invest in food, invest in portion size, invest in our people, and we're able to do that in a way that has protected our margins. And as Rick talked about, our plus 8% EBIT margins are incredibly impressive in this environment. And so when we think about incentives, we think about it holistically and all that we're doing to build our brands over the long-term. John Ivankoe : That's great, very helpful, excellent answer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Over the last couple of months, we've been hearing a lot more about delivery take rates coming down, being renegotiated lower. Wondering if that changes your perspective on the liability of delivery for Darden at all, especially as you've kind of highlighted some of the changes on the digital side and the willingness given the numbers that you cited for customers to engage with the brands digitally, if your thoughts are evolving at all on delivery? Gene Lee : No. We haven't -- we really haven't -- have any -- thoughts haven't evolved at all. We will acknowledge that the cost burden does appear to be shifting from the company to the consumer, and we are going to watch that closely. But I think -- I have a lot of concerns about that. This is still -- we're still -- it's all about value and how much of the overall experience are you willing to dedicate towards convenience? And so it's something to watch. It's definitely a shift that we internally predicted that would happen. And we'll watch it, but I want to pivot back to what I said earlier, our job is to create a compelling off-premise experience right now that -- with so much value that consumer is willing to come and get it. That seems to be working for us and we're going to continue to focus on that. Andrew Strelzik : If I could just follow-up on the value piece then just quickly. The Olive Garden price was about 2% for the quarter. Was that what the underlying price was? Not that it's a huge deviation from where you've been prior, but should be thinking about a little bit more price broadly at Olive Garden going forward? Rick Cardenas : Andrew, this is Rick. The price was 2.2%, I believe in the first quarter and that's just due to timing of pricing year-over-year. We still expect our price to be below 2%, which is our long-term goal to keep pricing below our inflation and below our competitors to increase our value perception in the marketplace, while still making great investments. So, yes, this was just a little bit of a timing anomaly for the quarter. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Anderson from Maxim. Your line is open. Stephen Anderson : Yes. Good morning. I would actually want to ask about the test you have underway for your rewards programs to see a multi-concept. As I recall, it\u2019s about 7% of your storage, you're testing that out right now. I wanted to ask about how the test is progressing? And whether you are ready to roll that out to additional locations, or potentially entire system? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Stephen, this is Rick again. Thanks for the question. As you said, yes, we have our loyalty program in about 7% of our restaurants and that -- across the nation. We're still monitoring that test. As we have said quite a few times, this is going to take a long time to understand the frequency driving nature of the loyalty program and how much we\u2019d have to provide discounts to our most loyal consumers to come to us, versus other incentives for them to come. The test is going okay. It's going well, but we're not ready to pull the trigger on adding more restaurants. We're going nationally. And when we do, I am sure all of you will be to first to know. But, right now, we're kind of holding steady on our test. The fact that it's still out there, tells you that it's not going well, but we want to just make sure that it's the right thing to do in the long run, as part of what Gene says, our overall strategy of how do we market to our consumers. Stephen Anderson : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Also, please limit your question to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Our next question is from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is open. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Just wanted to ask about mix, and I guess specifically on Olive Garden, is the impact that you saw in the quarter was roughly in line with expectation prior to the quarter? And then, more importantly, just looking out over the next few quarters, anything that would make you think the mix contribution could remain above kind of a long-term steady state? I guess if you could just kind of highlight some of the mix considerations this year, some of the puts and takes, thinking about incentives, trade-up promos, catering delivery or catering off-premise, et cetera. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Two things, I think, that will probably drive mix maybe a little bit above our target will be continued growth in catering and catering delivery and the addition of the $5 Take Homes. Those two things probably are going to drive that mix slightly above our long-term expectations. The $5 Take Home is a great value offering and it's something that we think is a real catalyst to continue to drive the off premise business, which should have a little bit more of a positive mix than what we want to try to do for a long-term. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Eric Gonzalez : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I think in the first quarter you benefited from a few extra weeks of the Buy One Take One as you pull that forward. But I think you said in your comment that it was a drag on traffic due to media shift. So I was wondering if you can maybe clarify what you meant there. And I know you had the hurricane impact, but perhaps you can quantify what the impact of not having those extra weeks of the Buy One Take One in the early part of the second quarter? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : No. We're not going to talk about the second quarter impact. And we shifted some media; we moved things around, which is always going to move our comparisons somewhat. But I'll go back to my statement; this was something we think strategically needed to be done. And -- again, I would also add this also always shifts in our media spending, as we -- it's the only way you can really discern what is working and what is not working and what -- and where to put more weight against, whether it's promotion or lunch or value is that you have to change the media spend to learn. And so we shifted a little bit inside the quarter. I wouldn't get caught up in that I point back to a great two-year stack great our performance in the industry. We made a strategic -- a big strategic choice to separate the two value promotions that gives us more balance in our value messaging throughout the year, which is really important. Let's not get hung up on a week-to-week media shifts. Eric Gonzalez : If I could maybe sneak in a follow-up there. On the $5 take-home and the Buy One Take One are similar type of -- they are sort of similar programs, are you moving away from Buy One Take One next year or is that something that's on the table? Gene Lee : No, I think they're similar, but different. And so there are different types of value offering and our team will continue to reenergize Buy One Take One, it's an important part of our value proposition. And if it's done right, it will continue to support the $5 take-home. It shouldn't be a cannibalistic thing. It should -- it really should support it and move it after you run Buy One Take One that should be the springboard for a $5 take-home for the rest of the year and you can reenergize the promotion each year. So, that's how we're thinking about that. So, it should be additive not -- it shouldn't be dilutive at all. Eric Gonzalez : That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass : Thanks. Thanks very much. First just on the other brands and the continued softness there. I think you commented last quarter that there is increased competition. So, maybe what we're seeing here is just more of that. But can you talk about how you think about -- what it's a breakthrough strategy to help market those brands better if you can achieve them national advertising scale of those brands? And does delivery makes sense in some -- we talk about delivery holistically, do you like delivery or not. But does it make sense in some brands, may be some of these smaller brands, it's worth giving a try given that they don't have that scale and delivery through the aggregator sort of provide scale that they don't otherwise have? Gene Lee : Well, it's an interesting concept John. As you think about the smaller brands, we've been reluctant to really add a lot of marketing costs to these businesses. They are unique; they've got great strong value propositions. But I think in this environment, I think we finally come to grips with that we're probably going to have to spend a little bit more money and become -- and try to find which channels in the digital environment can work best for them. I think there's not one channel that would work across all our small brands. And so each of them are so unique, we have to figure out what's the best way to talk to the consumer. As far as off-premise, our third-party delivery for the smaller brands, I really don't see that as upside. We do have one of our tests in the majority of the Yard House's. We are using a provider. Just think about where Yard House is located. It's embedded in a lifestyle center with no parking and so it's more difficult even for the last-mile provider to get in there and pick up the food. So, it's not a big part of the business. So, I don't really think about that as a way to grow the business. I think that, we need to make really good long-term decisions. We've been able to protect our margins in these businesses. We've got to continue to innovate and make them attractive. We also have to recognize -- there's a lot of volatility in these businesses. And it goes back to -- if you open an another restaurant that looks like you are in the same development. It's going to have a one year impact on the comps. And we have that once in a while. These are great brands. We're going to, obviously, try to compete a little differently as we go forward. I wouldn't look for a big change here in the next couple of quarters because we're going to test and learn and we're going to do it responsively. These are strong business models and I'm not going to put the brands on sale to get a headline number. We're going to protect the overall business for the long-term. John Glass : Thank you. I'm sorry to belabor the value point on Olive Garden. I just want to make sure I understand this correctly. You spent last year reducing some of the couponing or discounting and reserving that value power if you needed in the future. Are you now suggesting you need that today, or is this still, it's in the reserve, but you are not really changing your view on increased value promotions in 2020 as it stands today? Gene Lee : I mean as it stands today, I think, our position is exactly the same as it was the past couple of quarters that Olive Garden continues to perform extremely well, in over 300 basis points gap to the industry. We'll continue to look at each promotion, and what kind of support that promotion needs, depending what we're doing from a television standpoint. I do think that the analyst community and investor community is looking at things too much in isolation. And you don't have the whole picture of what's happening from overall media spend. And because we run a TBI or a TBI test, you read into a situation that things must be bad. I think that's not the way to look -- to analyze our business. It's just one of many levers that we have to pull to support our business. And right now I think, we're looking at the Olive Garden business as being competing extremely well in the environment. John Glass : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jake Bartlett from SunTrust. Your line is open. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. My question was about Cheddar's. And I'm wondering where you think you are now in the integration of the business, the turnaround of operations, the improvements and in the context of your acquisition and strategy going forward? Do you feel like you're in a position now, where you might get more active on acquisitions? Gene Lee : Well, that's a two-part question. I think where are we on Cheddar's? I think today, I'm more optimistic than I've ever been. I think, as I acknowledge in my opening comments there\u2019s still a ton of work to do there. This is a high volume complex operation that has some operational challenges that aren't systemic. Where we have strong leadership and great human resource metrics, we're running great businesses. We have to stabilize some of these other businesses and start with getting that right General Manager in place, managing partner and then building a great team. So, I think that, I'm very encouraged; the HR metrics are really starting to improve. I'm encouraged that our operation metrics are improving. I'm encouraged that our controls are better today than ever. I'm encouraged that our restaurant is staffed. And I'm encouraged with the new insight that we've really uncovered that we've got a real awareness problem. And an awareness problem is with people within 10 miles of our restaurants. So I'm encouraged that we can solve that. But we're going to solve these problems for the long-term. We\u2019re going to build a strong foundation and we're going to do it right. This represents less than 8% of our overall business and I'm really resolute in the fact that I want to fix this and fix it right for the long-term. I think this is still a huge opportunity. And as much urgency as I'm putting behind it, I'm more concerned about doing it right. As far as M&A activity, I use a standard statement. But the management and the board are going to continue to look at opportunities to add to our portfolio when it's appropriate. And I really have no further comment on that at this point in time. Jake Bartlett : Got it. And I had a follow-up question on your level of incentives and your approach to incentives. And your traffic has been negative the last two quarters at Olive Garden, obviously, outperforming the space significantly. As you look at that, are you focused more on the outperformance or your absolute level? And I'm kind of wondering how long you're going to -- you would kind of tolerate negative traffic versus kind of trying to insert more incentives to try to drive that positive? Gene Lee : Yeah. First of all, let's look at the magnitude of the negative traffic. I mean half of the negative traffic that we reported last month is just due to catering delivery. And that piece of the off premise business grows -- we're not giving ourselves any guest counts for that. We're not doing that for multiple reasons. And we could go ahead and change our methodology and have positive traffic if we chose to do that. I think that when we look at traffic and we look at the overall business, there are going to be times that there's traffic available to you and it's worth driving. There are other times when you look at the business, and you say, I'm okay with losing 10, or 15, 20 guests a week and being able to protect our business model. And so, I don't think you can just have, let's do everything we can to grow traffic, or let's do everything we can to protect our business model. I think it all has to be done in balance. And I think our management teams and this leadership team have done an outstanding job over the last four years of really balancing these efforts. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel. Your line is open. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning. First just a point of clarification and a question. Is the $5 Take Home entr\u00e9e promotion considered a new off premise transaction, or is it just an add-on to the dining check? And then, Gene, can you provide some more detail about how Cheddar's plans to broaden reach with its advertising? And when we might start to see that investment? Gene Lee : Yeah. The $5 Take Home is an off premise transaction. And as far as Cheddar's goes, I mean, we're out there testing and learning with different digital vehicles to see and other traditional media to see what we can -- what kind of awareness we can generate with that. So we're out there at a small scale and we'll continue to increase that scale as we learn. Chris O\u2019Cull: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks. Gene, just a couple of questions on Cheddar's, can we just go back and talk about the guest satisfaction scores, may be direction that you're seeing there? Are those improving, or have those kind of started to go backwards? And then on the turnover at Cheddar's both manager and the crew level, are those -- how far are those off of Darden's average? How much more work is yet to be done there? Thanks. Gene Lee : Good question, Peter. Guest satisfaction scores are increasing across the board as we've improved management, employee staffing and there is still opportunity there and I would say that the virgins, the differential between the better operating stores and the one for challenges is still too great and we've got to close that gap down. As far as turnover, the metrics are still outside Darden norms, but they are inside industry norms for the first time, which is I think is a really good trend. And it's going to take us a while to get them -- hopefully get them to Darden norms, but they are on their way and again inside industry trends at this point in time. Peter Saleh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. One clarification first. Gene, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the industry comps continued to weaken and then you did mention -- I'm just trying to gauge whether you think it\u2019s older to tough compare because I think that was what you mention initially as a rationale or whether you do see that there is some sort of change in the consumer behavior, because when you look at past couple of quarters, it seems like the two-year trend on comp and traffic seems relatively stable. So, maybe you're looking at broader industry data that we don't get a chance to see more holistically or whether you think it's again more just the two-year comp compare being more difficult or where there's actual change in the consumer? Gene Lee : Well, I think that, I think it's a combination of both. I think that's what I was trying to allude to in the comment was that, the industry was facing some tougher comparison, but I think you all talked about that is that overall industry comparisons were little bit more difficult. But I think, what I was trying to get at is, we were surprised that it went all the way to negative. We thought that our view was to the industry would stay positive in this environment. It may not -- the growth rate would've come back just like, if you look at GDP growth, it's still strong, but it has decelerated. So, we were just I think a little surprised that the industry went all the way back to negative. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just want to talk about Cheddar's, I'm just wondering things like the under-the-hood metrics are getting better and you seem excited about the opportunity longer term. I was just wondering whether frustration on the sales in the short-term might lead you to delay when you would otherwise ramp-up the new unit growth which seem like that was the big opportunity over time, I'm just wondering whether that timeframe might have changed or have been pushed back at all? Gene Lee : Only the timeframe has changed. I think we've been pretty consistent with our talking point around that is the biggest thing for a new unit ramp-up growth would be human resources and I'm not so sure that I haven't said that we won that battle yet. And so, every time you open a new restaurant, you make that investment, you got to have a great managing partner. And I don't think that we're there at that point yet that we can ramp-up growth. We're still doing five or six a year, which is the right number at this point in time. And I want -- I really want to see the management depth continue to build. And then when you get to that point that's when you can start to ramp-up growth. But I don't think that's -- we haven't given a timeline to that and I'm going to give a timeline today. I'm focused on really, really getting great managing partners in these restaurants. And I know when we do that our likelihood of success increases dramatically. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. No more questions at this time. Let me now hand the call over to Kevin Kalicak. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Ray. That concludes our call. I want to remind you all that we plan to release second quarter results on Thursday, December 19th before the market opens with conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Darden Fiscal Year 2020 Second Quarter Earnings Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings on March 19th before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and then Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the second quarter. As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today\u2019s call refer to estimated Knapp-Track excluding Darden, specifically, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. During our fiscal second quarter, industry total sales growth was 1.2%, industry same-restaurant sales increased 0.3% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 2.3%. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ve seen from our press release this morning, we had a good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.06 billion, an increase of 4.2%, same-restaurant sales increased 2% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.12. Looking at the industry overall. We continue to see that consumers are willing to visit brands with compelling value and strong in-restaurant execution. That\u2019s why we remain relentlessly focused on executing our back to basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere and supported with integrated marketing that resonates with our guests. We also continue to strengthen and leverage our four competitive advantages. One of those advantages is our results-oriented culture. Admits record low unemployment, I am proud to see our retention rates continue to improve. We have a compelling employment proposition and our ability to retain and staff our restaurants with the right people is an important driver of our success. Turning to brand highlights for the quarter. Olive Garden delivered its 21st consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 2.6%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 1.5% and 1.1% growth from new restaurants. Olive Garden outperformed the industry benchmark in same-restaurant sales and traffic by 120 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. As a reminder, Olive Garden had a difficult promotional ramp to start the quarter with Lasagna Mia comping over Buy One Take One for the first four weeks. Additionally, we made some changes to our promotional messaging and we reduced marketing spending. As a result, we had to make up some ground from negative same-restaurant sales at the beginning of the quarter. Sales trends improved as we moved into Never Ending Pasta Bowl with more comparable marketing spend. The Olive Garden team continues to focus on operational execution, convenience and everyday value. Delivering exceptional guest experiences remain a key priority for the restaurant teams. Olive Garden also continued to meet their guest need for convenience as off-premise sales grew 17% during the quarter, driven by strong preference for the $5 take-home offer. For the quarter off-premise sales represented 17% of total sales. Digital sales grew approximately 33% and represented 38% of total to go sales. Finally, as we noted last quarter, Olive Garden introduced a new weekday lunch menu with 21 options under $10 to strengthen everyday value. This platform continues to perform well and has seen meaningful improvements in lunch sales trends. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with Olive Garden\u2019s performance. They have the right strategy in place, and I\u2019m confident that they will continue to make the appropriate investments and execute at a high level, which will enable them to continue to grow market share. LongHorn Steakhouse had an outstanding quarter. Total sales grew 8.4%, driven by 1.7% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 6.7%, the brand\u2019s 27th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. LongHorn outperformed the industry benchmark in same-restaurant sales and traffic by 640 basis points and 550 basis points, respectively. LongHorn\u2019s performance is a result of the adhering to their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement. Over the last four years, the team has made significant investments in the strategy and those investments continue to pay off. During the quarter, they introduced several enhancements to existing core menu items to further strengthen the quality of their food and beverage. And in order to tell their quality story more effectively, LongHorn team evolved their award-winning You Can\u2019t Fake Steak advertising campaign to better communicate their expertise and showcase their high quality stakes. The overall LongHorn experience is a key differentiator and their distinctive, relevant advertising continues to resonate with guests. LongHorn was designed as a very simple business and the operations team has done excellent job of finding opportunities to simplify to drive execution. During the quarter, they implemented a number of ideas that would result a direct feedback from restaurant teams. Additionally, our renewed focus on execution standards led to improved throughput during the busiest weekend hours this quarter. And finally, LongHorn continues to leverage the biggest competitive advantage, their unique culture. Manager retention reached another all-time high during the quarter and hourly retention rates remained at industry-leading levels. This high level of engagement is further evidenced by the fact that LongHorn\u2019s guest satisfaction rating for the quarter reached record levels across all key metrics. I\u2019m extremely proud of the discipline the LongHorn leadership team brings to the business and I\u2019m confident that adhering to their long-term strategy will continue to drive their momentum. Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen total sales increased 4.2%, driven by sales growth in new restaurants of 5.4% and partially offset by same-restaurant sales decline of 1.2%. We continue to see improvement in Cheddar\u2019s HR and operations metrics, which we know are foundational elements of running great restaurants. I\u2019m encouraged by these trends, knowing that the restaurants that have made these improvements are operating successfully. Overall staffing levels for manager and team members remain strong during the quarter and retention levels continue to move in the right direction. Hourly turnover improved by nearly 20 points compared to last year, and management turnover showed meaningful improvement as well. From an operations perspective, Cheddar\u2019s is a high-volume business that requires efficient throughput. One of the key operations metrics the team focused on during the quarter was speed of service, and they saw significant improvement versus last year. In fact, they saw strong improvement in the guest experience across all key metrics compared to last year. In addition to strengthening HR and operating fundamentals, the team also worked to improve the appeal of the amazing value Cheddar\u2019s offers. In October, they began providing every guest with their most craveable and highest rated menu item, their honey butter croissants. This is an element of guest service that we identified as an opportunity when we acquired the brand. Providing every guest with a warm honey butter croissant reinforces the wild value Cheddar\u2019s provides. After making the necessary operational adjustments to facilitate this new step of service and given the overall improvements the operations teams have made, this was the right time to roll it out. And the response from the guests and team members has been very positive. As I shared on the last call, this quarter, the Cheddar\u2019s team increased their working media spend and conducted numerous test and learns using a variety of marketing channels to drive awareness and trial. They are in the early stages of this learning and still have a lot of work to do. They will continue to invest the time, effort and resources in order to determine the most effective way to market the brand in the future. While I\u2019m encouraged by the results we\u2019re seeing, the work at Cheddar\u2019s is far from over. Team is working on the right priorities and I\u2019m confident they are moving in the right direction. And finally, the holidays is the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams, as they delight our guests and help create lasting quality memories. This time of the year is also a great reminder that being at service is at the heart of our business. We embrace a higher purpose of enhancing people\u2019s lives, which is why we serve with purpose to delight our guests, support our team members and make a better tomorrow. One of the ways we\u2019re working to make a better tomorrow is through our harvest program. One in eight households in our country live without consistent access to food. To help fight hunger, every one of our restaurants donates surplus food to local food banks and nonprofits in their communities on a weekly basis. More than 115 million pounds of food has been donated through this program. That\u2019s the equivalent of nearly 96 million meals. The impact of our harvest program takes on and added significance during the holidays, and I\u2019m so proud of the passion our team members have for it. On behalf of the management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 185,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guest and communities. I wish all of you a wonderful holiday season. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene. Good morning, everyone. We had another good quarter with second quarter total sales growth of 4.2%, driven by 2.2% growth from the addition of 37 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2%. As I mentioned in last quarter\u2019s call, same-restaurant sales benefited by about 80 basis points this quarter, driven by two factors. First, an increase of approximately 100 basis points due to Thanksgiving moving from the second quarter in fiscal 2019 into the third quarter in fiscal 2020. As a reminder, the third quarter should see a corresponding decrease to same-restaurant sales because of this shift. And second, approximately 20 basis points of headwind due to the impact of Hurricane Dorian early in the second quarter. Second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.12, an increase of 21.7% from last year\u2019s diluted net earnings per share. We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $136 million in shares, returning over $240 million to our shareholders this quarter. Additionally this quarter, we had $0.91 of adjustments to our reported diluted net earnings per share. This was primarily the result of a $147 million pretax charge related to the termination of our primary noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, most of which was non-cash. The termination of this plan and the anticipated expense was previously communicated in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K. Now turning to our detailed margin results. Food and beverage costs were 20 basis points favorable to last year, as pricing of just over 2% and continued cost savings initiatives offset commodity inflation of approximately 1.7% and continued investments. Second quarter restaurant labor was unfavorable 10 basis points to last year. Total labor inflation of 4% was offset by pricing, check mix and productivity improvements in new and existing restaurants. We continue to manage labor well in this environment, given the heightened inflationary pressures we still face. Marketing expense was 30 basis points unfavorable to last year. Approximately 40% of this was related to LongHorn marketing and timing shift from the first to the second quarter, and the remainder was driven by increased media spending in our other segments, primarily Cheddar\u2019s. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin of 16.5% was 20 basis points lower than last year. General and administrative expense was 40 basis points better than last year, as we wrapped on higher incentive expense and sales leverage. Our second quarter effective tax rate of 5.9% was favorably impacted by the resolution of prior year\u2019s tax projects that were contemplated in our earlier guidance. Excluding these projects, our effective tax rate would have been closer to 11% for the quarter. All of this culminated in adjusted earnings after tax margin of 6.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Turning to our segment performance, Olive Garden grew sales and profit in the quarter driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin increased by 20 basis points by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing costs effectively. LongHorn also grew sales and segment profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. However, segment profit margin decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to the marketing timing shift I mentioned earlier, which increased marketing as a percent of sales in the quarter for LongHorn. In addition, LongHorn continued to have slightly elevated beef inflation, while making continued investments during the quarter. Fine Dining segment grew sales and profit in the quarter as well, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased versus last year 10 basis points due to higher pre-opening expense and inefficiencies related to our four new restaurants opened year-to-date. Sales for our Other Business segment grew 3.5%, driven by net new restaurants. Both segment profit dollars and margin decreased this quarter due to incremental marketing expense, primarily at Cheddar\u2019s and margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales growth. As you saw in the press release this morning, we reiterated all aspects of our fiscal 2020 outlook. As we look forward to the second half of fiscal 2020, we feel confident in our ability to achieve same-restaurant sales between 1% to 2% for the year, resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share of between $6.30 and $6.45. Finally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we will modify the reporting of same-restaurant sales to align with our four reportable business segments : Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining, and Other Business. This change will better align the current reporting of segment profits with reportable segment sales growth metrics. Before I close, I\u2019d like to wish all of our 185,000 team members, and each of you a safe and happy holiday season. And with that, we\u2019ll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning, guy. My question is just on Olive Garden, the slowdown in comps in the quarter. It seems like you\u2019re saying this is mostly related to tough promotion, tough marketing comparisons early on in the quarter. Have you seen performance in the business improve enough to have the confidence to say that these issues are indeed transitory at Olive Garden and maybe even that they\u2019re behind you? Gene Lee : Well, I think we are pretty clear on how sales performed throughout the quarter? We definitely had a tough wrap. And I think that we signaled that at the end of the first quarter that Lasagna Mia wasn\u2019t performing as well as we had hoped. We pulled the promotional advertising for that promotion, and we focused on the introduction of $5 take-homes. I did say -- as I stated, as we introduced Never Ending Pasta Bowl and had comparable marketing trends, trends improved throughout the quarter. And I would say, it\u2019s -- how we feel about the business is really in how we think about our guidance for the year. We\u2019ve come back out and reconfirmed our guidance. And we feel as though that that business continues to perform well, continues to take market share in the industry, and we\u2019re comfortable with where we\u2019re at. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : I just wanted to ask sort of a bigger picture question about the brands. It sort of looks to me like your long LongHorn and Cheddar\u2019s -- you made investments behind marketing or value and you saw real improvement in the top-line. And I know you talked about the tough lapse from Olive Garden, but the fact that the margins were better sort of advances a different trade off. So, do you have an opportunity to push a little bit harder on value for Olive Garden, maybe to more level load it through the quarter? And when you think about how you value those trade-offs, so maybe lower margins but great comp set at LongHorn for example? How do you think about that trade-off generally and then perhaps with each of the brands? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes. That\u2019s a great question, Sara. We did know that LongHorn was performing really well throughout the quarter. And we made a decision not to push extra TRPs into Olive Garden to try to make up for the slow start we had in the quarter. We have levers to pull if we need to. We chose not to pull them and decided to let the quarter play out the way it did. And that\u2019s the beauty of the portfolio. We knew that we had really great strength in LongHorn and we didn\u2019t upped the marketing spend. We actually spent less money in advertising and marketing in the second quarter than we did the prior year. So, I think, that\u2019s -- we have to always pull back and say what\u2019s going on in the business. I do think as we do go forward, we will continue to look at how we use value in Olive Garden to drive same-restaurant sales, but also compete effectively against our competitors. And we\u2019ll have to continue to watch what our competitors are doing. And we\u2019ll have to match that intensity. Olive Garden is -- when you look at what Olive Garden\u2019s accomplished over the last four years, it\u2019s incredibly impressive. And we believe that it is positioned to continue to dominate in casual dining. And I believe we have more leverage than most to pull, to support that business. Operator : Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : If I could just follow-up on LongHorn. Maybe I missed just what the combination of things were that really drove that material acceleration. But can you just revisit that specifically? And it sounds like some incremental marketing or something changing the promotional environment and made some promotion with advertising environment. How sustainable is that or is that or is it you pull it forward such that you can\u2019t maybe replicate it in future quarters or is this a new run rate of advertising, promotional, so we should think about this as maybe you\u2019ve taken a permanent step up in that brand from a sales perspective? Gene Lee : John, we had two extra weeks of media in the quarter, you saw that in the restaurant level expenses. I wouldn\u2019t give that a lot of the credence for the increase in same-restaurant sales. I think, as I said, the LongHorn team has been investing in this business for four years. Every state today is bigger or better than it was four years ago. They\u2019ve invested in the bread service, they\u2019ve invested in many other aspects of the overall operation. But, I think the most unique thing about LongHorn in this environment is that it is a smaller box with less employees than the average casual dining restaurant. Their ability to attract a top-quality employee, train them well and retain them, I believe enables them to execute at a higher level. And if I was to point to one thing that is driving that business, it\u2019s that single attribute right there. To answer your question, is this a sustainable trend? I don\u2019t know. All I know is this team has made -- has had a great discipline for four years, made a lot of really good investments, and I believe that they continue to do the right things every single day for their team members and their guests. And again, it\u2019s a unique operation because it\u2019s much smaller inside of smaller box and they deliver at a high level. And it all came together this quarter combined with a couple of extra weeks of media and they had a great quarter. John Glass : Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And Rick, just on the commodity front, specifically beef, I know you talked about where inflation is, and you\u2019ve given this in your coverage through at least May and thinking about low single digits. But, is anything changed on the margin, are you incrementally more concerned about particular proteins as you think about calendar 2020 in total? And there has obviously been a lot of noise and incremental discussion in the marketplace around ASF and how that may impact the protein pricing. Rick Cardenas : Yes. John, we still feel comfortable of our guidance for total commodity inflation of 1% to 2%. We were a little higher -- at the higher end of that range of 1.7% this quarter. A couple of things on beef. We\u2019re really not seeing significant changes to what we thought would be in the beef market. The only thing we\u2019re seeing from ASF right now, as we said a couple of quarters ago, we only have about 2% of our pork -- of our buy as pork. But, there could be an impact, 18 months from now into overall proteins. We are seeing a little bit in ground beef right now but we\u2019re covered for the year on ground beef. So, we still feel really good about where we are. Chicken, we are starting to see a little bit of inflation, but we\u2019re again we\u2019re covered for that as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. I\u2019m wondering just related to sort of the strategy on advertising and media heading into the election year. Normally, we media costs increase. And just wondering, Gene, how the brands are planning to manage through that type of environment, and if you expect any differences there? Gene Lee : Yes. Great question, David. I think, we\u2019ll continue to focus on non-working media spend to see how much we can pull that down to help offset the inflation. But, we will try to spend from media standpoint at the same levels without increasing the overall spend for the brand. Now, I think,, as you know, as you get around the elections, especially when you\u2019re doing a lot of national stuff and some spot television, you can get bumped. And try and make sure that we get our full complement of advertising as we move into the last six months prior to election, depending on the marketplace will be a challenge. We\u2019ll try to work around that. We\u2019ve got other levers that we can pull, social, we got TDIs, we\u2019ve got some other things that we can do to help offset that if we\u2019re not getting our full complement of advertising. But, we\u2019ll continue to work and focus on making sure we\u2019re as lean as we possibly can be on our non-working, so that we can maybe shift a little bit more of that into working to offset the inflation. David Tarantino : Great. And then, Rick, just a quick one on the margins. I think, there has been several quarters in a row of productivity and mix cited as a pretty nice offset to the labor inflation you are seeing. I\u2019m just wondering what the sustainability of that looks like, and whether you\u2019re starting to lap that at any point in the next few quarters? Rick Cardenas : A couple of things. One, we\u2019ve said quite a few times that we don\u2019t expect to have labor below last year for quite a while as we keep inflation. And so, this quarter played out, we\u2019re about 10 basis points lower than last year in labor. The productivity, if you remember, a lot of that started with new restaurants last year around the third quarter and we started to see a little bit of an increase in productivity from new restaurants. That should start lapping itself. So, we still feel pretty good about managing our labor well the way -- based on inflation, what\u2019s going on now. And we\u2019ve all contemplated that in our guidance of 1% to 2% total inflation. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you. Rick Cardenas : I\u2019m sorry. 2.5% total inflation. David Tarantino : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeff Bernstein : Two questions as well. First one, Gene, you mentioned watching your competitors closely. I\u2019m just wondering in that vein, as you think about casual dining broadly, do you think maybe you\u2019re seeing an increased promotional activity and maybe that would change your marketing approach in the back half of your fiscal \u201820, whether it\u2019s in response to what competitors are doing or whether you feel the need to be a leader in terms of being more promotional or a change in your promotional cadence? Any thoughts on the industry broadly would be great. Gene Lee : Yes. I think, what we\u2019re seeing in the industry is that there is more pressure on some promotional constructs that have now become permanent parts of menus. You\u2019ve got a big competitor out there that\u2019s stated they\u2019re going to be continue to be very, very aggressive. But, I continue to look at -- when I look at Knapp and Black Box, I continue to look at the check average is growing north of 2.5%. So, the consumer is still paying 2.5% or plus more. So, I think that you\u2019ve got to -- we\u2019ve got to stay on top of what\u2019s happening in the industry. We need to make sure that we\u2019re offering value in our large brands across the platform. So, some value in price, some value in portion, as we try to attract and talk to each and all the different constituents that we have for consumers. I would say that Olive Garden is the value leader and that we need to stay focused on that in making sure that we have the appropriate price point for all the consumers that want to use Olive Garden. And I think that we have the ability to lead in that, not just follow. Jeff Bernstein : Got it. And my follow-up was just as we think about the fiscal \u201820 outlook. Rick, you mentioned guidance unchanged and that\u2019s now the first two quarters of this year. And it seems like it\u2019s contrary to past practice of thinking of Darden as guiding conservatively and more of not beating and raising. So, I\u2019m just wondering if maybe you enter this year guiding more aggressively for the year or maybe fundamentals have eased relative to your expectation a little bit. I\u2019m just wondering if maybe you\u2019re a little bit more cautious as we move through or into the back half of the fiscal year, what might have changed relative to historical practice of being able to beat the conservative start to the year guidance. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Jeff, every year at the beginning of the year when we guide, we guide what we think is appropriate and we adjust as things play out. And things have been playing out exactly as we thought, which is why we haven\u2019t changed our guide. In the past, things have been a little bit better than what we thought in the beginning of the year. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve adjusted up. But, I wouldn\u2019t say that we were more aggressive in this year\u2019s guide than we have in the past. We used the same philosophy that we always have. It just happens that the first quarter and the second quarter didn\u2019t outperform what we thought as much as it has in the prior year. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t raise our performance. And we still have, coming into the back half of this fiscal year, chances of weather, chances of election and everything else is going on in talking about consumers having other things to think about. So, again, we didn\u2019t change anything the way we\u2019ve done things in the past, and we feel pretty good about where our guide is right now. Jeff Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Carril from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Chris Carril : So, I\u2019m curious to hear your current thinking on the off-premise opportunity, and in particular how the performance of the $5 take-home offer and the sequential acceleration in off-premise growth may impact your thought process on off-premise strategy today? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes. I think that $5 take-home has been a great addition to the off-premise menu for Olive Garden. It\u2019s been well received from -- by consumers, will continue to evolve that platform over time. We think this continues to upside there. As we focus on off-premise, our biggest initiative is to improve the convenience for our consumer. We go back to -- we know the two most important things are on time and accurate. And as we continue to grow this business, we focus on those two things with the addition of ensuring that we have the right capabilities in each one of our restaurants. We\u2019re investing capital dollars into our restaurants to ensure that we have the space and the right equipment to handle the additional demand. And that\u2019s a big -- that will be a big effort over the next 12 to 18 months. And we think that we can take a little more friction out for the consumer. This is a very highly rated experience for our consumer, and we\u2019ll continue to focus on executing at a high level. As long as the consumer demand is still there, we think there is opportunity to grow this space. And I\u2019m really excited about what we\u2019re doing. But, more importantly what excites me about what we\u2019re doing from an off-premise standpoint is the quality of the experience and the quality of the product that\u2019s leaving our restaurant. And, I believe that\u2019s why our business continues to grow. Operator : Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Please go ahead. Will Slabaugh : I had a question on Cheddar\u2019s. I know you\u2019re not where you want to be quite yet, but it was a nice improvement from what we\u2019ve seen. And you mentioned some improved turnover in customer metrics that -- but there were something else. I was wondering if you might point to in the quarter that helped improve the two-year trend I think well over 400 basis points. I would love to hear your thoughts there. Gene Lee : Yes. Bottom line is that we\u2019re operating better. We\u2019ve got more stability. I\u2019m starting to see a culture develop inside of Cheddar\u2019s for the first time, one culture. Right? So, you go back to when we did the acquisition, we had these three distinct cultures. And for the first time, I\u2019m feeling like we\u2019re Cheddar\u2019s of one. And I\u2019ve said all along, this is not a brand issue, this is an operations issue. And I think our teams are making significant progress. And we\u2019ve got stability in a lot of places for the first time. And again, this is the beginning of a journey. But, you look at the power of LongHorn. We have the stability and what we\u2019re able to accomplish. Gaining 20 points a reduction in our employee turnover is huge. And I think we can do -- I think we can continue to do that again. And so, that\u2019s really what\u2019s got me excited. I think, we\u2019re just doing a better job. I had lunch in Cheddar\u2019s this week. It was fantastic. It was the best experience I\u2019ve ever had in the Cheddar\u2019s. And so, I mean, that\u2019s why I think we\u2019re starting to make improvement. It is still -- as I said, there is still pockets in the Company where we don\u2019t have that stability yet, we don\u2019t have that tenure, and we haven\u2019t developed that culture, but we\u2019re on a much better path. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Gregory Francfort : I just had two. The first one was on, Gene, I think you mentioned turnover at LongHorn. Can you maybe frame that up versus either the industry or versus maybe its historical levels? Is it down, is it just maybe up less than the industry? I guess, what was the commentary meant to suggest? And then, the other question I had was on off-premise. It\u2019s been I think a couple of years since, Gene, you\u2019ve given some thoughts on the competitive push into off-premise. And, I think, a few of your competitors have gone into third-party partnerships. They\u2019ve grabbed a few points of sales, but the profitably is becoming more of a focus. Can you maybe give where your updated thoughts are on third-party delivery, particularly small order? Thanks. Gene Lee : Sure. When I think of LongHorn, I would just say the management turnover is sub-15%, and it\u2019s less than 10% at the managing partner level, which is very, very important. And I think, compared to industry of mid-30s. I mean, we\u2019re -- that\u2019s just -- it\u2019s industry leading, it\u2019s leading inside of Darden. We have tremendous tenure there and most importantly, we have tremendous pride in that business. And so, that\u2019s a big thing. Employee turnover is in the low 60s. That\u2019s looking much more like one of our upscale businesses. And so, you can do so many different things. Think about the lack of training costs that we have in that business and the rest of our businesses, because we\u2019re so far below the industry, but especially that one there. And I think that really leads to great operations. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s been driving. On off-premise, our position hasn\u2019t changed on off-premise with the last mile delivery. We believe today -- we want to control the experience. We do have off-premise last mile delivery in Olive Garden. Again I\u2019ll remind everybody $75 -- above $75, and if you let us -- if you call it in before 5 o\u2019clock, the night before, we will deliver. That\u2019s a big business. It\u2019s a growing business for us. We\u2019ve got an average check in the 300s. That\u2019s business that\u2019s really worth chasing and doing. So, we\u2019re in it in our own way. But, as I think -- as we think about it as a team, we really like controlling that experience. And we get back to those two most -- those two critical aspects the consumer is looking for, on-time and accurate. And we control those when we control the overall experience. So, our position on the last mile delivery companies has not changed. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Gene, I just wanted to ask a bit more about Olive Garden looking ahead. Good to hear that the trend\u2019s accelerated through the quarter, but just wondering if you could talk a bit more about contributions from key drivers going forward to continue to support this outperformance. You talked quite a bit about off-premise. Is there anything more kind of on the strength of the operational execution, how impactful that can continue to be? The lunch gains you mentioned thinking ahead, promotional dry powder, maybe your thoughts on the innovation pipeline, and just kind of anything else to kind of continue to support the outperformance that you\u2019ve seen for quite some time now? Thanks. Gene Lee : I think, off-premise will continue to be a driver. I think, the $5 take-home platform will continue to be a strong driver. There\u2019s a lot of innovation that we can still do in that platform. I think that we\u2019ve got other platforms out there that will continue to strengthen whether it\u2019s Buy One Take One, Never Ending Pasta Bowl. I think that the promotional pipeline continues to be strong. And I think that I want to pivot back to -- I think, this is an important time that we focus on running great restaurant, and staffing is the most critical thing that we face today in this employment environment. And so, we need to make sure that our Olive Gardens remain staffed with great people. We need to continue to focus on improving our employment proposition. These are high-volume restaurants. And I think that we win if we have the best people inside the box. I\u2019m comfortable with our ability to create a strategy to continue the momentum, and I think there are drivers out there. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Levy from MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Brett Levy : Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First, I guess, can you share a little bit more on the granularity of the calendar shift? Was that 100 basis points largely split evenly or was that -- did you see any major shift among brands? And then, also, did you see anything within the regionality? And then, I know you don\u2019t like to give intra-quarter type updates and I know you talked about how you had a softer start to the quarter but strengthened throughout. Is it possible to quantify what the market share gains were versus on the GAAP later in the quarter versus earlier? And then, finally, is there anything that you saw fundamentally operationally at Olive Garden from a score relation, guest satisfaction, quantifying the turnover that can help substantiate and support just the dominant position that the brand is generally in? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Brett. It\u2019s Rick. In regards to the calendar shift -- lot of questions there, but, in regards to the calendar shift, they impacted -- it impacted brand differently. So, the casual brands were impacted favorably in general and the finer dining brands were impacted unfavorably in general, and each brand was impacted a little differently. Within the casual brands, Cheddar\u2019s having the smallest positive impact. The regionality of that really wasn\u2019t that different. So, it\u2019s basically -- Thanksgiving shift was no different in one region than another. The only regionality would be whether. And market share gap for the quarter by month, we don\u2019t really want to get into the change in share gap by months, other than what Gene said about Olive Garden being negative in the first month and having to dig out of that a little bit to get to be positive for the quarter. And then, on operating metrics for Olive Garden specifically, their operating metrics are at all time highs. So, there guest satisfaction, a lot of their different metrics operationally are all-time highs and they were at all-time highs for every month of the quarter. So, hopefully that answers those questions. But, thanks Brett. Brett Levy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good morning. There is a lot of discussion around value proposition in Olive Garden. I\u2019m wondering when you do see the value proposition and how you look at your lens, your perspective move one way or another in the dining rooms. Does that show up in a demographic shift? Does every demographic want or seek value in the same way, or do you see some more or less sensitive to value? Gene Lee : Well, I think that -- Nicole, it\u2019s an interesting question. I think that for some of our consumer -- because it\u2019s such a broad audience, some of our consumer values a lot more about what they pay from a dollar standpoint, and they are looking for that entry level price point. For some of our consumers, value is more about portion size compared to price. And so, we try to find value for everybody a little bit differently. And I think you have to -- a brand that has such broad appeal, you have to have value and everything as just which part is important, the numerator, the denominator. We know that there is a guest base inside of Olive Garden that play -- that price plays a very important part of their decision making. And we have to have an offer out there a lot of the time, so that they will come to us. If they don\u2019t have an offer, they will go someplace else. We know that through our token analysis. But, we also know that there are folks out there that look at value on say chicken Alfredo. When we increased the size of the portion of chicken, the value scores went way up, and that was very important to them. But, that\u2019s on an entry level price point in Olive Garden. And so, we\u2019ve got to think across a broad spectrum and define value different for each opportunity. But, we have to have something for that consumer that is very deal oriented. And we know we have to have that out -- have to have something out there most of the time. Nicole Miller : That\u2019s very helpful. And I was thinking about it in that kind of bigger, better, looking forward context of how do millennials seek value. So, I think, if you could remind us the prime casual diner Olive Garden years around the 30 years old age and the millennial population is getting ready to peak in size of being in that age as a demographic cohort. Is it too early for Olive Garden to be thinking about how to benefit from that or will they just actually naturally benefit from that change? Gene Lee : Yes. I mean, the prim demographic is 35 to 55 for Olive Garden. And we\u2019ve talked about the fact that population for the prime dining out years is going to start to grow and continue to grow for a while. I would say, when we think about millennials, I think the one thing that millennials of all socioeconomic background like to do is have a lot of choice. They like to build their own meal. That\u2019s why Cucina Mia has worked so well for that cohort. But, I would tell you that millennials that have lower incomes are looking for value, just the way other groups look for value at that point in time. And I think, we have to be careful with gross generalizations of this cohort as they transition into the next phase of their life. We over-index with millennials. This is a very millennial friendly brand. It is a very social brand. And I would tell you that millennials love the value of Olive Garden because they can stretch their dollars. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Dan on for Andrew today. We saw sort of mixed performance across some of the polished casual where trends have been a bit more challenged recently. You talked about some of the incremental marketing spend at Cheddar\u2019s and LongHorn, but I know last quarter you also spoke about potentially adding some marketing spend around some of those smaller portfolio brands as well. So, did you end up doing that? And if you did, can you just kind of give us an update on how those initiatives are performing and how you think it will work, given the lack of national scale? Gene Lee : Yes. I think, the brand that we made the most progress in was a Yard House. And the Yard House was positive before the Thanksgiving shift. So, we are very pleased to see that. And so, we\u2019ll continue to find ways to try to use digital to promote these brands. We\u2019re doing a lot of test and learn in those brands also to try to be effective. We\u2019re trying to make -- we\u2019re making progress in all of those brands. I would say that Seasons, as Rick alluded to, Seasons was the most impacted by the holiday switch. I think, we\u2019re making progress in that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris O\u2019Cull: Gene, I know the Company had indicated Cheddar\u2019s would be testing some of these various marketing initiatives. But, did these tests have a material impact on the comp performance during the quarter? And, when do you think we could see some of these tests being implemented more broadly? Gene Lee : I think they had -- I don\u2019t know if they had a meaningful impact. I mean, they had some sort of impact on the quarter. I would tell you that this -- we\u2019re testing some of this activity on a very small scale, trying to get an understanding of what can move the needle. I would say that this is an evolution. I think that we need to continue to use a new store development backfill strategy, so that we can become more efficient in some more markets to really make some of this stuff pay out a little bit more positively. So, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t give you a time to say, hey, this is when we think we\u2019re going to have this all figured out. I would also add that in the digital world today, it is very, very dynamic. And I think test and learn and digital is going to be something that companies are going to be doing forever, because there continues to be new avenues and new channels in which you can get to your consumer, and that audience is very fickle today compared to what it used to be with spot TV. So, I think test and learn is going to be part of our vernacular for a long time. Chris O\u2019Cull: And then, I know you mentioned Olive Garden\u2019s comps improved during the quarter, but I\u2019m curious whether the check benefit from the $5 take-home was somewhat negated by the Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion? Rick Cardenas : Chris, this is Rick. The check benefit from the $5 take-home was not negated by the NEPB, Never Ending Pasta Bowl. It was really the lunch investment that we made earlier in the fiscal year that drove our check down. If you think about Olive Garden check, Olive Garden\u2019s check grew by 2.7% for the quarter. 2% of that was pricing, about 80 basis points was catering, and everything else washed. So, if you think about the 80 basis points of catering, you can think about that, like guest counts, since we don\u2019t talk about -- we don\u2019t give them credit for guests. But, to answer your question, no, $5 take-home was not offset by NEPB. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : I just wanted to come back to the conversation I think we had several quarters ago on loyalty. I think, you guys had loyalty test in place for over a year in maybe about 10% of your stores. Where do you guys stand on the loyalty test? Is that something you plan to forward with or just an update on loyalty would be great. Gene Lee : We\u2019re still testing. There\u2019s really no further update. We continue to analyze the results. But, at this point in time, we\u2019re just in the same 10%, and we\u2019ll continue to watch how that\u2019s maturing. Peter Saleh : Is there anything you\u2019re looking for in particular before you decide whether to just scrap it all together or move forward? Gene Lee : I think that we want to continue to see if there is something there. I mean, we\u2019re trying to value the first party -- what\u2019s the first party data worth to us and how much can we move sales with the loyalty program. We\u2019re trying to get that read. And again these are -- this is a very, very, very big decision and one that\u2019s very difficult to undo. And so, we have to have a high confidence level that this is the correct path to go down. And at this point we\u2019re not at that level yet. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Jeff Farmer : On the June earnings call, I believe you commented that your concepts were seeing some, I think you described it as day-to-day and week-to-week sales volatility. I\u2019m just curious if that volatility has continued. And if it has, what that might signal about the consumer and their demand for casual dining more broadly? Gene Lee : Yes. I mean, I think it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve had some huge calendar swings. So, I think the volatility on a comparative basis is still there. I think the environment is a little bit better than it has been in a while. I think that employment is still strong, confidence is rebounding. I think, the near-term risk of a recession has receded. So, I feel pretty good about the overall environment right now. And I don\u2019t think that us as a team, we get too worried about day-to-day, week-to-week and volatility. I mean, it\u2019s still there. There\u2019s volatility around what your competitors are doing and what we\u2019re doing. And we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re cognizant of trying to match promotional weeks, but we\u2019ve had much -- we\u2019ve been much more willing to make longer term decisions and let there be a little bit of volatility week-to-week with our marketing activities. So, it\u2019s made -- something that makes a little harder to read in the short-term. In the long-term, it all works out. Jeff Farmer : And then, just as a follow-up to that in terms of some of the volatility that you\u2019ve seen with the consumer demand side, despite incredibly strong consumer metrics that sort of break down in that very strong relationship historically, meaning if you saw a good consumer trends, good consumer health metrics, you typically saw a pretty nice casual dining same-store sales. You guys pointed out that that had softened up a little bit. Any further comment on that? Gene Lee : I think it\u2019s -- might I have a real brief comment on that. This marketplace is going to be defined by winners and losers. If you have a strong value proposition and you\u2019re executing at a high level, and that execution is going to be driven by your employment proposition. In this environment attracting, retaining great employees has never been more difficult. And those that can do that with a strong value proposition are going to win. Operator : Our next question comes from Katherine Fogertey from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Katherine Fogertey : Great. Thank you. I wanted to touch a little bit on the off-premise at Olive Garden. You talked about overall sales starting the quarter pretty soft and then improving. Did you see similar trends in off-premise, especially kind of when you take away the $5 take-home side of the business and kind of focus on the traffic that you\u2019re seeing from people placing orders 5 :00 pm, ahead of time, $75 and higher threshold. Did you see softness there in the beginning of the quarter and that improve or was that business behaving differently? Gene Lee : Again, a little too granular there, all I would say is that our delivery program continues to grow at a good pace. And when we\u2019re doing Never Ending Pasta Bowl, that\u2019s not a great time, I mean it\u2019s not one of our best periods for off-premise comp. It\u2019s just not a promotional item that lends itself to that. But overall, I would just say that, $5 take-home was a big piece of what we have for a new offering. It got people excited. But, our overall off-premise business continues to grow with consumer demand. And I\u2019m not going to get into a much more detail than that. Katherine Fogertey : Okay. Thank you. And then, you gave some good color around the 100 basis-point benefit from the Thanksgiving shift by some brands. But curious if you would help us understand a little bit more, was it Olive Garden that benefited more than LongHorn or was that benefit kind of equally split? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Katy. This is Rick. The Olive Garden, LongHorn were pretty similar in benefit for the Thanksgiving shift. Katherine Fogertey : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : I heard your comments that you made on obviously some of the upscale brands actually being hurt by Thanksgiving. But, could you talk about, are there any other common themes in upscale that are kind of noteworthy at this point? And I guess, Gene, would you expect the upscale brands to actually be performing better today for where we are in the economic cycle and where we are in the stock market, for example? And is there anything Darden can do, self help to improve those? Gene Lee : Yes. I mean, Thanksgiving has turned into one of the biggest days in upscale, and they didn\u2019t have that in the second quarter. So, I think that -- I think these upscale brands are performing really well. I mean, we have two of the best upscale brands out there today, very high volume with Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s, and they continue to perform at high level. So, I\u2019m excited about what they have going forward. As I\u2019ve said before, I think their books look good through the holidays. These are exciting businesses and I\u2019m very pleased with their overall performance. John Ivankoe : And I may have missed the number. How big the calendar shift actually was there in the second quarter? And could you also comment on some of the brands between Olive Garden and LongHorn and the two Fine Dining brands? Rick Cardenas : Hey, John. It\u2019s Rick. The calendar shift for Darden was 100 basis points favorable. As I said on the call, the casual brands were benefited by that and the upscale Fine Dining brands were hurt. And the upscale Fine Dining brands were hurt more than the casual dining brands were helped, but the casual dining brands are bigger. That\u2019s why we\u2019re at about 100 basis points. John Ivankoe : Okay. All right, understood. Thank you for that. And then, the brands in the middle? Rick Cardenas : There weren\u2019t really many brands in the middle. We\u2019ve pretty much had casual. I also mentioned that Cheddar\u2019s was the least benefited of the casual brands. And again, everything that\u2019s Fine Dining that takes reservations was hurt. John Ivankoe : Okay. Thank you for that. But also, like when we talk about Yard House, for example, we talked about Bahama Breeze, even Seasons 52, I mean, again, these are higher ticket brands than Olive Garden and LongHorn. One might -- you actually expect that the consumer would trade up to those brands in the current economic environment, current stock market. Is there anything as you kind of look at what Darden can do on the self-help basis to kind of improve those businesses? Is there anything that we should be considering? Obviously, the brand in itself is that big but together, certainly they are. Gene Lee : Yes. John, I think that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. I think that these brands are in some of the best retail trade areas in the United States. They continue to face competitive intrusion. And you have to fight that competitive intrusion off. They are small enough for a one or two restaurants being down a significant number. It can have an impact on the overall business. As I said, I\u2019m pleased with the trends in Yard House. Seasons, we\u2019re making progress in Seasons. We\u2019ve been able to pull out of a lot of the discounting that was happening in that business, which we believe was a good long-term decision that\u2019s put -- that\u2019s had an impact on the headline number. Bahama Breeze, we\u2019ve had some competitive intrusion. We\u2019ve also cannibalized ourselves in our biggest market Orlando, opening up a couple of restaurants that have had an impact on the overall system. And we know this market well. Those are places where we want to have restaurants. But, right now, there has been some cannibalization. I don\u2019t really pay a whole lot of attention to some of those top line numbers. I pay a lot of attention to the individual restaurants in each group and I understand how they\u2019re performing. These are well-positioned brands that continue to perform well. But, they are in the best trade areas in America and they\u2019re facing competition. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Matt DiFrisco : Thank you. Just a little bit of a different track here. I guess, on growth, a lot of people always look at sort of the smaller brands, Cheddar\u2019s and others to be the growth vehicle, but LongHorn\u2019s one that really -- you\u2019ve done a tremendous turnaround on the margin side. ROE positioned for a little bit better growth ahead. I think, you\u2019re maybe eight net stores you\u2019ve added over the last 12 months, seems a little low. You\u2019re only in about 13 or 14 states. So, there\u2019s certainly a lot more room for growth. I\u2019m just curious, what has been the governor to that. Why can\u2019t that brand go back to its growth year days and could that be on the cusp ahead? Gene Lee : Well, I think that there is a growth opportunity with LongHorn. I mean, we\u2019re concentrating on entering new territory slowly and we\u2019re focused on trying to backfill where we have opportunities. We think the governor to growth is the human capital. This is a brand that is very important how we develop our culture and how we run it. But, we are on a path to do 15 to 20 this year, which is a pretty good number. We haven\u2019t opened up any LongHorns in California. That\u2019s really the last big territory available to us. We are going to open up a restaurant this spring in California to see how the brand is received. We\u2019ll open a few more and will support that. But, we\u2019re very-pleased with this. And I love the controlled growth, because to me that\u2019s where -- we\u2019re in 43 states. So, I don\u2019t know where you got your number from\u2026 Matt DiFrisco : I\u2019m sorry... Gene Lee : LongHorn is in 43 states today, over 500 units, closing on $2 billion brand. We\u2019re going to continue to grow this. This brand has growth opportunity. We\u2019re going to grow it responsibly. Matt DiFrisco : Sorry about that. I was saying you have an average of 13 in a state. That\u2019s what I was saying. Just also I guess, we\u2019ve been checking a lot. And a lot of these smaller brands have been closing down. Is there that opportunity when you look at where you would grow LongHorn? Does it have to be necessarily a new site or are there opportunities, maybe more in this economic cycle where you could sort of take over an existing restaurant that just won\u2019t belly up and it\u2019s sitting next to a couple of Olive Gardens or in a market with a couple of Olive Gardens where you can get some synergies? Gene Lee : We look at every real estate opportunities, what is the best way? If the building has a good enough structure, we will do a rehab. We\u2019ve done a few of those. If we don\u2019t believe the building has the structure to really be a good place for a LongHorn over 30 years, then we\u2019ll blow it -- we\u2019ll tear it down. But, each individual site is evaluated through an economic lens and say, which is the best economic outcome for the investment. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Anderson from Maxim Group. Please go ahead. Stephen Anderson : I wanted to follow up with you on the off-premise opportunity and specifically at Cheddar\u2019s seeing that you\u2019ve built out a good infrastructure over at Olive Garden and at LongHorn, just wanted to see what your thoughts are. As soon as you build out your marketing capabilities at Cheddar\u2019s, what role off-premise will play and online mobile ordering will play there? Gene Lee : Yes. Stephen, good question. We have not had any emphasis on improving our off-premise sales in Cheddar\u2019s. We believe this to be a big opportunity, and it\u2019s an opportunity that we will tackle over the next 6 to 18 months. We need to go back and we need to develop good processes, understand what the -- develop good capabilities, implement online ordering, which is not accessible today, all those things are growth opportunity. And it all will be sequenced in when we believe we have the right operational capabilities to handle it. But you have identified a future growth vehicle for Cheddar\u2019s. Operator : Our next question comes from Jake Bartlett from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Gene, it was the second quarter of last year that you talked about more explicitly about pulling back on incentives that the consumer was strong enough. You wanted to kind of have that in your pocket if the economy got worse. Where do you stand on incentives? Have you kicked that up since the second quarter of last year? How do you think your approach on incentives for consumers is going to be going forward this year? Gene Lee : Yes. I believe that you\u2019ll see us use that lever appropriately. We have been in the marketplace testing some new offers with some relatively short expiration time to see how they -- how the consumer reacts to them. It is just one piece of our overall tool kit to drive the business. Now we -- again, we have identified as we pulled out and slowed down our TDIs over last year, there is a consumer out there that will only visit our restaurants when we have an incentive out there. So, we need -- we\u2019ve learned that we need to have something out there for this consumer. And we\u2019ll continue to -- we talk about one of our focuses, when we talk about back to basics is our integrated marketing approach. And this is part of our integrated marketing approach is how do we use TDIs, how do we use other discounts or incentives and combined with what we\u2019re doing on a promotional level too. We always think about those in unison. So, it is not a lever that we can pull. I will say for those that do look at our frequency, I would urge you not to look at that in isolation, because there are other parts of our media spend that have a lot more impact than our TDI spend, primarily how many total rating points we have in the marketplace. Jake Bartlett : Great. And then, second question is on acquisitions. And one is, just if you could talk about your appetite for kind of continuing acquisitions? It\u2019s been I guess almost two years since acquiring Cheddar\u2019s, but also the environment, whether you\u2019re seeing some smaller chains kind of under more pressure, given the kind of scale benefits with technology and with some inflation that\u2019s going on. So, one, your appetite and the second kind of the environment for acquisitions out there that you\u2019re seeing. Gene Lee : Yes. I\u2019m going to probably dodge that a little bit and give you the standard answer that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate our current portfolio and evaluate the opportunities to add to the portfolio. As you know we\u2019re -- we continue to look at the opportunities out there, we continue to look at the opportunities internally, and we\u2019ll continue to have those discussions with our management team and our Board. And while we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on running the great brands that we have. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Thanks and happy holidays. Just a quick one for me. So, based on work, it looks like your off-premise business in Olive Garden was greater than 100% of the comp growth in the period. And I believe that off-premise offers, like catering and $5 take-homes only show up in the mix and not traffic. And I think Rick, you hit on it earlier that lunch might have drove down mix a little bit in the period. But, I am curious if you could expand upon the thought that -- maybe these to-go businesses are cannibalizing potential future visits, or maybe you can give us some comfort that it isn\u2019t happening in the market. Rick Cardenas : Yes. I don\u2019t think -- we don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re cannibalizing future visits. I mean, obviously, I think the people make a choice, am I going to eat in or you out tonight, and we want to be in both those decision sets. I go back inside the quarter and say we started off, we had a great promotion last year with Buy One Take One and we had a promotion that was weaker. I think, it\u2019s important that -- we\u2019re sitting here today admitting that we didn\u2019t hit the mark on Lasagna Mia and we pulled off the promotional advertising to support that. Not everything that we\u2019re going to do is going to work, but you got to -- we recognize that this wasn\u2019t -- something wasn\u2019t right with it and we didn\u2019t put the promotional dollars behind it, and we pivoted. And I think that that put us in a hole in the quarter, and we decided to let it play out. And that\u2019s primarily because we had LongHorn doing well. So, I don\u2019t -- I think that -- I look at it is all one big pool. And we\u2019ve been saying it for you, we\u2019re going to try to feed people Olive Garden where and when they want it. And I think that we\u2019re doing a great job with that. And I\u2019m excited about what we\u2019ve done at launch. We\u2019ve definitely improved that trend. We\u2019re competing more effectively. And I believe into the future, we\u2019ll have to make strategic adjustments to compete more effectively at dinner too. You\u2019re constantly evolving in this business, you\u2019re not staying still. And so, I\u2019m confident in our team, I\u2019m confident in our insights, and all I want to do is sell Olive Garden food to some \u2013 anybody that wants and anywhere they want it. Jon Tower : And then, just following up on the promotional miss hit or hit and miss in this quarter. Was there anything different about the testing process on this promotion relative to past testing that might have altered the go-to-market or seen -- or what really played out in the market versus what you guys were seeing in test? Gene Lee : No. I think that anytime you -- testing environment is small and it\u2019s always different than a macro test. So, we\u2019re not sure what else was going on. We made the decision. I think in hindsight we may have made that decision too quickly and didn\u2019t give a chance to play out. But, we did what we thought was right -- right, wrong or indifferent. We made a pivot, and it\u2019s behind us and now we\u2019re moving on. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks. Hey. Good morning. Just two quick ones for me. Could we circle back on the Olive Garden incentives in the quarter? And if you look across all marketing channels, how do the mix of value and incentives compare year-on-year? Rick Cardenas : We were definitely out there with a lot more incentives, and that was part of we need to be out there because we pulled back on the advertising spend. So, it\u2019s just -- again, it\u2019s a small channel in which we play in, but we definitely increased and we also were out there doing a ton of testing. So, test and learn just doesn\u2019t apply to our smaller brands. It was test and learn inside of Olive Garden, probably the most test, trying to understand which TDIs would resonate with consumers, how long of time that they need to put on those to activate the consumer. So, we were definitely in the marketplace and it\u2019s a great way for us to talk to our E-club members. So, again, I just think it\u2019s a risk for you to look at all of that in isolation because the media spend was down significantly and we were testing and learning in this channel. Brian Vaccaro : And shifting gears to LongHorn. Obviously, a pretty sharp sequential acceleration that you saw, and I know you talked about a few different factors. But, could you possibly rank order to the factors that drove that acceleration in your view? And then, maybe just a little more color on how you drove that improved throughput during the busiest weekend hours that you referenced? Thank you. Gene Lee : I\u2019ll answer them backwards. I think it\u2019s just focus. I think, we\u2019re focusing on those busiest hours, we\u2019re asking for our top management person in the restaurant to be at the front door to help with that process. It\u2019s like anything else in our business. When we focus on something, we get it. And management team, they\u2019ve done a great job of focusing on that. I think, the beauty of the LongHorn quarter is I can\u2019t point -- I\u2019m not going to point to anything in specific. I believe this is a quarter where four years of investment, a couple of extra weeks of really, really good advertising that\u2019s resonated with the consumer, great stability in the leadership roles in the restaurants, all came together and we had a great quarter. Anybody that tries to isolate and to point to one thing other than a one-time promotion, I believe it\u2019s very hard -- very difficult to do. And I just think everything came together for LongHorn, great quarter, great job to the team. Anybody that\u2019s out there listening, you guys did a great job. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back to Kevin Kalicak for closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Thanks, Carol. That concludes our call for today. I\u2019d like to remind you that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday, March 19th, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today\u2019s call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Darden Fiscal Year 2020 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Please go ahead. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation will include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2020 fourth quarter earnings on June 25 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. Given the circumstances, we will only briefly discuss third quarter results and will spend majority of the time discussing the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, I want to remind everyone about the calendar shift that moved Thanksgiving from the second quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year, resulting in one fewer operating day for our casual dining brands during the third quarter. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I want to acknowledge that we\u2019re clearly in a time of uncertainty as it relates to COVID-19. I know you have a lot of questions relating to the future, and we will try to answer them the best we can. First, I want to say thank you to our teams who are doing a great job managing through this adversity. Additionally, I want to thank them for the outstanding job they did in the third quarter, our results were impressive. As you see from our press release this morning, total sales from continuing operations were $2.35 billion, an increase of 4.5%. Same-restaurant sales increased 2.3% and adjusted net earnings per share were $1.90. However, today we're clearly faced with more pressing matters to discuss, given the rapidly changing environment and ongoing impact associated with COVID-19. To that end, I want to share with you what the Darden team is doing as it relates to the virus and the impact to our operations. Rick will share some of our quarter-to-date results and analysis on potential financial impacts. Turning to our ongoing response. We've established a cross-functional crisis team led by me, and we're in close contact with the CDC and other government agencies to ensure we have the most up to date information to inform the decisions we are making. We have developed an action plan addressing business continuity, operations, communication and supply chain. Our plan is updated as we receive and process new information. The health and safety of our team members, their families and our guests remain our -- remains our top priority, and we continue to take steps to ensure the safety of our hourly team members and restaurant management teams. Yesterday, we announced that we're implementing an emergency pay program that will cover hourly team members for two weeks in restaurants facing a business disruption. This is in addition to the permanent paid sick leave policy we announced last week. At this point, we don't see any major impacts to our supply chain. We have been in discussion with all of our major suppliers and they are confident that they can continue to supply our restaurants with safe, consistent goods to maintain service to our guests. Our restaurant teams are well-trained in food safety, sanitation and managing through viruses. We are regularly cleaning our restaurants with products that are on the CDC list of approved cleaning agents for COVID-19. We are confident that we'll be able to maintain a steady flow of these products into our restaurants. We are committed to keeping our restaurants open where permissible to be able to provide meals to the community in which we operate, whether that be off-premise or dine-in where permitted. And I'll reiterate that we are committed to the health and safety of our team members and guests by offering limited or no contact, curbside pickup and practicing social distancing in our seating configurations in all locations where we are permitted to operate our dining rooms. While we have a strong balance sheet and a strong cash position, given the material declines we're seeing in our business, we'll have to make dramatic change to our cost structure and cut non-essential spending. I'd like to emphasize that this is a rapidly changing environment, and as such, we are not able to reasonably estimate the impact to our business. The analysis that Rick will be providing are theoretical in nature and won't be able to predict the duration or scope of the impact at this time. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying that we actually had a pretty strong third quarter with same-restaurant sales of 2.3% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90. But obviously that is behind us and we're now focused on dealing with the unfolding situation. Instead of going through the detailed financial results for this quarter in my prepared remarks, we have most of our usual financial discussion slides in the additional information section of our presentation. Turning to our results so far in the fourth quarter, the shift in business momentum has been swift after announcements from state and local governments limiting restaurant operations. For context, Darden's same-restaurant sales were positive 3% in the first week, the second week was basically flat and the third week was down almost 21%. Same-restaurant sales for our third fiscal week ending March 15 by segment where Olive Garden was down 18.7%; LongHorn down 15.9%; Fine Dining, down 27.7% and other business down 27.5%. Our presentation has trends by week for our segments. Turning to our current week sales, through yesterday, same-restaurant sales are down roughly 60%. As of 4 :00 pm yesterday, 60% of our restaurants are mandated ToGo only, 16% have mandated other capacity constraints and the remaining 24% have no mandates. But we are choosing to operate them at reduced capacity of approximately 50%, while practicing social distancing recommended by health officials. To that end, we've made the following decisions in conjunction with our Board. First, we have announced that the Board has suspended our quarterly dividend payment. The Board intends to review our quarterly dividend policy as developments warrant. Second, out of an abundance of caution, we are fully drawing down our $750 million credit facility to further shore up our cash balance, resulting in approximately $1 billion on our balance sheet. Third, we are limiting cash outflows by more aggressively managing costs and significantly reducing CapEx. Finally, given the level of volatility and uncertainty surrounding the future impact of COVID-19 on the broader U.S. economy and any specific impact to our company, we have withdrawn our previous fiscal 2020 guidance issued December 19, 2019. In the absence of specific guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we want to provide EPS sensitivity for the quarter. Assuming most restaurants have partial operations such as ToGo only, you can assume that for each percentage point decline in sales for the fourth quarter, which is 14 weeks, diluted earnings per share will decline approximately $0.06 to $0.08. During these uncertain times, it's important to understand the strength of our balance sheet and history of our cash flows. To that end, when looking at our historical operating cash flows, we've been able to generate enough cash to more than fund all of our needs. And while I can't predict the level or length of any reductions to our sales, assuming a sales decline of 50% for the entire fourth quarter would result in negative operating cash flow of approximately $300 million for the quarter, including change in net [technical difficulty]. As I mentioned earlier, we have approximately $1 billion in available cash. Given that, I believe we'll be able to weather this disruption to our business. And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. As the country's largest casual dining company, it certainly makes sense that you'd be having discussions with the government right now. It's also my understanding that the industry, in particularly the casual dining segment has been the united front and asking for some sort of a direct relief plan. Could you talk about some ideas that are realistically being considered, even if you're not counting on them for Darden survival? Thank you. Gene Lee : Good morning, David. Yes, we -- and I have been in contact with the administration and members of Congress to help them understand the unique challenge that we face in the full service sector. The priority of those discussions have been on developing a plan to be able to continue to keep our team members on our payroll, trying to develop a plan which would use government money to pay them and not have to separate with our 190,000 team members. That's been the focus of our discussions at this point. David Palmer : And is there a mechanism that they have decided on or even thought about to get that done? Gene Lee : No, I believe that -- I mean, at this point in time, we're early in the discussion and there's just a lot happening in D.C. But they are well aware of the situation that full service casual dining company owned companies are really facing, it's a company - different than franchise. David Palmer : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Jeff Farmer : Thank you. You did touch on it, but what is your monthly cash burn rate in the scenario as you outlined where the restaurant dining rooms are closed and you're only able to serve off-premise? And as a follow-up to that, I'm just curious if you think you can keep that off-premise number at Olive Garden, anywhere close to that, I think it's $14,000 to $15,000 per week in a normalized environment? Gene Lee : Hey, Jeff. On a takeout only scenario, we would expect the variable margin to be positive. And so that's very important for us is to make sure that we have positive variable margin on takeout. But our total EBIDTA will be negative. We do believe that we can build and we're seeing build in ToGo sales at Olive Garden and at LongHorn Steakhouse, significant growth in ToGo during this time period. I will say on a fully closed scenario, which is what we talked about a little bit ago, a fully closed scenario, a run rate, cash burn rate is about $40 million to $50 million. But we think a full close is unlikely, closing everything, including ToGo. Any variable margin -- sorry, one more thing, any variable margin we get from the takeout really helps offset that fully closed cash burn rate. Jeff Farmer : That's helpful. But that $40 million to $50 million that time period is over a month. Is that correct, or in a quarter? Gene Lee : Yes, $40 million to $50 million a week \u2026 Jeff Farmer : Okay. Gene Lee : \u2026 assuming we're fully closed. Now, we can probably take that cash burn rate down below $40 million. But that's just a range that we have and that's assuming we're fully closed again. Jeff Farmer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Katherine Fogertey : Great. Thank you. Can you give us a little bit of color about how many people you would need in the restaurants if you're running ToGo only. And then, you kind of alluded to you\u2019re seeing a big boost on that Olive Garden and LongHorn around ToGo. Could you give some more granular numbers about how that comp trend has moved in the three weeks like you split out the overall side? And then just finally, I know that you guys have not partnered with third-party delivery before, but just wondering given this very unique set of circumstances here, does it make sense to maybe look at even a short-term solution on that front to help get food to customers? Thank you. Gene Lee : It's taken us on average 6 to 10 team members ToGo only restaurants to operate. I would suspect -- I think it's been all over the place and every day is changing dramatically. But I think when I looked at it yesterday, our off-premise business was growing about 20% versus last year. So it's picking up as people change their behaviors. As far as third-party goes, I would say that everything is on the table. However, what we're focused on right now is ramping up and using our team members to be able to keep them on our payroll and develop our own delivery capabilities, which our teams are ramping very, very quickly. Katherine Fogertey : So I understand you guys are looking at doing your own fulfilled delivery in certain markets? Gene Lee : We're doing it now. Katherine Fogertey : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good morning. How was the conversation with your lender, if you don't mind sharing, please? And then what is the intent, in your opinion, please, for lenders to deal with restaurants at any level? In the past, I would understand that they would let the ability to draw down on a revolver. And also -- and then covenants as needed. It's going to be important again, maybe not for Darden because you've already had the conversation, but for many, many of your peers going forward. If you could talk us through that, we'd really appreciate it. Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes, Nicole, we've had some really good conversations with our banks. We've got long standing relationships with them. They were with us during the crisis in 2008. And so we just as we said, as an additive of an abundance of caution, we drew down our revolver. They said they'd be there if we needed them before we did that. But we decided to do that just to get in front of anybody else that might want to. In the terms of our covenants, we haven't gotten to a point where we're breaking our covenants. And so we haven't had those discussions. And even with our stock price today, we'd still be within our covenant. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Brett Levy : Great. Thank you and thanks for having the call this morning. If you could talk a little bit about what would it be your conversations within -- with landlords, now that you're not the sole owner of your properties and you talked about labor over the first two weeks. How were you thinking about it over the more intermediate period of time, the following two weeks, the following two months? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes. Brett, we've had no conversations with our landlords at this point in time. We have stopped all construction of all new restaurants, and we're negotiating with those landlords to push off the commencement of rent. As far as labor goes, we've -- again, we've implemented our emergency pay policy for those that are being impacted from disruption standpoint. What we do into the future will really depend on what kind of relief we may get from the administration to help pay our people. But that's yet to be determined and we continue to have conversations. I'll have conversations with the leaders in Washington as soon as I get off this call. So I really can't give a whole lot of guidance to that. Brett Levy : No that makes sense. And just on the store capacity, what is your anticipation? What are you hearing from other jurisdictions that are currently either fully open or at half capacity? Do you have any sense on how we should think about the next two weeks in terms of just ongoing capacity within units that I\u2019ll [indiscernible]? Gene Lee : Brett, the dynamic of this crisis is changing hourly. So I don't want to try to predict what is going to happen. All I can do is that we\u2019re going to react, I am in contact with the governors of the largest states to talk to them about how we believe that our environments, if we practice good social distancing, are some of the safest places to be. And we'll continue to have those conversations. But we are not in control of that. We will react to what the local government wants to do and we'll do the best job that we can. But I have no way of predicting what's going to happen. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara Senatore : Hi. Thank you. I have a question. If you could give me a little bit more insight into some of the consumer behaviors you're seeing with respect to, whether it's geographic dispersion or something else. Obviously, the whole country is watching this -- it's really a humanitarian cost. But to some extent, are you seeing different behaviors away from kind of the epicenters of the disease in the country on the coast, for example, it looks like some of the data we see suggests that, where your restaurants are in terms of population density or what parts of the regions of the country may make a difference. I ask only because as we try to think about how behaviors might change of this spread, I'm just trying to get a sense of, do you see differences in different parts of the country, depending on how -- what the immediate impact is, or is it more just everybody is kind of responding to the news that they're seeing. And it's really not distinct anyway. So any kind of nuance you can share as we try to think there how this might play out over time? Thanks. Gene Lee : Well, I would say that obviously the parts of the country that were impacted first obviously were down significantly before other parts of the country. Again, I would say more towards the middle of the country you're seeing a little bit -- more of a normalized behavior. And then in most of the Northeast is pretty much shut down except for off-premise. So that\u2019s tough. And the numbers are very difficult to read at this point in time because we haven't had the chance to bifurcate our sales report to areas that are open for business, for -- with a dining room, with social distancing and those that are just open for ToGo. So our ability to analyze that has been a little difficult, just because it's changing so dramatically. But, overall, you could see it as business travel started to decline. All the business centers took a major hit. And now with various closing down, I can't say consumer behavior is changed. It's just it depends on the situation. Sara Senatore : Okay. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on my -- yes. Gene Lee : Sara, just one thing -- just to give people an understanding of Knapp region. I'm going to give you a range. So for the week that we just ended, the best Knapp region was one that's not having any forced closures, etcetera and that was Texas. That was down 29% roughly in the casual dining space. And the worst performing Knapp region was down 61%. So no matter what it is, all of these regions are down just because I think people are practicing their own social distancing. But that gives you a perspective on the casual dining business, the range of the impact. Sara Senatore : Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just quickly on the cost, the cash flow, cash burn piece. And this is probably a naive question, but as I think about kind of the outlays, obviously you have rent and occupancy that you talked about still paying and then you\u2019re taking care of the people. Are there any other big buckets I should be thinking about as I think about what where this sort of cash outlays might be going, irrespective of what your revenues look like? Gene Lee : You talked about most of them already. If you think about our rent expense on a weekly -- on a monthly basis, it's about $20 million of the $40 million. And so I'm sorry, restaurant expense. Rent is about $8 million. And so that's the highest non-salary expense in this cash burn. I'm sorry, and that's weekly, $8 million a week. Manager salaries, somewhere around the $10 million, but that can move if we have a very long prolonged impact, or if something happens on the government side. So we could take that down if we want to make sure that our people get paid somehow. Sara Senatore : Okay. Gene Lee : So that\u2019s -- those are the big buckets. Sara Senatore : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Kind of understanding the survival mentality right now, I guess I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about advertising in this environment. You\u2019ve kind of long touted your robust digital capabilities. Is there anything you\u2019re doing in terms of mining that data to try to manage through the current environment? Rick Cardenas : Andrew, with the sales results we\u2019re seeing now, we are focusing any advertising that we do on ToGo, especially for Olive Garden and LongHorn, but we have dramatically reduced our advertising spend, without getting into too many other things that would be competitive. We have significantly reduced our advertising spend, or we plan on significantly reducing where we can, but it would be focused on -- anything we do would be focused on our ToGo experience. Andrew Strelzik : Okay. And is there any more color you can provide on just what we should expect from CapEx? Rick Cardenas : Basically the only CapEx we would have, we are focused on curbing any capital spend. We are managing it aggressively. And that really includes stopping all non-essential capital spending. As Gene mentioned, we are basically shutting down new restaurant construction where we can. And so that cash burn number I had told you before includes CapEx. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you so much. I have several, if I may. Firstly, what is that non-essential CapEx number? I know not the number that you necessarily want to sustain, but I mean how close to zero could you actually get while continuing to keep up the operation where you want it to be? Rick Cardenas : Very low single-digit millions a week. John Ivankoe : Okay. All right. Wow. Yes, it\u2019s really -- it just shows how extraordinary this environment is. And then, secondly, and this is just going to be from just the restaurant operations perspective, I mean, some numbers are kind of thrown out. No gatherings, about 25 people or 50 people, I mean the numbers kind of seem to be getting lower. I mean, how do you handle that from a practicality perspective within the restaurant? I mean, is there a number of which you say, listen, we\u2019re going to have more than 25 people or 50 people, whatever it is, including a staff restaurant. Is there at any one point in time is kind of the first point? And secondly, just because I haven\u2019t seen it -- I mean, how do you practice social distancing with servers and buzzers and what have you with people that have to have closer than 60 contact with your customers? And then finally, is there any thought of moving to things like disposable or the types of dish where it\u2019s just so the cleanliness aspect or the kind of contact aspect can be as minimal as possible? Gene Lee : It\u2019s a lot in there, John. You got it all in. Let me see if I can remember some of that. First thing we do is, once we get below 10 or less guests, we basically go right to ToGo. Most of our ordinance are 50% capacity or are a high number like 100 and how we execute that as we put someone at the front door and we count. And we\u2019ve the number of employees, we are working on in those environments, limited menus. So we\u2019ve got less employees in the building. We\u2019ve some high volume restaurants with limitations of 100 people in the building that are still doing some fairly good numbers. So I feel like we\u2019re really filling a need the consumer wants. As far as the social distancing with our team members, it\u2019s a challenge. Most importantly, we\u2019re working on hygiene. People are washing their hands, where we\u2019re sanitizing every table after every visit. And we\u2019ve instructed our people to really keep their face and back and be able to reach with their hands and be able to certainly get the best they can in that environment. To date, we are out of our 190,000 team members, we have no confirmed cases. We\u2019ve had a great protocol where we\u2019ve got a significant people -- significant amount of people that aren\u2019t allowed to work because they may have some sort of symptoms. But we\u2019ve got great processes in place. We deal with much more contagious viruses all the time, and we feel our dining rooms are some of the safest places right now. And there are other places that are open and operating that are nowhere near as safe as our dining rooms. John Ivankoe : And if you don\u2019t mind, Gene, I mean, you did kind of talk about, I mean, if I can have the language right, a dramatic change in your cost structure. I know we talked about on the restaurant side, is there anything on the G&A side that you would like to point out at this point of temporary versus restructural [ph] that you -- maybe your discretionary spend within the G&A side that does not involve headcount or possibly does involve headcount? Gene Lee : John, other than me not taking a salary, yes, there\u2019s opportunity. So we\u2019ve cut all travel, we will continue to look at our staffing levels in the support center. I\u2019m not going to make any comments, all my people are listening. We are going to have to make -- there\u2019s going to be some sacrifices that are going to have to be made for the organization, and we will continue to look at that and evaluate that as we get a better understanding of what we are really facing and that changes daily. John Ivankoe : Gene, I know you are doing the best you guys can. Good luck with everything. Gene Lee : Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Thanks for the question. Gene, just wondering if you could provide any perspective on kind of how you\u2019re thinking about the industry and broadly the smaller change in the independence within this environment in particular, maybe relative to Darden\u2019s brands. I know the focus here is on the immediate and the near-term. And I know you don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but just any thoughts that you\u2019ve got perhaps on how you think Darden\u2019s brands are positioned, perhaps if we can look a little bit past and coming out of some of this relative to the competition if you care to share any of that? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes, I think we\u2019re too early on in this crisis for me to have an opinion on that. I think that the full service casual dining business is an important piece of the overall economic engine of the United States. You look at just the six top chains, we employ over a half a billion people. These are great jobs, and people love working for us and consumers love us. And I think that we are all innovative and we are creative. I think that we are going to fight as hard as we can to get our share of the off-premise business in this time. And I believe that we will all come out of it the bigger ones in a strong position. We all have great people. Our people love working for us. Our customers love us, and we just got to manage through this, and I think the industry will be fine. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Brian Bittner : Good morning. Thanks. Rick, the sensitivity analysis you gave us for the fourth quarter, I think you said every point in comp is worth about $0.06 to $0.08 of EPS. I\u2019m assuming that includes things like the emergency pay program to cover hourly workers and whatnot, but can you just help us better understand what are you doing on your core operating costs per unit when we think about that sensitivity analysis? I think you did a great job of explaining the cash burn and I think that\u2019s pretty straightforward, but just trying to understand the cost assumptions in that same-store sales sensitivity analysis a little bit more? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Brian. The $0.06 to $0.08 does include the emergency pay that we had mentioned. As you think about -- we\u2019re taking a more detailed look at every restaurant expense line right now. I don\u2019t have the answer for you now, but the cash burn isn\u2019t that different than the P&L burn in our -- in the scenarios that I gave you. We have ways to reduce that number even more if we need to. And so we\u2019re continuing to look at it, but remember we have a -- after we get the revolver draw down, we have $1 billion of cash, and we\u2019ve got a $40 million cash burn a week. So we\u2019ve got a lot of cash to be able to cover this for quite a while, if we have a full shutdown. So we are -- but we are looking very hard at every expense, figuring out ways that we can reduce those expenses. Some of them are easier than others to reduce. And some of those take conversations with other people, which we haven\u2019t had yet. But one of the easier ones is some of the daily contracts that we might have in the restaurant, some of the services that we do trash pickup, etcetera, because the restaurants aren\u2019t nearly as busy. So we are focusing on every expense. With the priority right now to ensure that we get our people paid until something happens that we can\u2019t anymore. Brian Bittner : Thank you. And Gene, it\u2019s a bold move to take your salary to zero, and I wish you guys luck. Gene Lee : Thank you, Brian. We are going to be fine. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Howard Penney with Hedgeye. Howard Penney : Hey. Thank you for the question. I know this is going to be a difficult one to answer, but if you even hear conversations you\u2019re having with the government of different people that we don\u2019t have conversations with any thoughts on the duration and the timing of this, and what you might be looking at to determine the duration, or is it just basically the curves that we can all say? Thanks. Gene Lee : Hi, Howard. I don\u2019t want to speculate. I\u2019m not an expert and I\u2019m looking at the same information every day, every hour that you are. And when you look at the curves that they are predicting, I mean, I think that what I\u2019m hearing is a peak at the end of May, beginning of June. Howard Penney : Awesome. Appreciate it. And thank you again for your commentary today. It's very helpful. Gene Lee : Thank you, Howard. You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Eric Gonzalez : Hey, thanks for the question. I was just curious if you can go back to the off-premise conversation, and maybe talk about what you\u2019re doing differently, which maybe you haven\u2019t done in the past. I know you mentioned that you\u2019re ahead of everything\u2019s on the table, but have you considered maybe lowering the threshold for smaller delivery? And then, what your current stance is on third parties, if that\u2019s changed at all? And then just secondarily, on the -- on this dividend, I was just curious, what things do returns in normal? How will you determine the size of the dividend? Is that -- will you bring it back to the prior level or would you think about maybe the payout ratio on trailing earnings basis? Thanks. Gene Lee : As for off-premise, I mean we are -- we\u2019ve already ramped up. We are doing delivery. We are bringing down the threshold where we\u2019ve the available people to make those deliveries. I mean, think of us at this point, well, at least within the next 24 to 72 hours, we will be pretty much deliver in Olive Garden wherever people want it to be delivered to. As I said earlier on third-party, everything\u2019s on the table. But right now, my obligation is to keep as many of my people working as possible. And I think that we can ramp up our own delivery much better. I will let Rick talk about the dividend. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Eric. Yes. As we mentioned, we did suspend the dividend. And all I can tell you is, the Board is going to reevaluate that dividend when the conditions change. I can\u2019t tell you where we will be, what the dividend will be. But I will say that in our capital returns to shareholders, the dividend is one of the most important things that we do to return capital to shareholders. Eric Gonzalez : Thanks. Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. My question, Gene, is on the pay of the hourly workers. I know you did the right thing. It seems to implement this emergency pay. But I just wanted to confirm the length of time that covers. And then, once that expires, what your thought processes on and how you keep these employees engaged for when times do get better down the road? Gene Lee : Yes, David, I think the time commitment right now is once the disruption happened it\u2019s two weeks. But that is subject to change depending on what happens with these relief packages from the government. We know that the government is going to start sending people checks directly and not come through us. That has to be part of our calculation. And when we think about our people, we are going to try to keep people employed maybe through our furlough program where we can still have -- they can still have access to their benefits, and they don\u2019t lose their tenure. We are really, really trying to work through keeping our people engaged, so when it\u2019s time to ramp back up that we can ramp back up quickly. But we\u2019ve to continue to work in concert with the government. And if they\u2019re going to compensate the American public directly, then that has to be a part of our calculation as we think about our people. David Tarantino : Great. Thanks for that. And then, Rick, just in terms of cash priorities, I will be the optimist and thinking that you will work through the short-term period and then return to some sense of normalcy. So, I guess, what are your priorities once you get on the other side of this, would it be to pay down debt or would you be looking to reinstate the dividend sooner rather than later? Rick Cardenas : Hey, David. Thanks for the question. One of the things that we\u2019ve said is, the dividend is very important to us. Even with the debt we are taking on, we feel comfortable with that level of debt, if we need to keep it all. What we will do is, look at the cash flow forecast going forward and prioritize if we can the dividend [technical difficulty] priorities of capital or maintaining our restaurants. So we have to continue to maintain the restaurants, make sure that they look great, then the dividend, then new unit growth and then share buyback. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve talked about for years. That hasn\u2019t changed, and we don\u2019t think this situation is going to change that. So, again, capital outlays, maintaining our restaurants, dividends, new unit growth, may be at a more tamed level depending on what happens going forward, and then share buyback. We will likely, if we pay down this revolver to get back to where we were before, but that\u2019s all in the calculus. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you and best of luck. Rick Cardenas : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Rick clarify the comments around sensitivity. I think you said, this week comps were down 60%, down sharply from the 20% last week. So just to connect that guidance to your -- or to forward guidance, you said if comps are down 50% for the fourth quarter, cash burn would be $300 million, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s relative to the $1 billion you have to try and demonstrate your sustainability. But can you compare that to the comments you made have down $40 million to $50 million per week, are those all apples-to-apples or just want to clarify those details? Rick Cardenas : Those aren\u2019t necessarily apples-to-apples, the $40 million to $50 million per week remember is assuming that we were completely closed, and that\u2019s on a run rate basis. The down 50% scenario that we gave to result in $300 million includes some of those run rate costs, include some of the emergency and it also includes the wind down of our negative net working capital, somewhat not all the way. But remember, the restaurant business is a negative net working capital business. And so as sales slow, we start giving back some of that working capital credit that we have. And over time, that working -- if we\u2019re closed completely, that working capital goes to -- goes away from a negative balance. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. So when you say the $40 million to $50 million per week burn, I\u2019d assume 100% close, you are not talking about just the in-restaurant, you\u2019re talking about this restaurant front doors locked, you would burn $40 million to $50 million a week? Got you. But this \u2026 Rick Cardenas : We are talking the door locked and nothing -- every light off. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got you. Okay. And then just to clarify that you said comps, if comps are down 50% this quarter, I think that was the frame of reference you gave at $0.07 per quarter. So you\u2019re talking about EPS reduced $3.50 or so from the prior estimate. So that means that the $0.06 to $0.08 sensitivity change, if comps fall more aggressively, that doesn\u2019t vary, where the comps are down 5 or comps are down 50, you\u2019re assuming there is no kind of bell curve on that which does assume a $0.06 to $0.08 per comp point for the fourth quarter? Rick Cardenas : Yes, that\u2019s a good assumption. I think if it -- $0.06 to $0.08 for every comp point -- remember, for the full quarter and after first three weeks, we were only down 6% roughly. So \u2026 Jeffrey Bernstein : Got you. Rick Cardenas : \u2026 but that assumes 50% for the entire quarter. Jeffrey Bernstein : But ultimately -- just my last question, I mean, qualitatively when the virus fades, and we are hopeful that does soon, but any reason the business model in the earnings don\u2019t bounce back to full strength. I mean, implying no material change to, let\u2019s say, fiscal \u201922 earnings. I mean, most people value this company on future years. Just trying to make sure that any changes you\u2019re making today wouldn\u2019t necessarily change the long-term earnings growth dynamic from here? Rick Cardenas : Jeff, what we are trying to do is make sure that we come out of this even stronger than where we were when we came into it. But it all depends on what happens to the consumer and the length and depth of this crisis economically. As long as people continue to get paid, we think there\u2019s a better chance that the bounce back is a quicker bounce back. If unemployment gets to some pretty high levels and people aren\u2019t getting paid, that\u2019s a different story. With that said, if those things happen and the inflation that we\u2019ve been seeing for the last couple of years probably goes the other way too. So we haven\u2019t looked two years into the future. We are looking hourly and weekly right now. But we believe that our position helps us become even stronger when we come out of this, but we can\u2019t comment necessarily on what the margin structure is going to look like in two years. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. Gene Lee : Hey, there\u2019s 10 people in the queue and I want to get to everybody. We have a hard stop at 9 :30. We\u2019ve got to get back to taking care of some things. So if you could keep it just to one question, that would be great. So I want to give everybody an opportunity. But that would really be helpful. Thank you. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. My only question is, just trying to understand the 60% that you talked about in the last week. I believe many jurisdictions have only limited dine-in sales, as a kind of Monday. So does that really just include half of the impact of that trend to kind of really get down to the run rate of sales? Gene Lee : Yes, Jake, most of those jurisdictions started Monday. We saw a little bit of a slowdown from Monday to Tuesday. But Tuesday to Wednesday was about the same amount, so about down 60%. So as long as it stays that way, we hope that that will continue to be around that number, but we can\u2019t comment on what we actually think is going to happen. That said, we are getting better and better on our ToGo business too. So as it becomes ToGo only, we'd hope to continue to grow that. Jake Bartlett : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. It looks like you\u2019ve a small presence for Olive Garden in the Seattle market. And obviously this has been the site of the first U.S outbreak and perhaps a leading indicator for the rest of the country. So I\u2019m curious if you can talk about the progression of sales in recent weeks for this market to help with the potential analogue for the broader market. And then, Gene, any best practice you learn from the Seattle market to help extrapolate to the rest of the country, give me a little more time here. Thanks and I\u2019m [ph] hanging in there. Gene Lee : Yes. Thanks, Jake. I would say that the Seattle market except for the Downtown area held very tough, and sales hung in there for a while until we started to close down the dining room. So it was a very -- it was okay in aggregate. I\u2019m making that comment based on looking at big groups and numbers, we are looking at the individual numbers and especially brands. I don\u2019t know if that we really learn anything that\u2019s going to help us throughout. I think the biggest challenge we\u2019ve right now is how do we really use our human resources and our creativity to ramp-up our off-premise businesses. And I\u2019ve a lot of faith in our leadership and our folks operationally to be able to really make this a real focus and keep this business growing throughout this crisis. Andrew Charles : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Rick, I was hoping you could go into maybe just a bit more detail about what the company\u2019s alternatives for cash liquidity would be if it happens to come to a point where you would need additional funds, and if you could just give a little bit more color there about some of the options that would be available. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Chris. We are hoping not to need any additional options. And that\u2019s why we pulled down our revolver to get roughly $1 billion in cash on our balance sheet to get us through this. That said, we\u2019ve excellent banking relationships. We\u2019ve been discussing other options with our banks. I don\u2019t want to get into the details of that right now. But if we believe that, again, to be cautious we need a little bit more. We think we\u2019ve access to more without getting in any of the details. Chris O\u2019Cull: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Thanks very much. And I also appreciate all that you provided in this tough time. Rick, you talked about Knapp at different times. You talked about your own sales most recently. Can you just clarify or do you think your trends are consistent with Knapp or are you outperforming or underperforming, we are all trying to get a sense of the benchmark for the industry. Historically have Darden has outperformed that particularly in more challenging times? Can you just maybe, one, trip those numbers; and two, talk about qualitatively do you think you\u2019re outperforming or underperforming peers? Rick Cardenas : I would -- we don\u2019t have the Knapp for the most recent week that I just told you about. So it\u2019s hard for me to say whether we are outperforming them, but I believe we were outperforming before that. And we'd hope to continue to outperform. We have a lot of room to be able to grow our ToGo business. And the comment that I gave earlier was based on Knapp regions, so different regions of the country. And we don\u2019t have that level of data yet. John Glass : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Matt DiFrisco : Thank you. Percentage of the base now with the acquisition of Cheddar\u2019s that you skew towards tourism or travel, if you could give us an estimate on that? And then I had a follow-up on -- the follow-up when we come out of this. Gene, how do you think the process would be if God forbid, you did have a employee come down with COVID, say, in July or August, would you close down the store? Is this going to be something that is going to be treated greater than other viruses that might enter the building and cause closures of stores you believe? Gene Lee : No, John. I think that depending on the situation how long -- when did the employee work, how many days prior were they out before they were diagnosed. What I\u2019m seeing in other businesses is that the retail establishments are not closing. We would do another level of cleaning if that was the case. But I wouldn\u2019t expect major closures over having an employee diagnosed with COVID-19. Matt DiFrisco : And then, on the tourist travel skew, if you don\u2019t mind? Gene Lee : Yes. Matt, we don\u2019t have that in front of us, but I can tell you one of our biggest states is Florida. And that -- we are still operating under our own capacity restrictions of 50% utilization of our restaurant. Even with Cheddar\u2019s, Cheddar\u2019s was primarily a southeast brand. And we haven\u2019t seen as many mandated closures in the Southeast as we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the country. That said, tourism is likely down, but that\u2019s also in -- what we\u2019ve had in the last week. So if you think about the last couple of weeks, it was a big spring break time, and the week that we\u2019re in is a big spring break time. And then, the other thing is, the impacts that we\u2019re seeing are much more pronounced in fine dining than they\u2019re in the casual space right now. And that\u2019s in our presentation. Matt DiFrisco : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Gregory Francfort : Hey. Thanks for the question. Just -- I know you commented on the revolver drawdown. Were you able to or did you make any changes to your amendments on those documents, the debt-to-capital covenant change at all or no? Rick Cardenas : We did not make -- from what I understand, we did not make any amendments on any of our capital right now, any of our debt. Gregory Francfort : Got it. And then, maybe just variable margin you talked about it. Is there a minimum hurdle at which variable margin is positive for ToGo mix, is that 5%, 10%, 15%, is there a level at which that doesn\u2019t become a variable margin positive? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Well, I mean, there -- if we do very little ToGo business, and we\u2019ve someone sitting there waiting to take the order. That\u2019s where the variable margin gets negative, but our variable margins are pretty good in ToGo. It\u2019s just a stair step, it\u2019s not as straight line on ToGo because you\u2019ve got somebody manning phones or something like that. That said, if our ToGo business gets to be too low and we look at it on an individual restaurant basis, if our variable margins are negative, we probably end up closing that restaurant. But it\u2019s still too early to determine that. We are also using -- we\u2019ve got managers in our restaurants, so they can help. They don\u2019t have as many things to do in the dining room, so they can do some ToGo. And so, we\u2019re able to maybe run a little bit, fewer hourly employees during this timeframe and use managers in some of this ToGo business as well. Gregory Francfort : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Peter Saleh : Hey. Can you guys hear me? Gene Lee : Yes. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Peter Saleh : Yes. Great, thanks. Can you guys just talk a little bit about, if you have business interruption insurance. Does the business interruption insurance cover this type of situation on any kind of conversations you\u2019ve been having with your insurers would be helpful. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Peter. Yes, we do have business interruption insurance that covers the situation. The maximum we can recover is $10 million. And we think based on what\u2019s going on now, we will probably be able to recover all of that. And I will say that it\u2019s pretty rare to have some of this kind of coverage. And so, we were pretty fortunate that we were able to get this coverage. And we will hopefully try to keep it next year. Thanks. Peter Saleh : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Andy Barish : Yes. I\u2019m all set. Questions have been asked. Thanks for the time and stay safe. Gene Lee : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Jon Tower : Hey, great. Hopefully you can hear me okay. The question that I had was on -- we talked about the lender side of the equation with respect to negotiating power, but can you talk about perhaps any discussions you\u2019ve had with landlords about the potential of deferring rent -- rental payments in the future periods. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Jon. Other than the mention that Gene said about new restaurants slowing down construction, we haven\u2019t had discussions yet with landlords on deferring rent or delaying our rent payments. We\u2019re hoping not to have to get to that point, but we are probably going to start some discussion, just to be sure that we have enough capital later. But we might not need to do that. Jon Tower : Great. Thank you. Good luck. Rick Cardenas : Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Great. Thank you so much for squeezing me in, and I hope you can hear me clearly. My question was just around whether you guys have had conversations with the rating agencies at this point, and how much flexibility they are willing to afford, given sort of the fluidity of the nature of what we are seeing with COVID and some of your liquidity needs? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Priya. We have conversations with our rating agencies throughout the year, and we\u2019ve had conversations with them more recently. I can\u2019t comment on where they\u2019re saying -- what they\u2019re saying about COVID-19, but I think they are looking at every company\u2019s rating right now based on the results. But, yes, we are having conversations with them. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Kalicak for closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you. That concludes our call. I would like to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 25. Thank you for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your call for today.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Thanks so much. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2021 first quarter earnings on September 24 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. It has been 14 weeks since our last earnings call. I don\u2019t know about all of you, but it\u2019s felt more like 14 months, so much has happened. Over the past three months, our business changed in ways we never imagined, so I want to spend my time with you this morning trying to put it all in perspective for you, then Rick will share some of our fourth quarter and year-end results and provide our outlook for the first quarter. When I look back on all that has transpired, one thing that stands out is the resiliency of the full service dining industry. Prior to the pandemic, total annual sales for the casual dining industry was approximately $108 billion. And while I do not know how long it will take the industry to recover from the significant impact it experienced, I am confident that this category will get back to the size it once was. Our industry plays a vital role in our communities, and that was evident in how the consumer relied on restaurants over the last several months, even in a to-go-only environment. And while off-premise will continue to play an important role as we recover, we know that the consumer still wants to enjoy an in-restaurant experience. In fact, going out to a restaurant with friends and family is the number one activity consumers say they look forward to doing as the economy opens back up, and we've seen that as our dine-ins reopen across the country. As this vital industry continues to rebuild, there is tremendous opportunity to increase market share through increased on-premise demand and incremental off-premise sales. Those executing at the highest level are going to continue to win, and Darden is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. When we last spoke in March, we knew the pandemic was going to have a significant impact on our business. Our ability to manage through this crisis has been driven by our commitment to prioritize guest and team member safety, invest in our team members, provide frequent and transparent communication, leverage our digital platform, and be brilliant with the basics. The health and safety of our guests and team members has always been our top priority, and we've taken a number of steps to create a safe environment in our restaurants. From sourcing masks and other personal protective equipment for our team members to developing a contactless curbside pickup process at our brands while our dine-ins were closed. We are mindful of the trust our guests and team members place in us. Today, our health and safety commitments are focused on team member health checks, personal protective equipment, enhanced sanitation processes, social distancing, and frequent hand washing. We also provide paid sick leave for all our team members so they can stay home if they're ill. But we can't do it alone, and that is why we encourage our guests to join the online waitlist or make reservations, not enter our restaurants if they are symptomatic, wear a mask, and utilize contactless or mobile payment options where available. We continued to invest in our team members as our dine-ins closed. In addition to rolling out permanent paid sick leave, we introduced a three week emergency pay program that provided nearly $75 million of pay during the fourth quarter for our hourly team members who could not work. When emergency pay ended, we covered insurance payments and benefit deductions for hourly team members who were furloughed. As we brought hourly team members back to work to support increased to-go volume, we introduced an additional payment to help cover unexpected costs such as transportation and child care incurred as a result of the pandemic. And to recognize the unbelievable work our managers did during the quarter, we paid their target bonus for the fourth quarter. We know our people are our greatest competitive advantage. Not only were these investments the right thing to do to take care of our team members, they've also created a deeper loyalty and strengthened engagement while we've seen this pay-off as we bring our people back to work. Communication is the most important aspect of leadership during a crisis. We knew frequent and transparent communication with our team members and investors was important. Beyond daily meetings with all of our brand presidents who in turn met with their operational leaders on a daily basis, we have maintained a consistent communication cadence with our team members. Since this crisis began, I have provided regular business updates to our people and have been open and honest about the impacts to our business, and consequently the impacts to them. We took the same approach with our shareholders and the analysts by providing four business updates during the quarter. The pandemic accelerated the consumer's desire for convenience, and we saw a significant increase in digital engagement. The work we have done over the past few years investing in our digital platform to reduce friction prepared us to quickly adapt to consumer behavior and deliver on their expectations of convenience in our to-go-only environment. During this time, we have strengthened our digital platform and made meaningful progress against our digital strategy. In addition to improving the guest experience across our digital channels, our strategy is focused on using technology to help our guests easily order outside and inside the restaurant, improve the wait to be seated, streamline the order pickup process, and speed up how they pay. We've been building on our digital platform to support increased demand, and we certainly tested it like never before. During the quarter, online ordering at Olive Garden grew by more than 300% over the prior year and accounted for 58% of To Go sales. And at LongHorn, online ordering grew by 400% and accounted for 49% of To Go sales. Additionally, we accelerated our timeline and rolled out online ordering at our brands that had not yet deployed it. We also added the ability to order alcohol online for all of our brands and markets where that was allowed. Our commitment to being brilliant with the basics allowed us to remain focused on operational execution even as the environment forced us to radically change how we serve our guests. Each one of our brands did a phenomenal job delivering a new guest experience by collaborating and sharing best practices. This involved creating contact -- contactless curbside pickup that included designing what was essentially a drive-thru in our parking lots while this execution in this environment meant enabling our guests to order and pay online and have our team members seamlessly place their sealed orders in their vehicles. Our operators displayed tremendous innovation, flexibility, and passion as they continue to serve our guests. And to ensure we consistently executed at the highest level, we took the opportunity to streamline our menus, and improve our processes and procedures. With these changes, we are seeing improvements in execution and direct labor productivity. So what have we learned from all this? We've learned a lot. But most importantly, this situation has reinforced that our strategy that we developed five years ago grounded in our back-to-basics operating philosophy leveraging our four competitive advantages and cultivating a portfolio of iconic brands is still the right one today. Strong brands with loyal guests have fared better, and the trust we have earned from our guests is critical. Being brilliant with the basics by consistently delivering exceptional food, service, and atmosphere is imperative. However, we know how important safety including this are to our guests right now, and we must continue to earn their trust every day. And throughout this unprecedented time we have been benefited greatly from our four competitive advantages. Our significant scale, our extensive data and insights, our regular strategic planning and our culture; whether sourcing PPE for our team members, ensuring we're not impacted by supply chain issues or sharing best practices across eight brands, the ability to leverage just scale has allowed us to quickly react to constant change. Finally, as I said earlier, we know our people are our greatest competitor advantage. And I'm impressed by how our team members responded and continue to respond to take care of our guests and each other. Having a strong culture has been part of our DNA since we were founded. We were able to keep the majority of our managers employed and we stayed connected with our furloughed hourly team members. This allowed us to bring our people back quickly and get our dinings opened safely without any delays. As you saw in our press release, 91% of our dinings have reopened with at least limited capacity. We have also brought 60,000 furloughed restaurant team members back-to-work and we expect to bring at least another 40,000 back as business continues to improve. I'm incredibly proud that our culture is actually strengthened during this most difficult period in our company's history. This, above all else is what gives me confidence in Darden's future. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you Gene and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2020 was on track for a solid year of performance and the beginning of Q4 was no different. The first few weeks of sales were strong and then nearly overnight, the impact of COVID-19 required us to pivot to a To Go only format. This posed unprecedented challenges for our restaurant and support center teams and I am proud of how everyone moved quickly to increase To Go sales, reduce costs, manage working capital and improve efficiency. The simplifications Gene referenced helped to reduce key variable expenses in our restaurants especially direct labor. The teams also worked to reduce or eliminate other fixed costs in our restaurants and restaurant support center as well as eliminate non-essential capital spending. Given the significant reduction in cash flow, we also had to work quickly to ensure we had enough cash for whatever might occur. During the quarter we suspended the dividend and share repurchases, fully drew down our $750 million credit facility, took out a $270 million term loan and raised over $500 million in a follow on equity offering. All these efforts, and the strong loyalty of our guests resulted in us tripling our prior To Go sales run rate averages, and materially reducing our cash burn as we disclosed to you through our periodic business updates. Given the confidence in our cash flow trends and the ability to access it in the future, we fully repaid our credit facility in early May. Now turning to the results. The total sales were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 43.0%. Same-Restaurant sales decreased 47.7% and adjusted diluted net loss per share was $1.24. Because of the significant reduction in total sales compared to last year, all of the expense lines experience sales deleverage, so I'll just touch on a few highlights. First, Food and Beverage costs were higher as a percent of sales given menu mix related to both To Go mix and simplified menus, as well as increased packaging expense and elevated beef cost. As we look at the labor line, there was significant deleverage in management labor, including approximately $25 million in manager bonuses. However, we saw an improvement in hourly labor as a percent of sales of over 150 basis points even with a substantial reduction in sales. Restaurant expenses per operating week decreased over 20% given our focus on cost management, even as we incurred over $5 million in incremental cleaning supplies and PPE related to COVID-19. For marketing and G&A expense, we were able to reduce the absolute spend by $37 million and $17 million respectively versus last year. Included in our restaurant labor, and to a small extent G&A is approximately $50 million of investment net of retention credit. This was related to emergency and furlough pay for our team members while they were not working. This negatively impacted our EPS by $0.30 which was not adjusted out of reported earnings. During the quarter, we impaired $390 million of assets as a result of lower sales, reduced profitability and lower market to capitalization. The impairments related to $314 million of Cheddar\u2019s goodwill and trademark assets, $47 million of restaurant level assets and $29 million of other assets. We permanently closed eleven restaurants in the quarter, six of which were already impaired. The entire $390 million of impairment charges were adjusted out of our reported earnings. We ended the quarter with $763 million in cash and another $750 million available in our credit facility. This gives us over $1.5 billion of liquidity available to weather the crisis and make appropriate investments to grow profitably. Our adjusted debt-to-adjusted capital at the end of the quarter was 61% well within our debt covenant of 75%. As we shifted to an off-premise only model, we took a disciplined approach to pursue sales opportunities, with an eye toward incremental profitability and cash flow by focusing on cost management and the guest experience, while ensuring our team members were taken care of. This approach resulted in a better finish to Q4 than anticipated and is the underpinning for the strength of our business model that is reflected in our first quarter financial outlook. Now turning to fiscal 2021 performance. In today's release, we provided quarter-to-date same restaurant sales and the performance of our restaurants with dining rooms at least partially open. These results are encouraging with last week's blended same-restaurant sales down 30%, we are operating cash flow positive at these levels. Our To Go sales remain elevated in restaurants with dining rooms at least partially reopened. Olive Garden To Go sales are approximately double their pre-COVID averages and LongHorn has more than tripled their pre-COVID averages and LongHorn has more than tripled their pre-COVID averages in these restaurant. While it is our normal practice to provide an annual financial outlook, due to the uncertainty in business performance moving forward, we are only providing an outlook for the first quarter. We expect to achieve approximately 70% of prior year sales levels, total EBITDA of at least $75 million and diluted net earnings per share of greater than or equal to zero on a diluted share base of 131 million shares. At this point, we don't intend to further share intra quarter business updates since we have provided our first quarter outlook. For the full year, we intend to open between 35 and 40 net new restaurants. Our first opening of the year is expected to be in early July, with a few others likely to be opened by the end of the first quarter. In total, we expect between $250 million and $350 million of capital spending for fiscal 2021. Turning to other aspects of capital allocation. As you recall we suspended our dividend last quarter due to the level of cash flow uncertainty and the need to preserve as much cash as possible. We have been consistent in our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, and our dividend is a big part of that. As soon as we see the business begin to generate the sustainable cash flows to support a dividend and repay our term loan, we will have discussions with our board on our dividend policy. And now I'll turn it back to Gene for some closing comments. Gene Lee : Thanks, Rick. And as you've seen in our 8-K filing this morning, Dave George will be retiring on August 2nd. Dave will celebrate his 65th birthday later this year, and we've been discussing this transition for some time. Dave and I have been partners on this journey for 23 years. It was a joint venture partner for LongHorn when I joined RARE in 1997. I still remember the first time I met him. We're going to visit his restaurant, so he picked me up at the airport in his Volvo, with no air conditioning in the North Carolina heat. I knew at the end of the day that Dave was a special operator. I wasted no time we bought out his interest in his joint venture and brought him into the company. Over the last 23 years Dave has been a successful in every one of his leadership positions. He has led three of Darden\u2019s iconic brands; the Capital Grille LongHorn Steakhouse and Olive Garden, and most recently he served as our Chief Operating Officer. He built great teams and became a mentor to many operators and executives. His can do approach and attitude permeates throughout Darden in each of our brands today. For many of the last 23 years, Dave and I have had lunch together on Monday to discuss what happened the previous week and talk about what needed to get done going forward. Not much has changed over those 23 years except today; we order salads instead of two or three entries each. And for the last five years, David sat next to me during every hour earnings call as he is today helped me find the details I need to answer your questions. I'll miss seeing him when I walk into the room on these days. For all the Darden team members listening today, our annual conference which usually happens in August would have been a great opportunity for everyone to see Dave, thank him and wish him well in person. Unfortunately, because of COVID-19, our conference has been postponed until next year. We will however be inviting Dave to our conference in 2021, and he's committed to come so we can celebrate all he's done for Darden and for many of you. In closing, I want to say thank you to all our team members, those currently working and those who remain on furlough. And as I've said to you repeatedly, your ability to adapt, innovate and collaborate during this time has truly been inspiring. Thank you for your on-going commitment to our guests and each other. And now we\u2019ll open up it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Go ahead please. Your line is open. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. First, I want to pass on my congratulations to Dave George on a very successful career and wish him the best as he retires. So Gene, I guess my big picture question is related to what you think the environment could look like on the other side? Gene Lee : I lost you \u2013 did I lose you just -- you there, David. David Tarantino : Can you hear me, okay? Gene Lee : I lost you. Last word I heard was on the other side. Is there a period after that or --? David Tarantino : No. Gene, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you think the environment will look on the other side of the pandemic especially as it relates to the competition and the potential for unit closures, and how you're positioning Darden to potentially take advantage of that type of environment, whether it\u2019s potential to grow faster or how do you think about those dynamics as you look longer term? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes. Good morning, David. Yes, I think that as I said in my prepared remarks. We went into this as a $108 billion category, and I've been really impressed with the resiliency of the consumer and how important full service casual dining has been in everyday life of our guests. So, I think the industry gets back to where it was. I think it's important. I think people really miss it, probably miss it more than they know. There's been a lot of predictions of how much capacity will come out of the system. I'm not going to sit here today and say I know what the exact number is. The one thing I do believe is there'll be -- there'll be less competition as we -- and less restaurants as we move forward, and I think that's a great opportunity for us. I think scale is going to matter more than ever. I think that you know we believe that we can get back to 2% to 3% unit growth pretty quickly. We're going to continue to open restaurants. We\u2019re going to continue to do new deals. We think the economics going forward here in the short term should get better for us on new restaurant development, and I think we'll go back to our basics. We're going to continue to try to improve our food offerings. We're going to try to make sure we have the right value that we're offering the consumer. As we mentioned in both our comments this morning, we've improved productivity in our restaurants through more streamlined menus. So, we think the opportunity is there. We also think that off-premise will play a bigger role as we move forward. We think our capabilities in that have improved dramatically over the last 14 weeks, and we -- and I think a lot of consumers have had the opportunity to maybe use our service off-premise that hadn't used it before. I think they were really pleased with the overall experience. David Tarantino : Great. And then, Gene you mentioned kind of streamlining the operations and the menus. Is that something you think will continue longer term or do you see that maybe some of the items coming back that you removed? Gene Lee : Yes. I think -- I think David, each brand\u2019s in a different place. Each brand went to a different place when they went off premise only, so some brands I would say right now are probably back to 100% of where they will want to be other than maybe some promotional items here and there. Other brands still have 10%, 15% that they need to add back to their menus to make them competitive. But it was not only the menu. I mean, I think when we basically closed down the operation except for off-premise, we had the chance to rebuild as we opened back up and we had a chance to look at all our processes and procedures, and I think we were able to simplify and eliminate a lot of prep work in some of our businesses that we'll never get back into the business. I think these are costs that we're going to -- we've gotten out. We've had a lot of discussion around our table is that it's been much easier as we build the on-premise business back up to reimagine what the operation in the back of house looks like versus trying to reimagine it why you're operating. And we're really thrilled with the results so far. David Tarantino : Great. Thanks very much and good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning. Also would like to wish Dave George a very happy retirement. Congrats on a wonderful career. Gene, I know during this pandemic you've instituted lower order price thresholds for delivery across the Olive Garden portfolio. What are the insights and maybe the impacts you're seeing from this, and what are your updated thoughts on that opportunity as this environment has so rapidly changed these last few months? Gene Lee : We've run a lot of tests there, David. I think where we're settling in right now is $50 minimum, it\u2019s still the 5 o'clock call the day -- the day before. We find that to be the sweet spot. The average order size is still well above that. We didn't see any benefit of going below that threshold. And so, that's where we're going \u2013 that\u2019s what we're netting out and we think that, that opportunity will continue to be there. I won't -- we will tell you that we did test doing our own delivery, found it really inefficient, and it wasn't that additive. And so, we're really focused on this curbside operation and think that's the future for off premise. Brian Bittner : Okay. And my follow up is just -- it's interesting to see the LongHorn sales recovery occur a bit more rapidly than Olive Garden, you know particularly in units that have reopened their dining rooms. Gene, what do you really attribute that to, and you know I ask that question in the spirit of the fact that To Go sales in the open LongHorn units are actually much lower than Olive Garden. So, I'm surprised we're seeing such a big recovery in LongHorn versus Olive Garden more recently. Gene Lee : Yes. You know Brian two things to consider. First of all, geography is working for LongHorn. We've got the state of Georgia. We have a huge presence there, and business has come back real strong. I would also say that the Olive Garden dining room yields a higher percentage of tables available in -- with the occupancy restrictions than Olive Garden does. And so I want to take this opportunity to talk just a little bit about occupancy. A lot of people have done a lot of work on this and I think that you're -- I think you need to think about just a little bit differently. Once your past 25% occupancy the only thing that matters is there is six feet of social distancing required. Remember, there's always significant inefficiencies in your seating capacity. We've always got twos and fours -- fours and sixes. We've got tables for large parties. Our average party side is two point three. So different layouts even in different -- inside the same brand will yield you different seating efficiencies. We will be installing temporary barriers in approximately 100 restaurants in the next two weeks to try to improve this efficiency especially in Olive Garden. We want to do that while maintaining the social distancing requirements. We'll analyze the sales growth after that we've installed those barriers and decide how many more restaurants we want to add it -- added to. So that's a long answer to your question, but I think that there's some confusion out there and we have to remember that once you're past 25% occupancy, that's six foot restriction on social distancing trumps any other restriction there is, because you can't get to 50%. Brian Bittner : Understood. Thanks for the color, Gene. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open. John Glass : Thanks. Thanks very much. I will. And congratulations to Dave on your retirement. I wanted to ask about incremental margins as you think about the recovery. So you know COVID has made a lot of businesses including yours, rethink how you do things, you talk about menu simplification, but you also talked about this heavier to go mix made influence food costs. Do you think as your AUVs recover that you're able to get back to higher margins [Technical difficulty] Gene Lee : Hey John, thanks for the question. As it relates to margins incrementally going forward, right now if you look at our P&L and the way our margins looked, our margins are better on a variable cost basis than they were coming into the pandemic. So if we don't make other investments going forward, you would anticipate our margins to be a little bit better than they were before. However, we're still making decisions on what we'll do as the sales continue to grow, whether we bring some things back or invest in our guest even more to grow sales even faster. So, I don't want to comment too much on what our margin structure is going to look like in a year or two years, because we may make choices that take away some of that margin gain that we had or we may let that margin flow to the bottom line. But as of right now, our variable margins are better than they were coming into the pandemic. John Glass : Okay. Thanks. And then, Gene, just following up on your question about the To Go being your -- or your curbside being the preferred off-premise channel. Did you take the opportunity to test third-party in this period of time? Do you look at your results and say, they are just as good as many of your peers with third parties? So, what's the advantage? I mean, how do you conclude or look at this period of change in any way your view on third-party or maybe stiffing your resolve against it? Gene Lee : John. We've had third-party delivery in some of our restaurants even before the pandemic started including some Olive Gardens, the lot of Yard House. And we actually added some third-party delivery in Yard House in a different state. And we really didn't see that the third-party delivery grew faster than our own To Go business. Our own To Go business actually grew faster than the third-party business in those restaurants. And so, we're still at the point where we believe that our off-premise business is really strong and continues to grow. And we are not anticipating, launching a third-party delivery model. Now, as we've said all the time that can change as soon as we see or if we see that those margins are equal to what we do today then maybe we'll go into the third-party model. But as of right now, our resolve is strong. We believe that doing off-premise the way we do it, especially now that we've added this significant curbside business is the way to go. John Glass : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Gregory Francfort : Sure. Thank you very much. And Dave, congratulations on retirement. I have two questions. The first is a follow-up, just to the capacity restraints. I guess, the point that average party size is lower in Olive Garden, which is what's creating the six foot distancing. I think the 2.3 was overall. But I think we're just trying to understand that point. And then, the other question I had was just on off-premise and how much maybe that could look like in a fully recapture scenario. How are you guys looking at it? Because you guys give some data in the release that maybe it's like a third of prior sales volumes now or 60% of what the peak kind of off-premise was. But I'm curious how you guys are thinking about that and trying to figure out what that would look like in terms of size after this? Thanks. Gene Lee : As far as capacity for Olive Garden goes, I don't really think it has -- the party size has an impact on that. It just more the way the physical layout is. And we have a lot more room. We have rooms. We have less boost. And so, we\u2019re trying to create that six feet is more difficult. Remember, some of our smaller rooms are offset. They're family tables, they're larger parties. Olive Garden does a lot of that. But the majority of our buildings right now - because the booth backs are less than six feet. We can correct the same yield. If we - and we adhering to the local jurisdictions. If we adhere to those local jurisdictions we can't create the same percentage occupancy in mostly Olive Gardens that we can in LongHorn. And that's why putting some of these temporary barriers that we're building in there could help increase the yield. And what we're seeing. We're seeing - I think, when we talk about Olive Garden, we need to focus on the absolute sales number, which is significant. And as we get towards the weekend our percentages come down a little - I mean, get a little bit tougher to keep up, right? So the bigger, bigger days that we have an Olive Garden are harder to match. Early in the week, our year-over-year sales declines are little bit less. As far as off-premise, I think that -- we believe off-premise will play a bigger role going forward. I'm not so sure that we expect to kind of keep these run rate once we get back to a normal environment as long as there's a threat of COVID and people have modified their personal behaviors that we think off-premise business will continue to stay robust. We think this will be a contributor going forward. We think when we level out we'll be at higher percentages of off-premise in all of our businesses. While I can't sit here today and say what I think that percentage is going to be. I do think it will be greater. Gregory Francfort : Thanks, Gene. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks. And I just also want to extend best wishes to Dave on your next chapter. Two separate ones from me. One for Rick. Can you talk philosophically for how you arrived at 1Q guidance for sales. Was this more top-down or bottoms up just in -- what recent news as the virus spreads in some key states for Darden? Rick Cardenas : Well, Andrew, it was actually both. I mean, we did a top-down look at where we are geographically. What we've been running lately. And our brands did our own bottom-up look at it by geography et cetera, and we came to around the same number. And so, if you look at what we have, we're seeing approximately 70%, which is where we are after three weeks of this quarter. Now mind you, the restaurants that are open, with dining rooms open are doing a little bit better than that. But we just want to make sure that we don't know exactly when all the dining rooms are going to open. We don't know when if there's going to be another wave or of some closures. We're hoping that doesn't happen. But that's where we came up with our 70% number for sales. And then on the profit side, as you saw in our fourth quarter, we did much better job in controlling costs and expenses and everything else. And so, we just have a stronger business model, which makes us feel comfortable with our EPS of zero or greater and a $75 million or greater EBITDA. And that's total EBITDA in that restaurant level, that everything. Andrew Charles : That\u2019s helpful. And then question for you, Gene. Looking beyond the 35 to 40 openings plan for 2021, can you talk about how you'll be able to achieve 2% to 3% restaurant growth in shorter term rather than the longer term? But can you talk about how the pandemic has changed your practices for site selection as well as change the restaurant prototype to help maximize ROI for what looks to be more off-premise curbside-focused future? Gene Lee : Yes. I would say, it's too early to say, its really changed our philosophy on new restaurant development at this point. But one thing I do believe is the economics are going to be more favorable than they were pre-COVID. I think that they'll be a lot less people growing out there. So I think the cost of construction should come down just like it did in '09, '10, and '11. I think the cost of the underlying land should come down significantly. And so, as we look forward I think the economics look promising. The best restaurant deals we did were after the recession in '09 and '10 especially for our specialty brands. So we'll push hard on that to get favorable economics where it possible. I do think that as we look at these businesses transition to more curbside than folks coming into a restaurant that picking up the take-out order. And we still don't know how we get back to a normal environment. How that's going to migrate back. Will this going to stay 100% curbside or people are going to want to come in. We've got to really go to that discovery process. I think the big work that needs to be done is to think about what do we need to do inside the box to better support and stage curbside, if its going to be that big part of our business. Up until recently in our existing restaurant we been doing remodels to create capacity for inside pickup. Now we got a really re-look at that as we go forward. We have been developing an Olive Garden more of a dedicated pickup space off the side of the kitchen that we are really happy with. But that might not be the way we want to go going forward. We don't know. And so, we'll see as we move forward. I think we'll try to build a little more flexibility in our dining rooms and think about different barriers and our floor plans. So that if something like this happened in the future we might have more flexibility. But I'm actually -- I'm really excited about the opportunity to build restaurants. I'm confident in our model. I believe the cost -- the initial investment cost is going to be less or at least not be inflating at the rate it was inflating. So we're going to be able to create significant value for Darden going forward with new restaurant growth and we'll probably be one of the few out there that's opening new restaurants. Andrew Charles : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Eric Gonzalez : Thank you so much. And I also like to add my congrats to David. Based on the discussion we had earlier about the occupancy in Olive Garden versus LongHorn. I just wondering if you could speak to why it seems that the off-premise sales perhaps are being little bit -- cannibalize little bit more at Olive Garden versus LongHorn? And then, my second question relates to the promotional environment. It seems like very few of your competitors are discounting or even advertising right now. I know, you had that $12.99 [ph] promo earlier this month. But wondering, when you think the right time to restart the promotional schedule? And how you think the competition is setting up with regards to advertising deals? Thanks. Gene Lee : On the first question, I think -- I mean, LongHorn just started at a much lower level for off-premise and that's why it's growing at three times and not two times. I don't think there's anything more to that. I think the absolute dollars going outside on Olive Garden. Our on-take out are impressive. I mean, they have some of the CD levels of overall sales. I mean, those are impressive numbers. If you look at 40% last week on $81,000 per week. I mean, that's a huge business. So, I wouldn't read anything else into that other than LongHorn started at a much lower level. As far as promotional go --promotions go, we've pulled back. Obviously, we've pulled back on almost all promotional activity. You're seeing us do a little bit of television Olive Garden because we own the spots. We bought them in the upfront. And so we need to -- we'll continue to advertise there. Right now, we don't think it's prudent to be promoting people into our restaurants when we have long waits to get into the dining rooms. Well, I think we would just be creating more frustration for our guests who can't get in. And so, at some point maybe we'll do some more off-premise advertising. But right now, we're looking -- we're taking this opportunity to cleanse our marketing spend to understand as we put it back in what works better. What gets us the highest return on investment as we as we put it back into the system? And when that's going to be a big opportunity, again, this is where scale will matter. We can come back in and advertise our businesses at the right time. We don't think this is the right time to be advertising. We think this is the right time to pull it back, analyze the situation and we'll make it -- whenever its doing this -- when the situation is right, then we'll start to layer some advertising back in and promotion back in. Andrew Charles : Helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Chris Carroll : Thanks. Good morning and good to hear from you all. And congratulations to Dave on his retirement. So Gene, you referenced Georgia Performance regarding recent LongHorn strength. So following up on that, can you provide any additional detail on what you're seeing more broadly in the states that were among the first to allow dining rooms to reopen? Are you seeing sales in those states meaningfully different than that of your overall average? And how is off-premise mixing in those states now versus the average? Thanks. Gene Lee : Well, I think that -- I'll answer the first question -- last question first. The off-premises is strong. It's maintaining. Wouldn't see no change in off-premise in those states for the most part. As far as how those states are performing against others and all depends I think on what your brand strength is and what your relative share is in those markets. So obviously, when you look at LongHorn in Atlanta Georgia, we've got the largest share of voice there. I mean, we have 45 restaurants in the DMA. We're very trusted brand. We are borne out of LongHorn -- out of Atlanta. And so, I think people just trust the brand. And so, where we have great brand strength whether it's a Cheddar's market that has great brand strength. There an Olive Garden Market that has great brand strength. Those restaurants come back faster and perform at a higher level. And so, I don't think it really has to do with as much as when the state opened, as much as what's the brand strength in those specific markets. Another example is where we do really well in LongHorn Cincinnati is another one of those early markets. And we came back strong in Cincinnati as soon as we opened. But that's true in for Cheddar's in certain markets, is true for Olive Garden in certain markets. Chris Carroll : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much and congrats, Dave. That's a long time to be having weekly lunch with Gene. So congratulations. Just one question, one follow-up. Just in terms of the question, the changes you've discussed that you've made during COVID. I'm just wondering maybe you can prioritize a few of that you think maybe a good business and will remain post-COVID. I know you mentioned curbside and we talked about delivery. But thoughts around social distancing or I know you mentioned the online waitlist and reservations and the reduced menu. I'm just wondering if any of those you see is kind of more permanent. And then I had one follow-up. Gene Lee : Well, the most permanent and the most significant thing we've done is streamline the menus and our processes and procedures and that's forever. This was the opportunity that a lot of us have been waiting for. When we closed down our dining rooms and we knew we had to simplify for the off-premise. And then we had those three or four weeks to really focus at the corporate level with our teams. They say, okay, what do we really need to come back. And how do we keep this simple. Because we had no idea what was going to happen when we opened our dining rooms. We didn't know when it was going to show up. And so we had these simple menus out there. They're all disposable. We knew that we could change them quickly if we needed to. But what we learned was, we could get enough variety on the menus to satisfy the demand of the consumer. And we could simplify it because we want to make sure we didn't have as much labor in the back of the house to execute it. So to me that's the biggest thing our teams have done. And that's been the biggest insight on that -- some of the --what I would call this superfluous menu items that are on our menu that one out of 100 people that were buying when they were coming in just aren't important. And most of those created the complexity in the kitchen. And so with this one -- hopefully once in a lifetime opportunity we were able to pull those out. And I think that's what's going to be the lasting change. It's going to have significant impact two, three, four years from today. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got you. And then my follow-up was just. It was mentioned earlier about the reinfections and seems like it's ramping up in recent days and weeks. So I'm just wondering if there's any color you can give directionally in states we've seen recent spikes. How your business maybe changes. Or maybe how your approach to decisions is going to change versus the first time whether speed to close or duration of closure. Just wondering what you've seen where those spikes have happened and how your business -- or how you might change a process of making decisions this go around versus the first? Thank you. Gene Lee : I would just say real quickly. We've seen no change in our business trends in the states that are starting to spike. Obviously, we're concerned, we're focused on it. But as a leadership team, we always talk about, let's focus on what we can control, right? We can't control it. We're not doctors. We're not in the government. Folks are going to do what their leadership inside the states are going to do what they're going to do. What we -- if we're focused a pivot again to more restrictions in restaurant dining or even if we to go back all the way to an off-premise, we can pivot that way. It's going to be a lot easier this time to pivot that way, because we know we're going to do. We know how to do it. Last time we were kind of making it up as we were going. We made a lot of right decisions as we did that. But this time it would be a lot smoother for us to pivot back to on off-premise. Its only experienced for a short period of time. I think the difference this time is that this will be micro, not macro. And that's how we're thinking about it. And that we've got a team setup to manage day-to-day what's happening in these local municipalities. And we'll adjust. But as we think about it as a management and a leadership team is, we're going to control what we can control and we're not going to worry about things that we can't control. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Jeff Farmer : Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the question that Jeff just asked. So I appreciate that you said that so far you're not seeing much of a change. But just drilling down a little bit from that level. Again, is there any type of like a pivot back to off-premise from on-premise, reduced frequency? It sounds like you're seeing that. At least as it relates to the overall volume levels you haven't seen much of a change. But in terms of consumer behavior or taking a little bit of a deeper dive to see how those consumers are behavior -- this consumers are behaving in those states that have seen a dramatic jump in COVID cases. Is there anything you can add beyond what you've already answered for Jeff's questions? Gene Lee : No. Peter, I mean, we're talking here six or seven days since we've really seen something. We haven't seen any change in any behavior at this point in time that we can call out. Who knows? Maybe some will change tomorrow. I don't know. But right now there's nothing for us to say that can add any value to this topic. Jeff Farmer : And then just one other follow-up question. So is it possible for some of these restaurants that are operating at 50%, 60%, 75% capacity to put up positive same-store sales numbers. Can they actually again grow sales year-over-year positive comps with that 50% to 75% capacity constraint? Rick Cardenas : Yeah. As of today we have somewhere between 10% to 15% of our restaurants that are putting up positive same restaurant sales. There are restaurants that have good solid off-premise business. And they've got a business that kind of goes all day. There an trade areas where even early in the week you've got business from two to five and after eight. So 10% to 15% of our restaurants today are positive same restaurant sales. Jeff Farmer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you. I wanted to echo the congrats to Dave as well. Gene, I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about value. I know you said, you don't really want to promote right now. But it also seems like you've got some labor productivity benefits in your back pocket with about 150 basis points of productivity. So you've got some margin I guess to spend. How are you thinking about value maybe over the next couple months or maybe a couple of quarters? It seems like we're going to be in a relatively high unemployment environment and competition is coming more back on line. Just try to understand your perspective on value going forward? Gene Lee : Yes. I think it's real simple. Once we the capacity and if we see any let-up in demand, then we can pivot to value. We have that opportunity to invest in value to drive traffic. At this point it just doesn't make any sense, because we have no capacity to drive it to. Peter Saleh : Understood. And then just my second question is on the -- you just talked about a competitive advantage and extensive data and insights that you guys have. Do you see anything in the data that would move you more towards a loyalty program or away from a loyalty program in the future as things normalize? Has anything changed there in this environment? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Peter, this is Rick. Something did changed during this environment. We actually canceled our loyalty program test. And that ended at the end of the fiscal year. And it ended for a couple of reasons. One is, we've had it out there for a while. We had seen some incremental improvement over time. But we just didn't think this is the right time to continue to invest in that. We wanted to streamline everything we were doing. That said, there is a chance that we'll bring one back in the future. We did get some good data out of a loyalty test. So the data is richer than the data that we get from our credit cards and other things. The real question was, do we have enough of that to utilize to market and to do the right things? And so, we cancel the test again to streamline to ensure that we're focusing on the things that are most important right now. That said, we may come back with another loyalty program in the future. Peter Saleh : Very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, I want to wish you all the best during your retirement. I've really enjoyed covering your career at RARE and Darden. So I just have a couple of questions. Rick, the first quarter guidance implies no improvement in the current trend. So, I'm wondering if you're anticipating sales could be impacted when the supplemental unemployment benefits expire. Rick Cardenas : Well, everything that we're anticipating is in our guidance. They could be impacted. That said, we don't know if they're going to be expanded, right. Are they're going to be extended or they can be extended at different dollar amount. There's still some discussions along those lines. And so, we put everything in there. There's some positives in that could happen or some negatives can happen. And that's why we felt that our 70% sales number against last year was the right number. Chris O\u2019Cull: Okay. And then the company had 43% sales decline in the fourth quarter and lost about a $1.25 and adjusted earnings. Expect 30% sales decline in the first quarter and earnings to breakeven. Can you give us further a little more explanation as to what are the key line items driving that improvement in earnings sensitivity? Rick Cardenas : Yes. A couple of things. One is, we had $58 million of costs that we did not adjust out of our earnings that we won't have in this quarter. As we talked about before, the $58 million of investments that we made, $50 million of that was definitely -- not definitely, but it was an impact that we wouldn't expect to happen going forward. That's one. And two. When we came into this and started declining fast, it took us a little bit of time to get some of those costs out, right? So, you go from a positive sales in one week to negative 75% and within a couple of weeks it takes you a little bit of time to move those costs. Now, we have all the fixed costs where we like them. And so with a 70% sale -- so a 30% reduction versus last year we can be profitable. Chris O\u2019Cull: Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Go ahead please Your line is open. Sara Senatore : Thank you. I have two questions. One about unit growth and one a follow-up on margins. The new units, we had actually anticipated that you might have much lower unit growth just because there might be constraints on construction or permitting that kind of thing. Could you just talk about what -- whether we should expect openings to be more back end loaded? Or if the pace is sort of level loaded or more like normal? And then, I guess the other -- and what brand would we expect to see? Is it safe to assume Olive Garden and LongHorn given the volume recovery there? So that's the first question just on unit\u2019s cadence and brand. Rick Cardenas : Sara, this is Rick. In terms of opening cadence for the year, recall, we stopped construction in the fourth quarter. And a lot of those restaurants were either done or close to done. So the restaurant that's opening in July was pretty much already completed. And so, we will have some restaurants that can open quickly if we want them to. We're opening as I said one in July. We've got probably handful more that will open by the end of the quarter. And that we're doing to make sure that we can train in social distancing and make sure that we're training the teams correctly. And then after that we've got a lot of and that can open. As soon as we think that we can serve the guests need that's coming into that restaurant. And so, we can flip the switch fairly quickly. But the likelihood is it'll be a little bit more backend loaded just because we want to see what the environment is before we open a restaurant at limited capacity. Sara Senatore : Got it. And the question I had about margins. Sorry did you say which banners you might be opening Olive Garden, LongHorn. Or is it sort of look back at historical rates in this. What the right mix? Rick Cardenas : Yes. I would look back at historical. Our plan this year is to open at least one restaurant for every brand. And some of them again, we're already under construction. But the majority of our openings will be Olive Garden and LongHorn. Sara Senatore : Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then just on the margin follow-up. Can you just give a little more color. You talked about labor savings, but I'm also trying to understand when we look at the margin complexion sort of food, labor, other, how much of that is difference in off-premise versus on-premise? And what those margins look like? Or was there mix? I know, if LongHorn is doing slightly better I think that is negative for food but good for Labor. Just trying to understand how much of this is sort of the expense management and the efficiencies that you found versus business mix? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Sarah. Cost of sales was unfavorable to us in the fourth quarter. A lot of it because of mix in brands, mix in To Go business and the higher expense for packaging. Unlike other brands we actually put our packaging costs in our cost of sales. It's not in restaurant expenses; it\u2019s in cost of sales. So when you think about how much we shifted To Go and we had some value platforms in To Go, Olive Garden did buy one take one for almost the whole time for To Go. So that was a higher cost of sales. We had we had To Go packaging for more entrees than normal. We had bundles at some of the other brands. So it was really a mix up To Go and mix of what we were selling. And then brand mix is a little bit of that. But it's not too much, except for the fact that our higher end brands actually had a lower same restaurant sale, so a bigger negative. And some of those brands have a fairly good cost of sales measure. On the labor front, it was all deleverage as we talked about -- as I talked about in the prepared remarks. We had restaurant managers we paid them even when they were on furlough. We had -- we kept most of our restaurant managers throughout this downturn. We had the $58 million of those expenses that Gene mentioned. That was in our restaurant labor. Primarily there was a little bit in G&A, but most of it was in restaurant labor. So that hurt our margin on that front too. Those are things that we don't expect to continue. What we do expect to continue is deleverage in the restaurant manager labor line because that's a fixed cost. But we do have some as we said some favorability on the hourly labor side. Sara Senatore : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Setyan from Wedbush Securities. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Nick Setyan : Thank you. Appreciating that. We don't really know what happens to the incremental $600 a week or are there stimulus measures going forward. I mean -- but is there a sense kind of looking back internally around the extent to which the stimulus measures contributed to date to the sales recovery? That's my first question. And then, I have a follow up. Gene Lee : And I think -- when you think about stimulus, I would say, it's definitely a positive. I'm not sure we can quantify how positive it is. And I would say that yes, right now there is -- we think it's -- some of that's going to go away at the end of July. But I have to -- you have to -- at least I think that the government's going to have to add some other stimulus to the economy that should be positive to us and it just may come to us to a different vehicle. And so, I expect the overall economy to have stimulus in it. I don't think it'll come in the same form as it's coming today. But I think that we'll get our fair share of it. Nick Setyan : And you have given your experience and you've navigated through a number of Psycho. What's your sense that even if the capacity constraints are completely normalized, but we're in a low sort of teens or high single digit in unemployment environment. What's your sense in terms of where sales eventually do stabilize? And then just structurally around sort of the fine dining business or Yard House business given its exposure to malls et cetera. How do we think about those businesses in the medium to longer term? Gene Lee : Yes. I think what you're asking me is impossible to predict right now. Because what we -- we don't really understand the competitive situation. We don't understand how many competitors are going to be out there. We don't understand the stimulus that the government going to put it in. So I don't know where this levels out. But I do think it's important to note that our fine dining businesses and most of primary all our specialty businesses are going to return to normal more slowly than I think casual dining will return to normal. Primarily because Capital Grille, Eddie V's rely on business travel and entertainment as a big part of their sales. And we saw that in '09 and '10, the businesses do shift. You become more weekend-focused in fine dining and in an environment like this. And we're already seeing that shift that our weekends are actually fairly good in fine dining. Our Midweek business is weak. And so, I think to sum it up, the specialty brands are going to -- are going to come back a little bit lower especially in some of -- like some of the yard houses that are tied to ballparks or stadiums or something like L.A. Live, as those areas come -- those entertainment areas come back slower. They will have some tough sledding going forward there. But I don't know where this all ends up. All I do know is that with our strategy and we believe with our scale and our competitive advantages that we are positioned to gain market share as we move forward. And I'm confident in that. And I believe the investments we've made in our people are going to be the biggest advantage we have. Nick Setyan : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks for the question. And Gene thanks for the commentary on capacity constraints. Just wanted to follow-up on Jeff's question about kind of getting those AUVs headed back towards flat or positive. Just wondering if you could talk a bit more about the things you can do other than the partitions to increase capacity. Your capacity utilization while the restrictions are in place. And maybe even more broadly in addition to the capacity utilization, just speaking to some of the other key things that you can do to drive that AUV recovery with those restrictions in place? Thanks. Gene Lee : Well, I think it's tough. I think that that's -- we're balancing how much do we want. How much capital we want to invest in some sort of temporary solution. If you asked me two weeks ago, I would have thought they were on a better path to being able to see all the restrictions lifted. Obviously that has changed here in the short term. So there's not -- I don't think there's much more that we can do than create some physical barriers without ruining the atmosphere in the restaurants to create capacity. I mean, some of our folks have been really creative with outside seating, which I applaud, and I hope they continue to do that. But then, as we get into the summer months down south, that gets more difficult because of the thunderstorms and things like that. So I really don't see. I think we have to learn to live with what the restrictions are until such time they're removed. Dennis Geiger : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good morning and thanks for this extended time for the conversation. I wanted to ask about your team in the store is. How are they feeling? If you think about reopening the dining room, how many of -- what would have been a prior concept in play? Were you able to retain or not retain, but actually bring back. And is that something that you're leveraging in terms of the reopening process? Gene Lee : Yes, absolutely. That's what we think the investment that we made with the emergency pay and then paying their benefits has really paid off. We've had very little problem bringing our people back to work. They're excited to come back to work. They miss their work family. And so depending on the brand we're anywhere between 50% and 70% of the initial workforce coming back. In the restaurant business, our reputation is one of the most important things that we have. And so, we have great basic hygiene processes and procedures already developed. And so our team members are used to working in this environment. Now we're enforcing some social distancing. They have to wear a mask. But they're great already at washing their hands. The restaurants are already clean. They've got great food handling procedures. And so, there's a lot of confidence in our restaurants that these are great environments to work in and they feel safe. Our people are just so excited to get back to work. And even -- I would even say, even when we were in our off-premise only, the amount of people that were coming back to work and doing different types of jobs and just looking to contribute anyway was incredible. And so that's why one of the things that we talked about was the leadership team. The first thing that we're going to do is we're going to try to take care of our team members the best we possibly could in this very, very difficult situation. And that's why we've invested in a gross level $75 million an additional pay for those first three weeks. And I think we're being paid back for that not just today but I believe we'll be paid back for that in two, three, four, five years. Our restaurant managers are incredibly loyal. We treated them very, very well during this process. Nicole Miller : And just to confirm and closed the loop on that. If you think about being relatively back in the range of 70% of sales, the staffing levels are 50% to 70% as a match to the 70% of sales. Is that the way to think about that? Rick Cardenas : That's how we think about it. Nicole Miller : Okay. Alright. Thanks again. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Andy Barish : Hey guys. I'll ask one and then a quick follow-up. Just Gene, can you give us sort of an update progress report on how Cheddar's has come through this. I know you were making some good strides on the people side. Obviously, this was unprecedented. But just an overview on where Cheddar's is heading? Gene Lee : Yes. I think Cheddar's has made it through this very well. There's two things I would highlight on Cheddar's. First of all they've always under-indexed on off-premise. And we were able to do a couple of things through this a lot quicker than we were planning to do. First of all, we only had two antiquated phone lines going into each restaurant. And through this we were able to get them an upgraded phone systems, so people could actually call in orders and get a response from our team members. Second, we were able to transition them to online ordering. And we just had a big impact. And so their off-premise business has built and continues to build each and every week through this process, which we think will be very beneficial. The most important thing that happen for Cheddar's through all this is the way that we at Darden treated them. And I think that when you think about the management and employees, especially management this was a critical. I always look at when we do acquisitions, there's always this critical moment. When the management forgets about the old days. And they don't have that romance with it. And then they're thankful for the new days. And through this process, this is the time I think that our Cheddar's leadership and people in our restaurant. So just thankful that they were a big part of a big company that could step up and do the right thing. And I think that is going to create incredible loyalty. We've lost very few management people through this time. And people are really excited about what they're doing. And lastly, they have the opportunity and through this they made the biggest change with their menu and processes and procedures in the back of the house. That's going to have a long lasting impact on that business and improve the overall financial performance. So we're pleased. We think leadership did a great job. We think management and the restaurants did a great job. The team members came back excited. So we think this was a positive for Cheddar's when it's all set and done. Andy Barish : Great. And just a quick follow-up on the on the efficiency and the back of the house in lower prep hours. Was that simply the menu changes or did you also -- where were you also able to layer in some supply chain changes with more value added product or something like that? Rick Cardenas : No. I think it was a little bit of value add, but not much. I think it was really -- there was just a -- there was a handful of products that weren't providing a whole lot of value to the consumer that caused a lot of chaos and a lot of additional prep and cost in the kitchen that we just removed from the menu. And our guests haven't been asking for it back. So I mean, there's just a lot of streamlining. But that menu has come down to a lot simpler. And they did some really good procedural work from the back door to the front -- to the dining room table that has just made it easy to execute. Andy Barish : Thanks, Ricks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning. I just wanted to circle back on the comment you made about some of the investments you're considering making going forward. I just wanted to better understand the decision making process there. Is there something specific that you're looking for? Is it just a matter of timing? Just curious for any color on that please? Gene Lee : You talking about the investments in the facilities that create capacity? Andrew Strelzik : There was a comment about kind of margins two or three years from now and not wanting to commit to something around that. So I guess, I'm just curious around those potential investments that you're considering? Rick Cardenas : Andrew, this is Rick. Yes, I made the comment on margins. And there are a lot of investments we can make. One of them is to bring marketing back. And so we took -- we're taking marketing down significantly. Now, we'll still have some number in our P&L in Q1 for marketing as percent of sales. So, I would encourage none of you to put zero in there. We do have some marketing, but we significantly reduced it. These menu simplifications that we made. Are there some items that we need to bring back as we do some more research down the road when we have full dining rooms? Do we have enough breadth of appeal? And so, if we bring them back how do we do those. How do we bring those back with a simplified process. But it would still be a small investment. So there are other investments that we can make. We can make investments in taking less pricing, because we have margin to do that. We can make investments in quality which we're doing right now. LongHorn has just made some more significant quality investments in their menu even throughout this process. I don't know if it's in the restaurant yet, but its coming. It\u2019s a higher ounce weight for one of their best products without really pricing for it significantly. Olive Garden is making some significant investments right now in their menu in terms of a better quality and better value. And so, we still have a lot of investments that we can make. We're not going to talk necessarily about what we're going to look forward -- whether we make those investments or not. But just be sure to know that the margin that we have today gives us room to make investments or gives us room to drive into the bottom line. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for making time for the questions. And Dave, congratulations on your retirement. Just a few follow-ups for me. First, kind of going zeroing in on this specifically. What percent of in-store sales can Olive Garden regain with the six foot capacity constraints still in place? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Jon, this is Rick. That's actually a difficult question to answer, because every restaurant is different in their layout. Not every restaurant, but a lot of restaurants are different in their layout. And we actually showed in our presentation what they're doing today. So what the restaurants are doing that are open. What are they doing in total sales and To Go sales and kind of get an idea of where they are. We think we can make that a little bit better overtime with some of these barriers that we're looking at. But any one brand is different. It's kind of hard to tell you exactly what percent we can do. It all also depends on how much people are willing to go on the shoulders of a meal period. And so, as the capacity constraints happen are people willing to wait a little bit longer or come in a little bit earlier and that'll help us drive more sales. But I couldn't tell you exactly what percent is the right number. Jon Tower : Okay. Thanks. And then just on the labor savings so far. How much of 150 basis points you saw this quarter? Do you think can stick when volumes kind of return back to normal. And then just lastly. I don't think anybody asked yet and maybe I missed it. But you guys raised quite a bit of capital there in the quarter. Can you just discuss your intent on use of those proceeds? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Jon, as regards to the 150 basis points how much can stick as sales go up. All of -- our hourly labor is primarily variable. So unless we're making some significant changes to our menu or where we have to bring in some training again because there's a little bit less training in the fourth quarter. That would be the reason that our labor as a percent would go up. Or if we determine as we look at our guests experience, did we take a little bit too much out. And so, we don't believe that was the case because a lot of this labor came out of the kitchen. But we'll look at and see that and determine whether we need to bring some of it back. But I would still say that the first quarter should have an hourly labor benefit. Now remember, it's going to be offset by deleverage in the management labor side. And so, if you can remind me the second question, sorry. Jon Tower : Just in terms of the proceeds you raised. Rick Cardenas : On the capital front, yes, when we raised that additional $500 million in capital, we said it was to invest in growth and to shore up our balance sheet. And so, we believe our balance sheet is shored up as we mentioned our adjusted debt to adjusted capital ratio of 61% and our covenant is 75%. Had we not raised that capital we would have been a lot closer to that covenant. We are making investments in growth. Right now, as I mentioned, some of the investments that we're making are investments in quality. We're using some of that capital to invest in quality. We use some of that capital to invest in our team. As Gene mentioned, so the things that we did that we think are going to benefit us in long term. We now have the capital to be able to start growth again And as we've said, we're going to start opening restaurants again. We think that others might not have as much of a balance sheet to be able to do that. And so, those are the investments we're talking about today. And we'll continue to look at other ways to invest that capital for future growth. We think there's tremendous opportunity to invest. And that's why we took out that extra equity. Jon Tower : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Brett Levy : Great. Thanks for taking the call. And Dave, I think you really misunderstood what Gene was saying when he said that this is going to be a work at home, a stay at home economy. So congrats to your time off. When you think about the capital that you've provided us, the outlay for the $250 million to $300 million. How much of that is going to go in towards the new level of maintenance that these units are going to take? And also just how are you thinking about areas like the stepped-up IT and the digital onslaught that we're seeing? And then just when you think about your portfolio, you've talked about LongHorn, Olive Garden, Cheddar's a bit. Where do you still see additional need to work on at the other change to catch them up to where you are, and I'll stop there? Thanks. Gene Lee : Okay, so you got Maintenance CapEx technology and brand mix. So if you think about our maintenance CapEx you know our number of 250 to 300 is probably got $100 million to $125 million, $100 million to $120 million of maintenance, which is a little bit lower than we normally say about 120 million, so let's just say we take a $20 million number out of that. On the technology front, we're still investing in technology. That's one of the things that we're going to continue to invest in, and we -- and we made a lot of investments in the fourth quarter. When you think about what we did to bring Cheddar's online, bring all the other brands that didn't have online ordering up to make some investments now on our curbside and how do we make that curbside even more streamlined through technology. How do we improve payment, and doing other things? So there's a lot more we're going to do in technology, that team\u2019s really really busy. We're really, really proud of what they did over the last couple of a couple of weeks of the actual 14 weeks to ensure that our website stayed up in running as we drove a lot more traffic. I mean, as it turns to the brand that we're investing in a week, we believe that we should invest in all of our brands. As we mentioned in the number of the openings, we're going to open I believe at least one restaurant for every brand. If we can get through all of the, all of the space limitations and the social distancing limitations in that 35 to 40 restaurants, and we are we are very excited about every one of our brands and their ability to grow. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please. Your line is open. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning and Dave congratulations on your career. Obviously a huge work done in the past on Olive Garden. Two questions; first on seating capacity. You talked about how social distancing is more of a constraint. It sounds like it was more of a constraint for Olive Garden than LongHorn. I don't know if you meant to imply that, and if that is the case, how much of a booster capacity can occur with those barriers? And I have a follow up. Gene Lee : Well the barriers that we're testing in Olive Garden can boost capacity significantly because the booth backs are so low in an Olive Garden, and that\u2019s the difference between Olive Garden and LongHorn is that the booth backs are much higher. And you think about a LongHorn, LongHorn is just one big room. What we do in a LongHorn is we use dividers to create space and to create the ambiance that we want, which ended up working in our favor that created some social distancing. Whereas, in Olive Garden, everything is at a much lower level, it's like at four feet. So we're looking at how do we, how do we you know we have gone in the majority of the Olive Gardens already and put plexiglass in certain places to create some barriers, to get us to the occupancy that we're at. And then also in Olive Garden, you have a lot of nooks and crannies, where we have you know four tables in there. And now we're lucky if we can, only know only going to use two, and if we can, in some of those instances in those rooms you only really get to use one. And so it's just, it just had to do more with what you know how the floor plan was. And our ability to harm, create barriers with Booth backs. David Palmer : I mean, is this -- is that 7% percent difference in the recent open stores roughly the difference? I mean how much of a boost to know you could you get? Gene Lee : There's some decent [Ph] geography that's favoring LongHorn versus Olive Garden. A lot of Olive Garden\u2019s you know I mean -- just the way the way it's laid out. When you think about Georgia and the percentage of restaurants that LongHorn has in Georgia, and there are no restrictions in Georgia right now for the most part, they've really benefited from that. David Palmer : And I -- and I guess you mentioned there is positive comps in 10% to 15% of restaurants. I mean, we're talking about these capacity constraints. It's hard to get your head around how that's possible. Can -- you have any comment on that and how what sort of information that gives you about what's possible for the rest of your restaurants? Gene Lee : Well it's just -- it's just you know you've got to -- you've got a significant off-premise business in those restaurants. And you have a consumer that probably has limited access to other restaurants that is willing to eat at two o'clock in the afternoon. And that's why I look at those restaurants. Some of them are more rural, especially in Georgia. And so you know I think each individual situation has got a specific reason why I think that that individual restaurant is performing the way it does. But it just says that you know combined with good off-premise consumer -- a consumer base that is willing to roll through the whole day and use the facility you can you can create some volume greater than last year -- situations though David. David Palmer : Yes. I mean do you don't feel like sharing what percent capacity increase you can get from these barriers on Olive Garden. Is that something you have put your finger on? Gene Lee : Maybe up as much as 20%. You're putting your pipe, get to put every booth in, and then maybe a little bit higher and put every booth in play. Right now every other booth is out. David Palmer : Yes. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Ivanka with JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. I know we've kind of touched on unit development a couple of times, you know just looking for maybe some clarification and also maybe a little bit of forward guidance. 35 to 40 net, how many is that gross? In other words you know how many are you expecting to actually close in 2021 and obviously I did see some impairments and you're wondering if that was going to lead to some closures. And that CapEx number of 250 to 300 is a low number given the number of units that you are opening and certainly any CapEx that you have in 2021 would also kind of foretell whatever you're going to open in 2022, so are you kind of thinking that you can get back to a 2% to 3% unit development in fiscal 2022 and how should we think about -- it's a lot of different questions here. How should we think about overall maintenance CapEx as perhaps a percentage of DNA in a post crisis environment as you've kind of rethought the overall business models? And I'd like another question as well. Rick Cardenas : All right, John. So the 35 to 40 restaurant is really almost gross and net. So there, we don't have a whole lot of closings that we would anticipate in this fiscal year. We just closed eleven restaurants in the fourth quarter. Some of them were already impaired and the rest of them we impaired when we closed them. And so if we had something that we were going to close, we already did it, unless we had something where the lease wouldn't allow us to close. So we don't anticipate closing any more restaurants this year unless there's a lease expiration that we couldn't move or if something gets damaged in other ways. So the gross to net is about the same. In terms of CapEx, the 250 to 300, remember we had stopped construction of 17 restaurants that were supposed to open in Q4 or in the fourth quarter really of FY 2020. And so a lot of that CapEx has already been spent. Even if we ramp up development, we wouldn't be able to ramp it up enough to spend a lot of CapEx in the late FY 2021 for FY 2022. We're not ready to talk about FY 2022 openings. So if you take out the 17 openings that we had delayed from FY 2020 to FY 2021 that cuts to 35.5. Right. And it cuts the 40 down to 23. And so we do believe, we could get to the 2% to 3% unit growth, get back to that fairly quickly. We'll probably be close to that this year when you think about the 35 to 40. The question will be 22 and how fast do we ramp up development when we have to make sure that the landlords and the landowners and the construction folks understand there's probably a new price out there today. And so that takes a little bit of time for price discovery. And so we'll see how long it takes us to ramp back up. We have the team to be able to do it, and we're ready to do it when we need it. On the maintenance side I think, I mentioned $100 million to $120 million. It's not too different than what we've been doing before. Remember, our number one priority with Capital is to make sure our restaurants are maintained beautifully. And we've been consistent in that all along. And so, we do not want to cut down on maintenance that is essential than it is needed, and we believe, maintaining our restaurants is essential maintenance. So while we did reduce that during the fourth quarter because basically restaurants weren't very busy, we will bring that back. And that's why we've got 100 million to 120 million in our CapEx number for this year. John Ivankoe : Okay. And maybe thinking about maintenance CapEx as a percentage of DNA, maybe that's kind of something to think about over the very long term and it doesn't necessarily have to play out over a couple of years I suppose is what you\u2019re telling me. Gene Lee : Yes, it won't play out much. John Ivankoe : Okay, understood. And the second tier topic and it's kind of a completely different one, but it's a big spending bucket. A lot of companies are you kind of thinking about and re-evaluating their calendar 2021 versus calendar 2019 G&A. I mean, we're all kind of recognizing how different we can work in efficiency and how much travel we actually need to do, and how much money and time virtual work and work at home what have you actually saves us. And that's you know that's something separate even in head count. But how many of the changes you know in terms of the organization are you making whether it's spending per employee, not in salary, but on things on top of salary and also a number of employees. Are we beginning to think might be the right level for the organization and if it's possible that you know because it's such an important number to put in the model and this thing and to think about what that calendar 2021 versus calendar 2019 if it's fair to think about it in that way could look like for Darden? Gene Lee : John, it's hard to answer calendar for us, because we're a fiscal year company. We don't think calendar. So to think that way would take a little bit of mental math. John Ivankoe : Yes, I understand. But it's like I just want to put an asterisk on calendar 2020. I bet you're unusual now you're right in the middle of it. So no. Okay, but\u2026 Gene Lee : And just let me give you an idea. We would anticipate in the first half of our fiscal year to have significantly less spend per employee in travel and in some of the department expenses that we have. We're also looking at our organization to see what the right size the organization is based on -- based on our sales levels today. And so as we mentioned after in Q4 we save $17 million in G&A. We don't anticipate to save $17 million in Q1, but we're going to save some G&A in Q1 and continue into Q2, without talking about what the percent G&A percent is. It's not going to be hugely hugely different than what it was at the end of the fiscal year -- in fiscal 20. So I wouldn't model dramatic changes. It could be 50 basis point to 100 basis points different, but higher, just because of those sales deleverage. But that's all in our guidance, that's all what we have in Q1, and as we get better understanding of what our sales levels are going to be going forward, we'll have a better understanding of what our G&A as a percent will be, but we will spend less per person on the on the department stuff and the travel in the first half of this fiscal year. John Ivankoe : Very helpful. Thanks for the patience and time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you so much. I have two quick questions. One for Gene, in particular you guys have talked a lot about the bigger your scale being an advantage, and the consolidation at the top. So, some smaller independents, small original players potentially falling out, some capacity coming out. I wonder if you could update us on sort of your outlook say the next six months or so what we should look at as year-over-year capacity that potentially could come out of a full service casual dining sector. And then secondly for Rick, I wanted to sort of walk through that model where you gave about 30% down on sales equates to a little over 600 million in sales in your model in 1Q and then your EBITDA is about 200 million or so less. I wonder how do we get back to a whole basis year-over-year on EBITDA. Do we need all of the 600 million or so of sales to come back? Or could we get a portion of that to get greater than 200 million of EBITDA back. I'm trying to understand the flow through on this new lower variable cost model? Thank you. Gene Lee : Okay, Matt. On capacity, I think, I'm not going to probably sit here today and predict a number whether that's 10%, 20%. There are a lot of people throwing around different numbers out there. The one thing I will say, I believe there will be significantly less restaurants out there to compete against in the near term. And the longer this environment last, I think the more fallout you're going to have. And so I think that that is an advantage for us going forward. Rick Cardenas : Matt, and as it relates to sales to get back to our EBITDA, yes you're right. It's about 600 million is what you mentioned on the 30%. We don't need all 600 million to get back to that EBITDA based on what our margin structure looks like today. You know I'm not going to give you exactly what we need, but it it's not 100% of what we were doing before. That said, the reason I'm not going to give you that number is because we may invest some of that stuff. Some of that back. So I don't want, I don't want to add a number to say it's 90%, 95% or 100% because we're going to do the right thing for our guests and our team members to make sure that this cost structure that we have today is the right cost structure in the future. And if it's not we'll make some investments. But I will say that those investments may take a little bit of time. So we will have a better flow through in the first quarter on some of these sales than we would have had in the past. Matthew DiFrisco : Excellent. Thank you for the color. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Catherine Fogarty with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Katherine Fogertey : Great. Thank you for the question. I have a couple of questions mainly around the menu for simplification that you may have said you went through during the quarter. And I was hoping you could kind of walk through bright brands and where you found the greatest amount of efficiency. And you mentioned some are about 15% to 20% below prior menu points. What would be the catalyst to bring them back, and any kind of numbers you could put around the cost savings you found on that side? And I have a follow up. Rick Cardenas : Okay. This is Rick. On a brand by brand level to tell you what the margin differences are, and what we've done that's it could be pretty, pretty long conversation. But I would say that as Gene mentioned earlier, Cheddar\u2019s made a lot of change to their menu, and a lot of change in their procedures to bring a lot of direct labor out of the system. So if you think about kind of an order of magnitude Cheddar\u2019s had the most change in their menu and the improvement in their labor cost over time. All of our brands are doing better in direct labor as a percent of sales than they were last year. All of them, Cheddar\u2019s is doing a lot better. But to tell you exactly what we did, again, all brands did things differently, all brands change their menus a little bit differently. But all brands focused on and we went into it optimists only model. They focused on how can we serve? What can we serve? What are our highest value items? What are highest guest satisfaction items, and what are the items that we can actually run it with just managers. And so if you think about brands, like Cheddar\u2019s, like Capital Grille, the smaller you know the specialty brands most of their To Go sales when they were To Go only were done with managers only. So we had to simplify that menu. And Olive Garden also simplified even though they had team members in the restaurant at the same time. But those simplifications again were to streamline the menu to the most value item, value items for the guest and the ones that the guest wanted the most. And so what's interesting now, and without the menu marketing and the different things that we do on a menu development, you know guests are voting with what they're buying. And it's amazing what as we simplified the menu we can actually see what the guest\u2019s favorites really are. And the great thing is, for a brand like Olive Garden, it's a few products that are on a few different menu items and so it actually is better to keep it that way because we streamline. And so without giving you specific examples, those are some kind of high levels of how we did it. And again, all brand had hourly labor efficiency improvements and we expect those to stay maybe not as good as they were, but we expect the efficiencies to stay. Katherine Fogertey : [Indiscernible] helpful ranking on that guys. And then my follow up question is actually around the comments you made about investing for growth. Am I right to be thinking that M&A is at potential opportunity just given you have some of the benefit of your balance sheet and if that is right, what categories look particularly attracted to you? What do you think would help with your overall [Indiscernible] or do you have any holes in your portfolio that you are particularly excited about going forward? Gene Lee : But you know what the management and the board will continue to look at the opportunities that are available out there; we'll look at our own portfolio. We look at what, it's out there that could possibly fit our portfolio. The only thing I would say on specifics around that is that we believe we want to be in the full service business, that's where we get the advantages of our scale. So as we look out there at the full service environment, I think that we'll continue to analyze the opportunities and if something makes sense, then we'll try to bring an end to our platform. Our thought process is always does it benefits by coming on our platform, and does the platform benefit it by them coming on the platform to get through that screen and they can grow a little bit. Then it makes sense. I think right now it's about timing. It's about what's the right, what the price. You know the price discovery. And then we'd have to make the decision at that point in time. Katherine Fogertey : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And it looks like that's all the questions that we have at this time I'd like to turn the call back over to our presenters. Gene Lee : Thank you, James. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind everyone that we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday September 24th before the market opens. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to Darden's Fiscal Year 2021 First Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Thank you so much. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Marcella. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2021 second quarter earnings on December 18, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and then Rick will provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for the second quarter. As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated app track [ph] excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. During our first fiscal quarter industry same restaurant sales decreased 26%. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Given the ever-changing environment we continue to operate in, I am very pleased with what we accomplished during the quarter. We are focused on four key priorities; the health and safety of our team members and guests, in-restaurant execution in a complex operating environment, investing in and deploying technology to improve the guest experience, and transforming our business model. The progress we\u2019ve made in these areas combined with our operating results gave us the confidence to repay the $270 million term loan and reinstate the quarterly dividend. Let me provide more detail on the four priorities. First, health and safety of our team members and guests remains our top priority. Following CDC guidelines and local requirements, our teams continue to practice our enhanced safety protocols, including daily team member health monitoring. We also continue to configure our dining rooms for social distancing to create a safe, welcoming environment while maximizing allowable capacity. A key part of this work is installing booth partitions to enable us to safely increase capacity where permissible. At the end of August, we had completed installation in just over 500 restaurants in our total portfolio. Operating in this environment adds another layer of complexity to an already complex operation, and I am proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each other safe. Second, we are laser focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy to drive restaurant level execution that creates great guest experience, whether that's in our dining rooms, outdoors on our patios or in their homes. But it is not easy. Executing at a high level is more complex today due to COVID-19 restrictions that vary by market. Additionally, the constantly changing mix between on-premise and off-premise plus expanded outdoor dining that is weather dependent, reached unpredictability in sales. This is why the work we continue to do to streamline our menus and improve our processes and procedures is so important. Removing complexity from our operations has allowed our restaurant teams to execute more consistently in this unique environment. Our operators continue to deliver great guest experiences by displaying a high level of flexibility, creativity, and passion everyday, and I am thrilled to see that that reflected in our guest satisfaction metrics. Third, we are continuing to invest in and implement technology to remove friction from the guest experience. This includes providing multiple ways for our guests to order inside and outside the restaurant across our digital storefronts. Additionally, we are deploying mobile solutions to make it easier for our guests to let us know when they have arrived to dine or pick up curbside order-to-go. We are also expanding mobile payment options, providing additional convenience for our guests. For our three largest brands combined, more than 50% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guests ordered and paid online. Finally and most importantly, we transformed our business model. Even with the sales declines we are experiencing, our restaurants continue to produce high absolute sales volumes. Therefore, we made the strategic decision to focus on adjusting our cost structure in order to generate strong cash flows, while making the appropriate investments in our businesses. This provides us a stronger foundation for us to build on as sales trends improve. The first step in this process was to re-imagine our offerings. This resulted in simplified menus across the platform driving significant efficiencies in food waste and direct labor productivity. Additionally, due to capacity restrictions, we significantly reduced marketing promotional spending along with other incentives we have historically used to drive sales. We will continue to evaluate our marketing promotional activity as the operating environment evolves. Finally, we have further optimized our support structure which is driving G&A efficiencies. The results of all these efforts to transform our business model can be seen in the fact that we generated adjusted EBITDA of $185 million for the quarter. Turning to our business segments, Olive Garden delivered strong average weekly sales per restaurant of $70,000 while significantly strengthening their business model, resulting in higher segment profit margin than last year. They were able to capitalize on simplification initiatives that strengthened the business model while making additional investments in abundance and value. This work was critical to position Olive Garden to drive future profitable top line sales as capacity restrictions ease. Olive Garden same restaurant sales for the quarter declined 28.2%, 220 basis points below the industry benchmark. Overall, capacity restrictions continue to limit their top line sales, particularly in key high-volume markets like California and New Jersey where diners were closed for the majority of the quarter. In fact, restaurants that had some level of dining capacity for the entire quarter averaged more than $75,000 in weekly sales retaining nearly 80% of their last year's sales. Given the limited capacity environment during the quarter, Olive Garden made a strategic decision to reduce their marketing spend as well as incentives and eliminate their promotional activity. They will continue to evaluate their level of marketing activity as capacity restrictions ease. Additionally, off-premise continued to see strong growth with off-premise sales increasing 123% in the quarter representing 45% of total sales. Thanks to technology investments we continue to make, online sales made up almost 60% of total off-premise sales, more than tripling last year's online sales. Finally, Olive Garden successfully opened three new restaurants in the quarter which are exceeding expectations. LongHorn had a very strong quarter. Same restaurant sales declined 18.1%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 790 basis points. This strong guest loyalty and operational execution helped drive their outperformance, while they also benefited from their geographic footprint. In fact, same-restaurant sales were positive for the quarter in Georgia and Mississippi. Additionally, the LongHorn team made significant investments in food quality and operational simplicity, which led to improved productivity and better execution. They also took a number of steps to improve the overall digital guest experience. Off-premise sales grew by more than 240% representing 28% of total sales. Finally, LongHorn successfully opened two restaurants during the quarter. The brands in our Fine Dining segment are performing better than anticipated. While weekday sales continue to be impacted by reduction in business travel, conventions, and sporting events, we saw strong guest traffic on the weekends, and believe there will be additional demand as capacity restrictions begin to ease. And lastly, our Other Business segment also delivered strong operational improvement with segment profit margin of 12.8%. This was only 130 basis points below last year despite a 39% decline in same restaurant sales. Yard House's footprint in California is impacting same restaurant sales in this segment. Finally, I continue to be impressed by how our team members are responding to take care of our guests and each other. We know our people are our greatest competitive advantage, and I want to thank everyone of our team members. We are succeeding, thanks to your hard work and resilience. Now I'll turn it over to Rick. (Auidt End) Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. The encouraging trends and performance we experienced toward the end of the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Furthermore, the actions we took in response to COVID-19 to solidify our cash position, transform the business model, simplify operations, and strengthen the commitment of our team members, helped build a solid foundation for the future. These actions and our continued focus on pursuing profitable sales have resulted in strong first quarter performance that significantly exceeded our expectations. For the quarter total sales were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 28.4%. Same restaurant sales decreased 29%. Adjusted EBITDA was $185 million and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.56. Turning to the P&L, looking at food and beverage line, favorability from menu simplifications more than offset increased to go packaging costs. However, these inflations of over 7%, primarily impacting LongHorn, drove food and beverage expense 20 basis points higher than last year for the company. Restaurant labor were 20 basis points lower than last year with hourly labor as a percent of sales improving by over 350 basis points, driven by operational simplifications. This was mostly offset by deleverage in management labor. Restaurant expense included $10 million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to COVID-19 claims submitted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding this benefit we reduced restaurant expense per operating week by over 20% this quarter. For marketing we lowered absolute spending by over $40 million bringing marketing as a percent of sales to 1.9%, 130 basis points less than last year. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin was 17.8%, 20 basis points below last year, but particularly strong given the sales decline of 28%. General and administrative expenses were $10 million lower than last year as we effectively reduced expenses and right sized our support structure. Interest was $5 million higher than last year mostly related to the term loan that was outstanding for the majority of the quarter. And finally, our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 9%. All of this culminated in adjusted earnings after tax of $73 million, which exclude $48 million of performance adjusted expenses. These expenses were related to the voluntary early retirement incentive program and corporate restructuring completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Approximately $10 million of this expense is non-cash and the remaining will be cash outflows through Q2 of fiscal 2022. This restructuring resulted in a net 11% reduction in our workforce in the restaurant support center and field operations leadership positions. It is expected to save between $25 million and $30 million annually. We expect to see approximately three quarters of these savings throughout the remainder of fiscal 2021. Looking at our segment performance this quarter, despite a sales decline of 28%, Olive Garden increased segment profit margin by 110 basis points to 22.1%. This strong profitability was driven by simplified operations which reduced food and direct labor costs, as well as reduced marketing spending. LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining and the Other Business segment delivered strong positive segment profit margins of 15.1%, 11.9%, and 12.8% respectively, despite the significant sales decline experienced in the quarter. These brands also benefited from simplified operations keeping segment profit margin at these levels. In the first quarter 68% of our restaurants operated with at least partial dining room capacity for the entire quarter. These restaurants had average weekly sales per restaurant of $69,000 and a same restaurant sales decline of 21.9%. And while Olive Garden and the Fine Dining segment had fewer dining rooms open than our average, these restaurants had the highest average weekly sales per restaurant of almost $76,000 and $90,000 respectively. At the start of the second quarter, we had approximately 91% of our restaurants with dining rooms open operating in at least limited capacity. Now turning to our liquidity and other matters. During the quarter, as we saw steadily improving weekly cash flows we gained confidence in our estimated cash flow ranges. We fully repaid the $270 million term loan took out in April. We ended the first quarter with $655 million in cash and another $750 million available in our untapped credit facility, giving us over $1.4 million of available liquidity. We generated over $160 million of free cash flow in the quarter and improved our adjusted debt to adjusted capital to 59% at the end of the quarter, well within our debt covenant of below 75%. Given our strong liquidity position, improvements in our business model, and better visibility into cash flow projections, our Board reinstituted a quarterly dividend. The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share. This dividend represents 53% of our first quarter adjusted earnings after tax within our long-term framework for value creation. We will continue to have regular discussions with the Board on our future dividend policy. Our first quarter results were significantly better than we anticipated. The actions we took to simplify menus and operating procedures, and capture other cost savings, along with our choice to pursue profitable sales, have yielded strong results. And now with a full quarter operating under this environment, we have even better visibility into our business model. For the second quarter we expect total sales of approximately 82% of prior year, including approximately 100 basis points of headwind due to the Thanksgiving holiday moving back into the second fiscal quarter this year. We anticipate EBITDA between $200 million and $215 million and diluted net earnings per share between $0.65 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 131 million shares. In this environment we continue to focus on building absolute sales volumes week-to-week and quarter-to-quarter. This may result in variability and sales comparison to last year as capacity constraints lead to less seasonality than we would have experienced historically. Said another way, if capacity and social distancing restrictions remain similar to where they are today, it will be challenging to dramatically increase our on-premise average in volumes. Our second quarter is typically our lowest averaging in volume quarter and our third quarter is typically our highest. Additionally, as capacity restrictions ease and sales normalize, we will be able to reinvest to drive the top line and a better overall guest experience. One last point before we take your questions. Based on our strong business model enhancements, we now think we can get to pre-COVID EBITDA dollars and approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales while still making appropriate investments in our business. And with that, we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Your line is open. Andrew Strelzik : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. In the press release, you mentioned on the execution that it was better than expected. I'm curious if you could just kind of dig in a little bit there more specifically either by brand or by cost bucket? And subsequently, how sustainable are some of the cost improvements if you could maybe give a sense for how much better you think margins could be if you were to get back to say 100% of the prior sales? Gene Lee : I'll take the execution part, and I'll let Rick talk about the margin piece. I think a lot of our execution is coming from the streamlined menus. And our ability to put out products with increased frequency of that product is helping our execution and our team members are becoming much better at doing that. When you limit your menu and you focus on key products, the quality of that product just continues to go up. And I also think it transcends itself into the dining rooms. And I think today, we've gotten used to the complexity of operating with the COVID requirements, and every day I think we're running better and better restaurants. Rick, do you want to talk about the margins? Rick Cardenas : Yes, hey Andrew. I'm going to start with the 90% number that we gave a second ago. We have made improvements in our cost structure as Gene has mentioned and significantly improved our business model. As sales improve, remember we assume that some of these costs will come back, but not all of them. The 90% contemplates some costs returning along with continued reinvestments. And while the 90% sales level may change depending on the competitive environment and the economic backdrop, now I will say that if we get to 100% and we make some investments as we've been talking about, we could see margins improve by 100 basis points, maybe even 150, but again that depends on the economic backdrop, the competitive environment, and what do we have to do to get to that 100%. So, I wouldn't tie in the 100% to 150%, but I would at least get into the 90% based on our EBITDA, I'm sorry getting our EBITDA back based on 90% of sales. Andrew Strelzik : Okay, great. And if I could just squeeze one more in, I'm just curious if you think you've seen at all any impact from stimulus tapering off, if you've seen that or any other kind of regional or daypart differences that you have also seen if you can comment on that it would be great? Thanks. Gene Lee : No, we've seen no falloff with the stimulus. Actually, we're seeing average weekly sales across the system improve every single week. So, we're feeling pretty good about that. So, we\u2019re seeing some restrictions be eased throughout the country, so really nothing from a regionality standpoint. I think you've just got to look at the mobility index and you've got to follow what's happening with restrictions, and you can see guest traffic move along with that. Andrew Strelzik : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is open. Andrew Barish : Yes, hey guys, just wondering on the kind of comments on on-premise dining and sort of driving same-store sales performance from here. What would it take to from a capacity constraint perspective help that number? Can you do more booth partitions and just the impact of seasonality starting with the outdoor patio business as well, just trying to find a level set on all those areas? Gene Lee : Let me work backwards to your question, outdoor capacity is really de minimis for us overall as the system. The good news is that we haven\u2019t really been able to use a lot of our outdoor capacity in Florida, it has been raining every single day here for the last six weeks. So we're going to start getting that back. As we lose outdoor capacity up north, we will pick up a lot more in Florida than we've been able to use. So, for that when we think about outdoor capacity, it is really not that meaningful for us. As far as what's going to drive in the short term, some more same restaurant sales is additional capacity. We need to get California back. We need some other areas to increase their capacity from 25% to 50%. Once you get past 50% as long as the six-foot rule is in place, you still are not going to really be able to max out your dining rooms. In some areas we're getting our bar tops back which are important, gives us more capacity inside the restaurant. And so, I think it really comes down to just the incremental improvements in the capacity levels. We're going to probably continue to roll out booth partitions, we\u2019ll probably close to double what we have right now and that gives us six to seven extra tables per restaurant in the jurisdictions that allow us to do that, and not every jurisdiction allows us to do that. I think that our teams are being very respectful of the requirements in their operating environment, and we're trying to create first and foremost a safe environment for our team members and our guests, and we're not trying to push same restaurant sales and risk that experience for our team members and guests. So, I would look at getting California back is big in Olive Garden. We've got 100 restaurants there. Andrew Barish : Okay, and just a quick followup for Rick if you could. I mean the same-store sales and the total sales gap in the 1Q were basically on top of each other. The 18% reduction in total sales, is there a same-store sales analog for the 2Q we can kind of point to in terms of a gap? Rick Cardenas : Yes, it is pretty close. It is not like we have a lot of new restaurants coming into play, so it is within a 100 basis points. Andrew Barish : Okay, thank you very much. Kevin Kalicak : Marcella, we are ready for our next question. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Nicole Miller Regan : Thank you and good morning. When I look back to Slide 16 of the presentation, can you speak to the capacity in the first quarter? What was the average and was it higher or lower as you exit the quarter because that can help us kind of inform and understand the capacity in 2Q? I know 90%, 91% are open, but I am wondering what kind of capacity mandates or restrictions you are dealing with? Gene Lee : Well, most of the capacity restrictions are around the 50% range, 50% capacity, some are 100% but if you average out our company, when you take the six foot rule, et cetera, we're probably at the 50% capacity range even at the end of the quarter. Nicole Miller Regan : Okay, okay, super. And then it is not lost on us when you talk about the back to basics and I think there is obviously no one better than your team efforts and it is a power to teams. So if you think about roles and the functions for me like six feet office rule comes to mind. How are you really resourcing your team to be effective right now? Can you give us some concrete examples? Gene Lee : I think our engagement with our team members goes all the way back to the beginning of COVID, I mean it actually goes beyond that, but I think how we held the situation with emergency pay and taking care and thinking of our people and staying engaged with them and paying their benefits. We invested over $100 million in that short period of time into our team members. So bringing them back to work has been fairly easy for us. And I think our team members are really engaged in what they are doing. And so, and we've got this strong culture for a long time. And our team member retention is better than ever which is really exciting to see. I mean I'm looking at retention numbers for our team members that I'd never thought I would see in this industry. I've been working in this industry for over 30 years. I've never seen retention like this which gives us the ability to execute it at the highest level. And as we bring people back to work or bring them back, our most productive and our most dedicated team members. So I think the spirit is high in our restaurant. I think people are excited to be out there, they're making money. I think they're bringing happiness to people that come into our restaurants and I think that energy is \u2013 in this very difficult time in transferring between the guest and the team member, and I'm in the restaurants every day, and I'm in one of our restaurants most every day, sometimes twice a day. I would tell you that, the attitude is just absolutely fantastic and our team members are doing a great job. Nicole Miller Regan : Thanks, I appreciate the commentary. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian your line is open. Brian Bittner : Sorry, I was on mute. Good morning guys. When you talk about getting back to pre-COVID EBITDA levels on 90% of sales, can you just talk about your working assumption on that relative to G&A versus pre-COVID in restaurant level profits versus pre-COVID? Gene Lee : Well, Brian, I think on the G&A side, we talked about the voluntary emergency, I'm sorry voluntary early retirement program, and that's going to save us $25 million to $30 million a year on a rolling basis. And we would we would expect G&A to start coming back up as we start getting travel et cetera. We didn't do a whole lot of travel in the first quarter, but most of our investments will be back in the restaurant as you think about marketing spend and labor and other things. So I would say that if you look at what we say in the 90% range, most of our investment will be back in the restaurant. Our G&A, we would hope, our G&A would be at least below 5% for the foreseeable future. Brian Bittner : Okay. And would you describe all of the LongHorn's outperformance relative to Olive Garden, is that all due to geographical mix in the six feet rule, or is there anything else that you'd point out as it relates to LongHorn's performance relative to Olive Garden? Gene Lee : I think the majority of it is geographic and I think the brand strength in Georgia has been incredibly impressive. And I think that it's just a market where there's a lot of loyalty to the brand. I think the market, Georgia, State of Georgia trusts LongHorn and I think people are going to where they're really comfortable. And so I do think that their consumer maybe a little bit better off economically. But I mean, their performance is impressive without a doubt, but it's being driven by Georgia, I mean it is being driven a lot by their footprint. Brian Bittner : Thanks Gene, and my last question just with Olive Garden, we talked a lot last earnings call about the capacity restraints related to the six feet rule. Is there anything else if we stay in this environment for a while moving forward, is there anything you are doing to improve the capacity based on the seating configuration within that six feet rule that we should know about? Gene Lee : Well, I think we can see that temporary barriers, I think, the team continues to look at how do you, can you move a few tables in the dining room to improve the overall capacity. So I think they continue to try to modify that. I think the thing when you think about Olive Garden is focused on the absolute volumes. You know it is $75,000 a week, these are these are healthy, healthy businesses. And the off-premise business continues to thrive, which is a place that we're going to. We start putting some marketing money back into that business. It will be focused on trying to drive off-premise not in-premise. We continue to evaluate what's the best way to go with that investment spend, when is the right time to use it? And so, the other thing I would tell you is that, it can probably be hard for you to believe, but we have one restaurant that cost us 50 basis points in comps. That's the Times Square Olive Garden and we start every single week $300,000 in the hole from a comp store basis. We are going to get 25% capacity back in Times Square on the 30th, but that's -- you wake up every day and you are $300,000 short just in that one restaurant. That's our best restaurant in the Olive Garden system. We do $50 million there, and now we're doing, $2500 a day. And so, we've got some odd ball things. Getting California back is going to be huge. California is a big market for us with high volumes. We have a higher check average and we can see because we're starting to get some counties back, and we can see the impact on that on a daily weekly basis. Brian Bittner : Thanks Gene. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Andrew Charles : Great, thanks. Question for Rick and a question for Gene. Rick the sales levels in labor line was quite impressive during the quarter. I was curious how would you categorize what you view as permanent savings from the shift to online pickup and more streamlined kitchen operations and efficiencies versus maybe some of the temporary improvements that will persist in 2Q from volumes that are below peak? And then, Gene, you kind of talked a little about it, just did it head on, the hundred partitions that were implemented last quarter to improve seating capacity, I think you said you doubled it, but curious, what has been the learnings there? How would that help? Is that a key unlock for you in terms of where we are in this -- in the reopening, or is that just something that's just a small tool? Thanks. Gene Lee : Okay Andrew. On the labor line, remember we've got two components of labor, one is the hourly labor, which is where we saw a lot of efficiencies, and the other one is the management labor, which is more fixed in nature. We would expect the hourly labor to not be as favorable going forward, just because of training expenses. We didn't have as much training in the first quarter, and we'll continue to, we're going to start having some training in Q2 and beyond. But as our sales pick up, our management labor should be leveraged a little bit more than it was before. So, I think there was a question earlier on whether it get to at 100%, and that 100 and 150 basis point improvement will mostly come out of labor and some cost of sales. Rick Cardenas : Yes Andrew, on the partitions, depending on the restaurant foot layout, you're going to get six to eight more tables, and you know most of those will be four tops and the average party is 2.3. So I mean, I wouldn't say it's not de minimis, but sounds meaningful. I mean, you're getting, especially on the weekends you're getting another two seatings on those tables. So every little bit helps, because we have the demand for those tables, but it's not going to it's not going to move the top-line significantly. Andrew Charles : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Eric Gonzalez : Hey, thanks, good morning. Just on the promotional schedule, I think that I think we're all sad to see that may be never any possible is not being run this year and I'm just curious. You know what needs to happen from a capacity standpoint, restriction standpoint for that promotion to make sense, and there are limited that whether it be 25%, 50%, or 75% worth of diners reopened where it makes sense to have traffic driving promotions at that one. And then like later in the year is that a lever that you can pull and bring it back to drive people to the restaurants? Gene Lee : Yes, I think on those high volume, high traffic promotions, we're going to feel, we have to feel comfortable that we got pretty much 100% capacity unless the promotion, we are speaking about promotions that drive the off-premise and drive off-promise experience. When I think about marketing, and the team thinks about marketing, I think that we want to try to get far along as we possibly can through this crisis or cycle, and then fully understand what the competitive set is going to be, what the economic backdrop is going to be, and then we'll figure out how to appropriately layer back in all our promotional, marketing and promotional activity and our incentives. We think we can layer those back in smarter and more effective than we had them in the system before, and this is a terrible thing that we're going through, but we're trying to find, okay we're trying to find the positives in this to really rethink, and rethink how we go to market with our businesses. And this is fortunately once in a lifetime option to be able to do things that we probably couldn't do, where we were pre-COVID. So you know, I think long term, we're going to look at the situation and we'll decide when we layer in our best promotional options, and we may have to re-imagine and revisit some of those promotional options to our guests so that we can maybe do it at a higher margin rate, but we have lots of questions and a lot of work to do around that. Eric Gonzalez : That's really helpful. And then you mentioned in your remarks earlier that the off-premise mix was a moving target. Can you really dig into that a little bit more, and talk about what sort of the cannibalization rate looks like as dining was reopened, or maybe what happens when restrictions are put back in place? Gene Lee : There's nothing concrete there, because each market is behaving differently. And so, when you see restrictions change, and maybe your capacity goes from 25 to 50 in certain markets that volume just switches from off-premise to on-premise, in other markets it doesn't. It depends on what's happening. We believe there's a good percentage of our off-premise today is being generated by people coming to the restaurant that can't get in, because the wait is too long, and there's no place to wait inside our restaurants. And so we think that those people have a tendency to just opt into the off-premise experience. So we really can't quantify that for you, because every market is different. Eric Gonzalez : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird, your line is open. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. I have two questions. First, on the second quarter guidance, I just wanted to clarify, the guidance on the top line, is that similar to how you're running quarter-to-date or are you expecting to see further improvement as states like California start to open up? Rick Cardenas : Yes David, our guidance first for sales for Q2, remember it incorporates a 100 basis point headwind for Thanksgiving. So we are running a little bit better than that quarter-to-date, but not by much. And so we do anticipate an increase of about 10% of average weekly sales from quarter one. It doesn't contemplate any significant change in capacity restrictions, other than the ones that we already know, other than the ones that have already been approved. But it also doesn't contemplate any significant change in sales due to a second wave or a vaccine approval. So that we thought 82% was fairly prudent, it's slightly low where we are running today, but it does take into effect the 100 basis point swing from Thanksgiving. David Tarantino : Great, thank you for that. And then Gene, I was wondering, just philosophically how you think about what Darden might look like as we exit the pandemic, and I guess what I'm specifically wondering is, is it your goal to drive the sales volumes back to 100% of where you were before the pandemic or do you think you'd take less sales with a better simpler operating model that's easier to execute? Gene Lee : I would take, I want both, I want a simple operating model, and I want higher sales, and I think that we're setting up for that, because I think there's a few dynamics that are in our favor. Number one, there's definitely been a capacity, there'll be capacity coming out of the system and we believe that we're well positioned to take share. And we think that this simplified operations will help us improve execution we will get better throughput and so we think there's a pathway to both, higher sales and better margins. I think our teams have done an incredible job of reimagining almost every aspect of their business through this. And I see a pathway to get there. I think Rick is bringing you back to the 90% only as a way to communicate where we think margins are going to be at a future sales level. We're not setting a target saying that we'd be happy with that. We see a pathway for our sales to get above that and we see a pathway for our margins to be above pre-COVID levels at that time. David Tarantino : That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open. Jeff Bernstein : Great, thank you very much. One followup and then a separate question, the follow up just on the comments you made a moment ago regarding your guidance for fiscal 2Q does not assume any second wave of re-infection. I'm just wondering, as you think about it in the short term, what are you seeing with comps in markets where there are spikes in infection rates, whether you see a step back or whether you see capacity pullback? I'm trying to get a sense for the worst case scenario if we were to see a second spike in terms of what you're seeing thus far, or what learnings you've had? And then I had one follow up. Gene Lee : So, as you know so far Jeff, we have seen no change in demand based on COVID levels in a market, unless capacity restrictions change. So, if you're example we're in South Florida, when we had the spike after the 4th of July, and the restaurant restrictions were very limited, we definitely saw demand drop, but that was not because of the consumer, it was more because of the restrictions the local municipalities put on us. We see a pretty resilient consumer out there. I know that's hard for you guys in New York to imagine, but the rest of the country is not operating that way. And so, I would tell you that what we're seeing is, it's all being controlled by the local municipalities, that they're managing demand more than the consumer. Jeff Bernstein : Interesting. And then the other question was just on the, I think you alluded to it earlier in terms of what the industry is going to look like and capacity going forward. So I'm just wondering I just think about the independents and the crisis, we are all going through, but what are you seeing thus far in terms of, I guess you'd call it permanent closures or the impact you see for the industry going forward maybe the supply demand imbalance, or whether it's real estate availability, or market share opportunity, just trying to get a bigger picture thought on what you're seeing thus far for the outlook for primarily the independents? Gene Lee : Well, I think the independents obviously have a tough time right, and as we think about it we think somewhere between 5% and 15% of capacity will come out of the system during this, maybe a little bit more but a lot of people will get recapitalized quickly and get some of these boxes back open. Obviously that that's going to benefit us in the short term and in the long term. As far as real estate so far has been one of the things that, my hypothesis has been, I've been a little bit off on. We've yet to see a meaningful change and what we can acquire real estate, I thought that being one of the only bidders out there, that we would see the costs come down. I think we're still going through the price discovery process on that and we'll see how that plays out long term. I've got to believe that we will benefit from availability and hopefully price. Availability is already there. It's just trying to get through what we think the property's worth versus what the REIT or the landlord thinks the property is worth. And so that will have some impact and help us grow, get to our 2% to 3% new unit growth over time. Jeff Bernstein : Thanks Gene, I appreciate the color. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass : Thank you and good morning. One of the biggest -- two of the biggest shifts I guess during COVID right has been this growth in the off-premise business across the industry, and second has just been the pickup and delivery, not delivery, but the digital business overall. So can you first just talk about the off-premise business? How do you think you need to, or do you need to change the format of the restaurant, or some other sort of structural change that you think that can facilitate a better off-premise experience or is what you're doing kind of working and the operational changes are working or do you think there's more sort of either pickup windows or some other permanent changes to the way the restaurants are structured to facilitate that? Gene Lee : That's a good question John. I think that, going into this that we did the majority of our pickup with someone coming into the restaurant and picking up the food. We set up our process, because we believed and we proved out that accuracy and on time were the two most important things that the off-premise consumer wanted. Through this we had to go to a different experience which was when we moved very, very quickly to curbside. And we what we've learned through this is that curbside is a better option, and that the burden of on time and accurate needs to get on us and we need to have better systems to be able to deliver the same level of accuracy that we were delivering in pre-COVID. And what that means is, in one of our restaurants we are on a path to build better capabilities to handle the in-restaurant pick up. And now, as we pivoted to curbside the capabilities that we need to build inside are different. The good news is that they're cheaper because they're really not consumer facing. And so it will cost us a little bit less to be able to create those capabilities. But technology and when the expectation of the consumer is for a curbside experience. And when the expectation of the consumer is for a curbside experience, and we've taken a lot of friction out of that experience over the last 12 weeks, and we're in the middle of really rolling out some technology today to really make that experience a whole lot better. As just about notification when you're in our parking lot, versus we had a very manual procedure that we had to implement in the beginning of this. And eventually, we'll get the geofencing, and we'll catch up to what some of the bigger retail retailers are doing. So we actually think that there's a big benefit in this consumer shift, because we're going to take all these people that were in our dining room -- in our front door, picking up food, and they'll never enter our business -- building again, which makes it a better experience for our dining guests. So that's really the big change, John that for that has to happen. And right now we have the benefit of some of our -- have any extra space inside our restaurant that enables us to stage some of this off-premise work. But as we gain more capacity, we will need to modify some spaces. And actually add some like in a long home we'll have to bump out of the side of the building to be able to handle this extra demand. But I see it as all positive. We think, we can do curbside much more cost effectively than we can do picking up the food inside the restaurant. John Glass : Thanks for that. And then just thinking of in a second read on digital. So you've got a significant amount of growth in the digital business, particularly on the To Go business. What have you learned from that? Is this -- is this a gate -- are these different consumers for example? Do you think about now your promotional mark \u2013 your marketing spend differently because digital has just grown so significantly as a channel. And I am also curious to hear just your view on other brands have decided to use digital in various ways through delivery as a way to expand the restaurant into other brands, adding products, adding new brands, that specific to a category that doesn't relate to their existing brand. Is that a viable path for Darden? Gene Lee : So there's two questions in there John, and I'll get to the virtual brand in a second. The first question is, obviously the data is richer when we're capturing the data from our digital guest, which feeds into our huge database on our ability to market to them. So we can figure out to that, and through our tokens that these are, these are dying, our off-premise guests only. Then we can tell all our marketing towards that guest and towards that experience. We understand what they are buying, and what they want to buy. And so we can get smarter with that. We're pretty smart. Prior to this, we just have more information today, and we'll be able to -- our data scientists will be able to use that and market effectively. Let me just pivot to virtual brands, I'm shocked that it took this long to come up. But only give you my take my take on this. Everybody around the room is very nervous right now. But, I think people are in different places, and they're trying to approach this and deal with this moment in time differently. For us, this is not the right approach, we want to focus on brands that we've got 20 plus years and hundreds of millions of dollars invested in trying to build, and we want to make sure that they're executing at a high level. I think brands are going to matter. And I don't think you can -- I think brands are developed over a long period of time, around delivering a promise to a consistent promise to a consumer. I think you have to have a functional need and emotional need. And I think that's what I think that's what our brand builders have done for decades. And to get out on a digital platform and try to do that, I think people got to try to do what they want to do. I'm not -- I'm not saying it's a good idea or a bad idea. It's not for us. Brands are going to matter, and we think it's a distraction. John Glass : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is open. Dennis Geiger : Great, thanks. Gene, wondering if you could talk about where sort of customer satisfaction scores are at the moment, I think you might have alluded to it earlier, but kind of just based on some of the technology, the other friction reducing initiatives and maybe some of the other customer experience investments that you spoke to, if you if you're getting credit for that, if you've seen a notable increase there and kind of to some extent, how that's driving some of some of your go-forward thoughts on, on share gains, etcetera. That\u2019s question one. Gene Lee : I'll be very, very clear. Our guest satisfaction scores are improving dramatically. I want to -- I want to put some context around that, which is, what we don't understand is, is it just the consumer expectations are maybe different to this experience. So we're happy directionally where they're going. And we're happy directly where they're going compared to our competitors. But at the same time, we will -- we were not, patting ourselves on the back too much, because this is definitely a different environment and the consumer feedback is there is different. So we don't know what the expectations are, but we are very pleased directionally where we're heading with our own internal and in some of the industry stuff that we're seeing and how we're comparing to competitors. Dennis Geiger : Got it. And just kind of as a follow up to that, no, it's not the biggest needle mover right now. But just as it relates to, to Cheddar\u2019s and kind of any improvements that you've been able to make in this environment, and whether that's resonating, just curious if you could, if you could speak to that at all and more broadly if the current environment at all has and emerging from the current environment and your thoughts there, if that changes at all, how you're thinking about future M&A strategy in anyway, if you're able to speak to that? Thank you. Gene Lee : You guys are getting really good at getting multiple questions in one question. Let's talk about Cheddar\u2019s first, and I'll come back to thoughts on M&A. Cheddar\u2019s is from a business model standpoint, Cheddar\u2019s has had the biggest transformation. The work that John Wilkerson and his team have done, it's been transformative. And I couldn't be more excited about directionally where they're heading. Tactically, one of the biggest changes, and one of the one of the things that we had to really speed up was off-premise capabilities. We had very -- we had very, limited capabilities going to COVID. We only had two phone lines going into most of our restaurants. We couldn't -- we couldn't even take the demand over the phone. We didn't have online ordering. So the team rallied and this was supposed to be an initiative that was going to go all the way through fiscal 2021, really wasn't supposed to be fully operational at 2022. They got together and they've been able to real quickly upgraded their phone lines, they have four phone lines coming in and we now have online ordering, new packaging\u2019s being rolled out as we're speaking. And they developed a native app that actually getting some pretty good adoption. And so that piece of it is been really exciting that they've been able to move as quickly as they possibly can. Their in-restaurant dining is held strong, they still don't have a huge robust off-premise business, but we need to build that. It wasn't something that people thought of Cheddar\u2019s for, but we think there's a big opportunity there. So, I'm thrilled directionally with what they're doing and the transformation they have made in their business model. Just briefly on M&A, there's nothing new to report here. We continue to evaluate opportunities and discuss with our board. We are very happy with our current portfolio. And we believe, that we can achieve our growth targets and our value creation metrics with the portfolio that we have. We believe there is a great opportunity for all our brands. Dennis Geiger : Thanks, Gene. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chris Carroll from RBC. Your line is open. Christopher Carroll : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. So I just wanted to circle back to margins, and specifically an Olive Garden. So the margins at Olive Garden were particularly impressive this quarter despite the sales decline. So how are you thinking about the margins for that brand longer term? Obviously, as a marketing and potential reinvestment spend builds, that will create drag, but how much of the savings that you found, do you think you can hold on to? Rick Cardenas : Chris, as we mentioned, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 100 basis points better than last year? We've got a pretty good improvement in cost of sales, partly because of the question that was asked earlier about; about never any possible that actually drags a little bit margin for us. So cost of sales a little bit better. We improved our food waste significantly because of the operational changes that we've made. That said, a 22% margin on the sales levels they have. We're going to start reinvesting eventually. We've got marketing that was down about $20 million year-over-year for Olive Garden. And as capacity starts to come back online as Gene mentioned, we will look at our promotional cadence and our marketing cadence. But 22% is a pretty strong margin. So I wouldn't anticipate us significantly getting better than that, as we continue to reinvest to get back to a point of getting back over 100% of our sales. Our goal is to drive our sales profitably and we have enough room to invest to drive those sales profitably. Christopher Carroll : Thanks. And then Rick, in the estimate of recapturing pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at 90% of pre-COVID sales, how does off-premise versus on-premise mix factor into that estimate? Does that contemplate higher off-premise next versus pre-COVID levels? Rick Cardenas : It does contemplate higher off-premise missed and pre-COVID, but not significantly higher. I mean, as Gene mentioned, Cheddar\u2019s should be higher. Olive Garden should be higher, and LongHorn should be higher. But we're not going to be at 40% or 50% of sales premise when we've got full capacity dining rooms. As you -- as we open as Gene mentioned, as you -- as we open dining rooms, we start seeing that To Go business shift back into in restaurant, but we still are right now we're still retaining 60% of our peak premise sales. Christopher Carroll : Got it? Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore. Your line is open. David Palmer : Hi, good morning, how much? How much higher do you think To Go sales might be at your big two brands after the COVID crisis? And I'm wondering if you have any clues that you care to share in terms of informing that thinking such as these To Go sales being new customers? Or perhaps how that that off-premise mix fades, and they reopen states as your on-premise rebuilds. And I have a follow up. Rick Cardenas : Yes, David I might. And I've got no empirical evidence to support this. But my theory is that off -- once we open up the dining and say we get back to a normal environment, where we have concerts and revise going to football games and -- I actually think off-premise will dip down below where it was. I think there's going to be a huge surge for on-premise dining. I think people are tired of this experience. They are utilizing this experience right now. But when I talk to people, and we did some research, people want to get back out socialized. I do think, then it comes back, it comes back higher than where we were. I think our thought processes, it's a little bit higher, but not terribly higher, and it will continue to grow over time as it has been. But I don't think that this is some big change that we're going to wake up in Olive Garden and be doing 35% off-premise, if we're going to concerts and having football games. David Palmer : Wow, that's interesting take. I wonder just on the -- on and how you communicate with consumers. You've obviously made a lot more connectivity with digitally with those consumers. Are you going to advertise less on TV after this is all over? Is this a source of margin leverage for you going forward? Gene Lee : I think that we have to go back and go back to what I\u2019d said earlier. We have to understand what the competitive set is. We have to understand what the economic backdrop is. We'll have to analyze how well we can get to our consumer through television. We still believe that we can do that. We participate and we\u2019re still participating in the upfront. We think it's a good mechanism for us. And that's part of our skill benefit with Olive Garden. Right? We can advertise on a national platform. And we have some -- we have some efficiencies. And I think that we will still use that in the near term. But it will all depend on what the competitive set is and the economic backdrop. If we pull enough restaurants out, we may not have to advertise for a while. David Palmer : Yes. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, guys. Good morning. This is Patrick [ph] on for Chris. I know you spoke briefly, briefly to lapping seasonal increases that really begin after this coming quarter. But I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on just your base case thinking currently on how that plays out and what you're expecting to see based on customer behaviour that you see today. And the capacity constraints that are in place and what levers do you think you can pull if you do see a much more muted seasonality and average weekly sales as you move into the back half of the year. And then I had one follow up. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Patrick. I'll start with -- we've shown week-to-week, we're continuing to build our average weekly sales. And as I mentioned earlier, Q2 is our lowest seasonal quarter and Q3 is our highest, so it does take a lot of increase in average weekly sales to get to the same comp level Q3 as Q2. But what we are going to do and what we continue to do is evaluate the situation. As restaurants open, as dining room capacity is open. I mean as Gene mentioned, if dining room capacity don't continue to expand, we still have some levers to pull in the off-premise side. So that's what we will do, we will continue to advertise off-premise if it's what we need to do to continue to build sales. But as long as we do that profitably, our intention is to grow our sales profitably from where we are today. And so that's what we'll do. We'll continue to focus on off-premise. Now, if dining rooms can reopen completely, we should see an increase in sales. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful. Thanks. And forgive me if I missed this, but it sounds like menu simplification is, it sounded relatively permanent. And so I was wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on exactly, the margin improvement you're seeing from that initiative in particular? And then how do we think about, as sales normalize moving, moving forward a little farther into the future, should we expect to see some adding back to the menu and some additional complexity come back on? Or is this something you're thinking of is completely permanent, even as sales normalized? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Well, the biggest driver of the cost savings is waste. And that in that the touch Menu that's lacking promotional activity, there's some other things that are influencing that. I think that the challenge for the teams is if they need to add menu items, to fulfil a need, can they do that without adding complexity? I think they have to. I think, in their calculus prior to this, there wasn't enough weight put on the complexity of adding new menu items. So it wasn't enough. No one thought about that. I think today, that's part of the -- the part of the thought process is they think about adding something. How do we do this and make sure we maintain our productivity and don't increase our waste? So I think a better way to say that is, as we do menu developments, it\u2019s going through a better filter today, that I think will have a long longer -- have a long lasting impact on our ability to maintain these cost savings. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open. Peter Saleh : Great, thank you. Gene, can you just elaborate a little bit on where the cost savings are coming from for doing curbside versus in-store pickup? Is it cheaper labor? Or is it just less spent on CapEx in the store to build out the area for pickup, just trying to understand where the cost savings may be coming from? Gene Lee : Well, it's a technology that's creating it. It's no one, no one taken the answer on the phone. We're dropping, you know, the consumers letting us know whether when they're in the parking lot, and we're just dropping the bag in their car. So there's just a lot less, interaction there. Just think just, the cost is just purely productivity efficiency. Thinking about a line of five or six people at a desk, or at the bar top in a restaurant waiting to get To Go versus having someone just pull up to a car and put a bag in the trunk. That's where the efficiencies come and technology is enabling all that. Peter Saleh : Understood. Okay, and then just on fine -- on the fine dining segment. I think this quarter, you guys mentioned that the weekend, you saw strength, I think that was also similar to what you saw last quarter. Are you seeing any sort of change in consumer behaviour, in fine dining during the week? Or is it more of the same? Gene Lee : Well I think that, obviously we're missing the business travel and those types of dinners. So I mean, that was a big part of capital grow, and especially in your central business districts, you're always soft, and you're suburbia restaurant, during the week and you made up for on the weekends. I think we -- just another interesting titbit is that, look at capital growth comps, you're starting every week with over a million dollar shortfall just in the three restaurants in New York. We're doing 3000 bucks a day there with our 10 seats. Those restaurants do well over a million, a million dollars a week. And so, you just get this, just so much geographical differences in those businesses. We have some capital growth that\u2019s performing fairly well, especially in suburbia. But I'm confident as I see the sales volume on the weekends. I know we're turning away a lot of people and I know as soon as we can get a few more tables, we can continue to grow that business. And I'm confident that they're confident those businesses are going to be cash flow positive going forward. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. Jeff Farmer : Great. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions very quickly. So what level of sales from sales performance are you seeing in California? And if you don't want to get that specific, I'm just curious potentially what the headwind for Olive Garden consolidated, same store sales are related to the California partial closures? Rick Cardenas : Yes Jeff, for the quarter, we were down somewhere around 50% in California. Now remember, they were open for a little bit of time, and then they re-shut down. But we are seeing some pretty good unit volumes in California. And I was talking to Olive Garden more than more than any other brand. But and as Gene mentioned, Yard House is significantly impacted in California. But we were down. And if you take California out of Olive Garden, it's a 200 basis point swing for the quarter. Jeff Farmer : Okay. And then as a follow up, I think this was touched on earlier, but I asked you this in late June, and I believe you guys said there are about 10 to 15 restaurants that were posting positive, same store sales, even with that 50% capacity, restrict constraint in place, or limit in place. Where does that number stand now? Rick Cardenas : Yes, I would, what I would say is, instead of getting an individual restaurants; let's talk about a couple of states. I mean, Longhorn was positive in Georgia. The entire system was positive in Georgia for the quarter. We have a lot more restaurants that are positive now than we did going earlier. The last couple of weeks, it's been even better than that. So without getting an individual restaurants, we have it all contemplated in our guidance for Q2. And so I'd rather leave it at that. Jeff Farmer : Fine, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy from MKM Partners. Your line is open. Brett Levy : Thank you. Good morning, thanks for taking the call. When you think about the great job you're doing right now, in terms of managing the hourly labor. When you think about labor, just overall, what are you seeing in terms of inflation, your ability to hire, and also -- the integration of all of the different tests you've talked about? On the technology front, you've spent a lot of time talking about the customer facing, but what about on the operational side? And then just the managing of how you're balancing the in-store and the off-premise? Is it the same servers? Is it the other Front of House, you've heard, you've had one of your competitors talked about how the off-premise transaction is an hourly as opposed to attempt. So I'll stop there for now. Rick Cardenas : Well Brett, you got a lot in there \u2013 in that person. You got more, I can't wait. But let's talk about hiring. Hiring is very local. There are different pockets of the country that are more stressed than others. I will make a global comment, say I've been amazed at how, how well the hospitality workforce was absorbed into other areas during COVID. And so there hasn't been like, this still, there's still stress in that environment. We're still seeing, we still expect wages to rise somewhere between 3% and 5% for the year. As far as technology, technology goes, and the adaptation is so -- is easy today, right? And then we're doing that we haven't done it. We haven't focused a lot on improving technology in restaurant all of our stuffs really been, all of our efforts been focused on the consumer right now. We do have some -- we will get back to some projects that will modernize some of our tools in restaurant that'll hopefully help increase productivity. And as far as off-premise and we're using for off-premise for us are tipped employees. For more, they've got a higher average weight, but they do collect some gratuities on their service. Brett Levy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Lauren Silberman : Thank you. A follow up on your commentary regarding industry closures. Are you seeing any noticeable difference? Or do you expect to see any difference in the level of closures in states that reopened earlier? Or maybe urban versus suburban markets? And how has that been forming your future development pipeline? Rick Cardenas : Well, I think that the markets that have had the tightest restrictions are going to have the most closures. Because I think that's where, I think of some of these urban environments that just don't have the capitalism to hang on. I don't think it changes our development philosophy at all? I mean, I think good trader has a good trade areas. I mean we -- there's a lot of talk about migration out of some of the bigger cities, we'll see how that plays out. I think that, I think eventually we're going to have some really good opportunities to do some work in Manhattan as an example, I think that, it was very difficult from a cost standpoint, pre-COVID, to justify building more restaurants there. But I think post COVID, we might have, we might have some opportunities. So I don't think from a development standpoint, it has a tremendous amount of impact. We'll continue to look. We know where we have holes in each brand, from trade areas, and we're going to try to fill them. Lauren Silberman : Great. And you touched on this a bit, but with regards to fine dining brands, and maybe the Yard House as well. To what extent are these brands driven by tourism or large business conventions? And how are you thinking about that recovery? And do you need some of these exact exogenous factors just return to wholesale recapture? Rick Cardenas : Well absolutely. We got a bunch of Yard Houses tied to baseball stadiums and football stadiums, and LA LIVE is our best Yard House in the system. And that's been decimated because of what's happening with sporting events. So yes, there's a lot, there's a few of our brands that, a few of our restaurants that are tied to that, and they'll come back. I'm a big believer that, we're going get back to normal, it\u2019s going to be great restaurants. But for the time being, we just have to run them as efficiently as we possibly can, and do the best we can with what we have. Lauren Silberman : Thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from the line of James Rutherford from Stephens. Your line is open. James Rutherford : Hey, thanks for getting me in here. So quick question on the capacity bottlenecks at Olive Garden specifically? And it seems like it would be key to drive traffic at non-peak times and certain there's things you're doing around that. But are there any kinds of incentives you can do to bring people in during those shoulder periods? Or is it a situation where you're really fully utilizing that capacity already during the off periods as well? Rick Cardenas : No. I mean, I think that's something we face, pre-COVID with how do you how do you increase your capacity at certain down times of the day? I think that's, I think that's high, higher to high activity, exercise with very low payout. I think that one of the important things about a restaurant is that downtime to help you prepare for the break between lunch and dinner is important. So you can get ready for dinner. I mean, it's there's parts of us we have cycles in our business, and they're important. I think we would, I think that we've been very disciplined has process to make sure that we're not chasing, what I would call this low return activity. And so I don't -- I don't think there's a whole lot there. I do think that what happens is as your business starts to improve, especially midweek or early week is that your, your lunch last 15 minutes longer your dinner last, 15, 20 minutes longer. That's important. Trying to drive people into your restaurant, two o'clock 30 years, I found that to be a waste of time and money and effort. James Rutherford : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara Senatore : Thank you. I had sort of a related question on that and click on Cheddar\u2019s, but on the -- on the capacity I guess, as I think about 50% capacity across the system, that seems pretty standard for a lot of restaurants and I appreciate California's basis points. You know, how should I think about 50% capacity per se and all of our endorses [ph] may be competitors, I guess if it\u2019s all [technical difficulty]. You have been more capacity then mercy other competition. I don't know if any numbers about that. And then I guess I\u2019ll just have a quick follow up on centers, please. Rick Cardenas : Hey Sarah you were breaking up quite a bit. So let me see if I get the gist of your question. I think it was about the you know most restaurants are at this 50% capacity level. But how does that impact Olive Garden versus competitors. And I think the way I would, I would frame it is just average unit volumes. Olive Garden last year was probably using a lot more of it\u2019s capacity then some of our competitors were using it at that time last year. And so as we think about AUVs and think about the comp differential, maybe even between nap track, we think that some of the some of the impact is that while we're at 50% capacity today, and we were at 100% capacity last year, we were using much more of our capacity maybe than someone else. I think that was the gist of your question, but it was really hard to hard to hear. And if I think you also had a question on Cheddar\u2019s? Sara Senatore : Yes. That was actually exactly my question. I -- but I wasn't sure if you had any sense of what the average capacity might look like through the industry, just to help us sort of think through that. But the real question on Cheddar\u2019s is, you talked about off-premise. I have been sort of slow at that time. I think we were starting to see some improvement in comps and then this pandemic hit. Could you talk a little bit about any kind of metrics, and maybe in particular, I think that's where you've seen a lot. Is there any sense of kind of quantify [Indiscernible]? Just, just a little bit more color on that? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Sarah. Broken up again, but I think I caught most of it until the end. I think you were asking about the impact for Cheddar\u2019s and how we've improved margins that Cheddar\u2019s versus maybe the rest? And Gene mentioned. I think that was your question. So Gene mentioned that Cheddar\u2019s has had the biggest transformation in our business model. On an hourly labor basis that we said, we had about 350 basis points for Darden and proven an hourly labor, Cheddar\u2019s was close to three times that. And so it was a very big improvement at Cheddar\u2019s in their margin structure because of the simplification they did, and the work they've done. And the fact that they went from maybe less than 5% To Go sales to over 20 in a short period of time. And we think we'll continue to build that To Go volume. But Cheddar\u2019s did make the biggest transformation in their margin structure. And we think a lot of that will stick. Sara Senatore : Right. Your [indiscernible] mumbled question. So thank you very much. Rick Cardenas : I have triplets. I've interpreted mumbles a lot of time. Sara Senatore : You should talk to my four year old -- probably do better than I do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is open. Gregory Francfort : Hey, thanks. Thanks for sneaking me in. The question I had was back on the margin is probably for Rick. I think you've talked in the past about margins at Olive Garden above 20% at the level at which you reinvest and I think you were there, right around there pre-COVID. And so as you think about the 100 to 150 basis points of margin upside. Is that going to be spread relatively similarly across brands? Or I mean, do you think it gets overweight to the LongHorn and other businesses just given where the segment margins were pre-COVID? Thank you very much. Rick Cardenas : Greg. Yes, I think it overweighs to other brands. I mean, we'll -- we should still see a little bit of margin prune at Olive Garden, just because the environments very different today than it was pre-COVID. And I think a lot of brands are out there, improving their margins in some way, shape, or form with simplification. And we just want to make sure our gap to the rest of the industry doesn't grow significantly. But we do believe that Olive Garden will see a little bit of margin improvement from where they were before. We just think that the improvement will come even greater in some of our other brands, Cheddar\u2019s and some of our other brands in the other segment. Gregory Francfort : Thanks for the sauce. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. And Gene, your answer to David Palmer's questions on off-premise I think it's going to be like one of the great discussed topics, probably of this month. So thank you for that. The question got to that Thank you. LongHorn is helpful for all of us. It's -- I would imagine it's nearly impossible to get a staffing model right. Just kind of anticipating how customers are going to come back what have you, especially with men of labor hours that you took out of the store. I just wanted to see like how honed in that model actually is me what do you kind of seeing in terms of the variations of margins relative to you having too much labor at any point in time, too can imagine too little labor. At any point in time where you've got you're just not after the amount of customers that for whatever reason decided to come in at five o'clock on a Tuesday that maybe could have led to some longer cable times, that could have actually in some way actually impaired your ability to drive the traffic that you could have until that labor model gets more fine-tuned. Gene Lee : Yes, John, I think for Olive Garden because we're not doing a lot of outdoor dining. We don't have the capability there that business is a little bit easier to predict. We've been, the leadership of all of our businesses error on this side of more labor than less. And we're tracking number of servers per restaurant, per day trying to understand. As the business starts to grow, making sure that we have the appropriate staffing, where it gets more difficult as in some of the Yard Houses where we have some, a lot of outside dying, that that doesn't have any covers. And if it starts to rain, if it doesn't rain, I mean, that's where life gets a little bit more difficult for our operators. But I would say in the two big casual brands, they've gotten pretty good. And they need, what I would say a change in, in what's happening in the environment. In other words, if we go from 25% to 50%, that's going to change the flow of mix. That's going to change what's off-premise, on-premise. And it takes a few days to figure that out. But we're erring on the side. Believe it or not, I know our labor results are really strong, we're erring on the side of more labor, not less. John Ivankoe : Understood, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim Partners Your line is open. Matthew DiFrisco : Thank you so much. My question is with respect to Georgia, and the positive comps there. Can you I guess it sounds like you were saying the consumer obviously, we've known this for a while, the consumer is a little different than New York. However, is that also a byproduct of PPP sort of slowing down and having a lift? Or have we seen some closures happen there? I'm trying to get a picture of Georgia being a positive. Is it a positive market? Or is it just positive for Olive Garden and LongHorn? Or is the entire -- are dollars up for restaurant spending in the state of Georgia year-over-year? Or is it just a smaller pie and you've won consolidated a lot of that share? Thank you. Gene Lee : A couple things. First, first of all, the majority of the restaurants that are positive in Georgia are Longhorn, not Olive Garden. Olive Garden performed well in Georgia, but nowhere near what Olive Garden is, I mean, what LongHorn is. And LongHorn has had a strong footprint, and we got 45 restaurants in the city of Atlanta, where every three miles, we've got a restaurant. And we've always done extremely well there and the brand is, is loved there. So the brand strength there is fantastic. That's one component. The other component is that especially when you get 15 miles outside of the city, life is pretty is normal there. It's not pretty nice, it\u2019s normal there. And I landed Atlanta airport the other day, and not one person had a mask on. No, I was in a hotel, I stopped, I went up to a rooftop deck and it was too deep at a bar -- at the bar. I mean, so I mean, it's just a different life in Georgia. I know it's hard for you guys in New York, to even imagine that. But you still can't get around Georgia, there's so much traffic around the city of Atlanta. So in the city area, there's a little bit more, but I would tell you that, and I think if you look at other parts of the country in different states, behaviour is fairly normal. Rick Cardenas : So I guess that would be then the industry on a year-over-year basis also for or the peers, it seems like it's a rising tide. They just haven't taken as much of a dip down. Gene Lee : Well I think they haven\u2019t taken much dip down. But I think LongHorn is significantly outperforming most people in that market. And they always have John, I mean, they've always -- it's always been the core of that brand. And one of the thing remember, Georgia is one of the first to open, right. So they've been dealing with reopen for a long time, a lot longer than other states. So the longer a restaurant or a market is open, the more people start getting a little feeling a little bit more comfortable. Matthew DiFrisco : Okay, and just on that I mentioned PPP also. Can you guys talk about sort of what anywhere in or how, what your outlook is for the potential amount of seats maybe to leave the casual dining market. So say when we are in this time next year, how many seats might have exited? Rick Cardenas : You know what we're comfortable to believe in somewhere between 5% and 15%. I think there's some other industry folks saying more than that, but I think 5 to 15. I think you remember once a restaurant, it\u2019s a restaurant. A lot of these will get recapitalized in the next few years, but I definitely believe that we'll be competing against less competition on the other side of this crisis. Matthew DiFrisco : Excellent. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett from Truist Securities. Your line is open Jake Bartlett : Great, thanks for taking the questions. I had really had two quick ones. In the first, on the menu simplification, can you quantify how many less items for instance, that is just going to have a sensitivity as to the scale of the simplification? And then Gene, I'm not going to ask you about third party delivery. I think I know the answer. But I'm curious about your experience with in-house delivery and lowering the minimum check or the minimum order, for instance, is that something you want to lean into a little bit? Maybe continue to, to lower that to increase your in-house delivery? Gene Lee : I think the answer to the second one is that we'll continue to evaluate that. But we don't see a big upside there. What was the first -- percent of menu simplification, each brand is very, very each brand is very, very different. We range somewhere between 20% reduction to 40% reduction in one brand. The easiest thing to do is to go you know, go find the menus. Jake Bartlett : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian Vaccaro : Hey, thanks, guys. And thanks for the extra time. Rick, could you just provide a little more color on the other OpEx line, obviously, down around 20% versus pre-COVID levels. Just walk through some of the more significant cost reductions have been and how you expect those costs to come back? And then would you be willing to provide the fiscal 1Q comps for the individual brands within the fine dining and other business segments? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes, on the restaurant expense line, just want to give you a couple of titbits when we talked about business interruption of $10 million. That was a proceed that we got, that hit our restaurant expense lines. We did have some rent reductions in the quarter, a cash rent reductions were bigger than the P&L impact. The P&L impact was about $3 million. We had some most of our savings are in utilities, in smallwares, and repairs and maintenance. And we would expect that as dining room start to reopen as they get busy again, we'd have R&M start to increase, as well as small wares in utilities. Those savings are maybe not as permanent, right? Because those are just because their volumes are down. And another point to mention is, we are spending money on PPE for masks, for our team gloves, chemicals, etcetera. And that's about $4 million to $5 million a quarter. Brian Vaccaro : Okay. And then the comps for Fine Dining and other big segments. Rick Cardenas : Yes. On the comp side, we mentioned about a year ago that we were going to start providing comps only at a segment level. And this was our first quarter that was the case. And so we're going to continue with that. Brian Vaccaro : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jared Garber : Good Morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just a quick one for me. As you think about longer term capacity, maybe if you just focus on Olive Garden. Is there a level of average weekly sales or AUVs, how are you going to talk about it? That sort of a limit for Olive Garden, obviously, the off-premise business can be quite additive. But as you get back to sort of 100% in dining room capacity, how should we think about the longer term sort of cap, if you will, on AUVs in that brand? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Well, I think there is there is no cap. I mean, I think that, if you reach your -- you start to reach your capacity for just count, you have pricing power, and you can you can move your AUVs that way. I think pre-COVID, we were getting close to over $5 million on average unit volumes. So I think that, we'll definitely, hopefully you can get back there and get past that. I don't -- I don't ever think of a cap for a concept. Now we know that when you start adding new units, they're not going to come on at the average. Usually we can create a strong IRR with restaurants that that come in a little bit below the below the average and but overtime, we've been able to get that average to a pretty good level at 5 million. Jared Garber : Thanks so much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. Gene Lee : Thank you. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you that we plan to release second quarter results on Friday, December 18th before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of those measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2021 third quarter earnings on March 25 before the market opens followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights. Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for the third quarter. And then Gene will share some closing comments. Now, I will turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. As we continue to operate in a very fluid environment and I was pleased with our ability to once again deliver strong profitability in an unpredictable sales environment. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%, same-restaurant sales decreased 20.6% and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74. The last 2 weeks of the quarter negatively impacted our same-restaurant sales by approximately 200 basis points as we quickly went from 97% of our dining rooms being opened in the middle of the quarter to only 80% being open at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, Thanksgiving shifted back into our second quarter this year and we believe just modified their behavior in advance of the holiday. During the quarter, we remain focused on four key priorities. The health and safety of our team members and guests, in restaurant execution in the complex operating environment, deploying technology to improve the guest experience and transforming our business model. The health and safety of our team members and guest has always been our top priority. We continue to follow latest guidance from the CDC as well as our own enhanced safety protocols to create a safe environment for everyone. This includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring mask for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols. I\u2019m proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each other safe. Second, our restaurant teams remain focused on our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy to drive restaurant level execution that results in great guest experiences whether our guests are dining with us or ordering curbside to-go. Our teams have been operating in this environment for 10 months, and they have become very adept at adjusting to the ever-changing COVID restrictions, but it\u2019s still not easy. That\u2019s why we remain committed to our simplified operations, including streamline menus, processes and procedures which continue to strengthen our execution and our guest satisfaction metrics confirm that our restaurant teams are doing a great job delivering exceptional guest experience in this challenging environment. Third, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience. Our brands benefit from the technology platform Darden provides, allowing each of them to compete more effectively by harnessing the power of our digital tools, including the 25 million email addresses in our marketing database. During the quarter, Olive Garden LongHorn Steakhouse launched refresh websites and all our brands continue to use their digital storefronts effectively. More than 55% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guest ordered and paid online. And at Olive Garden, 20% of our total sales for the quarter were digital. During the quarter, we also rolled out Curbside I am Here which allows our guests to easily notify the restaurant that they\u2019ve arrived to pick up their curbside to-go order by simply tapping on a link embedded in a text message. As a result, our operators are spending less time on the phone and more time focused on ensuring orders are accurate and on-time, which is leading to improved guest satisfaction scores. We also introduced Wait List Visibility, allowing guest to see their place on the waiting list using their phone regardless of whether they have checked in online or in person. And we\u2019re working on several other initiatives, including streamlining our online checkout process and adding additional mobile payment options to provide even more convenience for our guest. We continue to accelerate our digital journey, and I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we are making. Finally, we continue to view this environment as a rare opportunity to transform our business model for long-term growth. We continue to make investments in our team members, product quality and portion sizes to ensure we emerge even stronger and better positioned to grow share. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales declined 19.9% as capacity restrictions continue to limit their top-line sales. Olive Garden began November with 56 dining rooms closed, and that number accelerated to 208 by the end of the month. However, they were able to deliver strong average weekly sales during the quarter of more than 73,000 per restaurant, retaining 80% of last year\u2019s sales. Olive Garden also continued to realize operational efficiencies and strengthened margin as a result of their simplified menu and the elimination of promotional activity, including discounts. In the current limited capacity environment, their reduced marketing spend was focused on showcasing the convenience of their off-premise experience, while featuring compelling core menu items rather than limited time promotions. This led to increased segment profit margin, while making additional investments in abundance and value. Additionally, off-premise sales grew 83% in the quarter, representing 39% of total sales. Enabled by the technology investments I mentioned earlier, Olive Garden improved their to-go experience and achieved another all-time high in guest satisfaction for having orders ready to pick up at the time promised. Finally, Olive Garden successfully opened three new restaurants in the quarter. LongHorn Steakhouse had another solid quarter. Same-restaurant sales declined 11.1%. Almost 20% of their restaurants grew same-restaurant sales in the quarter. They also successfully opened three new restaurants during the quarter. The LongHorn team remains laser focused on their strategy of increasing the quality of their guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement. During the quarter, the team did a great job of managing controllable costs while their simplified menu drove improved labor productivity. Finally, LongHorn grew off-premise sales by more than 175%, representing 22% of total sales. Now I will turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. For the second quarter, total sales were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%. Same-restaurant sales declined 20.6%, EBITDA was $206 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74. Our second quarter start was encouraging with weekly sales building on results from the first quarter. However, as COVID-19 cases began increasing in November and many state and local governments re-imposed dining room restrictions, the last two weeks of the quarter trended down significantly. We estimate that this downward shift in sales over the last two weeks negatively impacted operating income by approximately $15 million. Turning to the P&L. Food and beverage expense was 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily driven by investments in food quality and increased to-go packaging. Restaurant labor was 140 basis points lower than last year with hourly labor improving by over 310 basis points, driven by operational simplification. This was partially offset by deleverage and management labor due to sales declines and $3 million of emergency pay net of retention credits as we reinstated our emergency pay program for our team members impacted by dining room closures. Restaurant expense per operating week was 13% lower than last year, driven by lower repairs, maintenance and utilities expenses. However, sales deleverage resulted in restaurant expense as a percent of sales coming in 170 basis points higher than last year. We reduced marketing spend by almost $50 million this quarter with total marketing 210 basis points favorable to last year. Restaurant level EBITDA margin was 17.9%, 140 basis points above last year despite the sales decline of 19%. General and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by $8 million of mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. This is related to significant appreciation in both the Darden share price and equity markets this quarter. As a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, it is mostly offset in the tax line. Page 12 of this quarter\u2019s presentation illustrates the $8.1 million reduction of operating income and corresponding operating income margin reduction of 50 basis points from mark-to-market expense. Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $6.4 million, resulting in a net mark-to-market reduction to earnings after-tax this quarter of $1.7 million. The effective tax rate of 8.3% this quarter was lower by 5.1 percentage points due to the tax benefits from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned. After adjusting for this, the normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter would have been 13.4%. Looking at our segment performance this quarter, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and our other segment, all saw a segment profit margin increase despite sales declines. This was driven by our continued focus on simplified operations, which significantly reduced direct labor and lower marketing expenses. Our Fine Dining segment profit margin of 18.8% was impressive, although below last year, driven by a 30% sales decline. We ended the second quarter with $770 million in cash and another $750 million available in our untapped credit facility, giving us over $1.5 billion of available liquidity. We generated over $150 million of free cash flow in the quarter and improved our adjusted debt to adjusted capital to 58% at the end of the quarter, well within our debt covenant of 75%. The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share, 50% of our Q2 diluted EPS within our long-term framework for value creation. We will continue to have regular discussions with the board on our future dividends. As I mentioned earlier, the quarter started with sales building upon first quarter results. As dining room closures increased, these improving sales trends reversed. As of today, we have approximately 77% of our restaurants operating with at least partial dining room capacity versus a peak of 97% in the middle of the second quarter. Moving forward, we may experience further dining room closures and increasing capacity restrictions in the third quarter. As you may recall, in our last earnings call, we mentioned that the third quarter is historically our peak seasonal sales quarter, driven by the Christmas, New Year\u2019s and Valentine\u2019s Day holidays as well as travel time during this time of year. At that time, we also stated that it will be more difficult to increase on-premise average unit volumes if capacity restrictions do not ease. Current dining room closures, capacity restrictions and reductions in travel will exacerbate our same-restaurant sales comparison to last year due to the higher sales \u2013 seasonal sales from last year. Additionally, there are still uncertainties surrounding further capacity limitations and dining room closures and the duration of these impacts. Given all these factors, we are providing a broad range of expectations for the third quarter. We expect total sales to be between 65% and 70% of prior year levels, resulting in total sales of between $1.53 billion and $1.65 billion, EBITDA between $170 million and $210 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $0.50 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares. With dining rooms closures increasing, we are focusing on our playbook of expense management and off-premise sales. While there is encouraging news on the broad distribution of COVID-19 vaccine in the spring, we currently don\u2019t anticipate meaningful sales trend improvements until some time in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Despite the short-term headwinds we faced with sales trends, operational complexity and impacts to our team members, I\u2019m confident we are making the right decisions for the long-term to create a better guest experience and strengthen our business. And consistent with our messaging last quarter, we continue to believe we can achieve 100% of our pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales, while continuing to make appropriate investments in our business. Now with that, I will turn it back to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks, Rick. This morning, we also announced that Rick will become our President and Chief Operating Officer. Rick\u2019s career represents what our industry is all about. He joined Darden as a Buster at Red Lobster 1984 and has worked extremely hard mastering many functions. On January 4, he will become the President of the world\u2019s largest full service restaurant company. He\u2019s been a great partner to me over the last five years, and I look forward to working side-by-side with him in his new role. Additionally, we announced that Raj Vennam will become our Chief Financial Officer. Raj began his career at Darden in 2003, and has done an exceptional job in every role he has held. His promotion recognizes the significant contributions he has made to our individual brands as well as the greater organization. With a brilliant mind and a keen understanding of our industry, Raj is the perfect person to take over for Rick. I\u2019m excited to see him expand his role in the company as CFO. Rick and Raj are here with me in the room today, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate both of them. I want to close by recognizing our team members in the restaurants and at the support center. I can\u2019t say enough about the dedication they\u2019ve demonstrated throughout the year. Their focus, commitment and determination is exceptional. With multiple jurisdictions implementing dining room closures, we know many team members will not get the hours they needed during this holiday season. That is why we have reintroduced our emergency pay program that will provide three weeks of emergency pay to team members who are furloughed from their restaurant when dining rooms are closed. Our [indiscernible] greatest competitive advantage and we are committed to taking care of them. On behalf of the management team and the board of directors, I want to thank all our team members for your tireless effort to serve our community by providing the comfort of a warm meal. Thank you for going to the extraordinary lines to take care of our guests and each other. I wish you all a safe and a happy holiday season. And with that, we will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Go ahead please. Your line is open. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. First, Gene, congratulations on being elected to Chair of the board and Rick and Raj also congratulations on your promotions, very well deserved. Gene, my question is about those changes. I wanted maybe to hear your thoughts on how your day-to-day involvement will change as a result of Rick taking on the President and COO role? And just your thoughts on whether investors should interpret this as a signal that you will be less involved in the business going forward? Gene Lee : No, absolutely not. I plan on being as involved operationally there, that\u2019s my strength. I mean, I see this as a opportunity to create growth for both Rick and Raj. I think it\u2019s going to give Rick an opportunity to understand operations more deeply. Obviously, he has a great relationship with our presidents today, but I think it\u2019s important for him and his development to get a little deeper into the operations and get to know and oversee a lot of the other people that make things happen, just not the president. I also think it\u2019s important for him to partner with me on making sure that we are leveraging all the non-consumer-facing parts of our business and to see if there is an opportunity to continue to find additional synergies to enable us to further invest in our business. So I see this as an opportunity to work with people that deserve the opportunity to grow. And more importantly, have an extra set of hands to be able to do some things and look at things maybe a little bit differently. Giving Rick the freedom and the time to look across the organization and see where we can pick up some additional synergy I think is a good thing. I think that I tried to do that even in a position that was in, but I know there is a limit to the amount of time you have. I think giving Rick that time will be very beneficial to the organization as we move forward. So I am excited about these changes. It has \u2013 I don\u2019t think anybody should read anything into it. I am going to still be heavily involved in food servicing atmosphere, just the way I am today, and I look at it as a great opportunity. I also look forward to working with Raj and giving him a chance to develop into a world-class Chief Financial Officer, and I think that\u2019s going to be really exciting. So don\u2019t read anything into it other than we\u2019re creating growth for our people, creating new opportunities and we have a few things that we want to get done with this change. David Tarantino : Sounds great. Congrats again to all of you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Gene, how is the company thinking about returning to a normalized marketing spend, meaning, does the company plan to wait until government restrictions on dining usage are lifted or does the company plan to see what kind of pent-up demand there is going to be as consumer mobility increases to determine how much advertising utilized? I am just trying to get a sense for how you guys are thinking about that? Gene Lee : Yes. We have no definitive plans to put back marketing at this point in time. Obviously, we have developed multiple options of how to come back and use those resources that we have. But I think \u2013 and part of your question, I think the answer is there is that we\u2019re going to look and see what the competitive environment is like, we want to see what the pent-up demand is like and we\u2019re going to put back the marketing \u2013 put marketing resources back in the business judiciously. And I would love to get to a point where we can grow our business and rely a little less on advertising spend. We really like the P&Ls with the marketing line at the level it\u2019s at right now. And so there is no predetermined outcome on this. We just \u2013 we need to get into the competitive environment and then make our decisions then. We have developed multiple options if needed. Chris O\u2019Cull: Great. Congratulations on everyone\u2019s promotions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks so much. Gene, Rick and Raj, happy holidays and congrats on the well deserved promotions. Gene, do the most recent few weeks of sales trends change your view from last quarter that 5% to 15% of the category is likely to see store closures? And what I\u2019m trying to get at is, are you starting to see more favorable terms from landlords and developers that will benefit the development pipeline as you look out to the 2022 and 2023 class of openings? Gene Lee : No, I don\u2019t think \u2013 I mean, I think that my position on closure is still in that 5% to 15% range. And it\u2019s unfortunate that a lot of these small businesses are being impacted this way, because I do think it has a \u2013 it will have a negative impact on our \u2013 on the productivity of our industry, so on so forth. So as far as real estate goes, I think that my position on that is still pretty much the same is that there is some more availability out there right now. However, we\u2019re not seeing any weakness in the rent deals. I think what we are \u2013 I think there is some speculation going on out there right now with some of the REITs. So I think as we move forward, we will continue to try to grow our businesses responsibly. We want to eventually get back into our long-term framework. We\u2019ll give you some more guidance in March exactly how we\u2019re thinking about FY \u201822 for development. But we reconfirmed our guidance for this year and hoping that we can get the number of restaurants that we talked about in the press release open. And we have a bunch of restaurants today sitting there ready to go and that are ready to open. We just need to \u2013 our guideline here is, once we get to approximately 50% occupancy in a jurisdiction, we will go ahead and open that restaurant, and we\u2019ve been very successful doing that. Andrew Charles : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Brian Bittner : Thanks and good morning. And I echo the congratulations to all three of you on the upcoming move into your new roles. Gene, in the press release and on this call, you talked a lot about the fact that you were taking this opportunity to transform the business for a long-term growth. And on the call, when you spoke about that in your prepared remarks, you specifically said, employee investments and some menu and portion changes, but can you just talk a little bit more beyond that. What else are you doing to truly transform this company for long-term growth and how do you strategically think about growth, both for the AUV recapture opportunity and the unit and portfolio growth of the company in the long-term? Gene Lee : Good question, Brian. I think we think about it in three ways, right? What are we doing to ensure that we can grow the base from a same-restaurant sales perspective. And I think a lot of the simplification and efficiency \u2013 and the efficiencies that we\u2019re creating. But more importantly, and I think I talked about this in the last call was, as we brought our menus down, we learned a lot about guest behavior and what the guest wanted to buy without our nudge. And I think that\u2019s really been eye opening for us. And I think that that\u2019s going to strengthen the operation and day-to-day operation on that side. So I really think that we\u2019re well positioned there. We have done a lot of good work to ensure that our brand is set up for success. Secondly, we talked about transformation. And when we go to second bucket of growth, which is new restaurants, the key here is that we believe that the business model from a cost side is much stronger than it was pre-pandemic, which should enable us to be able to grow, especially in Olive Garden, deeper than we may have thought we would be able to grow pre-pandemic. So that\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m really excited about is, we think that we can actually over time tick up Olive Garden growth and handle \u2013 because of the improvements we\u2019ve made, we think we can handle the cannibalization a little bit better and still get a good return on our investment. The third bucket that you highlighted was really around how do we continue to add brands to the platform? And as I\u2019ve said forever, we continue to look at what our options are. The filter that we use really comes down to does the \u2013 does it benefit us to put that brand on the platform? Does the platform benefit that brand? Do we think it can grow faster than Olive Garden to improve our growth rate? And we\u2019ve historically done something every three or four years. This has obviously been a different period of time. But we believe that to be an avenue of our growth and to support our long-term framework. And so I think we\u2019re really well positioned in all of those \u2013 in those three buckets to drive the business. The last thing that I would say is I think that \u2013 in this transformation, it\u2019s moved a lot of the technology forward faster than what we originally were planning to do. And the big change for us is moving from \u2013 moving how we handle the off-premise business, which has been a big part of our growth historically the last 5 years as we capture the convenience trend. But really getting clarity that this is going to be a curbside business, it\u2019s going to be technologically enabled versus someone coming to the restaurant and getting out of the car and coming to pick it up. And I think that we\u2019ve really worked hard and our team has done a great job. And I think that experience today, when you come into an Olive Garden, especially Olive Garden and LongHorn, in all our brands, but really this is an Olive Garden play because of the food travel so well. I think that that\u2019s going to really be a competitive advantage going forward. Brian Bittner : Thanks for that, Gene. And nobody seems to be taking their follow-up, but I am going to ask one, if you don\u2019t mind. The step back that\u2019s happening in the business in the third quarter, it\u2019s pretty telegraphed by what\u2019s been happening in the world. But when you look back at the quarter that you just reported, when you got to that 97% of units offering in-store dining in the middle of the quarter, can you give us a peek into how the business was performing with that type of percentage of stores operating in that manner? Gene Lee : Well, I think there were still geographic problems, and I would say that we were really adhering to the social distancing. But the business \u2013 in some ways I gave you that because I said we \u2013 the last two weeks cost us 200 basis points for the quarter. And so I think there were parts of the country that were performing really well, and I think you can look at the mobility index out there and see what parts of the country were performing well. And so if you look at Georgia and Texas, Florida hasn\u2019t been performing as well just because of tourism is down and we have a lot of restaurants based in tourism. But in our non-tourist markets in Florida we\u2019re performing well. So we had some good momentum, but we all \u2013 we knew as a management team that we weren\u2019t \u2013 this wasn\u2019t done, that we\u2019re going to face this second wave and we are prepared for it. And we had good processes and we\u2019ve been able to wind down the businesses effectively to off-premise-only and then we\u2019ll quickly be able to wind them back up and take advantage of the opportunity. Brian Bittner : Thank you and congratulations, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Eric Gonzalez : Hey, thanks. And I would also like to add my congrats on the promotions. My question is, as we look ahead to the vaccine rollout, can you talk about what you think you need to do differently in order to maximize the opportunity to capitalize on that pent-up demand that likely exists? And as a follow-up to that, what is the \u2013 what do you think the flow-through rate is on incremental sales today? And what do you think it will be post-vaccine, assuming you don\u2019t need any \u2013 assuming you don\u2019t need to discount or advertise? Thanks. Gene Lee : I will let our new President answer that. Rick Cardenas : Well, first of all, thanks everybody for all the kind words. And I want to congratulate Raj as well on his promotion. He has been a real partner to me over these \u2013 over the four and a half, five years that I\u2019ve been the CFO. And so I appreciate that. What do we needed to capitalize. Gene has been talking a lot about what we\u2019re doing to make sure that we invest in our team members, invest in our food. And as the restaurants start to ramp up, we really believe that we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ve seen growth when those restaurants start to open. We\u2019re not going to talk strategically about what we\u2019re going to do to capitalize on that. But just know that our business model is so much better that even if we \u2013 as we get our sales to grow, our margins will continue to improve, which gets to the second part of that question that you asked, and the question is flow-through in incremental sales. As we look at what we\u2019re doing today, right, today, our variable margins are closer to 50% and before they were closer to 40%. And so we\u2019ve taken a lot of costs out, but some of those costs will come back in. And as we mentioned, and that would imply about 150 basis points of margin improvement over the long run. But right now, incremental profitability is pretty strong. When we started to see some closures, we started to see that drop. And so as we move forward, we still believe that we\u2019re going to get to a 100% of our pre-COVID EBITDA, 90% of pre-COVID sales. We just don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to get to the 90% of pre-COVID sales. Eric Gonzalez : Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Chris Carril : Hi. Good morning, Gene, Rick and Raj. Congratulations on your new roles and promotions announced this morning. Rick or Raj, could you please provide your thoughts on how to think about G&A now moving forward, both in the near-term and longer term? At this point, how much of the savings that you\u2019ve seen thus far do you think could be held on to in a more normalized environment and how does the increased focus on technology impact this? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Chris. Thanks. The G&A, I\u2019ll talk about this quarter that we just ended. And as you saw, we reported about $90 million in G&A. But that would have been closer to $82 million without that mark-to-market expense. And as you recall, at the end of the first quarter call, we talked about the early retirement program that we had, saving us about $25 million to $30 million a year. We\u2019re still seeing that and we still believe that we\u2019ll keep that as we move forward. But we\u2019ve also had some savings in G&A because of reduced travel and other things, no general manager conference and those kind of things. Those things will come back. How fast they come back is a question. But we\u2019re running about 5% G&A or 5.5% G&A right now, which is remarkable considering our sales where they were \u2013 where they are. As we get back to our pre-COVID sales, we will start seeing G&A come up a little bit, but nowhere near where it was before because of that $25 million to $30 million \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, $25 million to $30 million of savings that we got on early retirement. Chris Carril : Got it. Thank you. And just again the increased focus on technology is there any potential impact there? Rick Cardenas : Yes. No, we\u2019ve been investing in technology for years. As we continue to work on our technology investments, that will impact the depreciation line amortization line going forward. But we also have some projects that we worked on [indiscernible] would fall off. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in technology. Will that help make us more efficient here in the support center? Yes. But a lot of our G&A is out in the field and our directors of operations and our senior vice president of operations and technology will help them be more effective and more efficient, but it won\u2019t get us a whole lot of G&A save. But absolutely, the technology investments we\u2019re making are more about in restaurant. So that\u2019s not a G&A, that\u2019s kind of restaurant margin. Chris Carril : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations, Gene, Rick and Raj. One question and then a follow-up, the question is in terms of the labor outlook, obviously lots of moving pieces. And I think we\u2019d agree Darden\u2019s an employer of choice. And with unemployment up, inflation in theory should ease and you experienced significant leverage in the second quarter. I\u2019m just wondering how you think about that in the context of potential for national minimum wage increase. I\u2019m just wondering your bigger picture industry thoughts maybe using Florida as a guide or how you think about how you can offset that whether with cost savings or menu pricing or just broad outlook on the labor line going forward? And then I had one follow-up. Gene Lee : Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Labor is definitely is a little bit of a question mark for us and for the industry. But as we think about labor, we\u2019ve dealt with the structural increases over time very effectively. We are better positioned than anybody else in the industry to be able to deal with that because where our margins are today. Do I \u2013 at the bottom if you\u2019re asking me, do I think there\u2019ll be a federal minimum wage increase that\u2019s similar to Florida, I think over time we will see federal minimum wage increase, but not at the same rate as Florida. I think the key for us and the way we\u2019re thinking about it is, how do we get to the right tip wage and to keep that relationship between the constituents \u2013 two constituents, the guest and the server that don\u2019t want that relationship to change, albeit people in public office and some advocacy groups believe that that relationship should change where our team members in service really don\u2019t want that to change. So how do we protect that, get that to the right level. If we\u2019re all \u2013 if the industry at all faced with it then, we are going to have to figure out how from a pricing standpoint we are able to pass that through. I think long-term, when I look at the P&L and think about it, I think it\u2019s \u2013 California is an example of it today. You\u2019re going to end up with a little bit lower cost of goods sold and a little bit higher labor cost, but you\u2019re going to end up at the same place. And so as long as you are thinking about that way, I\u2019m confident in our ability to manage that over the long-term. Could it have some short-term impacts and volatility of the cost structure? Yes. But long-term, I like where we are positioned and our ability to be able to deal with it. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just the follow-up, you mentioned earlier, Gene, that maybe there is an opportunity to increase penetration of your brands, obviously Olive Garden is the furthest along, so maybe that\u2019s the best example. I\u2019m just wondering whether there is any quantification on that or how you would think as an alternative about maybe using goes kitchens? I mean, with your portfolio being as large as it is, I would think you can create your own kitchen just of your own portfolio since the brand is already pretty well known and not necessarily need to open up as many new boxes. So just trying to get a sense for that? Thank you. Gene Lee : No, we believe we\u2019re an on-premise restaurant company. And we believe \u2013 we strongly believe that demand for in-restaurant dining is going to come back really strong. There\u2019ll be some fall-off on the off-premise occasion. I think people have a lot of fatigue with that right now. Long-term, convenience is going to \u2013 when you think about long-term, convenience is still going to be important. But I think that \u2013 and off-premise will come back and be strong and be stronger at some point than it was pre-COVID. But I believe that these are \u2013 these brands need to be developed to be on-premise locations that as your primary business that drives an auxiliary business, which is your off-premise location, off-premise business, but you developed the brand in a box and we create in-restaurant \u2013 great in-restaurant experience. And the logistics of moving that the last mile are just so so expensive and something that we know really cuts into the profitability and some that we don\u2019t want to be involved in. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you and congratulations to the team on the promotions. Gene, I wanted to ask if you can give us an update on the Cheddar\u2019s brand and what, if any changes you guys have made throughout the pandemic and how should we think about the unit growth of that concept when we come out of this pandemic? Gene Lee : Yes. I think we\u2019ve talked about in the last call the biggest transformation we\u2019ve made in the cost structure has been at Cheddar\u2019s. As we simplified the menu, we really were able to get in there and look at all the processes and procedures from the backdoor to the dining room table. And the team has made great progress there, which has resulted in a significant reduction in labor cost. And we\u2019ve got a significant reduction in the waste in that business around cost of goods sold, which has really changed the business model. Prior to the pandemic, we had just rolled out at every single guest which has been received very well, and we were able to absorb the pricing that we implemented. When we did that, our value ratings have actually increased. I think the other thing that going through this crisis has accelerated is their off-premise capabilities. Prior to the pandemic, we did not have a ton of capabilities there. We didn\u2019t \u2013 we really had a couple of phone lines, but it was just a mess. So we\u2019ve increased the number of phone lines. We\u2019ve got online ordering in place. We\u2019ve now got the Curbside I\u2019m Here in there. And it takes our businesses growing fairly rapidly through the pandemic, and we\u2019re very pleased with that. We\u2019ve got to get better at it because it\u2019s not a core competency in Cheddar\u2019s, but I think the team has been working really hard on it and I know they have got a big initiative, and I\u2019m really proud of what they are doing. As far as unit growth goes, we\u2019ve really \u2013 I always talk about human resources than we talk about unit growth. We\u2019ve stabilized the human resources in Cheddar\u2019s. The human resource metrics are getting closer to Darden metrics. I think actually management turnover is actually in the middle now after being such an outlier for so long. So I am excited about that. But we still need to build management strength to handle growth. Now we have been opening restaurants all the way through the transition, through the pandemic and through \u2013 really through the integration. And I would expect unit growth to be somewhere in that 5% to 8% range, which I think we can handle from a human resource standpoint. So it\u2019s additive to our growth rate. We\u2019re excited about the business. We\u2019re excited to see what the P&L will really look like in a post-pandemic environment. And we\u2019ve always loved the business and we love the business today, and we\u2019re excited about it. We\u2019ve got \u2013 team has done a great job, I\u2019m really proud of them. Peter Saleh : Do you anticipate having to spend more as a percentage of sales for Cheddar\u2019s to \u2013 on the marketing side to accelerate that growth in the coming quarters or year? Gene Lee : No, I just don\u2019t have \u2013 we don\u2019t have the density in that business to be cost effective from a marketing standpoint. I think we\u2019ll continue to use the digital \u2013 our digital capabilities there. But really, it was always a high volume concept that didn\u2019t have the cost structure set up right. Now we have the cost structure set up \u2013 we think set up right and doing 5,000 guests a week. I think that the growth in that business really comes from new units not really comp growth. There is not many restaurant companies out there doing 5,000 guests a week. Peter Saleh : Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open. John Glass : Thanks very much. Happy holidays to everyone and congratulations from me as well. Rick or Raj, maybe two, maybe more boring finance questions, one is just on the third \u2013 on your current quarter guidance. Even at the high end, it would assume revenues might be a little lower than they are, total revenues this quarter, but the operating margins might be actually higher, I should say, EBITDA margins. Is that just a function of like the G&A, which was a little bit off this quarter because of mark-to-market? Is there something else going on that would actually allow you even have higher profitability versus second quarter on lower sales? Rick Cardenas : Hi, John. No, I think you got it a little bit on the G&A front. But as we continue to reopen restaurants, we are getting more efficient at that, right? So if restaurants come back and reopen, we are just getting better at doing that. And as restaurants close, we are getting more \u2013 we are more efficient doing that as well. So we just believe that we have got a business model that\u2019s wired pretty well right now and that should show up in our margins in Q3. John Glass : And in the next \u2013 this is probably the last quarter we\u2019ll be talking about negative same-store sales and then you\u2019ll start to lap the May period etc. How should investors sort of think about how to model the business or think about the recovery? Should we just focus on average unit volumes and then just sort of back into this implied same-store sales because that\u2019s what really drives things to be really \u2013 year-over-year doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s really just the volume capacities are limited to a point until those capacity restrictions end. Is that the best way to think much of business over the next couple of quarters after you start lapping the pandemic? Gene Lee : Yes. John, I think what investors have to do is make assumptions for when the pandemic starts to ease and when dining room restrictions kind of \u2013 when dining rooms reopen and then look at our average unit volumes what we\u2019re doing today and kind of put some kind of a factor on that. And you can kind of see some of the things that we\u2019ve shown in our releases and pretty transparent on our weekly sales and restaurants that have dining rooms opened versus the total company and just kind of make your best guesses on when do you think the pandemic is going to wane and when dining rooms are going to reopen. We can\u2019t tell you when that is, but we feel really confident that when that does happen, we\u2019re going to be there to capitalize on it. John Glass : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Dennis Geiger : Thank you and congrats to all on well deserved promotions. Gene, wondering if you could talk a bit more about technology and the digital platforms, you talked a bunch about the initiatives that recently rolled out and those that are coming. But can you size up the opportunity a bit more on the role that tech plays and digital plays and can play for the brand, perhaps a bit more maybe on some of the top line benefits and thinking about guest satisfaction, speed ultimately and sales? And then, Rick, I think you talked some about the benefits from the cost and margin perspective a little bit, but if there is anything more to kind of frame up that opportunity as well? Thank you. Gene Lee : I think \u2013 first of all, I think technology really helps you on the off-premise side. As we talk to our guest, they continue to talk \u2013 tell us they don\u2019t want a technologically advanced or enabled in-restaurant experience. They don\u2019t want to look at digital menus. I mean, as we put the QR codes out there and have people try to look at the menus on their phone, they really pushed back, they don\u2019t like that. And so that trend I don\u2019t think is going to take place in restaurant. We are playing with some handheld devices to see if we can get orders quicker. I think that kiosk has played a major role in a lot of our brands. It\u2019s enabled our servers to in a non-pandemic time be able to use that device to get orders in. It really does a great job on payment. The option rate on payment is extremely high with that device as the consumer becomes used to using it. So in restaurant, I don\u2019t see a ton of technological advances there over time. I think the things that we are working on, you know Wait List is important. Again, the big one that we\u2019re working on right now is how do you accelerate the checkout process on an online order and how can that be as friendly as the big retailers. And so those types of things on the margin I think technology is there. We are fairly technologically advanced with our dining room system, our KDS system. I\u2019m not sure how much more is there that we see right now. We are working on a technology roadmap over the next five years to figure out where do we want to invest and how do we get the highest return on that. And so there is still work to be done. I think the majority of it still is in off-premise to accelerate that. And then on the other side, we don\u2019t talk much about, but when you think about the size of our email database today and how we interact with our guests digitally. We will continue to evolve that and get better at that and more efficient with that. Trying to figure how to communicate more effectively with our consumers and let them know about the things that might drive a visit. And so I\u2019m excited about that. There is a lot of engagement digitally with our brand, both from an email database, but from social. Just think about what happened last week when Taylor Swift dropped the song with Olive Garden in it, and how we were able to capture that socially and create buzz around that. And all of a sudden, when Taylor Swift drops our name in a song, our brand becomes very, very relevant. It\u2019s a 40-plus year old brand that\u2019s all of a sudden relevant with her audience. And our team was working around the clock to capitalize on that activity. And to those that are listening that were on that team, they did a fantastic job to be able to make that relevant. So, thank you to them and thank you to Taylor Swift for dropping Olive Garden in her song. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Jeff Farmer : Great. Thank you, and congratulations to all three of you. Well deserved across the board. Another labor question for you. So if memory serves, you saw 350 basis points of hourly labor favorability in the fiscal first quarter. It sounds like you guys just talked about 310 basis points in the second quarter. How should we be thinking about favorability moving forward, especially with the emergency pay coming back? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Jeff. This is Rick. On the labor front, the hourly labor of 310 basis points favorability this quarter, it was really driven by the fact \u2013 compared to 350 in Q1, it was really driven by the fact that in Q1 we had a much, much more simplified menu in some of these restaurants because some of them were still to go only, some of those restaurants were running with very few hourly employees. And so, as we started ramping up dining rooms, yes, we added some labor, but 40 basis point difference isn\u2019t very big when you consider the sales that we added from Q1 to Q2. And the emergency pay isn\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t necessarily put that into our direct labor cost, it\u2019s more in the kind of fixed labor, we talk about it. So when we talk about the 310 basis point to the 350 basis points, it does not include emergency pay. Jeff Farmer : Okay. And just as a follow-up again on labor, this is a popular investor question. But you touched on it, but with indoor dining suspensions affecting roughly 25% of the system as you \u2013 most recently. Can you provide some color on the impact that that has on variable restaurant level costs, specifically in the labor and restaurant expense lines? And I know you\u2019ve shared some color on hourly versus management labor as a percent of total labor, but anything there to sort of help analysts and investors understand the movement between fixed and variable costs for restaurants that are essentially close to indoor dining? Gene Lee : Yes. When you think about, when you have no indoor dining, a big part of our restaurant is the servers and \u2013 so that\u2019s a little bit less, actually, a little less efficient in number of hours than in our premise business. On dollars it\u2019s not so bad, but on an hour\u2019s basis you have a lot more servers per guests then you do wanted to go \u2013 to go experience. So actually it does help us a little bit when we go to off premise only, just for a little bit of time. We actually don\u2019t like to be off premise only, we would much rather have the total sales and the total margin of being open on premise. And in relation to the fixed versus variable, that \u2013 as the definition says, the variable cost definitely go way down as we \u2013 our sales go down. Most of our costs on the fixed side will be there. We have a few things that we can turn off, when we go to off-premise only. The TVs, the music and those kind of things, but that\u2019s not significant. The other thing that is significant as we have a little less repair and maintenance. When you\u2019re restaurant isn\u2019t getting beat up in the dining room, you don\u2019t have to do as much repairs there. But I would say, we would much rather have a full restaurant full dining rooms and deal with the cost of that, then have empty dining rooms and just do off-premise. Jeff Farmer : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Lauren Silberman : Thanks for the questions. Congrats to all. Hopefully at this time next year all restaurant will be open at full capacity. When you reopen restaurant, how long does it take for restaurants to ramp up sales to their full allowable capacity? Is that immediate or it takes several weeks to build. What I\u2019m trying to get at is, how quickly do you expect to reach full pre-COVID sales level, assuming capacity restrictions are lifted 100%? Gene Lee : Well, I think that \u2013 I mean that\u2019s hard for us to really define for you. I think that from our standpoint, we can \u2013 other than maybe having a ramp up in staffing, we can get right \u2013 we can get to a point where we can move back to 100% fairly quickly of where we were from a volume standpoint. And I think even staffing would be more of a fatigue thing, because we probably have to work our people more hours than what they were used to in the near-term, but I think we can get there right away. The question is going to be more on the consumer demand is that, is this going to come back in all at once or is it going to come back over a period of time as more and more people get comfortable. You think about the different demographics out there today, and is it going \u2013 our people is going to, as soon as they are vaccinated say, Okay, I can get out and move or are they still going to be cautious. And that to us is the unknown. But what I would tell everybody on the call and our investors is that, we\u2019re going to be prepared to be able to handle the situation as it unfolds. And we\u2019re going to be in a situation where I think that our brands are trusted and beloved by our guest and that people once they feel good about being able to have a little bit more mobility, they\u2019re going to come back to as quickly and we\u2019re going to be ready to serve them a great meal and deliver on our expectation. Lauren Silberman : Great. And then can you touch on those kitchen that are sending us the virtual brands operating out of existing restaurants, more restaurants are developing new virtual concept businesses. And at near-term sales, I think, uncertainty regarding the same tower over the long term. Last quarter you said this wasn\u2019t the right approach for Darden, is that still your view? And can you just expand on your view on the concept of virtual brands and whether that\u2019s appropriate for any of those concepts in the Darden portfolio? Gene Lee : It\u2019s still our position, we believe that we need to stay focused on running the brands that we spent many, many years investing and marketing and building. And I believe that that\u2019s the right place to be. I believe, as I said last quarter, others have got to do what they think they need to do to run their business. I think the question I would ask is, who owns a virtual brand? Is the kitchen or just door dash on the virtual brand? Lauren Silberman : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Jon Tower : Awesome. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the questions. Congrats to the team, happy Friday and happy holidays to everybody. Just two follow-ups really. First one, when thinking about the targeted 100 to 150 basis point margin improvement over time, does that take into account potentially a higher or a lower level of marketing spend over time? Or essentially we\u2019re turning back to, say, the 3% spend? And then digging a bit deeper into the unit potential we were discussing a little bit earlier. When thinking about it, are you contemplating the idea of potentially putting more units in an existing trade area or do you think that there is greater opportunity for your brands to move into a smaller markets over time? And is this more about the portfolio or all of Olive Garden specific? And then just one more on top of it, how much is cannibalization weight on same-store sales and margins historically? Rick Cardenas : Hey, John, this is Rick. I\u2019ll go through those questions. So lower marketing is part of the 100 million to 150 million \u2013 100 basis points to 150 basis points. I\u2019m sorry. But most of that is going to be from our labor efficiencies that we\u2019ve come to play. As sales go back up depending on what the competitive environment looks like we will market. I mean, Olive Garden is a national brand. And one of the benefits of Olive Garden is their scale and their national footprint. So Olive Garden will be on TV nationally, because we think that\u2019s a big competitive advantage for us. And so marketing will come back not to the level it was before, but most of our 100 to 150 basis points is going to be on the labor front. As it relates to unit potential, while we\u2019re not going to give a number on units, Gene did mention Olive Garden, seeing that we could potentially go into smaller markets because of the business model enhancements that we\u2019ve made, but other brands are going to fill in markets. I mean, one of the things that Gene mentioned earlier about Cheddar\u2019s is, they don\u2019t have scale, they really don\u2019t have a whole lot of scale in most of the markets there are in either. So we really believe in relative market share and we think Cheddar\u2019s has the opportunity, LongHorn has the opportunity, all of our brands have the opportunity to build scale in some markets they are in, while still growing into new markets. And in regards to cannibalization, we haven\u2019t given that number in a long time. And most of the cannibalization would be at Olive Garden. And Olive Garden isn\u2019t growing that many restaurant, so the cannibalization isn\u2019t that impactful for us. And as it relates to the other brands, as we do go into some markets that we already have restaurants in, because we\u2019re so, especially for Cheddar\u2019s, because we\u2019re so disbursed on where we \u2013 where our restaurants are. When we add a new restaurant, yes, we will have some cannibalization, but the business model is so much better now that we believe that is the right thing to do, plus it actually leverages some of the G&A and other things in that market, even our supply chain. So while our restaurant level margins may tick down if we cannibalize, the cost outside the restaurant will get better. Jon Tower : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good morning. Congrats to everybody. Two quick questions for me. The first is on numbers, with the guidance. Can you talk just a little bit more about what is underlying that? I would wonder about two things. I think you said like 75% of the dining rooms are open. So I can imagine you\u2019re contemplating all of those reopening, yet you are not contemplating everything closing. So what is kind of the spectrum there? And then on the comp, is it holding steady for dining rooms opened and the momentum they have achieved and \u2013 or are they also seeing some softness? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Nicole, this is Rick. As it relates to our guidance and then I\u2019ll get into the comp. We aren\u2019t assuming that we\u2019re contemplating any significant changes in net capacity restriction. So where we are today is where we\u2019re going to expect to be through the quarter. Other than those that are already contemplated by officials if there is some new ones coming then \u2013 that we already know about, but we don\u2019t know about any new ones coming. Now hopefully those things will ease as the quarter goes on. And so, we do have some \u2013 a little bit of that. I will give you \u2013 I want to give you a couple of data points. So as of Sunday our quarter-to-date on a fiscal basis, which is what you all look at, our comp sales were down about 26%. But if you look at it on a comparable calendar basis, because, remember, we had a 53 week last year and Thanksgiving shifted, we\u2019re down 35%, as Gene mentioned, over the first 2 weeks. So our guidance takes all that into account, it takes into account that we think that our sales are going to maybe grow a little bit on a per op week basis or on average unit volume basis, but because we are going up against that high seasonal sales last year our comps will be a little bit more challenged. And so that led to the second part of your question of what are we seeing in comps for restaurants that still have dining rooms open. We\u2019re now getting into our seasonal period, so we\u2019re getting into that point that we talked about after Q1 and recently mentioned on today\u2019s prepared remarks is that, our comps are going to be harder. What I would focus everybody on is our average weekly sales. And if you look at our press release that we shared, we still have average weekly sales growing. Unfortunately not growing as fast as average weekly sales grew last year, which we knew would happen and we highlighted that. So we\u2019re focusing more on Q4 next year. We believe we have the business to get us through that and we\u2019re really comfortable with the guidance that we gave for Q3, but we\u2019re really focusing on getting our business really ready to capitalize on when sales come back. Nicole Miller : That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you. And to your point on \u2013 yes, looking to this quarter and looking to the next, absolutely, that just leads me to my second last question is exactly that. There is not even just the thought process anymore about these bigger chains like yourselves being able to take share. But it\u2019s absolutely model by seeing the consensus estimate, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. And I want to understand what do you think about that? What\u2019s the opportunity for sales transfer? Does the NRE saying 110,000 locations are closed what\u2019s all the type and location and health? What\u2019s the probability in the interim that you pick up those sales? I mean, we are hope for an independent revival, but that\u2019s going to take time. Has consensus been too optimistic on that front or is that what is happening is going to happen? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes, Nicole. I don\u2019t want to comment on where consensus is for Q4 or beyond. But what I do want to get everybody understanding is, before the pandemic the full service restaurant business was about $100 billion category. We believe after the pandemic, it\u2019s going to be $100 billion or more category. I mean, we also know that unfortunately there have been a lot of restaurants that have closed and there might be more that are coming. We really are unhappy with that, we really like to see these independents stay opened, as Gene mentioned, because they do provide some novelty and flare that we can learn from as well. But as we think about our business in the long run, full service restaurants was a big category, we had about an 8% share, 9% share, we believe it\u2019s going to be at least as big, potentially bigger because of the pent-up demand and people really understanding and realizing what they missed out of casual dining and full service restaurants. And so, if restaurant stays close for a while, we are bound to pick up some of that share. How much that is? I can\u2019t comment on it, but we believe we\u2019re really, really well prepared to capture that share. And with the business model that we have, we believe that we\u2019re going to benefit from that. Nicole Miller : Thanks again. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning and congratulations to all of your promotions. A follow-up on your comment so far about how Darden is transforming the business model for the long-term, you mentioned how simplification and productivity will result in a longer-term margin step up and that can lead to greater unit growth opportunities down the road. That\u2019s great. And I think to get that, one thing I\u2019m curious about is about this whole crisis and your internal actions, has the business been transformed in a way than your major brands that is going to bolster sales per restaurant long-term perhaps some year like fiscal \u201823 might be higher than it would have been without the crisis and your internal actions. I\u2019d be curious to hear about that? Gene Lee : Yes, David. I think \u2013 as this crisis has done a few things. I think it\u2019s not just for the restaurant business, but for our business. I\u2019ve listened to all the CEOs talk. I mean we\u2019ve identified a lot of non-value-added activity inside our organizations that you are funding, but also was creating distractions at the operational level. And I think that\u2019s a big upside for us and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re really focused on to ensure that there is not \u2013 there is not this gravitational pull to bring us back to do that type of work. What gives me the most confidence in our ability to get above pre-pandemic sales is the investments we\u2019ve made. And from the minute after \u2013 day after April 20, when we raised $500 million in the equity offering and we knew liquidity wasn\u2019t going to be an issue. This management team focus 100% on what do we need to do to ensure our businesses are stronger than they were before the crisis? What actions, what investments do you want to make? What things that you do in history that turned out to be wrong that you want to make right? And our businesses have worked hard to do that. Now each one of our brand is in a different place on that journey. I think our bigger brands are much further along at this point and they\u2019ve made the moves. And what I\u2019m really impressed with is, the stuff that they\u2019re working on today, at the level of detail are trying to improve guest satisfaction to me is absolutely amazing. Words down to \u2013 we\u2019re spending a lot of time working on how do we improve our \u2013 the off-premise experience and how do we ensure the food at 15 minutes if it\u2019s not going to go back into a microwave is in it\u2019s optimal eating point or what it look like at 30 minutes when it goes back into the microwave. So there\u2019s just a tremendous amount of work and investment being made. And what I would call the second level that I think is going to pay big dividends. We\u2019ve invested a lot back into quality and value and our brands. And I\u2019m really excited about that and the guests are telling us that they are noticing these changes. David Palmer : Is kitchen capacity an issue at Olive Garden? I mean can you kind of \u2013 the step changes happen without you running into bottlenecks and thresholds where the experiences compromised on either off-premise or on-premise? Gene Lee : No, actually the opposite, David, because we have removed a lot of the extraneous products that we are trying to serve, we were getting 0.5% of sales out off. And then we really through our menu \u2013 in our menu engineering, we are moving the high value, high satisfaction more of those items through to our guests. And we \u2013 the more we make the better we get. So actually, everything we\u2019re working on today, speed is taken into account and that holds the simplification of that process. You guys have heard me talk about this \u2013 you probably tired of me talking about it. A great kitchen starts with how the product comes in the backdoor and we got to streamline all those processes until it get to the table. And during this crisis we\u2019ve been able to reevaluate all that activity and all those processes and we\u2019re so far along that journey today and that\u2019s what gives me confidence about the future. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Nick Setyan : Thank you, and congratulations on all the promotions. As the recent months progressed, the strength of the consumer in the context of the dining room capacities was a positive surprise. Is there a way to tease out that? How strong the consumer now is as the reversals happen and the dining room closures accelerate. Is there a way to tease out whether part of it is also the customer just spending less? Gene Lee : Yes. Nick. We haven\u2019t really seen a whole lot of difference in our check average, so that\u2019s one way to think about the consumer and how strong they are. And as you look at our week to week sales in dining rooms that are open, they are still growing. Now, it\u2019s really hard to tease out consumer strength versus people going out for holidays or people actually curbing their spending because maybe they were self-quarantining before Thanksgiving and those kind of things. So it\u2019s really tough to see that other than the fact that our check really hasn\u2019t had a big dip. Nick Setyan : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Andrew Strelzik : Great, thank you. Good morning. Two things for me. The first, just in thinking through what off-premise sales could look like in a normal operating environment whenever that may be. Can you share where sales were from \u2013 on the off-premise side in markets where the dining recovery maybe was farthest along, or anything you\u2019ve gleaned from your customer data that\u2019s informing your thinking around post pandemic off-premise sales? And then the second question, as you mentioned adding brands to the portfolio, has the COVID environment either created more or fewer attractive opportunities for acquisitions or multiples less or more of an inhibitor now than they were before. Just any comments around the M&A environment would be great. Gene Lee : Yes. First on the off-premise capacity \u2013 on the off-premise capacity, what I would say is, it\u2019s hard to get your arms around it, because you still have capacity restrictions in your restaurant if you living with the six feet. So there is still a lot of people that pull up to our doors that realize that we\u2019ve got to hour wait and then they transition to an off-premise experience. So we really don\u2019t have a feel for where that\u2019s going to level out. And I think I said last quarter, we actually see a scenario where that could actually fall down to below pre-pandemic levels once you open up the dine rooms, because there\u2019ll be less demand for it. And then we believe it will come back at a higher level than it was pre-pandemic. But we don\u2019t have a feel for where that\u2019s going to settle in right now. Because I think everybody\u2019s behavior is so modified in this environment. I\u2019m really not going to comment on the M&A environment any further than what I\u2019ve already said. Andrew Strelzik : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Andy Barish : Hey, guys. A lot of kind of medium and long-term questions. I just wanted to kind of think about the fourth quarter, given obviously there is impossible number of variables to try to project at this time, but if the environment kind of stays the same as it is, I mean, historically your 4Q has looked a lot like your 3Q, is that how we should kind of be thinking about things on a high level? Gene Lee : Hey, Andy. Our fourth quarter isn\u2019t that different than third quarter. We\u2019ve got Mother\u2019s Day in Q4, so that\u2019s a really big day for us. While it\u2019s not as seasonally high as Q3, it\u2019s not that different. Andy Barish : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Brett Levy : Great. Thanks for taking the time sharing all this information. Congratulations to all of the team members who were elevated and all the people who actually helped them get there. I guess just one data question if you\u2019d be willing to share. And then just second question on that. The first is on market share. Would you care to share what Olive Garden and LongHorn were X and if you had any thoughts on positive units just across those two systems? And then just a second question, we have talked a lot about technology and the people, how are you thinking about the physical boxes, the existing ones, the new ones with all of these transformative issues that you are dealing with, whether it\u2019s tack or people or just how the consumers are looking and some of the structural issues you dealt with at Olive Garden. How are you thinking about what you need to do to your current and your future boxes? Thank you and good luck. Gene Lee : Yes, Brett. As we get the share information pretty lagging, so we\u2019re usually a quarter behind to see what kind of share we\u2019ve gained in Olive Garden and Longhorn. So I really can\u2019t really comment on that. I would assume that we\u2019ve gained share based on based on the industry data. I mean, because we\u2019re looking at total industry, so a lot of restaurants were shut down. As far as our boxes, and I think the biggest thing that we\u2019re looking at right now and I mentioned this earlier, is that we, believe the off-premise experience will be driven by Curbside enabled by technology. We were on a pathway in our big brands to really developed space that\u2019s consumer facing to deal off-premise experience where the consumer came into the building to get it. So now we\u2019re looking at that and we\u2019re trying to develop ways to adapt the current facilities to make that space non-consumer facing and closer to the kitchen so it should actually cost less longer term as we make these adjustments. We have just built the new prototype in Orlando for all of Garden with a dedicated consumer facing off-premise experienced more like a, what I would call, a fast casual type restaurant/and now we\u2019ve determined that\u2019s not necessary, so that\u2019s good news on that [indiscernible]. And so, our team is working real hard to figure out what these adjustments will look like, they will target those investments in the high volume off-premise locations and they\u2019ll react and get that done over the next couple of years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. I don\u2019t think this was touched on in any of the questions. But you did mentioned technology you\u2019re making. And I think it was field level management more effective and more efficient. So I wanted to explore whether that has been fully implemented in the field and the regional manager ranks. And exactly, I guess how big that could be? And then secondly, as you do think about repopulating the restaurants, is there a possibility of changing the mix between manager and hourly employees? Do you think you actually may have an opportunity to run more efficient restaurants from a managerial perspective as as we return back to normal? Gene Lee : Hey, John. Good questions. I think from a technology standpoint, there is nothing we\u2019re adding to help our supervision. We\u2019ve got some \u2013 we got management information systems that we\u2019ve been well developed over the years, we continue to evolve those, streamline those, try to get them the most important information that they need to run their businesses. I think the biggest challenge there is how to not giving too much information and parallelism and so I think that will be one thing that I think Rick will look at in his new role, especially with his technology background as how to fine tune that platform to ensure that they\u2019re getting the information they need, but not too much information. As far as the team member management mix. I don\u2019t see any gain, we\u2019ve always been efficient maybe more efficient than I think a lot of our competitors are at that level. We use key employees to supplement as a supplement to management but also as a development program is a gateway into our management program. So I think we\u2019re pretty lean there and I don\u2019t see our technology is going to change that at all. I mean I\u2019m always going to want a Management person in the business, in the facility leading, these large groups of people. I think the difference in casual dining and I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why it doesn\u2019t franchise all that well, these are complex businesses with lots of team members. And if you\u2019re not doing this business over the counter. And the one thing that off-premise has added is, added more complexity as you\u2019re dealing with 10 or 12 at a time in your parking lot as you bring in the food out. So the businesses in some ways getting more complex as you try to deliver food through different channels. So I don\u2019t see a whole lot of cost savings there. John Ivankoe : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Gregory Francfort : Hey, thanks. I\u2019ll keep it brief. I just had a follow-up to Palmer\u2019s question about the menu. And can you maybe talk about from two quarters ago to today. How your thoughts might have changed on re-expanding the menu. You shrunk it quite a bit and I think customers are okay with that. Are they still okay with it and just have you stock on re-expanding it change at all? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes, good question, Greg. I think that \u2013 obviously, we shrunk it for many reasons, primarily supply chain and then just from a labor productivity standpoint. We\u2019ve been very judicious as we brought the products back. We think we\u2019ve through our turf studies we think that we\u2019ve satisfied everybody on the \u2013 any consumer and offer them places that they would want to go and eat specific menu. What we\u2019re really focused on is, eliminating duplicity in the menu where you have a menu item, it does the same thing someone else did. I think that [indiscernible] has a very broadly appealing menu but yet limited number of items you have to figure out what Hill Stoner or Houston\u2019s environment where they touch everything in each category that you might want as a consumer, but they do it with 15 menu items. And so I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do is to ensure that we don\u2019t have duplicative. And I think the example I would use is, in Longhorn as an appetizer you don\u2019t need both wild west shrimp and [indiscernible], it\u2019s the same consumer that\u2019s going to buy the product. And so what we\u2019re working on is, how do we end up with the unique product and a product that you can only get in our restaurant, that\u2019s very craveable and that differentiates you. And having two products that do the same thing and one is not \u2013 one is ubiquitous and one is differentiated, it makes no sense to me. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. So, over time, yes, [indiscernible] product there, yes. But what you have to have, you have to have discipline. And the discipline is, you have to take stuff off. And we have been demonstrating that as an industry over the last 15 years and we need to demonstrate that moving forward. Gregory Francfort : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jared Gardner with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Jared Gardner : Good morning, thanks and congratulations to the team on respected promotions as well. Just a quick one for me. Wanted to get an understanding of the potential opportunity in sort of the family ordering or catering business, is that something that over the long-term, when things normalize and consumers tend to come back to the restaurants, is that another business that can be maybe bigger than it was in the past, as we think about consumers may be adopting more of an at-home occasion and in-restaurant dining occasion? Gene Lee : Yes. We are very strong in that. In Olive Garden already \u2013 obviously, we sell [indiscernible]. So that\u2019s a big part of our business. Where we\u2019re seeing some growth right now is in Cheddar\u2019s with that business with family packs. We\u2019ve also had some success in our upscale brands being able to sell family packs, stakes and size that you can \u2013 that are \u2013 stakes aren\u2019t prepared but the size are prepared and we will give you instructions to reheat. And so we\u2019re calling family meals or family packs that are working very well. So I think it\u2019s something that we had some penetration. In Olive Garden, I think it will be bigger as we move forward. And it provide us an opportunity in some of our other businesses to get in that business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Rutherford with Stephens Inc. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. James Rutherford : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just one quick one for me. Gene with the technology investments that you all have made around online ordering in Curbside, has your view changed at all in terms of the long-term mix of off-premise, where perhaps it doesn\u2019t that being a material higher mix longer term compared to where it was pre-pandemic. Of course, still this is maybe a slight bump but not huge kind of pre and post-pandemic? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes, I think it\u2019s a slight bump from pre-pandemic levels. I think that \u2013 I mean, listen, this was a growing piece of everyone\u2019s business has convenient to became more and more important. Maybe there is an opportunity for us to take more share in Olive Garden than I think, because the experience is going to be so frictionless, but we are going to see what the consumer demand is. What I am confident in, especially on the Olive Garden side and somewhat to Cheddar\u2019s is that, we will have \u2013 we will get our share in this business, we will get our share of the off-premise pie. And I think we\u2019ll do a really good job with it, and it will continue to grow over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks. And I echo the congrats on your promotions. Just two quick ones from me. I wanted to circle back on the labor discussion and you spoke to some tech investments. And I\u2019m curious what role you think server handhelds could play in the coming years with Florida and others potentially moving toward the path to 15 or perhaps there are other adjustments in the service model that you could see, maybe implementing while protecting the guest experience, just curious to get your thoughts there? Gene Lee : Yes, I\u2019m not a big believer in trying to gain too much efficiency on the service side. I mean I think every time you say you\u2019re going to gain efficiency there, you\u2019ve really saying you\u2019re going to cut service. And we are full service restaurant. So when I think about the handhelds and technology for the service, I\u2019m thinking more about speed of service for our guest than saving money. I just \u2013 I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and I just \u2013 every time I\u2019ve tried to increase the efficiency in that part of the restaurant it doesn\u2019t end well for me. And so I am committed to keeping the service levels up. I think service is a big part of the value equation, that\u2019s a differentiator when you come into our restaurant versus go into a fast casual or fast food is, we got to provide a service. And there is a level that you\u2019re going to, you want to get to that minimum level, you want to do a better than your competitors and you want to earn your business that way. So I see the technology solution more as a benefit to the consumer not a benefit to us from a cost standpoint. Brian Vaccaro : Understood. Alright, that\u2019s helpful. And then shifting gears, quickly on the store margins, Rick, could you provide a little more perspective on the other OpEx line. Some more specifics on costs that are starting to normalize versus the lower spend levels in your fiscal Q2? And it looks like your guidance for Q3 and bed store margins that are in the ballpark of Q2. I know you mentioned emergency pay but, are there other changing cost dynamics that we should be mindful of, specifically in Q3 versus Q2? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Brian. The one cost that will continue to go up is repairs and maintenance. As I mentioned, we have dine in\u2019s closed, we don\u2019t have as much beating of our dining room. So we have \u2013 we\u2019ll have R&M start to tick up and it already started to tick up in Q2 as dining rooms reopen it also gives us the time to actually do some of that repair and maintenance while the dining are close. So we will have some of that coming up. Utilities go up as your dining rooms open and you\u2019ve got more utilities going that way. But again that\u2019s all contemplated in everything that we have in our guidance. Brian Vaccaro : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the questions and also congratulations to all. My first one is a quick one on LTOs in marketing. You mentioned that your marketing dollars would largely recover post-COVID. Do you expect to go back to the same sort of cadence you had on LTOs, are you rethinking kind of your promotional strategy longer term? Gene Lee : We\u2019re totally rethinking our promotional strategy and how to effectively use that. There was a lot of good in what we did and we\u2019ve realized there was a lot of bad in what we did. And there\u2019s a lot of activity that goes into those. And as we evaluate that after the fact we believe there is a better way to do that. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not going to do LTOs, but we\u2019ve been out of them \u2013 we were out of LTOs and LongHorn for almost 2 years, pre-pandemic. And we have been able to make that adjustment. As we look at Olive Garden, we will continue to try to figure out what\u2019s the best way to use our scale advantage and market that business effectively, but also considering do we need to do six LTOs a year or are there other ways to do that more effectively. Jake Bartlett : Got it. And then my last \u2013 my second and last question is, you talked about improvements to the business and kind of coming out of COVID I think it was a better business model. How do you think about or I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re ready yet to talk about it, but how do you think about the long-term growth algorithm that you\u2019ve talked about in the past as it pertains to unit growth, or maybe margin expansion opportunities. Are we still kind of thinking the 7% to 10% EBIT growth or you think we should think about that differently longer term? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jack, this is Rick. I think if you \u2013 as you think about our long-term framework, we haven\u2019t adjusted our long-term framework. So as of now, we still believe we can get to those numbers over the long run. But as we\u2019ve always said, any one year could be above or below that. And so I would hope that FY\u201922 would be above that, because of where we were in FY\u201921, but in FY\u201921 and we\u2019re going to be below it. So in the long run, which is what we talk about to all of our investors and to all of you. We believe we can hit our long-term framework. And I will remind everybody that we\u2019ve been a public company since 1995. We\u2019ve never had a 10-year period where our average annual TSR has been below 10%. And even when \u2013 fiscal period. So even last year when we had the worst fourth quarter I think of any industry and of any one at least for us, we still had a 10-year TSR of over 10% on average. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Great, thank you so much for squeezing me in. And let me just add my congrats to the three of you as well. I was just curious if you could give us some thoughts around how you are broadly thinking about the dividend? I know you mentioned sort of 50% payout relative to this quarter\u2019s EPS. So just in light of the upcoming guidance and some of the continued volatility that we\u2019re seeing in the external environment, how should we anticipate the dividend sort of progressing going forward? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes, Priya. As we know the dividends are important to our shareholders. We also know that the dividend policy is important to our bondholders. And as you think about our dividend and what we do, we typically set it within our long-term framework of 50% to 60% of our earnings. And the quarter that we just ended was at the low end of that, at 50%. We\u2019re going to continue to work with the Board on what our dividend is going forward, but going farther than this quarter, it\u2019s kind of hard for me to say, because the board is the one that decides a dividend, but we did contemplate what we think our guidance was in Q3 when we set our dividend in Q2. So we always look forward to see what we think our cash flows are going to be to ensure that the dividend is safe. And so that\u2019s why we set the dividend of $0.37 this quarter. Priya Ohri-Gupta: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Gene Lee : Thanks, Priya. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s Q&A session for the call. I would like to turn it back over to Mr. Kalicak. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you everyone for participating. That concludes our call for today. I\u2019d like to remind you that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday, March 23, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you and happy holidays. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Rick will give an update on our four operating priorities and Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for the fourth quarter and a partial outlook for fiscal 2022. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. It's hard to believe it\u2019s been a year since the pandemic began to significantly impact our business. When I reflect back on everything that has transpired, it is clear to me the strategy we developed six years ago provided a strong foundation to help us navigate this period of unprecedented change and uncertainty. Our portfolio of iconic brands has been focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy while leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results oriented culture. And while our four competitive advantages were critical to our business and operational success this past year, our significant scale and results oriented culture have played an outsized role in our ability to emerge stronger. Our significant scale enabled us to quickly react to the turbulent operating environment. The depth and breadth of our supply chain relationships ensured that we could adjust our product supply as needed without experiencing any significant interruptions. We have our own dedicated distribution network, and the assurance of an uninterrupted supply chain provided consistency and a high level of certainty for our operators. Our scale also enabled us to significantly accelerate the development of online ordering and several other digital initiatives and cascade them across our brands quickly and effectively. The robust expansion of our digital platform over the past year has provided us a richer set of first-party data on new and existing guest. Finally, our scale provided us with multiple levers to pull to ensure we have the liquidity we needed during the early days of COVID-19. As soon as our liquidity needs were solved for, our brands were able to focus on strengthening their value propositions and transforming their business models. As our Founder, Bill Darden said, the greatest competitive advantage our company has is the quality of our employees evidenced by the excellent job they do every day. Throughout this past year, Darden and our brands have emerged stronger and our success is a direct result of our team members and their relentless commitment to delivering safe and exceptional guest experiences. That is why we've continued to invest in our team members throughout the past year. Since March of 2020, we've invested more than $200 million in our people through programs such as paid sick leave. COVID-19 emergency pay and covering insurance payments and benefit deductions for team members who were furloughed. These investments also include our recent decision to provide all hourly restaurant team members up to four hours of paid time off for the purpose of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, these investments include the one-time bonus we announced today totaling approximately $17 million, which will impact nearly 90,000 hourly team members. As we continue to grow our business and welcome guests back into our restaurants, continuing to attract and retain the best talent in the industry will be critical to our success. While we're proud that on average, our hourly restaurant team members earn more than $17 per hour today, which includes our servers and bartenders who earn more than $20 an hour. I'm excited about the announcement we made this morning. Beginning Monday, every hourly team member tipped and non-tipped will earn at least $10 per hour, inclusive of tip income. Additionally, we are committed to raising that amount to $11 per hour in January 2022 and to $12 per hour in January 2023. These investments further strengthen our industry leading employment proposition. Lastly, I continue to be impressed and inspired by our team members who have shown extraordinary resilience and passion during the past year. Once again, I thank you for your commitment to delivering exceptional guest experiences in our dining room and through curbside to go. You are the heart and soul of our company. And on behalf of the management team, we're extremely grateful to you. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. As Gene said, it's hard to believe we've been operating in this environment for a year. In addition to executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy, our restaurant teams have continued to successfully manage this \u2013 through this situation by remaining focused on the four key priorities we established at the onset of the pandemic : One, ensuring the health and safety of our team members and guests. Two, simplifying operations and strengthening execution. Three, deploying technology to improve the guest experience. And four, transforming our business model. The health and safety of our team members and guests remains our top priority. Throughout the past year, our team members have done a fantastic job of upholding our safety protocols while taking great care of our guests. Today, even as restrictions are easing in some parts of the country, we continue to follow our enhanced safety measures. This includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring masks for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols. Our second priority has been to continue finding ways to simplify our operations and drive in-restaurant execution at each of our brands. This environment gave us a once in a lifetime opportunity to evaluate every aspect of how we operate and make decisions we would not have been able to do in a normal operating environment. A good example of this work, all of our brands have done to streamline menus and remove low preference or low satisfaction items. This focus makes it easier for our restaurant teams to consistently execute our highest preference items, which means we are serving our most popular dishes to more guests. In fact, a year ago, the top 10 entrees at Olive Garden accounted for about 48% of guest preference. And today they account for approximately 55%. Reducing the bottom selling items eliminates distractions and allows us to execute at a high level. We have dramatically reduced low volume items, which reduces the need to prepare them saving time and reducing food waste. For example, at LongHorn Steakhouse, the number of total items with less than 1% preference is down to eight from more than 25, pre-COVID. Third, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience and build on the progress we have made over the last 12 months. When the pandemic began and our dining rooms were closed, we were able to quickly roll out online ordering at our brands that had yet to deploy it. We also streamlined the curbside to go pick up process by rolling out the Curbside I'm Here text message notification feature. So guests can easily alert us when they arrive. These technology enhancements and other process improvements helped Olive Garden achieve new all time high guest satisfaction ratings for delivering on-time and accurate off-premise experiences during a quarter that included three busy off premise days, Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day. In fact, Valentine's Day was our highest sales day since the start of the pandemic. Also during the quarter, several brands including Olive Garden and LongHorn implemented enhancements to their websites to streamline the online checkout process. This resulted in a meaningful reduction in order abandonment rates. Our continuous digital transformation is resonating with our guests. In fact, during the quarter, nearly 19% of total sales were digital transactions. Further 50% of all guests checks were settled digitally, either online or on our tabletop tablets or via MobilePay. We have made great strides in our digital journey over the past year, and we will continue to strengthen our digital platform and provide our brands with the tools to compete more effectively. And finally, the investments we've made to simplify our business through menu and process simplification have resulted in significant transformation of our business model. For example, across Darden, our hourly labor productivity has improved by over 20% with some brands improving by well over 30% such as Cheddar's. We thought it would be helpful to provide a bit more insight into what the business model transformation has done to Cheddar's P&L, year-to-date through the third quarter Cheddar's has grown the restaurant level margins by over 300 basis points and a year-to-date sales retention of 75%. When Cheddar's reaches 100% of the pre-COVID sales, we expect that restaurant level margins to be well in the high teens, while we don't intend to continue to provide this level of detail in the future this illustration helps to highlight the business model improvements our brands are making. As we have mentioned previously, the simplifications across all of our businesses are expected to result in 150 basis points of margin improvement with 90% of pre-COVID sales. Our business model transformation also strengthens our belief in our ability to open value creating new restaurants across all of our brands. Due to this transformation, the sales required to exceed our return expectations are much lower today. In fact, we opened six new restaurants during the quarter, and each is exceeding our expectations. Before I hand it over to Raj, I want to conclude by saying thank you to our team members. As Gene said, our success is a direct result of their hard work. Being of service is at the heart of our business and our team members demonstrate that every day through their commitment to our guests and each. Raj? Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. For the third quarter, total sales for $1.73 billion, a decrease of 26.1%. Same restaurant sales decreased 26.7%. EBITDA was $236 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.98. Turning to this quarter of P&L food and beverage expenses were 80 basis points higher than last year primarily driven by investments in food quality and mix. Restaurant labor was 20 basis points higher. As Gene mentioned, we invested approximately $17 million in team member bonuses this quarter. Excluding the team member bonuses, restaurant labor would have been 80 basis points favorable to last year. The favorability to last year was driven by hourly labor improvement of 280 basis points due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications Rick discussed. The hourly labor improvement was partially offset by de-leveraging management labor due to sales declines. Restaurant expense for operating week was 16% lower than last year driven by lower workers' compensation, utilities, repairs and maintenance expense. Restaurant expenses as a percent of sales was 250 basis points higher than last year due to sales de-leverage. Marketing spend was $52 million lower than last year with total marketing 200 basis points favorable to last year. This all does altered in restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.4%, only 150 basis points below last year. Excluding the one-time hourly team member bonus, restaurant level EBITDA margin would have been even stronger at 19.4%. We impaired one Yard House restaurant this quarter resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million. This location was in Portland, Oregon and had been temporarily closed since April. Turning to G&A we finalized the legal recovery during the quarter resulting in favorable of $16 million. This favorability was partially offset by $8.8 million of mark-to-market expense on our different compensation. Excluding these two items, G&A would have been $86 million this quarter. As a reminder, the mark-to-market expense is related to significant appreciation in both the Darden share price and equity market this quarter, and due to the way we hedge this expense it is mostly offset on an after tax basis. Page 13 of this quarter's presentation illustrates the $8.8 million reduction of operating income and corresponding operating income margin reduction of 50 basis points from mark-to-market expense. Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $7.2 million resulting in a net reduction to earnings after tax this quarter of $1.6 million. Our effective tax rate of 2.3% this quarter was unusually low due to two factors : first, the tax benefit from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned reduces the tax rate by 5 percentage points. Second, the stock option exercises this quarter drove approximately $7 million of excess tax benefit. Reducing the tax rate by 4.8 percentage points, after adjusting for these factors our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter would have been 12.1%. Looking at our segment performance this quarter, Olive Garden saw segment profit margin increase versus last year despite sales declines. Our continued focus on simplified operations, which significantly reduced direct labor combined with lower marketing expenses, drove this margin improvement. Segment profit margin declined for Longhorn as higher than average beef inflation and other investments drove higher food and beverage expense. In addition, both labor and restaurant expenses were higher as a percent of sales due to sales de-leverage. Segment profit margin declined for fine dining and other segments due to de-leverage across the P&L from the significant sales decline year-over-year. We generated over $240 million of free cash flow this quarter ending the third quarter with our $990 million in cash. Our recent performance has given us better visibility into the durability of our cash flows. Therefore, we will return to our 50% to 60% dividend payout target applied to future earnings to determine our dividend. To that end, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share matching our pre-COVID dividend level. The ability to resume pre-COVID dividend levels just 12 months after suspending is a testament to the strength of our business model and the durability of our cash flows. And finally, today we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $500 million, which replaces all previous authorizations Turning to the fourth quarter; as of today, we have 99% of our dining rooms open with some capacity. This morning, we provided sales plans for the first three weeks of the quarter, in which we saw a week-to-week sales improvements. As the vaccine roller progressed, dining room capacity increased, and consumers began receiving stimulus checks. Taking that all into consideration we currently expect for the fourth quarter total sales of approximately $2.1 billion; EBITDA between $345 million and $360 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $1.60 and $1.70 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares. We've also updated our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be between $285 million and $295 million, and we anticipate opening 33 net new restaurants for the year. We continue to believe we can achieve pre-COVID EBITDA dollars on 90% of pre-COVID sales resulting in 150 basis points of EBITDA margin growth, and our Q4 outlook falls within this framework. As we move beyond the fourth quarter, there are additional costs such as training, travel, growth costs, incremental marketing and other investment that we expect will need to come back into the P&L. And while it's too early to provide insights into fiscal 2022 sales and earnings, we did want to provide some preliminary guidance on a few items. We expect total capital spending between $350 million and $400 million and open approximately 35 new desiccant sent in fiscal 2022. We also anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 12% to 13% for fiscal 2022. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a clarification first, the \u2013 that [indiscernible] thinking about 150 basis points of margin expansion permanently, did that contemplate these labor investments that you're making? That clarification would be helpful. But my question is really about the seating currently, and you're thinking about the meaningfulness of recent weeks. The seating capacity you mentioned you have partial dining rooms in 99% of the restaurants or locations, but how much of the seating is available currently? And how much do you think that that is holding back comps? And Gene, my follow-up, which I'll just say right now, it looks like these off-premise numbers are very strong. The mix is very high, even as people get more comfortable, are you rethinking the stickiness of that off-premise business and I'll pass it on? Thanks. Gene Lee : Good morning, David. Yes, the labor investments we made is embedded in the 150 basis points improvement. We think we can make at 90% of sales; so that is inclusive there. We'll talk about the dining capacity. Basically, the way our dinings are laid out, LongHorn has an advantage over Olive Garden and its utilization because of the number of boosts. But the way to think about it is, we're somewhere between 50% and 60% capacity inside the dining room depending on the particular four plan, and so there's still limitations of availability inside our restaurants. As long as we're following the CDC guidelines, it doesn't matter what the local municipalities are doing. And we believe right now, it's in our best interest, our team members' best interest with the priority of their health and safety for our team members and our guests to continue to follow the CDC guidelines. And so we think about our dining room somewhere between 50% and 60%, 65% depending on the individual floor plan off premise stickiness. Let me just \u2013 let me start off by saying, I am incredibly impressed with what our team has done to improve our capabilities in the off-premise experience. The digital experience is getting better every single day, it's being adopted, I thought in Rick's prepared remarks, he talked about 19% of our total sales now being digital. I think that's really impressive. I do believe that as more as we get to offer more capacity and we see this in individual restaurants that the off premise will start to fall off. I think why the capacity is limited, and there's still a lot of people out there that aren't fully vaccinated. There's still good demand for the off premise. I believe that because of our capabilities that we've developed during the pandemic and our vision for how those capabilities will continue to improve in the future, that our off-premise business will still be robust when it's all said and done. I can't tell you today what that percentage is going to be. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks for the question. Gene wanted to ask a bit more about any kind of regional differences that you might be seeing. I think you gave some interesting color there on CDC guidelines being the capacity constraint in most cases for your restaurants. But curious by region, by state, if you're seeing a notable difference in performance based on those state restrictions, and then just kind of following-up on that as it relates to off premise where you do have greater capacity in select restaurants or states, if that off premise looks a whole lot different than it does across the system on average? Thank you. Gene Lee : Well, obviously we're only at 25% capacity in California, which is \u2013 that's pretty restrictive there. So, yes, our takeout percentage is higher in California. So I would say it's still pressure on the coast, both coasts, especially the North \u2013 Northeast part of the country. You're still seeing mobility, not as great as it is and what I would call from Arizona all the way over to Carolinas where I think mobility is much greater and the consumer is much more willing to get out and move around. So there's difference in sales there. But every day, I mean, this is very dynamic folks. This is changing daily as more and more people get vaccinated, more and more people get become confident in their ability to be mobile. And it's getting to the point where, I think we're cautiously optimistic and excited about what's going to transpire here over the next few months and maybe few years. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Operator : Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open Jeff Farmer : Sorry, just looking for a little bit of a follow-up call here. So just in terms of looking at to go sales, I'm curious what you've learned in terms of the nature of these customers? Are they new customers that are \u2013 are there new customers? Are they existing customers driving increased frequency? I'm just curious what you guys are seeing in terms of, who's actually driving these very strong to go sales levels? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Jeff, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. In regards to those sales and who's driving it, you know, at the start of the pandemic we saw a lot of new customers. A lot of new ones coming in and then hadn't been to our restaurants before and the frequency with which they reordered was pretty high. We're still seeing those new customers but everybody is ordering to go, right? If you came into the dining room and the dining room is full, you may just walk over to the go station in order. But the frequency of our newer customers was higher and is higher than the frequency of our existing customers. We are really happy with what we've done as Gene mentioned with the technology that we put in to go business. It is helping to get some younger people in our restaurants or to order to go what we've done with car side to go and curbside here has made it so much easier for people to come pick up. And so we feel really good about the customers we're getting and the information we're gleaning from them. Jeff Farmer : Thank you. Operator : Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Gene, my first one is just that the comment about the 50% to 60% capacity in terms of following the CDC guidelines. As we look at restrictions easing across the country, do they \u2013 do they really matter or should we just really kind of think about just the overall guidance from the CDC, as we think about your capacity and increasing? Gene Lee : Yes. I mean, I think it's a very interesting question. I think we're hoping the CDC comes along with the consumer and the consumer behavior. We feel right now; it's still prudent to follow that guidance. Then there may be a point where we determined that guidance is out of date. And I think with the consumer in a certain marketplace, but it's too early to tell. Right now we believe that the best course of action is to continue to follow the CDC guidelines. And just back on the 50% to 60% capacity one of the things you really lose in like on a LongHorn box is that those two or three deep standing at the bar waiting for tables that's not there. So that's kind of included in that lack of capacity that we have right now. We're still asking guests to wait outside and not corrugating our lobbies. So there's revenue that we're losing \u2013 we're losing there too. So I think here in the near term, I think it's \u2013 let's follow the CDC guidelines and let's see if some other leading indicators around COVID cases and the death rate continue to decline, and then we'll continue to reevaluate as we move forward. Jake Bartlett : Got it. Thank you. And then I have a question about the fourth quarter guidance and maybe in the context of the weekly the same facility that you gave in the last week was obviously very strong and positive. I believe the guidance is implying, I'm still lower, I think about 8% or 9% lower average weekly sales in the fourth quarter versus 2019. So I think you're expecting the deceleration from current levels. Maybe if you can just talk about that in, if there was anything abnormal about this last week in relation to 2019? Gene Lee : Well, yes, with the government \u2013 the government sent a bunch of chucks to a lot of people. I mean, you know, we use a lot of stimulus in the marketplace is that there's multiple variables that are transpiring, right? So we've got stimulus being sent out. We've got vaccinations increasing and we've got the virus declining. What we can't do is really tease out which one of those variables is driving this. We believe that stimulus is a really big part of maybe the backend of 2014 and weakening 2014 and the weekend 321. And so we don't have that stimulus in our outlook for the rest of the quarter. We know from history of that phage and this was a big, this was a big, this was a big stimulus package. So we'll see how long it lasts, but right now we're thinking that it tails here pretty quickly. Jake Bartlett : Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Gonzalez : Hey, thanks for the question. Just maybe a margin question. I think your guidance is implying, some of the \u2013 one of the highest EBITDA margins we've seen, possibly in some time. So can you maybe talk about what's one-time what's sustainable in terms of that guidance? Clearly there's some marketing savings and obviously the 150 basis points that we talked about in the G&A setting. But maybe you can go through that, and what part of the upside too recent trends \u2013 recent margin trends is sustainable going forward. Thanks. Yeah. Raj Vennam : Hi Eric, this is Raj. Thanks for the question. So when you think about the margin I think it depends on really where the sales levels are. And as I mentioned in the pre prepared remarks, there are some costs that have to come back into the P&L and that will come back, but it's not like we're going to ramp up those costs as fast as the sales are coming back here, right? So as you look at Q4; one, I want to point out Q4 generally is our highest or one of his higher, an EBITDA margin then the annual average combine that with the fact that we have this decent acceleration in sales from Q3 to Q4, and some of these costs we're talking about will come back over time as we go beyond Q4. And when you think about at the 90 plus percent sales levels, if you, not saying that he's the discrete cutoff, but if you think about it, that level it's really marketing and labor are two big contributors positively as a percent of sales. And then the offs \u2013 partially offset by food costs going up. That's where we have made some investments. We've all along made investments into the value proposition for the guests. And that we'll continue to do that too. So we feel like at those levels, marketing and labor will help food will take away from it. Personal expenses are probably going to be relatively flat, maybe a slightly off by 10 basis points. And then G&A, we should be flat at 90% given the reduction we've done on the G&A. As we grow from there we do think some of those sales will come \u2013 some of those costs will come back in. And I think we're still not saying the margins are going to go down any further, but we do want to maintain the 150 and see what we can do, but some of these things are going to play out based on the environment and the economic backdrop. Eric Gonzalez : Thanks. Operator : Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. The primary question is just on the wage rates, obviously encouraging to see you seemingly setting a floor for the hourly team members. I'm just wondering how large of an investment is this $10 to assure all people make at least $10 an hour and be more broadly. Gene, what are your thoughts on the likelihood of more of a national hourly and tipped employee wage increase? Maybe you can just share what your approach has been in terms of pricing or profitability in the states that are already out these at these elevated levels. And then I had one follow-up? Gene Lee : Hey, good morning, Jeff. We're not going to \u2013 we'll all say about the cost of this is covered in our guidance. And we're not going to get into the specific costs of implementing this program. As far as wage rates are nationally, I mean, there's a lot of momentum here. I think that there's momentum for a bipartisan group to get to a solution that, I think everybody can live with. I think that our focus is more on protecting the tip wage. We think that is \u2013 we think that is extremely important for the overall restaurant business, we think it's extremely important for both constituents. The server doesn't want that relationship to change with the consumer and the consumer doesn't want that relationship to change with the server. And so our focus and working with the powers to be is explaining how this relationship works and the importance of this relationship. And I would point to the fact that our average server earn or our average tipped employee earns greater than $20 per hour. And you think that's an average, so you think about as these servers develop their skill set and become \u2013 and their capabilities and become very competent. They have the opportunity to earn well above $20 per hour once they become proficient at what they're doing, and I think that's important to note. I also think it's very important to note that if the tip wage was to be eliminated, the current compensation model for servers would have to change. The industry would change that, the way people are compensated and it's my belief over time that those people would be compensated less, not more. On wage, I would just end with that, I believe that we're really well positioned to manage through any changes here. We've been able \u2013 we've been managing structural wage changes for years, and we do that to improve productivity. We do that through pricing, but we've been able to manage that effectively, and I believe that we're well positioned to manage whatever changes come out of Washington or out of the individual states as we move forward. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just to follow-up \u2013 just as you mentioned marketing as one of the big helps in terms of the margin opportunity. I'm just wondering, I think you said it was down $50-plus million in the third quarter or a couple of hundred basis points. Just wondering how you're thinking about that recovery, whether it's the fiscal fourth quarter or just qualitatively, how you think about fiscal 2022? Maybe your thoughts on various marketing channels for investment or whether there are some permanent savings opportunities as maybe you shift away from some of the more expensive channels? Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes, Jeff, I think right now the way we're thinking about is we don't have any definitive plans as we move forward. We really need to understand what the competitive environment is. And then we have to really evaluate all the different channels and which is the most effective channel for each of the businesses, which I believe are very different. And then we'll have to, if we need to layer it back in, we'll have to make the decision on what's the highest ROI investment that we can make for each of the businesses. And so we have \u2013 we have some contingency plans are redeveloped. We know what levers would pull in different environments. But right now we think we're spending at the appropriate level. We're still spending some good money in Olive Garden. We bought the up fronts. We're still running some very good television. I really liked the creative; I think the team's done a very good job on the creative. And so I think we're getting across great messaging. So it's not like we've cut all advertising. We're still in some digital channels. We're still spending money on search. We think we're spending at the appropriate levels right now, and we'll continue to evaluate as we move forward. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thanks for the color. Operator : Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Chris Carril : Hi, good morning. So clearly you've used the opportunity over the last year to find efficiencies in the business and lean further into digital. How are you thinking about the composition of your brand portfolio now longer term in the context of all the improvements that you've discussed recently? And again this morning and how an enterprise level you're position to potentially add brands and further leverage the scale of bandages you've built? Gene Lee : Yes. We love our brands today. I think that some of our brands that were, maybe I wouldn't say they're underperforming, they may be underperforming our expectations because against the broader competitive set they were at the midpoint or even better than that. But the moves that were made and the structural changes to these business has this really excited and more \u2013 and we think more about growth for some of our brands that probably didn't hadn't earned the right to have a lot of new capital invested in them because the returns weren't as competitive inside our portfolio. And we had better alternatives, that's going to change a little bit. So we're a little \u2013 we're more excited about the potential growth of these brands. As far as M&A goes, I mean, I know I'm going to give you the standard answer that we continue to have conversations with a board and look at opportunities, and I really can't say much more than that on that subject at this point. Chris Carril : Thank you. Operator : James Rutherford with Stephens. Your line is open. James Rutherford : Thanks Gene. As guests started to come back into your restaurants, had you noticed any differences in their behavior or they lingering longer ordering more drinks and appetizers more or less expensive entrees, et cetera. I'm just kind of wondering if there's any noteworthy changes to guests behavior that you're seeing as a pattern. Gene Lee : No. I don't think it's any noteworthy behavior. I mean, I think in certain markets people \u2013 it's amazing people get their vaccination. The first thing they do is they go to a restaurant, even though there's probably should wait a few days for the vaccination to be. But I mean, there's just, I mean, there are a lot of people that this is, we're noticing especially near vaccination sites, that this is their first time out in a year, and they're just so excited to be back. And it just, you can tell because you see in some larger groups of senior citizens that just happy to be back out, having a dining experience. So no major changes, other than people are happy. I mean, people are happy to be out and it's definitely noticeable. There's a good vibes in our restaurants right now. James Rutherford : Well, that's great to hear. And as a follow-up on curbside, can you give an update on how much of your system is offering curbside today and the initiatives around, I think geo-fencing, dedicated doors to the kitchen or any of the things you're doing to make this hyper convenient channel kind of even better than it is today? Rick Cardenas : Hey James, this is Rick. On the curbside experience, all of our brands are offering curbside. Now there might be a few restaurants here and there that might be within in malls, et cetera, that it's hard to do, but all of our restaurants offer curbside today. They all have the curbside, I'm here feature where you can text \u2013 well you'll get a text 10 minutes before their pick-up time to tell the restaurant that they're here. And so they all have that. Once we implement a technology that works, we blow it out in all the restaurants. As regards to kind of the building design and change, we are looking at some changes to prototypes as we build new restaurants, to make it a little bit more convenient for our team to bring the food out to the cars. But there is still a high percentage of people that are picking up in the restaurant that maybe ordering the restaurant and pick-up, or they just want to walk in and maybe sit at the bar for a minute to watch TV. And while they're to go is being prepared. So we have to keep an in-restaurant type of experience for them as well. So we're looking at that. In regards to making a bunch of modifications to our existing restaurants, we're thinking about that as we see our restaurants start to build back-up in the dining room. We're just trying to figure out the most efficient way to make changes, whether it's in the kitchen to give them more, more room for packaging, but maybe not having a side door, because we do believe that the guests may still want to come in. So we're working through that. We don't expect to make huge, huge investments in our restaurant \u2013 existing restaurants where to go. We do have some investments to make, but they're not that great. James Rutherford : Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning, everyone. My question is for Raj. I wanted to come back to your comments about costs coming back into the business after the current quarter. And I wanted to understand the implications of that, and are you saying that the math you've laid out with margins of 150 basis points higher at 90% of your prior sales volumes? Will that still hold as these costs come back into the business? Are you going to need higher volumes as per Q4 to hit that 150 basis point bogey? Raj Vennam : No. David, I think we were actually expecting to maintain that margin, so we don't need higher volume to get to that. And then as volume grows, we're saying, we're committed to maintaining that as costs come back in, but we don't think we're going to be diluting margin that 150 basis points is sticky. David Tarantino : Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then I guess my real question then is; how do you see that developing if sales end up going back to 100% or more of what you had previously? I know you're committed to maintaining the 150, but it's our line of sight or a path to exceeding that as more sales flow through the model. And I guess how do you balance that with the investments that you might want to make to sustain the health of the brand longer term? Raj Vennam : Yes, I think that's a great question David. I think the way we're thinking about it is as sales grow, we'll find opportunities to make more investments into guest experience, into food quality. Thinks that we want to do, and we also have talked about trying to price \u2013 continuing to price below inflation and below competition. That's one of our bigger investments that we make. Could you see for a time period where our margins exceed and build off of that? Absolutely. But I think longer term; I think the way we're thinking about it is we don't want it to grow too much. We want to just kind of find ways to set us up for longer-term market share gains, but still have a pretty robust business model. David Tarantino : Great. All make sense. Thank you. Operator : John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass : Hey, thanks very much. I had a question about unit development in your 2022 outlook. Now, given what you said about your success of margin improvement at Cheddar's, what you've seen at Olive Garden, why wouldn't development be faster, I guess specifically as you look at 2022 is sort of a stepping stone to faster in 2023. Is there external constraints on development or is this just internal decision as fast as you want to grow? And since you brought up Cheddar's specifically, right that thesis \u2013 when buying it was, this is a really big growth vehicle for the company. How do you think about development now that Cheddar's margins are better? How many of those 35 are Cheddar's and what do you think that brand can \u2013 what the pace of that bank growth can be thereafter? Gene Lee : Well, this is a couple of couple of questions, John. Driving our ability to only get 35 restaurants next year. Number one, we \u2013 as we entered into COVID, we dismantled the whole development team. And so we spent the last 90 days to 120 days rebuilding that. But that's really not the driving and limiting factor as we move forward next year. The limiting factor is that after we get past letter of intent, every step along the way, and that development process is pretty much slowed down significantly. And it has a lot to do with, people working remotely and we're not able to negotiate a lease as quickly as we once were, but the biggest hang up right now is permitting and getting your plans through permit and getting approvals that you need, getting people out to do your inspections so that you can move along. So I think, the way I would answer is there's external factors that are limiting us, being able to open more restaurants. We have the letters of intent signed. We're just struggled past that point and we hope that we can get to 23. We can get to the higher end of our 2% to 3%. We believe our pipeline is in good enough shape to get there. There's enough availability out there, and we're happy with the construct of the deals. But once we get to pass letter of intent, this thing really slows down significantly and really out of our control. Now I'll just add that over the last couple of weeks, things are starting to pick up a little bit in the local municipalities, and we're starting to get some things done, but we're sitting on a restaurant today that we can't get open, because we're waiting on that last inspection and there's no sense of urgency and that local community to get out there and make that last inspection. As far as Cheddar's, I think the limiter on Cheddar's \u2013 we're thrilled with the business model. The limiter on Cheddar's will still be the human resources. We've got to build the bench strength so that we can get that system up and running. There's a tremendous amount of backfill opportunity. We're seeing the benefits of the backfill opportunity, whereas we're opening some of these new restaurants that we've opened here recently. And so, hopefully we can get Cheddar's somewhere between 7% and 10% unit growth once we get everything to where we want it to be. And I think the benefit of our platform is that we don't have to overtax one of our businesses to get growth. And I always say [indiscernible], and we want to be able to grow this thing responsibly and open great restaurants with great operations, high volume concept that we've simplified, but still difficult to run. Just one last comment on the growth is that, with the transformation of the business model, we think the big upside now is that there's more Olive Gardens than what we may have originally thought. We can handle the cannibalization a lot better today than we could before. And therefore we want to push a little bit harder on Olive Garden and we think, and the returns are just fantastic in that business. So that\u2019s the best place to put our capital. John Glass : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Lauren Silberman : Thanks for the question. I also wanted to ask about the labor investments that you're now specific to the hourly wage increase at least $10. What percentage of your hourly employee base will be impacted by this initiative? I guess what percentage is currently below 10? And does this affect only non-tipped employees? And then are you increasing wages at a commensurate rate across the board? Gene Lee : We don't plan to \u2013 I'll start backwards on this. We don't think there's going to have a \u2013 be a big compression issue. The amount of people this impacts is small. We're not going to give the exact number. And again, as I talked about earlier, it's included in our guidance for the quarter and we included for next year though and what we'll disclose what our wage inflation we're projected to be when we give you 2022 guidance. And it's for all employees. It's basically, if you're a tipped employee, in your tips and your wage doesn't get you to $10, we'll bring you to $10 an hour. Lauren Silberman : Okay. Yes. I just \u2013 I figured that this was primarily going to impact non-tip, because I think generally makes more sense to kind of confirm that. But my follow-up question to that is \u2013 how does your hourly staffing level today compared to pre-COVID levels? I guess January what percentage of your hourly employees you have in the restaurants right now? Gene Lee : We have \u2013 I haven't seen the number for last week. But the week before, we were at a home about 115,000 versus 165,000 active pre-COVID. And that number is increasing every week. And I think our greatest challenge right now is staffing. It's staffing, trying to attract people to come to work. That's why we're strengthening our employment proposition, which is already strong. We've got to staff it. We've got to train people. We'll train people now in a very high volume environment. And so, as I really think about what we're focused on is really Back-to-Basics restaurant operations. And part of that \u2013 one of those things that we focus on there is hiring great people and having great certified trainers that are able to train those people, to bring our brands to life. And so that's our number one, that's really a number one priority right now. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Brett Levy : Great. Thanks for taking the call. If we could follow-up on James' question earlier, what are you seeing from a demographic standpoint given that you guys go up and down the average check continuum? Obviously, we've seen what the LongHorn and the Olive Garden numbers look like. But if you could give us just a little bit more clarity into and color into what you're seeing across different demographics and I'll have a follow-up also. Gene Lee : Yes, I'll just comment on fine dining. Obviously, that's coming back a little bit slower. I would say that fine dining in Suburbia is performing much better than fine dining in the central business districts. We are incredibly impressed with the weekend business in fine dining, even in the central business district. So this business is coming back, it's coming \u2013 we're going to be extremely profitable in this business. But this is going to definitely come back slower than casual. And so there's \u2013 I will just add that we've been pretty impressed the last couple of weeks, how this business has rebounded. Brett Levy : And then just other for Rick or for Raj. When you think about the structural margin, pre-crisis obviously you were one of the industry stalwarts and you're \u2013 you've found efficiencies within the model. When you think two, three, five years out, what do you think is the potential for where you can get to versus where you were pre? And thank you. Raj Vennam : Yes, I think it would be tough for me to sit here and project out five years from now what we think the number could be. But all I'll say is we are definitely committed to getting to this 150. And then beyond that, we still go back to our long-term framework once the \u2013 once we get back to the sales levels we had before, it's about that 10 to 30 basis points margin improvement every year. And we think we can still do that. Brett Levy : Thank you. Operator : Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Your line is open. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you, and good morning. On the CapEx guidance, if I have this right, the number of new stores came down a little bit, but the CapEx is going to be towards the high end of the range. Are you finding incremental projects to spend behind this year? I'm just looking for a little bit of color there. And then, somewhat related a question on technology given all the success that you've had on the digital side, and the ability to kind of look at the business holistically through this last year. Are you identifying or exploring different ways to leverage technology kind of going forward? I'm just curious how we should expect technology to be implemented either from a guest facing or kind of internal perspective over time? Thanks. Raj Vennam : All right. Just let me answer the CapEx one. I'll hand it over to Rick on the technology stuff. So from a CapEx perspective, when you think about our annual CapEx, we're already spending money for next year\u2019s new units, right. So that's why you don't really see CapEx move much, because we're still working on our pipeline, we're still working on next year. The other thing I want to remind you is this year spend is relatively low because some of these units were already built earlier. We spent a lot of CapEx last year, and then we were sitting on these restaurants because when the pandemic hit. So that's the color on CapEx. And then Rick? Rick Cardenas : Thanks, Raj. On the technology front, we are in the process of doing another three-year roadmap for technology. We're going to continue to invest in technology to reduce friction in the guest experience and reduce friction and the team member experience. We've given you some examples of what we've already done this year with shifting everything to curbside, going to Curbside I'm Here. We're actually going to make that process even easier as we keep going forward. We're going to make the process of checking into your \u2013 to the restaurant easier. We're doing a lot of things going forward. Without getting into too much detail, we expect to spend more money in technology than we have this year, and we continue to invest in technology. We think it's an advantage for us. It gives us better access to data, and because of our scale, we can do it. Andrew Strelzik : Thank you very much. Operator : Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good morning. Two quick questions. The first, on being data rich typically guest satisfaction scores are a leading indicator of comp. But if we back that up, I guess I can imagine it's a satisfied employee serving that guest. So maybe you could compare and contrast the metrics that you look at that are, I guess, external for guest satisfaction versus internal for employee satisfaction. And perhaps that was tied to or grounded hourly wage changes that you discussed today. Thanks, Rick Cardenas : Nicole. This is Rick. I'll start with the guest satisfaction metrics. All our brands are improving their guest satisfaction year-over-year from pre-COVID, even with especially because of all of the things that we've done to simplify our business to make it easier for our restaurants to get the product to what they \u2013 get the product to the consumer in the way they want it. We're shifting more of our sales to our top 10 items, which are high satisfaction items. We've improved significantly to go experience, which at the beginning was a pretty low satisfying experience. It's getting better every week. So on the guest side, all the satisfaction measures look great. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks on to go, Olive Garden was at an all time high for on-time and accurate premise experience for the third quarter, even though it was a really high off-premise quarter for them with three big holidays. In the employee metrics, the metric that we look at the most is turnover and our turnover has been great over the last year. And as Gene mentioned, we just introduced another thing to help the employee experience and their process of coming to work for us. We're going to simplify the hiring process as we go forward, but we have just great, a great employment proposition, which leads to our turnover. Those are the two metrics we look at the most. The last thing I'll say, is there some external metrics that we're really proud of for LongHorn? They're now number one in food quality and food taste with all of the investments they made over the last few years. And that's a pretty high bar for us. And we feel really good about the investments they've made and that's what's driving our performance. Nicole Miller : Thank you for that color. And then I think you had mentioned six openings if I wrote that down, I think the question still stands, you talked about exceeding expectations and I want to understand, how much of that is the strategic operational control and excellence you have, and how much was that influenced by the external competitive landscape. And when you first looked at those stores, perhaps there's competitors that just didn't make it across the finish line and didn't open. So how would you compare and contrast that? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Nicole thanks for that. If we look at the six restaurants that we opened in the quarter, and actually restaurants will open this year, their sales levels have been higher than we thought considering we opened some of these restaurants at really hard, 50% capacity limitations. Now that could be because other restaurants didn't open, but we've been performing really well. If you look at our guest satisfaction measures in those restaurants, we've done a really good job in training our people and getting open. And then the other thing, though, I think a bigger part of our performance is actually at the bottom line of the P&L. And these restaurants are performing much better on their P&L than restaurants that we opened a year or two before. And that's because of the simplifications that we have made. Whenever you simplify you really to make it easy for new restaurants, right. When they open, if they open with a full menu and a pretty big dining room, it's hard for them. When they opened with a menu that we have today with a dining room that's a little bit constrained. It makes it easier, but we've also changed some of our training programs, especially in the fine dining brands to make it almost like you're coming into a restaurant that's always been there. And so we've done a really good job in improving the process to open new restaurants. So I would give it \u2013 I would give that much more of the benefit than another restaurant or two that not didn't open during that time. Nicole Miller : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jared Garber : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on maybe comments from last quarter, and as we're thinking about market share opportunities going forward. Gene, are you still thinking that 5% to 15% closure rate on the independent side makes sense, and just wanted to get your thoughts on three months later on how that that environment continues to kind of play out and relatedly, you made some comments on Olive Garden and maybe some more opportunities there. Several years ago, you guys put out some data on a longer-term TAM of, I think, it was 900 to 950 and some TAM on LongHorn as well. How should we be thinking about those opportunities going forward over the long term? Gene Lee : Yes, first of all, on capacity, I think the last printed thing I saw from Technomic was still 5% to 15% tilted toward the higher end. It's my belief that the restaurants in central business districts will get recapitalized a lot \u2013 and be able to come back a lot quicker than what we'll see in Suburbia. And so, I think that there's population is still growing. And just the fact that a lot of new restaurants are going to \u2013 aren't going to be added are also a benefit as we go forward. So I think as far as the capacity part of it, it's still a real good tailwind for the industry. As far as \u2013 what was the number one\u2026. Jared Garber : Yes, the TAM opportunity. Yes. Gene Lee : I think that would \u2013 as you think about that, we're not ready to put a number out there right now. We want to \u2013 the way we think about development is we find the best piece of property that we can find. And then we try to put, what do we think is the best you what \u2013 which restaurant in our brand and our portfolio will maximize the opportunity of that piece of land. And so I think numbers will ebb and flow. But we believe in the next few out years, we're going to get closer to 3% of our framework. That's where we want to be. Operator : John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. Obviously, you guys accomplished so much in 2020 around digital efficient marketing, restaurant operations, reorganization, G&A efficiency, so much, maybe that would have taken you three to five years. Have you been ever to get to some of the metrics that you got, so Gene maybe, this is a question for you and the Board, how are your strategic priorities changing if at all? I mean, as you accomplish so much, that you hope to accomplish over the next three to five years, that some of these initiatives are not fully behind you, at least partially behind you, what might be like the next big ideas that Darden is working on? Gene Lee : Well, I'm not sure what the next big idea is. I think the big thing that we're really cognizant of is how do we fight the gravity to pull us back \u2013 pulling us back towards, what had worked extremely well for us and staying, keeping our eye on the prize of all the gains that we made over the last few year. So I think right now, more importantly than ever, the way I'm thinking about it is Back-to-Basics. We've got to run great restaurants. We've got to be able to execute our food, our service and great atmosphere is if we can do that. I think I always say this simple term. How do we do less better? And I think right now we put our businesses through significant change and I'm in this do less better framework. I want to make sure that we're running great, great restaurants. Strategically, I think the way we're \u2013 we continue to think about it is how do we ensure we get, take this opportunity to get our top line growth to 3%, which is a number we haven't really achieved yet. And 3% doesn't sound like a lot, but that's a lot of new restaurants in our system, absolute numbers, right. When you start adding 50 to 70 restaurants a year that puts a lot of strain on your organization and puts a lot of strain on your human resources. So I like this whole notion of getting narrower, not a lot of strategic change, but let's get into execute, execute, execute. I believe our brands are differentiated enough right now to compete effectively. And it's not a lot of work to be done there. John Ivankoe : Great answer. Thanks Gene. Operator : Andrew Barish with Jefferies. Your line is open. Andrew Barish : Hey guys. I'm sorry if I missed it. But I know you've kind of taking a look at the fluid competitive situation, and it doesn't appear as if it's changing your philosophy on, kind of using price as an investment or pricing below the industry. Can you give us what you're maybe looking at going forward for 2022 or so for the two big brands at least in terms of menu pricing? Gene Lee : Andy, I think it's a little premature to signal what we think that is. I think I would, based on what \u2013 if we start now, I would look at what our norms have been. But one of the things that, we\u2019ve got to \u2013 we'll have to consider is in this dynamic environment, is what do we think inflation is going to be? And it's too early for us to really understand what we think inflation is going to be in our fiscal 2022. So I would just look \u2013 if you're looking for guidance on that, I would look more towards our historical norms at this point. Andrew Barish : Okay. And then a quick follow-up Raj, just on the underlying kind of G&A number, last couple of quarters it's been that $85 million to $90 million, is that a decent run rate going forward at this point, or are we missing some reinvestment back into the business that may come into that line? Raj Vennam : I'd say at this point, think up somewhere around $90 million as a good run rate to start with. And then if that changes, we'll let you know in June. But I think at that point somewhere around $90 million is a good number. Andrew Barish : Okay. Thanks folks. Operator : Howard Penney with Hedgeye. Your line is open. Howard Penney : Thank you so much for the question. My \u2013 the second \u2013 the next quarter, you \u2013 this consensus estimate is for somewhere around 65% comp, which implies sort of a two-year 10% stack, managing the business in a normal year to see 10% growth would be incredible. I would love to hear about how you're managing that kind of acceleration in \u2013 I'm not asking about the comp and whether it's good, just sort of from a middle of the P&L, how do you hire for that and how do you purchase really like how do you manage a business that goes from sort of zero to 60, if you will in comps. Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes. Good morning, Howard. I think that's why I'm trying to narrow the focus of the organization and then really focusing on the Back-to-Basics and trying to eliminate any distraction at all. And I believe that, the priorities right now, especially over the next six to nine months is staffing. How do you ensure your supply chain is growing with the demand and all those other basic things that, that go on every day. And part of why we're making this investment today in our people is to say, thank you, and also to be \u2013 to recruit. We know the people best that the teams with the best people will win in this environment. And we need to attract great people, offer them great opportunities, provide careers for them. But you've identified what our operation \u2013 operating priorities are. Rick in the presence and really need to focus on this. We're monitoring the number of employees in each restaurant every single week. We're monitoring today, the number of servers in each restaurant every day. So we understand, what our staffing levels are and what we need to do to support that. Doug Milanes, our Head of Supply Chain has done an incredible job keeping the supply chain full and keeping that continuity. We also have a lot of sensitive products that we serve. They have to be aged appropriately, which they've done a great job on. And so, we're focused on \u2013 you highlighted our biggest challenge. It's not strategic today, it\u2019s operational. Howard Penney : And you didn't mention training. Is there any incremental training associated with that? Are you going to bring back people that you familiar with the organization? Thank you. Gene Lee : Well, I think, we're going to do both. We're going to try to bring back anybody that's familiar with the organization. But right now I think most of who we're bringing back, well, maybe the exception of California is new people. And so what we do in that circumstance? We've really, we have a certified trainer program that we were able to really energize and connect with these people that are actually doing the training of the new employees in every one of our brands. And they're the key. We've got to give them the tools and the time and the compensation in order to be able to train these new people effectively. And you're pressing on some of the biggest operational challenges as we've ramped this back up. And I think it's right to highlight that. And we're \u2013 I think we're going to \u2013 our teams are going to be up for the task. Operator : Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks. Just two quick ones for me. On advertising, I'm curious if there's been any change in your thinking as to when it makes sense to begin increasing your spend again it's not many, but it seems like a few chains have either have, or soon will be ramping their spend. So just wondering if that is at all impacting your thinking and sorry if I missed it, Raj, but can you ballpark the level of spend that's embedded in your fiscal 4Q guide? Gene Lee : As far as, I mean, and I talked a little bit about this earlier Brian, is we just have no definitive plans right now. And on what we're going to put back in or how we're going to put back in and which channel we're going to put back in advertising. We've got to look at the competitive environment. We've got to see where we're at. I think each brand will come back differently and use different channels that are more effective for them. We're still spending a good amount of money in Olive Garden on advertising today. We bought a lot of television in the upfront. We think that's an effective medium for us. And so we'll continue to spend that. I'm very happy with the creative. And so, this is what I would call a game time decision. We will \u2013 when it's right to call that play, we'll call that play. But right now we have no definitive plans to do that. Raj Vennam : And Brian, just for Q4 ballpark, I would expect similar levels as Q3, somewhere around $25 million. Brian Vaccaro : Okay, great. And then I also just wanted to touch base on the commodity outlook. What are your expectations over the next few quarters from an inflation perspective? And you can touch on some of the more significant puts and takes within your basket? Raj Vennam : Yes. We're not ready to get into fiscal 2022 yet, but I will tell you in fiscal \u2013 for Q4, we do expect our commodity inflation to be a little bit higher at around 2% for the entire basket with, I think there's a little bit more in chicken, and there's a little bit more in \u2013 actually oil is one where we think it's going to be pretty high. There are multitude of factors that are impacting oil, as you might already be aware, but those are the ones I can call out. Brian Vaccaro : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Kevin Kalicak for final remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Great. Thanks, Jack. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind everyone, we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 24 before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks again for participating today. Operator : This concludes the Darden fiscal year 2021 third quarter earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of those measurements are included in the presentation. Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing fourth quarter performance as a comparison to our fourth quarter of fiscal '19 and the annual reference to pre-COVID is the trailing 12 months, ending February of fiscal '20. This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic impact on the business as dining rooms closed and we pivoted to go only model during the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. We plan to release fiscal '22 first quarter earnings on September 23 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks, Rick will give an update on our operating performance, and Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for fiscal '22. Now I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, we had a very strong quarter that exceeded our expectations as sales quickly accelerated from the third quarter. During our call a year ago, I talked about the resiliency of the full-service dining segment and the confidence we had in the industry's ability to bounce back from the impacts of the pandemic, and we've begun to see demand come back at strong levels. As we think about the industry, our consumer insights team has done a lot of good work to better understand the size of the full-service dining segment. There are multiple sources of data that offers sales estimates for the restaurant industry, and the size of the industry and the full-service industry, specifically varies considerably across these sources. This year, we are adopting Technomic as our data source, which we believe better reflects the sales contribution from independent operators, provides a broader view of the restaurant industry, and aligns more closely with the census data. Going forward, we will be referencing industry data provided by Technomic, which sizes the casual dining and fine dining categories for fiscal 2020 at $189 billion and for fiscal 2019 at $222 billion. Given the strong demand we're seeing in the financial health of the consumer, we believe the categories will return to that size or greater despite having approximately 10% fewer units than before the onset of the pandemic. Over the last 15 months, we have made numerous strategic investments. At the restaurant level, we've invested in food quality and portion size that will help strengthen long-term value perceptions for each brand. We also made considerable investments in our team members to ensure our employment proposition remains a competitive advantage. And we invested in technology, particularly within our To Go capabilities, to meet our guests' growing need for convenience and desire for the off-premise experience. Our business model has evolved and is much stronger today. As we begin our new fiscal year, we will remain disciplined in our approach to growing sales, more specifically, our focus is on driving profitable sales growth. Given the business transformation work we have done and the demand we are seeing from the consumer, we are well positioned to thrive in this operating environment. Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to say thank you to our team members in our restaurants and our support center. This was, without a doubt, the most challenging year in our company's history, but thanks to your dedication and perseverance, we have emerged stronger. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the senior leadership team, thank you for all you do to take care of our guests and each other. Rick? Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Our results this quarter are a combination of the business model transformation work that Gene referenced as well as the simplification efforts we implemented throughout the year. Significant process and menu simplification at each brand has enabled us to drive high levels of execution and strengthen margins, further positioning our brands for long-term success. As we began the quarter, our restaurant teams remained disciplined, while continuing to operate in a difficult and unpredictable environment. As restrictions continue to ease and dine-in traffic increased, our teams successfully managed through it, thanks to their focus on being brilliant with the basics, ensuring we provided great food with outstanding service in an enjoyable atmosphere for all of our guests. This enabled us to deliver record-setting results. For example, Olive Garden broke its all-time, single-day sales record on Mother's Day. Additionally, both Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse achieved the highest quarterly segment profit in their history. Even as capacity restrictions eased and we were able to utilize more of our dining rooms, off-premise sales remained strong during the quarter. Off-premise sales accounted for 33% of total sales at Olive Garden, 19% at LongHorn, and 16% at Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Guest demand for off-premise has been stickier than we originally thought, and this is driven by the focus of our restaurant teams and the investments we made to improve our digital platform throughout the year. Technology enhancements to online ordering and the introduction of new capabilities such as To Go capacity management and Curbside I'm Here notification, improves the experience for our guests, while making it easier for our operators to execute. As a result, during the quarter, 64% of Olive Garden's to-go orders were placed online and 14% of Darden's total sales were digital transactions. Thanks to additional technology enhancements, we continue to see guests utilize our digital tools even when they were dining in our restaurants. Nearly half of all guest checks were scheduled digitally either online on our tabletop tablets or via mobile pay. The business model improvements we have made also reinforced our ability to open value-creating new restaurants across all of our brands. During the quarter, we opened 14 new restaurants, and these restaurants are outperforming our expectations. While Raj will discuss specific new restaurant targets for fiscal '22, we are working to develop a pipeline of restaurants and future leaders that would put us at the higher end of our long-term framework of 2% to 3% sales growth from new units as we enter fiscal 2023. Finally, the strength of the Darden platform has helped our brands navigate near-term external challenges. The employment environment has been an issue for the industry. However, the power of our employment proposition strengthened by the investments we have in our people, continue to pay off as we retain our best talent and recruit new team members to more fully staff our restaurants. So, while there are staffing challenges in some areas, we are not experiencing systematic issues. Additionally, the strength of our platform has helped us avoid significant supply chain interruptions. Our supply chain team continues to leverage our scale to ensure our restaurant teams have the key products they need to serve our guests. Notably, the few spot outages we have experienced are related to warehouse staffing and driver shortages, not product availability. To wrap up, I also want to recognize our outstanding team members. During my restaurant visits, I'm inspired by the positive attitude and flexibility you demonstrate every day. Thank you for all you have done and continue to do to deliver great experiences for our guests. Now, I'll turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.3 billion, 79.5% higher than last year, driven by 90.4% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 30 net new restaurants, partially offset by one less week of operations this year. The improvements we made to our business model, combined with fourth quarter sales accelerating faster than cost, drove strong profitability, resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.03. Our reported earnings were $0.76 higher due to a nonrecurring tax benefit of $99.7 million. This benefit primarily relates to our estimated federal net operating loss for fiscal year 2021, which will carry back to the preceding five years. Looking at our performance throughout the quarter, we saw same-restaurant sales versus pre-COVID improving from negative 4.1% in March to positive 2.4% in May. And same-restaurant sales for the first three weeks of June were 2.5% compared to two years ago. To Go sales for Olive Garden and LongHorn continue to be significantly higher than pre-COVID levels. We have seen a gradual decline in weekly To Go sales. However, that decline is being more than offset by an increase in dine-in sales. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L. Compared to pre-COVID results, food and beverage expenses were 90 basis points higher, driven by investments in both food quality and pricing below inflation. For reference, food inflation in Q4 was 4.3% versus last year. Restaurant labor was 190 basis points lower, driven by hourly labor improvement of 320 basis points due to efficiencies gained from the operation simplification and was partially offset by continued wage pressures. Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 200 basis points of favorability. G&A expense was 30 basis points lower, driven primarily by savings from the corporate restructuring earlier in the year. As a result, we achieved record restaurant level EBITDA margin for Darden of 22.6%, 310 basis points above pre-COVID levels and record quarterly EBITDA of $412 million. We had $5 million in impairments due to the write-off of multiple restaurant-related assets. And our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12%, excluding the impact of the non-recurring tax benefit I previously mentioned. Looking at our segments. We achieved record segment profit dollars and margins at Olive Garden, LongHorn and the other business segment this quarter. Fine Dining improved segment profit margins versus pre-COVID despite sales decline. These results were driven by reduced labor and marketing expenses as we continue to focus on simplified operations, while also continuing to invest in food quality and pricing below inflation. 2021 was a year like no other. And despite the challenges of constantly shifting capacity restrictions an uncertain guest demand, we delivered $7.2 billion in total sales. The actions we took in response to COVID-19 to solidify our cash position and transform our business model helped build solid foundation for recovery and resulted in over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $920 million of free cash flow results. As a result, we repaid our term loan, reinstated our pre-COVID dividend and quickly built up our cash position. Our disciplined approach to simplifying operations and driving profitable sales growth positions us well for the future. As a result of our strong performance, cash position and the fiscal 2022 outlook, this morning, we also announced our Board approved a 25% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share, implying an annual dividend of $4.40. This results in a yield of 3.2% based on yesterday's closing share price. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022, we assume full operating capacity for essentially all restaurants, and we do not anticipate any significant business interruptions related to COVID-19. Based on these assumptions, we expect total sales of $9.2 billion to $9.5 billion, representing growth of 5% to 8% from pre-COVID levels, same-restaurant sales growth of 25% to 29% and 35 to 40 new restaurants. Capital spending of $375 million to $425 million; total inflation of approximately 3%, with commodities inflation of approximately 2.5% and hourly labor inflation of approximately 6%; EBITDA of $1.5 billion to $1.59 billion; an annual effective tax rate of 13% to 14% and approximately $131 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in a diluted net earnings per share between $7 and $7.50. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning. Gene, you stated that Darden is well positioned to thrive in this operating environment, and I think that's just a pretty powerful statement given all the labor challenges and cost issues that we're hearing from all of your peers. What is your reaction to these dynamics and why specifically do you believe Darden is standing out from the crowd as it relates to the near-term impacts from these issues? Gene Lee : Well, let's start with -- on the labor front. I mean, we've made significant investments over time in our people starting way back when we had the tax reform. We made the choice to invest in our people at that point in time. We've invested in our people throughout the pandemic. Our best people have stayed with us through this. We have an attractive employment proposition. We're able to attract people to our businesses to work for us. We think that we're fairly well staffed right now, and as the environment continues to improve, we see no reason why we're not the employer of choice in our businesses. I've been pretty clear saying, I think the restaurant industry is going to continue to struggle attracting workers, but there's enough great hospitality workers out there to staff all Darden restaurants if we provide the best employment proposition. And not just an employment proposition today, it's about potential growth. Our ability to promote from within, we're promoting 1,000 team members a year into management. We\u2019re providing other opportunities through training and going out and opening new restaurants. I think our team members really love the experience. And so, I think that we're in great shape from an employment standpoint. We'll continue to invest. We'll manage -- we'll do a great salary administration to ensure that we're paying competitive wages, and I think that we have the flexibility to manage the wage inflation because of our margin structure. And combined with our pricing philosophy, I think we have some room there if need be to offset that and to be able to increase wages if we need to. As far as food inflation goes, I mean, our team has done a fantastic job. We're fairly long on the things that we need to be long on, and I think using our platform and our scale to our advantage through this has been a big advantage, and we feel like we're very well positioned to manage whatever inflation comes our way in the near term and even in the long term. Brian Bittner : Thanks Gene. And just a quick follow-up for Raj. We're no longer talking about 90% sales recapture, thankfully. We're on the other side of this. It feels in your guidance for '22 is 5% to 8% above pre-COVID level. So, obviously, over 100% recapture. And I believe the EBITDA margins at the midpoint of that guidance are 16.5%, so 250 basis points above pre-COVID. So what is the philosophy on communicating investments to us now and the philosophy on communicating how you're thinking about EBITDA margins now that this path for sales above pre-COVID levels is so much more clear? Raj Vennam : Yes, Brian, I think as we look at where our guidance is, let me just start with that. When you think about what we guided this morning for fiscal 2022, that implies EBITDA margin growth of between 200 on the lower end to 250 on the higher end. And so clearly, our sales have recovered. The -- some of the flow-through we're letting it flow to the bottom line. But we have made some investments -- continue to make investments. And as Gene mentioned, we are pricing well below inflation. In fact, I think this morning, we said we expect overall inflation to be around 3%, and our pricing is in the middle of our one to two target. So we are pricing well below inflation. That's the biggest investment we're making, but it also gives us some extra dry powder if there was additional inflation that was to come our way. So, we do think the $200 million to $250 million is a good target for us now, but as we think beyond that, I think we need to better understand the economic and competitive environment as we hone in on the business model. And I would say based on where we are today, we expect to retain most of that margin improvement we'll see in FY '22. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Eric Gonzalez : Thanks for question. My question is on the inflation outlook. Clearly, there have been some big moves in commodities in recent weeks. Can you talk about some of the key variables included in that 3% inflation? I think you said 2.5% on the food side, and perhaps how that might stage throughout the year? Do you expect inflation to be higher in the beginning of the fiscal year before perhaps leveling out towards the end? Raj Vennam : Hi, Eric. So yes, as you look at inflation, we said commodities is around 2.5% for the full year. But it is -- the front half of the year is somewhere between 3.5% to 4% and then it is a little bit -- it tapers off a little bit as we go into the back. And as I said in my prepared remarks, Q4 this year was 4.3%, which implies -- which is where we think as we wsrap on next year, we expect Q4 to be more closer to flat. And so that's kind of the cadence. And then about the drivers of commodity inflation, I'd say chicken and seafood are high, and we\u2019re also seeing significant inflation in cooking oil, a little bit in dairy, and I'd say the other thing is packaging. Packaging continues to be -- especially with the resin costs going up, packaging is another factor. So all in all, those are the big drivers of inflation on the commodity side. And on the labor side, overall labor, we expect to be somewhere between 4%, 4.5%. But wage rate itself, we expect that to be around 6%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. I'm wondering related to Olive Garden or perhaps your overall sales, how much do you think capacity constraints are still in play in terms of weighing down the performance? And I guess, relatedly, what do you think the upside is, Gene, as you see the restaurants come back to full capacity now that you're seeing some of these To Go sales stick more than you thought they would? Gene Lee : Yes, David. Good morning. It is very limited capacity restrictions out there. There are still a few states and municipalities that have some restrictions on us, but we\u2019ve got California back last week and we got New York back. So, there's no major market that has restrictions. I think that when we think about where we're at from a sales perspective, we think there's still more room inside the restaurants as we continue to work on -- we think the work we do with our menus and our business model are going to help us with throughput, which is going to enable us to, in these high-volume periods, get more volume to the restaurant. I think Rick's commented in his prepared remarks about what the teams were able to do and execute on Mother's Day to have the biggest -- the best Mother's Day we've ever had before. It says a lot about our ability to execute and get more people through our restaurants in a limited time period. So I don't think we have any capacity restrictions. Obviously, we're seeing less sales growth on the weekends than when we are mid-week just because there's less opportunity in a lot of our high-volume restaurants to get through extra volume. So I mean there's still -- the word I use a lot is we're still in search equilibrium, and we're not there yet. And I don't know when we're going to be there when we see consumers really get into what I would call a normative behavior pattern, and we kind of get to where we understand what the in-restaurant dining is going to be, what the off-premise is going to be. Rick in his comments talk about that we're pleased with where the off-premise is leveling out, even though it's declining slightly. And I said this a while ago, and I think you guys -- a lot of you guys disagree with me. I think you were right and I was wrong that some of this off-premise was stickier than what we thought. And I think a lot has to do with the capabilities we created through the pandemic to make it a lot less frictionless. But we're searching for equilibrium, understanding when and where the business is going to come from. I think we're still in the early innings of that. I think we still got a lot more upside. David Tarantino : Thanks for that Gene. And then I guess one other follow-up question on this point is the gap between how LongHorn is performing and how Olive Garden is performing relative to pre-COVID is very significant. I was wondering if you could give your thoughts on why either LongHorn is outperforming by so much or Olive Garden is kind of lagging the performance you're seeing for LongHorn? Gene Lee : Well, first thing I would say is Olive Garden is not lagging. I mean I'm just thrilled with their performance. When you're looking at 25.5 restaurant level margins and getting back to pre-COVID sales levels, that's just amazing. That performance is unbelievable. When you look at what's going on in LongHorn, we've been investing in that business for five years since Todd's come back. And he and his team have just done a great job of improving the value perception. When we look at where they are in Technomic and the ratings, they are number one in most categories. They moved from middle of the pack to number one. And so I think LongHorn's performance is just a culmination of a lot of work over a great period of time. And I also -- I want to also recognize that the whole Steakhouse segment is moving. The whole Steakhouse segment has outperformed the other segments, and I believe that's has outperformed the other segments, and I believe that's perceptions. So they're definitely getting a segment lift, but they've also done a great job and they're executing at an extremely high level. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two quick ones, actually. The first one, just on the first quarter as we now seemingly exit, hopefully, the pandemic. I think you said June, your month-to-date comps are up 2.5%. I think that's actually identical to what you said for May. I'm just wondering how does that compare to expectation whether you would have expected further acceleration with additional markets, like you said, having recently reopened? Or any kind of thoughts you can give us having given us full year guidance? Just wondering, I want to make sure with this being the first quarter of lapping full COVID? Any thoughts on those sales or whether there's any parameter around the earnings that you want us to think about? And then one follow-up. Raj Vennam : Jeff, this is Raj. So when you think about the cadence, I mean, I think May to June, I mean, it's three weeks, 2.5%. That's -- we feel pretty good about where we are on that in terms of same-restaurant sales. I would argue they are actually a little bit better than what we had expected going into the fiscal year. And then as you look at the cadence of some of as the markets open up as the capacity restrictions are lifted, we are seeing some movement, especially in California and places like that. But when you blend everything at the Darden level, some of these brands that are impacted the most are brands that are not a big portion -- playing a big part of our overall portfolio. So, it takes a lot to move the needle on our blended same-restaurant sales. And then there are other factors you got to take into consideration, especially, as you look at versus fiscal '19, because we're not doing some of the promotional activity. We're not doing things that would have stimulated demand in the past that we're doing now, right? So there is that we are basically comparing to a level that was different when we had a lot more spend in marketing and other stuff. But as Gene said, I think the continuation of the same team that we are thrilled with where we are, and we're also thrilled with our business model. However -- and the fact that we're able to make investments not only our people, but also in our guests through food quality, food portion and pricing. So we're giving a lot back to the guests, while actually getting a strong business model. And so I think that's how I would, I guess, address the question. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. And then just my follow-up, just wondering as you think about fiscal '22, what do you think is the greatest risk? I mean seemingly, you're feeling quite good about current quarter-to-date trends and thriving in the outlook commentary. But in terms of risks to fiscal '22, would you say it's more on the sales or the cost side? Maybe where you think yourself and/or the industry would be most vulnerable as we come out on the other side? Thank you. Gene Lee : I think the greatest risk still is COVID. I mean I think we're getting to the point where we think we're getting to the other side of that. But when I look at what we've put out there for guidance and I think that -- I think we -- obviously, we think we can achieve that. But I look at the greatest risk as being external, not internal, and I don't see risk from a sales perspective or a cost perspective. I think we've got the flexibility, and we've set this up to have the flexibility to deal with almost anything that is thrown at us, with the exception of another outbreak in COVID, where we had to have some restrictions on our business. To me, that's the greatest risk to what we look for. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Chris Carril : Good morning and thanks for the question. So just in looking at the segment margins, holding aside the performance at Olive Garden and LongHorn, the other business segment margin was particularly strong and well above 2019. So curious to hear what some of the key drivers of the performance were in that segment? And maybe how much of a factor that segment's improvement is contributing to your '22 outlook? And I know last quarter you had discussed the improvement at Cheddar's, so any additional color or update there would be great as well? Raj Vennam : Yes. So I think as we look at our -- Chris, as we look at the other segment, I'd point out a couple of the brands -- business model transformation was significant. I'll say Cheddar's is a big part of that and Bahama Breeze in another brand where we saw a significant improvement in the business model. And part of this is going back to the simplification. We had a chance to kind of break down everything, rebuild back up and kind of figure out a way to transform the business model. So those two brands are primarily contributing to the significant growth we have in the other segment. And as we look at next fiscal year, they still play a decent role, right? I mean when you look at the other segment, it's about 20% of it. So they're not going to be a huge contributor. But related to their size, they are going to be outperforming on the segment margin. Gene Lee : Yes, Chris, on Cheddar's, I would just say that we're extremely pleased with this business at this point. As Raj indicated, the biggest improvement in the business model in all of our business came in Cheddar's. We continue to focus on strengthening the restaurant leadership teams to be able to handle the future growth. But overall, we're very pleased with where this business is at today and very excited about the potential. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of James Rutherford with Stephens. Please go ahead. James Rutherford : I wanted to start off with a technology question for Rick. Last quarter, you mentioned being in the middle of developing a new three-year road map for technology. And I wanted -- I was curious if you -- where you expect to see the biggest returns, whether it's consumer-facing in the box, online, back-of-the-house support center or in some other area? I mean where are the biggest opportunities and priorities for the next three years on the tech side? Gene Lee : Yes, James, thanks for the question. We have completed our three-year road map and what we're working on. And we look at it in a few places. But the primary -- I would say, the primary theme is reducing friction. So what we're doing with technology is reducing friction in the guest experience, in the team member experience and in the manager experience in what we do. And so that would mean continue to enhance our off-premise capabilities to make it easier for guests to order repeat orders and to pick up their off-premise experience. In the restaurant, we're looking at a revamp of our point-of-sale system. It's a pretty old system that we developed years ago. We're going to revamp that to make it much easier for our team members to handle the guest experience and to handle off-premise. And for the managers, we're simplifying the way things look in the back of the house. So a lot of our systems, while they have great back-end -- very great back-end, the user interface isn't as great. So, we're working on improving the user interface. But all of those are under the theme of reducing friction. James Rutherford : Okay. Excellent. And then Raj, just one follow-up. I think last quarter you said you were sitting at 115,000 hourly employees across the Company. Could you update us on where you stand today? And where you view full employment given the demand environment here today? Raj Vennam : I don't know that we're comfortable sharing the total number of employees at this point, but I'd just say we have made significant progress. In fact, going back, I don't know that we -- I don't remember if we said 115, I think it was a little bit more than that. But anyway, at this point, I'm not so sure we want to get into the exact number of employees other than just let you know we feel pretty good with the way we're staffed, and we don't see any gap. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks. Raj, you guys impressively raised your dividend 25% to $1.10. And if we think about the historical 50% to 60% targeted payout ratio, this would imply EPS of $7.33 to $8.80 versus the formal guidance of $7 to $7.50. Can you help rectify that a little bit? Is it just conservatism reflected in the formal guidance? Raj Vennam : Okay. Great question. Let me start with, when you think about how we look at our dividend, the 50% to 60% is our target range, right? But at this point, given where we are with our cash on the balance sheet, we felt pretty good about going to the higher end of that range. So as you pointed out, if you look at 60%, then we're right. It's closer to the middle of our guidance. So if you take the middle of our guidance, we're basically at 61% payout. So that's not that -- I would argue that's not that different from the 50% to 60%, especially given we're sitting at a $1.2 billion cash flow, and we expect to still generate significant free cash flow. And at the end of the day, when we look at our business model, this bill only -- the proposed dividend or the dividend that we actually announced this morning, only it's up about 50% of our free cash flow. So we feel really good about where we are. And also, just remember, the target is over time. We had a year where we're below the target. So think of this as a way to kind of make up for a little bit of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Jeff Farmer : Thank you. On the March earnings call, you reported that hourly labor productivity had improved by, I think, you said over 20% for the system. So I'm just curious, two things. How are you measuring labor productivity? And I think you touched on it a little bit earlier, but how have you driven this level of improvement in productivity? Rick Cardenas : Jeff, this is Rick. Yes, we did mention that productivity was about 20% better across the system. And we measured on an hour per guest basis. So how many guests can we serve per hour -- per labor hour? And we're still seeing significant labor productivity improvements. As Raj mentioned, we had a significant improvement in labor per labor margin, even with inflation. And the way we did it was what we've been talking about for the last year is continue to improve our processes from the food coming into the backdoor to getting to the table, which means significant menu design work, significant prep design work, which took a lot of the steps and procedures out of the kitchen. And what I would say is we are never done with that. We redesigned our processes over the last year. We have to look at them again, and we have to redesign. So we're going to continue to do that to drive efficiencies where redesign. So we're going to drive efficiencies so that we can reinvest those savings in our plate and give a better experience for our guests. Jeff Farmer : And then just as a quick follow-up, and I might have missed this earlier, I apologize. But of the 25 states or so that have ended the supplemental unemployment benefits early, what has the hiring or staffing dynamic looked like since that's happened in those states? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jeff, a lot of those states announced something either late May or early June that would take effect sometime in June. And I think the first date took effect maybe last week. And anecdotally, we have seen a little bit of an improvement in the trend of applicant flow, but we've seen it all across the country, not just states that have eliminated the UI, but even states that haven't yet. It could be because the states that haven't yet are actually starting to open and so you're going to see applicant flow. But we feel really good about our applicant flow into our restaurants. We're hiring -- we're not hiring a lot of people every week, we had a record hiring quarter in the fourth quarter, and we feel really good about where we are. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Brett Levy : Great. Thanks for taking the call and good morning. I guess just two separate questions. You're obviously talking about some significant EBITDA margin expansion. How should we be thinking about that from a split between the recovery of G&A spending as well as the unit level profitability? And does the progress you've seen of late change what you think the longer-term ceilings are for your restaurant level margin? And then the second question is on the development side, we've obviously seen a lot of news out there of delays of inflation of labor availability. Are you -- what are you seeing on those fronts? And how confident are you about either the cadence of the 35 to 40 or the ability to reach the higher end? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Brad, let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Rick for the development question. So as you look at our margins, I would argue the margin that you saw in Q4, where bulk of it came from the restaurant level, there's a little bit at the G&A. I say a little bit. It's actually 30, 40 basis points, which is huge. So I think as you look forward, I think the way to think about G&A is probably going to be in that somewhere around 40 basis points of favorability, but then the rest is going to come from the restaurant level margins. And the way I would kind of categorize that is the restaurant labor and marketing are going to see an improvement. However, we're going to continue some increase in food cost because of the investments. That's a deliberate choice we made. And then -- so that's how I'd kind of categorize that. And then the restaurant expenses, why should be a little bit better, but not as significant because that's one -- especially because we're not pricing in line with overall inflation. You got to have an impact on all the line items across the P&L. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Brett, on the development side, this is Rick. On the development side, we have a couple of things. One is we shut down our pipeline at the beginning of COVID, and we restarted the pipeline during this fiscal year as we saw us coming out of that. We feel really good about the 14 restaurants we opened. But I would say, you hear a lot about shortages in construction and about product shortages in construction, we're getting out in front of that. So we're ordering product a lot further in advance than we used to. So to make sure that we've got a stainless steel in the kitchen to do the things that we need to do. The good news is you're seeing some of these input costs come down. So hopefully, by the time we're starting to build our restaurants, those input costs are more back to a more reasonable level. I said, the margin improvements we've made in our restaurants and our restaurant profitability has really helped even if the inflation was where people are hearing about it. In terms of cadence of openings, as I said, we got in front of this and started ordering product earlier for our restaurant. But we typically open mid-teen restaurants in the fourth quarter. And of our 30 to 40 restaurants we're going to open this year, we'll probably have mid-teens in the fourth quarter, and the other ones will be kind of spread throughout this fiscal year. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Lauren Silberman : Okay, great. So, on the To Go, you talked about To Go being stickier than perhaps you originally thought. Are you seeing any discernible differences across markets that have recaptured more on-premise sales? And then is there anything that you can share on how consumers are using the To Go occasion? And whether that's a replacement for on-premise versus in that whole meal? Gene Lee : Well, I think the -- for off-premise, they're using it as a home meal replacement or maybe in the workplace during the day, I think there's no behavioral change there at all. And there's really no difference in what's happening throughout the country as more restaurants, more dinners open. It's been the kind of the same kind of shift. You took down a couple of hundred basis points and you pick more of that up in the dining room. Again, I think that, as I said earlier, I just think this -- I think I'll give the analyst community credit on this. This was stickier than what we thought. We know we've reached some new consumers here. And the experience is very, very good. And so, I think that we don't know where it's coming net out. It's going to net out a lot higher than it was pre-COVID. And I think it's something that's part of our business, we have to pay a lot more attention to as we move forward. Lauren Silberman : Great. And just if I could do a follow-up on June running at 2.5%. Are there any seasonality considerations in June relative to May? Or are you largely seeing similar average weekly sales? Raj Vennam : I'd say, yes, the similar average weekly sales once you take out the north of the holidays. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Raj, I believe you stated that demand came back at a faster pace than cost. I was hoping you could elaborate on what those costs were given staffing hasn't been an issue and maybe the impact of that timing dynamic? Raj Vennam : Well, I would say a little bit of it was staffing. We had to catch up on staffing through the quarter as they accelerated faster than we hired. But by the end of the quarter, we're in a good place. So there was a little bit of that. But beyond that, I think as you look at our P&L, you can see, obviously, the marketing didn't grow as we had sales come in. We didn't have the level of travel was a lot less. Some of these costs that we have, the other cost is really more around growth cost that we said we're going to want to bring back, especially because we want to kind of have the right pipeline of talent for new openings. And those costs are -- we were holding off on some of these to wait for the sales to get back to the levels where we thought we were delivering the right level of returns. And so -- now that the sales are at the levels that are above the pre-COVID, some of these costs will have -- we want to put that back into the P&L. And that's part of the guidance that we provided this morning. Chris O'Cull: Can you quantify the impact to the store level labor that -- from that timing mismatch during the quarter? Raj Vennam : I'd say it's in the 10, 20 basis points. It's not huge. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Jon Tower : Rick, I just wanted to circle back on a comment you made about unit growth in fiscal '23, potentially being above -- or sorry, towards the higher end of that 2% to 3% range that you've historically guided to. I'm just curious, how sustainable do you feel that level of growth is into the future beyond just fiscal '23 in terms of that potentially being a catch-up year of growth from this kind of more disruptive period? And then perhaps you can dig into the components of that growth. Obviously, Olive Garden has been a bigger piece of the gross new store -- excuse me, a bigger piece of growth historically, But going forward, how should we think of that relative to the other brands in the portfolio? Gene Lee : Jon, thanks. First of all, on the sustainability of the growth going forward, the only thing that can slow us down in growth after this kind of ramp-up is having enough people to open our restaurants, right, having enough general managers ready and able to open our restaurants. We believe that we can stay in the higher end of our range for a little while. Now the economic environment could be different in a year or two that might change that. But we feel really confident that we can get closer to the higher end of our range because of the business model improvements we have made, and it gives the ability to open even more Olive Gardens, right? So when we were opening in Olive Garden before, we would impact many Olive Gardens around them. But with the business model enhancements to Olive Garden has made, we feel even more confident being able to open some of those. Raj had already mentioned Cheddar's and how much they've improved their business model. That has given us more confidence in being able to open more Cheddar's. So that gives us the ability to get towards the higher end of that range. But every one of our brands has the ability to grow, and that's the important thing. We've made significant improvements in the business model at Bahama Breeze, while someone asked about the other segment. I want to tell you that Season 52 has also made a huge business model improvement, even though their sales growth wasn't as strong as Bahama Breeze because of their clientele. That's all coming back. We've opened some pretty darn good Seasons 52 recently, and we opened a great Bahama Breeze recently. So we feel really good about our open all of our brands and be at the higher end of our range for the foreseeable future, unless the environment changes. Jon Tower : Got it. And then just following up to the comments on To Go business, I think you had mentioned that 64% of To Go orders were online. And I'm just curious to get your thoughts on how you're communicating with those customers today? I mean this is essentially opening up a new channel of marketing that you've already put in place? Or is that something that you're not necessarily even doing today but down the line could harvest as a new marketing channel? Gene Lee : John, because they're ordering online, we do get a little bit more information about them than we would on a phone order or other orders. And that gives us the ability to market them in the future. We haven't really done a whole lot of marketing in the last year, right? Olive Garden has done TV, because we've bought that media already. We've done some digital marketing just to keep the digital marketing just to keep the digital marketing moving, but we haven't really started focusing on those new customers and demand speaking directly to them. As we start thinking that we need to ramp things up, that's a great source of people to market to now that weren't coming to us before. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks. Gene, I appreciate the commentary on the industry and the industry size, and then shrinking supply. Just wondering if there's anything more that you can share on whether you've been able to identify gains for your brands from the restaurants that have permanently closed? Or if you have any updated thoughts going forward on how you're thinking about your opportunity to gain share from that percentage of supply that's going away? Gene Lee : Yes. I think, Dennis, I think our opportunity to gain share is gets back to our ability to execute at a really high level. And the fact that we have continued to invest in portion size and quality, and I think that's the key. I think this is all about running great restaurants and executing at a high level. And I think we have a huge opportunity to gain share in all of our restaurants, through comp store sales growth and through organic growth. That's why we're excited about the ability -- our ability to add a lot of new restaurants. Dennis Geiger : That's great. And then just kind of building on that. Just one more, if I could, on Olive Garden, kind of just following up on the solid recovery that following up on the solid recovery that the brand has seen already. If you could talk just a bit more about the drivers of the continued AUV growth over, let's say, the near to medium term. So I just want to make sure that I understand correctly that it's probably really a function of further capacity increases from the brand from here. But if it's kind of specific drivers, if it's the marketing that you were just talking about turning that on, if it's potential promotional activities that you have in your back pocket, if it's digital, it's probably all of that and more. But Gene, just curious if you could kind of speak to some of those drivers perhaps? Gene Lee : I believe there's one significant driver, and that's how we have to improve the cravability of the food. And we continue to do that by investing in portions and quality. The team is laser-focused on this. And I think that's the best driver of overall profitable sales growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on Dennis' question, Gene, around the industry. I know you said there's been about 10% fewer units coming out of the industry, yet we're seeing a labor shortage. And just curious if you're seeing any sort of benefits on rent or availability of real estate or anything more specific around development that may be a benefit to Darden? Gene Lee : No. There's tremendous speculation in the real estate market driving prices up. Peter Saleh : Okay. And then just lastly, on menu innovation, how are you guys thinking about menu innovation and expanding the menu? Is the labor squeeze right now? And I know you guys said it's not really as much impacting you guys, but is that keeping a little bit on menu innovation? Are you guys still focusing on some of the core? Any thoughts there? Gene Lee : We're focused on the core. All innovation right now is trying to improve the products the majority of our consumers buy. We love that focus. We think we're improving cravability. We're improving -- we're continuing to keep our restaurants simplifying and we're sticking to one on, one-off. The teams have great discipline around that right now. And I think that, that's key to our ability to execute at a high level. And as Rick talked about, the improvement in productivity and it's resulting in these record margins. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Nicole Miller : I wanted to ask about the specialty restaurant group of content, specifically around the higher end. I was wondering if you could just kind of give an indication of which brands are above 2019 and which ones are slightly below maybe? And really getting at the ones that are above, what is the likelihood of that structurally being the new run rate? Or is there some reason that demand could pull back? Thank you. Gene Lee : Well, I don't think there's any reason why demand would pull back. I mean demand might shift from suburban to urban a little bit as business travel starts to reignite. I've been thrilled with the recovery in the last six to seven weeks in Fine Dining. I was surprised how resilient the business was in suburbia through the pandemic. We still got seven or eight really large restaurants in what I would call the heavy urban core that are starting to come back slowly. But overall, I think this business is doing really, really well. And the one business that has started to come back in the last couple of weeks was Seasons 52, which was hit pretty hard when you think about who their consumer was. And so upscale Fine Dining is performing well above where we thought it would be and it's coming back very quickly as we get our three major restaurants in New York City back up and running and downtown Boston and downtown D.C. Those five restaurants are core to what we do, and they're starting to come back quickly. Nicole Miller : And anything you would change in the -- or excuse me, comment briefly on the customer profile, same guests, different guests eating differently coming at different times, they're just more of the same like it used to be? Gene Lee : Well, I think, again, we're seeing a little bit -- on the suburban business, we're seeing a little bit more weekend business than what we did. We've seen a little bit of shift without the business travel and what midweek looks like. But overall, that's dynamic, and I go back to my overused word of equilibrium, not transitory. Equilibrium, we'll wait for equilibrium in that business. And we're going to get there the next six months, so we'll understand what the new norms are. But I think we've exposed a lot of people to our Fine Dining brands through this. And I think that they really love the experience. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Andrew Strelzik : First, I wanted to just clarify quickly on the margin commentary, the 200 to 250 basis point improvement. Is that from an AV perspective relative to pre-COVID levels? Is that at fiscal '22 levels just some context around that? And then my other question is just on the off-premise business. I think there's some uncertainty about how to think about the growth of that channel after kind of the step function we've seen over the last 12-plus months. So kind of what's the growth rate that you would expect from To Go kind of over the next 18 to 24 months or maybe longer term whoever you want to think about that and the drivers behind it? Gene Lee : I'll take the off-premise question and then Rob can take the margin question. I think on off-premise, until we understand where equilibrium is and where do we get to balance, where is the new level, then we can think about growth. We do think we have more avenues to grow that business. We've learned a lot about that business through the pandemic that we can use to, I think, grow it into the future. Consumer desire for convenience is not going away, and I think we can fulfill that need with our brands and our technology. Raj Vennam : And Andrew, on the margin question, we are referencing pre-COVID. So I think the way to think about it is our EBITDA margin at the pre-COVID was around 14%. I think it was actually 14.1%. So the $200 million to $250 million is relative to that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. Obviously, you have -- you doubled your off-premise sales per unit at Olive Garden, basically fourth quarter '21 versus fourth quarter of '19. So that does leave a pretty substantial amount of capacity that kind of remains for on-premise dining. So I wanted to ask a few points on that. You mentioned that much of off-premise is being used as a home meal replacement that would suggest, I guess, the lack of cannibalization for on-premise dining. But can you possibly update those if you know the cannibalization numbers between the percentage of off-premise sales that are coming from on-premise? And I guess, at this point, I mean, do you think it's an opportunity -- a necessity to basically bring back those on-premise customers here was Olive Garden is so busy before that maybe people aren't getting to eat at the times that they want? But just to think about getting that off-premise sales -- on-premise sales per unit back to the 100% level that you previously had in 2019? And if there's anything that you can talk about, whether it's age or that level of vaccination, state by state, what have you, that shows different levels of success of achieving on-premise sales '21 versus '19? Gene Lee : Yes, John, that was -- there's a lot in there. All I would say, and I want to be brief here is we're going to do whatever we can to drive as much on-premise dining inside Olive Garden as we possibly can profitable sales in the dining room. And we're going to try to grow as profitably as we can in the off-premise channel. We also have to recognize at this point in time, there's still a lot of people out there in our trade that aren't comfortable going into restaurants yet. And so we still have a ways to go to understand where that natural sales level for Olive Garden is going to level out and a lot to learn. And so we haven't been that granular yet to understand who the consumer is. We'll get there once we reach this new place. But our goal is to drive business as we possibly can -- profitable business as we can in restaurant and do as much profitably as we possibly can off-premise. John Ivankoe : And do you have a sense of the amount of sales transfer between on-premise and off-premise? Or is that data that still needs to come? Gene Lee : This data needs to come. I mean the environment is so dynamic, and we will need to analyze that. We've got the analytics to be able to really look at that once we've got to this equilibrium that I'm talking about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : I'm actually going to follow up on that. If we assume the 15% sales mix at Olive Garden pre-COVID was off-premise, you're looking at something like down high teens on-premise on a two-year basis. If that right, what constraints do you think we're on the on-premise business in May? And is it really this consumer comfort that that's driving that decline? And how are you thinking about those factors as we go through 2022? I'd be curious to hear whether you think there are any constraints that you would imagine to the on-premise business getting back to, you say, flat or even higher than 2019? Gene Lee : Well, I mean, I think you have to think about what our promotional and marketing strategy was. Right now, we're just -- we're out there on television just doing some brand advertising. We've been able to remove all incentives and all discounts from the business, and we'll continue to analyze when might be the right opportunity to put some of that back in. I mean this is a complicated question. Olive Garden has never ever operated at these margin levels at this sales volume. And so we need to move slowly. And I don't think that we're looking at what capacity was in '19 and trying to triangulate this the way you guys are talking about it. We're trying to drive as much profitable sales as we possibly can. And so -- and we're just extremely pleased with where this business is. And we're not going to run the business and try to chase an index and get back to some level that -- and deal with and look at our business -- we're looking at our business differently than maybe others are looking at it. And I just couldn't be happier where we've repositioned the Olive Garden business and the record profitability that this business is throwing off. David Palmer : I'm thinking back to some of our earlier conversations on these earnings calls, and I know you were thinking that you might actually have this on-premise swell where you would overshoot on the on-premise. It's -- I wonder if we might be a couple of quarters away from that if the comfort levels continue to build? If that happens, do you think the capacity in terms of labor, the seats, the lack of cannibalization from off-premise, I mean, do you think that that could happen? Do you still see that potential? Gene Lee : I think that this -- let me put one thing. This is not -- this is being held back by labor. I mean our restaurants are fully staffed on the weekends. We're doing our three to four turns in Olive Garden. I think the issue is -- if you told me that we could get back to 100% of sales in Olive Garden and spend $100 million less in advertising, I didn't think we could do that. And I'm thrilled with where we're at based on what we're spending and how we're -- and what our profit is per guest at these levels? And we'll continue to focus on driving profitable sales growth and where that ends up, that ends up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Thank you very much. First, just, Gene, back on the industry and your outlook, capacity is being reduced, your margins are high, how do you think about M&A in the portfolio right now? Is this a good time to think about adding brands? Is pricing difficult? Are you just very pleased with the current business and portfolio that you really don't think about M&A in this environment? Gene Lee : Well, we're always talking with the Board and the senior management about what the possibilities are to add a brand to our portfolio that would benefit from being -- I mean our platform being on our platform, and we would benefit that they would come on to our platform. So, we're always thinking about that. But more so today, we're thrilled with the business model transformations in our business. And we're very happy to invest our capital into our businesses and capture the return that we're getting today on those new businesses. John Glass : And Raj, if I could just clarify. You said you thought in '23, you could hold most of the gains in margins this year. Historically, Darden has talked about 20 to 40 basis points maybe of margin gain year-on-year just on natural leverage. Is there some reason why '23 and beyond may be different, like maybe marketing may be a risk that you've got to add some of that back? How do we think about beyond the current year in terms of margin expansion? Raj Vennam : Yes. I think, John, that's where I think there's still some time until we get to fiscal '23 and beyond. And really, I think we need to better understand the economic and competitive environment. And just we got to get holding on this business model, we had the real -- I will use Gene's term of equilibrium is. And just kind of really want to get to find that. But I think where we are today, given the dry powder we have, whether it's with pricing or other levers we can pull, we do feel confident we'll be able to keep most of the margin gains. And like I said, we'll play out and we'll have more to share next time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Jake Bartlett : Gene, I was wondering, it's great to see the recovery with Olive Garden. But as a percentage showing it increased versus '19, it is less than some of the other publicly traded companies that have reported. Can you just maybe give us a couple of the reasons why you think that is? I imagine because you're at high capacity in '19 or you have less marketing? But maybe just help us understand why Olive Garden has recovered, I think, to a less degree than a lot of the others? Gene Lee : Well, because we're not participating in giving our way of food through third-party channels. We're not discounting not discounting heavily. We're not discounting our cash like others are through selling gift cards. And we're running a business here to drive profitable sales growth. We've got a business that's doing over $5 million for average unit volumes. In the fourth quarter, we put up 25% restaurant level margins. Isn't our job to drive profitable sales growth? And that's what we're focused on. And so there are a lot of reasons why we're not keeping up with where some of the other people are going. There's a lot that's changed in two years and how they're handling their businesses. All of them have virtual brands and all this other stuff that's out there. I mean guys, you got to get off this. I mean this is the best business in casual dining, not even by a little bit anymore, by a lot. And we're doing $5 million in average unit volume, with 25-plus restaurant level margins and growing. And we've got -- our guests are loving the experience. They love the credibility of the food. They love the changes that we made, and we're executing at a very, very high level. I think we're going to continue to grow. But I'm really -- I'm not chasing an index, so we're not chasing where we were in the past. We love our position today. Jake Bartlett : Great. I appreciate that. And I guess also just a question about the industry and about the cadence of the comps from April to May to June. We've seen people getting vaccinated, capacity restrictions being lifted. Why do you think the cadence is not increasing? Why don't you think May versus -- June versus May versus April is increasing? What are the offsets to some of the benefits, which are capacity restrictions being lifted and people getting vaccinated? Gene Lee : I'm not sure I understand. We did see sequential improvement throughout these months. These look like pretty strong numbers as I look at them across. We saw Fine Dining go from 12 down to 6 in May, that's without our New York restaurants. We've gone from other businesses, 8 to 4 from 14 in March. I mean we're seeing sequential improvement. And again, I think that as we think about it, this has been a very, very fast recovery. And as people start to live more normal than normal -- get back to some normal behaviors, we think it's implied in our guidance that we're going to get back to a pretty good level here. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Jared Garber : Gene and Rick, you talked a little bit about the technology initiatives and some of the success you're having with the tabletop tablets. And I think, last quarter, you talked also about how this is maybe attracting a younger consumer to some of the brands. I just wanted to know if you had any update there on what you're seeing on consumer side related to some of this technology? And maybe if you think the next kind of several years out, what are some of the consumer-facing technologies do you think you'll see or we'll see enter the restaurant space in the in-dining room part of the business? Rick Cardenas : Jared, thanks. This is Rick. The investments that we have made, is really recently is more about the off-premise experience, right? And so there are just anybody who's coming to our restaurants off-premise. The people that used to come inside that may not still feel comfortable to come inside or going to off-premise. And we are getting a new consumer. At Cheddar's, we have a new consumer that didn't come to Cheddar's before. I don't want to get into the details on that, which gives us more confidence in their ability. They do have the tabletop tablet. I am not going to say that their consumer is younger or older because of the tabletop tablets. It's because they're learning about Cheddar's. And so we're going to continue to invest, as I said, in removing friction to make it easier for our guests to eat where they want, when they want and how they want, and make it easier for our team members to serve them. And so that's what we're going to continue to do without getting into the detail on the new guests or if technology is driving new guests. I'm not going to say technology is driving new guests. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks and good morning. Gene, I just want to quickly circle back on the positive industry view in a post-COVID world. And kind of as specifically, how do you expect consumer behavior to normalize as it relates specifically to cooking at home versus ordering in? And also how you see that consideration that may have expanded for the average consumer to utilize casual dining for an off-premise occasion where that was not in the consideration set pre-COVID? Anything in the Technomic data or other data to sort of size that opportunity to capture share of previously at-home cooking occasions? Gene Lee : Brian, I'm not sure I can quantify that, but I think you answered -- maybe you answered your question and your question is that the casual dining off-premise experience definitely got more exposure through COVID. And I think people that would have never used that experience probably because they weren't casual dining users, and now determined, that's a really good option for home meal replacement. So I think that's an area where you're going to be able to hold on to this new consumer and maybe continue to market to them effectively. We don't have a whole lot of insight on cooking at home and home meal replacement. I do think that you're seeing mobility increase significantly, especially in the states that were heavily locked down. I mean I spent a lot of time in the Northeast, the last couple of weeks. It's still very quiet compared to what I see in Georgia and Florida when I travel. So still has some opportunity to increase in these marketplaces. I don't know where -- I think we've still got another six to nine months to understand what -- if we don't have any more problems with COVID, what are going to be the normal behaviors that are going to develop out of this? And what's -- what was an adaptive behavior? And what was normal? And we'll get through over the next 9 -- 6 to 12 months, and we'll have a better understanding of consumer behaviors. And then I think you start developing your marketing plans and you get tactical on how to get to these folks and try to get them into your restaurants or use you as an off-premise dining occasion. Brian Vaccaro : That makes total sense. And a quick follow-up on the guidance. And Raj, sorry if I missed it. But what does the guidance embed in terms of G&A and marketing spend in fiscal '22? Thank you. Raj Vennam : We did not necessarily share that detail, but I'll just tell you, like I think the G&A is -- you could expect to get leverage on G&A, and we expect marketing to be significantly reduced from pre-COVID. Without getting into the exact numbers, that's what I tell you. Operator : And I'll now turn the conference back over of consumer behaviors and any final remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you, we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday, September 23, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Darden Fiscal Year 2022 First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting the presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation will include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Any reference to pre-COVID, when discussing first quarter performance is a comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This is because last year\u2019s results are not meaningful due to the pandemic\u2019s impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during the first quarter of fiscal \u201821. We plan to release fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings on Friday, December 17 before the market opens followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks on the first quarter results; Rick will give an update on our operating performance; and Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update of our fiscal \u201822 financial outlook. Now, I will turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, we had a very good quarter. Our teams continue to operate effectively in a challenging environment and I am proud of their focus and ability to deliver another quarter of strong sales and profitability. All of our segments delivered record first quarter profit. Our ability to drive profitable sales growth is a testament to the strength of our business model and our continued adherence to the strategy we implemented 6 years ago. Our brands remain laser focused on executing our back to basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere, while at the Darden level, we concentrate on strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Our first quarter sales trends started strong as momentum carried over from the fourth quarter and they further strengthened and peaked in July. However, in August, sales slowed due to the impact of the Delta variant, but remained positive relative to pre-COVID levels. For the first quarter, sales per operating week were up 4.8% relative to pre-COVID. And through the first 3 weeks in September, sales per operating week were up approximately 7% relative to pre-COVID. Regardless of the operating environment, our unwavering commitment to our strategy ensures we will stay focused on what we do best, providing exceptional guest experiences. Throughout this unique period, our operators have shown tremendous flexibility while remaining locked in on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. At the same time, our focus helps us continue to find ways to make our competitive advantages work even harder for us. One of the ways we do this is by leveraging our ability to open value-creating new restaurants. We opened 7 new restaurants during the quarter, all of which are exceeding our expectations. And we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year. Our long-term framework calls for 2% to 3% sales growth from new restaurants. Given our stronger unit economics, our development team is working hard to build out a pipeline of locations for fiscal \u201823 and beyond that would put us at or above the higher end of our framework. Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center. As I visit our restaurants and talk with our teams, I am constantly reminded why our people are our greatest competitive advantage. Their passion for being of service to our guests and each other fuels our success. Rick? Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. Our success this quarter was driven by the work we have done to simplify our processes and our menus to drive execution at the highest level. We also paused any new initiatives in order to further eliminate distractions for our restaurant teams and allow them to focus on what it takes to run 14 great shifts a week. In addition, To Go sales continue to benefit from the ongoing evolution of our digital platform. This platform makes it simpler for our guests to visit, order, pay and pickup, all while making it easier for our teams to execute at the highest level, both in the dining room and off-premise. This served our teams well as To Go sales remained high through the quarter. For the quarter, off-premise sales accounted for 27% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and guest satisfaction metrics for off-premise experiences remains strong. As we navigate short-term external pressures, our focus is simple. We must continue to win when it comes to our people and product. From a people perspective, the employment environment is challenging. That\u2019s why our top priority during the quarter was staffing our restaurants. Our operators and HR teams have done a great job sourcing talent. We recently launched a new talent acquisition system that helps increase our pool of candidates by allowing applicants to apply and schedule an interview in 5 minutes or less. Additionally, our brands are successfully utilizing their digital platforms, including social media, to promote our employment proposition and drive applications. As a result, we are netting more than 1,000 new team members per week and our team member count is approximately 90% of our pre-COVID levels. The biggest operational challenge we have been dealing with is the temporary exclusion of team members identified through contact tracing. Given our commitment to health and safety, we are diligent about exclusions, but they create sudden staffing disruptions for our operators. Despite being appropriately staffed in the majority of our restaurants, these exclusions reduced the number of available team members with little notice for our operators to prepare. This volatility can negatively impact sales in these restaurants for the duration of the exclusion period. Getting and staying staffed also requires a strong focus on training. As we continue to hire, it is critical that we have the right training in place to ensure we continue to execute at a high level. That\u2019s why our operations leaders are validating the quality of our training during their restaurant visits, ensuring new team members receive the appropriate amount of training and successfully complete the required assessments. Our team members are the heart and soul of our business and we are constantly focused on our employment proposition. The investments we have made and continue to make in our people are helping us retain and attract top talent and I am confident in our ability to address our staffing needs. When it comes to product, our significant scale, including our dedicated distribution capabilities, enables us to manage through the challenges affecting the global supply chain and maintain continuity for our restaurants. Our supply chain team continues to work hard to ensure we successfully manage through any spot outages we encounter and our restaurants have the key products they need to serve our guests. During the quarter, we had to secure more product than usual on the spot market, because our brands exceeded sales expectations and some of our suppliers experienced capacity challenges. Raj will share more details in a moment, but these higher sales volumes as well as freight costs have contributed to higher than expected inflation. Our scale advantage provides the opportunity for us to price below our competition and inflation, which is a strategy we have executed successfully. Our competitive advantage of extensive data and insights allows us to be surgical in our pricing approach positioning us well to deal with these higher costs and maintain our value leadership. The rich insights we gather from our analytics help us find the right opportunities to price in ways that minimize impact to traffic over time. We still expect pricing to be well below the rate of inflation for the year, further strengthening our value proposition. Ensuring our restaurants are appropriately staffed and our supply chain continues to avoid significant disruptions will be the most important factors of our continued success in the short-term. To wrap up, I also want to recognize our outstanding team. I am inspired by the dedication and winning spirit that our leaders and team members both in our restaurants and in our support center continue to demonstrate. Thanks to each of you for all that you do to continue to create exceptional experiences for our guests. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, 51% higher than last year, driven by 47.5% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.76. We returned approximately $330 million to our shareholders this quarter, paying $144 million in dividends and repurchasing $186 million in shares. We had strong performance this quarter despite increased inflationary pressures, with EBITDA of $370 million and EBITDA margin of 16%, 250 basis points higher than pre-COVID. Our sales results were better than expected, requiring us to go out and purchase more product, on the spot market. In particular, proteins, as our LongHorn and Fine Dining segments had the largest sales outperformance versus our expectations. The market for proteins this quarter was very strong with spot premiums as high as 30% above our contracted rates. This resulted in higher average cost per pound for our proteins, contributing to total commodities inflation for the quarter of approximately 5.5%. Given the heightened attention on inflation, I want to clarify that we use a conventional approach to calculating the rate of inflation. We are only measuring change in average price, holding product mix and usage constant. We follow the same approach for calculating wage inflation rate in which we keep the hours and job mix constant and only look at change in wage. While we expect higher rates of inflation to persist for the remainder of the year versus what we initially planned, we believe our scale and recent enhancements to our business model enable us to deliver significant margin expansion, while still adhering to our strategy of pricing below inflation. Now, looking at the P&L for the first quarter of 2022, we are providing a comparison against pre-COVID results in the first quarter of 2020 which we believe is a more comparable to normal business operations and with how we have been talking about our margin expansion. For the first quarter, food and beverage expenses were 150 basis points higher driven by investments in both food quality and pricing significantly below inflation. Restaurant labor was 110 basis points lower, driven primarily by hourly labor improvement due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures. Restaurant expenses were also 110 basis points lower due to sales leverage. Marketing spend was $45 million lower, resulting in 220 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin for Darden was 20.9%, 290 basis points better than pre-COVID levels. G&A expense was 30 basis points higher, driven primarily by approximately $10 million of stock compensation expenses related to the immediate expensing of equity awards for retirement-eligible employees. Additionally, we had approximately $5 million of expense related to mark-to-market on our deferred compensation. As a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, it\u2019s largely offset on the tax line. These impacts were partially offset by savings from corporate restructuring implemented in fiscal 2021. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.6%, which benefited from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been closer to the top end of our guidance range for the year. Turning to our segment performance, first quarter sales at Olive Garden were flat to pre-COVID, while segment profit margin increased 220 basis points. This was strong performance despite elevated inflation and 2-year check growth of only 2.4%. LongHorn had the best sales performance across our segments with sales increasing by 26% versus pre-COVID, while growing segment profit margin by 250 basis points. Sales at our Fine Dining segment increased 24% versus pre-COVID in what\u2019s traditionally their slowest quarter from a seasonal perspective. Segment profit margin grew by 490 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodity inflation. Our other segment grew sales by nearly 5% and segment profit margin by 360 basis points. We continue to be excited about the long-term prospects of this segment as it\u2019s driving the strongest underlying business model improvement of all our segments. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022, based on our performance this quarter and expected performance for the remainder of the year, we increased our outlook for the full year. We now expect total sales of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, representing growth of 7% to 9% from pre-COVID levels; same restaurant sales growth of 27% to 30% and 35 to 40 new restaurants; capital spending of $375 million to $425 million; total inflation of approximately 4% with commodities inflation of 4.5% and total restaurant labor inflation of 5.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation of about 7%; EBITDA of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion; an annual effective tax rate of 13% to 14%; and approximately 131 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.25 and $7.60. This outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID in line with our previous outlook as higher sales are helping offset elevated inflation. Before we open it up for questions, I want to remind you about a calendar shift next quarter. Thanksgiving falls in our fiscal second quarter this year, whereas it was in the fiscal third quarter pre-COVID. This will be a net negative to second quarter from its sales perspective. Now, we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Thanks. Good morning. Gene or whoever, could you please first just talk about the impact of the reduction of couponing at Olive Garden? I think that probably has adversely impacted sales. It obviously has a huge positive impact on margin. But can you just sort of quantify what you think the foregone sales were for that so as we think about that brand versus peers, we have the right context? Gene Lee : Yes. Let me take a stab at this a little broader, John and just the coupons, because I am not sure we can get right to the number that you are looking for. I mean I think the coupon number probably was about 1% of sales. And so trying to say, okay, what\u2019s that driving guest count? I think that\u2019s a little bit harder to get at. When I look at that line in the P&L, it\u2019s about \u2013 it was about 1%. Let me just put Olive Garden\u2019s performance in context for everybody. Obviously, I am thrilled with their performance. We only have 2.5% check in the business over the last 2 years. That\u2019s compared to a little over 5% for the industry. I mean, that\u2019s a strategic choice that we continue to make and we think it\u2019s the right choice. And if you just assume that the marketing was breakeven, I mean, you got to add another 10 points to the sales. And so basically, they are flat, flattish and you take out that marketing, that\u2019s a big number. The other thing and then Rick alluded to this in his script I mean we are still struggling from a staffing standpoint, primarily because of the exclusions. And if you think about that, that\u2019s limiting our sales. And it\u2019s just \u2013 and the way I think about it, it\u2019s just another way of capacity limitation. Just if you just think about it, on average, I guess we have one or two sections closed in most of our restaurants, most nights. So we are losing 6 to 8 tables. So there is, especially in Olive Garden, that\u2019s putting a cap on what we can do for sales. So, when I think about the overall and I sum up Olive Garden\u2019s performance, I just think that we are doing unbelievable. We have got 23.2% restaurant level earnings percentage. Our profit grew $25 million over pre-COVID. This is just \u2013 this is an impressive business. And we are just \u2013 we are reevaluating over time how we are going to take this business to market when we think about couponing, when we think about overall promotional activity and full marketing. John Glass : Thank you for that. And if I can just ask one follow-up, Raj, on your commodity comments, it sounds like you would still expect maybe better commodity inflation later in the year. Do you have better visibility than you did before? I mean what would prevent you from having to go to the spot market more often if sales continue to go? How much visibility do you have on that inflation for the full year now versus last quarter? Raj Vennam : Sure, John. Let me start by saying we have \u2013 you saw us we increased our forecast for sales. So, that gives us a little bit of, I guess, less need to have to go back into the market than what we are already anticipating. So, some of that increased sales impact is baked into our estimate. As we look at Q2 and Q3, we have more visibility clearly into \u2013 a lot more into Q2 and some decent visibility into Q3. Q4 is one that\u2019s probably we will have to figure out where things shake out, but we do \u2013 we did have higher inflation last year in Q4. But all-in-all, the way we are thinking about it is, Q1, we had about 5.5%. We have about 80% contracted for Q2 based on the updated volume. And then for Q3, I think we have around 60% contracted out. So, we feel pretty good about that. Could there be some movement? Absolutely. But I think that\u2019s where we showed you, I think, in the first quarter how we have the ability to manage through that. I mean, I think the fact I mentioned about the business model improvements as well as other levers we have at our disposable \u2013 at our disposal to help us manage through that fairly well. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Andrew Charles : Great. Rick, I appreciate the commentary on the labor and staffing challenges. What have you seen over the last 2 weeks since that $300 a week [supplemental] (ph) unemployment insurance expired. Has this been as large of a tailwind as you previously anticipated and perhaps you can speak to what you are seeing in state that curtailed benefits earlier this summer as a leading indicator? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Gene Lee : Hey, Andrew. Thanks for the question. I would say is we have done a lot of things to help increase staff flow \u2013 or applicant flow. And one of those that I talked about was the new system we put in place. We haven\u2019t really seen a dramatic change in staffing flow from when we put that new system in place to when the unemployment benefit started to eliminate. So we think we have been getting staffing flow even before that happened. We have, as we said, staffing challenges. And the challenges are a little bit more in certain parts of the country, but not necessarily driven by unemployment benefits. It\u2019s just driven by when they have opened up versus not when they have opened up. We are not so worried about getting great applicants, because we are getting them right now. Andrew Charles : Yes. And then my follow-up question is that you have called out prior to the pandemic that Olive Garden could reach 20% of sales off-premise. And obviously, with the rebound in the dine-in business, you are seeing that off-premise mix come down a bit still sticky. You are now accounting for about 27% of the brand sales. Do you think this is a fair mix of sales that you can sustainably see going forward or is it likely to further come down as staffing challenges ultimately ease and you can fulfill more on-premise dining? Gene Lee : Yes, Andrew, I still think that the off-premise mix will come down at Olive Garden and at LongHorn as the dining rooms continue to fill and people feel more comfortable going out to eat in a restaurant. We were starting to see that some when COVID was winding down before the Delta variant spiked. We were starting to see our percent of sales go down. And then when the Delta variant spike came back, we started to see that percent go back up. So, we don\u2019t believe that 27% is where we will be in the immediate long-term after COVID is over. We still think somewhere in the 20s, but that all depends. I mean, we have made a lot of great investments in our technology. We have made it easier for our team members to handle all of the orders. We have made it easier for our guests to order, to pay, to do the things that I mentioned in the earnings \u2013 in the call. And so we do believe that our To Go as a percent of sales is going to be greater than it was than we ever thought it would be before COVID. That\u2019s because we are getting a lot of people that have come to Olive Garden into LongHorn that hadn\u2019t done that \u2013 hadn\u2019t done To Go before. So \u2013 and they are getting a great experience. Andrew Charles : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question today comes from Jared Garber of Goldman Sachs. Jared Garber : Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, the LongHorn trends remain very robust and I think it was really encouraging to see the Fine Dining segment turned positive this quarter. Can you talk about what you are seeing in terms of pent-up demand and consumer trade-up? It seems like the Steak category remains really strong, maybe even relative to some of the other brands. And I wonder if some of that trade-up is sort of not benefiting Olive Garden as much despite some of the reduced pro activities in that brand? Gene Lee : Yes. I think that might be overthinking it just a little bit. I mean the steakhouse category has been strengthening even be pre-COVID, strengthened through COVID. I think that LongHorn as, as we have discussed, has benefited somewhat from geographical footprint that has been \u2013 when you think their footprint heavy Georgia, heavy Florida, I also think that we have made a lot of investments in LongHorn over the last 5 or 6 years. And I think they are really \u2013 they have come through. I would also say that operating these smaller footprints has been easier to \u2013 a little bit easier through COVID. We need a lot less employees to run at LongHorn. I think we are fully \u2013 basically fully staffed in that business. And so I think it\u2019s all come together and running real well. As far as Fine Dining goes, I mean we are thrilled to see the level \u2013 the sales volumes we did this summer in Fine Dining. I will tell you that there is still a heavy drag on Fine Dining in the major cities. We are still down 40% in our 3 Manhattan locations, a little bit less than that in the other major cities, but we are seeing a big uptick in Suburbia in Fine Dining, which has been fantastic. And so that business has been robust. I never thought in my wildest dreams, I\u2019d see the kind of absolute numbers that we saw this summer in Fine Dining, which has been fantastic. So, I think there is some celebratory out there. I think that \u2013 I think people who aren\u2019t traveling for business as much as they used to are using Fine Dining restaurants maybe a little bit more on the weekend, which has been great to see. And I think the only other thing that I would say on Fine Dining is Sundays become a legitimate sales day in Fine Dining, which was really pre-COVID kind of a throwaway day and most \u2013 unless you are in a convention city and a convention start on Sunday, but Sunday is our real legitimate day now, which is taking \u2013 operationally has taken some adjustments for us to get used to. Jared Garber : Thanks. Appreciate the color there. And I just wanted to follow-up on the unit growth commentary that you made earlier, Gene. I think it was really encouraging to hear that you\u2019ll likely be ahead of that at the top end or ahead of that 2% to 3% range in \u201823. Can you talk a little bit about the adjustments or the impacts you\u2019ve seen in the other segment and maybe some of the opportunities coming out of the pandemic in that segment for the restaurants within there? Gene Lee : Yes. I think the biggest impact has been we transformed those business models, and we\u2019ve talked about the transformation we\u2019ve made at Cheddar\u2019s. Also Bahama Breeze had a significant transformation there. We\u2019re doing some good work in Yard House. We\u2019re making some more investments in the food. We\u2019ve got that business model in a good place. So we think there is good outsized, hopefully, good growth in that business. So we have a lot more confidence in investing on new capital into these segments. I mean we\u2019ve also \u2013 I mean Seasons is another business that\u2019s really made significant improvement, so that we\u2019re confident to reinvest in that business. So as the real estate becomes available, we have more options. We\u2019re confident and more options to use that real estate. So if we go into a market where we already have a great Olive Garden and great LongHorn, we have a property or a brand that we can put on top of that great piece of real estate and confident that we\u2019re going to get a really good return from that. And so it\u2019s given our real estate and development team a little bit more flexibility now that we have this confidence in these businesses that we can grow in. Jared Garber : Thanks so much for the color. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Jake Bartlett of Truist Securities. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. My question is on the limited menu in Olive Garden. And I\u2019m just wondering whether there \u2013 do you have any concern that, that\u2019s impacting the recovery, the pace of the recovery and Olive Garden, whether that\u2019s impacting sales? I know it\u2019s been great for margins. In the context of that question, I think there is been commentary from some of the distributors that independents are reexpanding their menus. Is there a concern that as others kind of re-expand the menus that you guys might be missing on sales? And then I have a follow-up. Gene Lee : Jake, I think that the limited menu is not impacting Olive Garden at all, and I\u2019ll go back to the context I provided in the beginning. If you just use the breakeven on the advertising, we\u2019d be up double digits in this business. And we don\u2019t do advertising to break even. Again, the recovery in Olive Garden, I think, has been stronger than most. And I define recovery based on how much profit we make. And I keep looking at that profitability number, and I\u2019m really pleased. So I don\u2019t think the limited menu is having any impact on our ability to drive top line in that business. I\u2019d go back to some of the things I outlined in the beginning. As far as independents adding menu items, more power to it. They think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive their business, let them make those decisions. We\u2019re very comfortable where we are with our menus at this point in time. Jake Bartlett : Great. I appreciate that. And following up on that, selling expense has been about 1% of sales for the last three quarters now. Is that the right level we should think about for the rest of the year? And maybe just share any thoughts you have on longer term, significant change from historical. So where should we be thinking more than near in the long-term in terms of marketing as a percentage of sales? Gene Lee : Well, I think for the short-term, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us change our marketing strategies at all or, I guess, our tactics at all at this point in time. I think longer term, I think I\u2019m going to go back to what I talked about last call was, we\u2019re still waiting to determine what \u2013 what is the equilibrium of this business? What\u2019s going to be on-premise? What\u2019s going to be off-premise? What\u2019s the competitive set look like? This additional kind of ramp-up in COVID, I think, is stressing out more restaurants, so maybe there is going to be some more closures. I don\u2019t know \u2013 we don\u2019t know. And so we\u2019re just searching for equilibrium. And once we get to that equilibrium, we will develop a strategy and implement tactics that we think will best position our brands to be able to grow profitably into the future. But at this point for us to talk about that and kind of say where we think that\u2019s going to end up, that would be \u2013 that\u2019s just a huge mistake because we just don\u2019t know what environment we\u2019re going to be operating in. Jake Bartlett : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, Gene, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, specific to August, that trend slowed versus June and July, but still up versus pre-COVID. Just wondering how much of that you maybe attribute to the staffing shortage versus maybe the spike from a Delta variant perspective, just trying to gauge the impact from each. And I think you said September was up 7% per operating week versus the first quarter, up only 4.8%. So I\u2019m just wondering what your assumption is for the rest of fiscal 2Q relative to that September comment. And then one follow-up. Gene Lee : Good try, Jeff. I\u2019m not going to comment on forward-looking on sales. I will just say that I will say in our commentary about the trends is that as COVID started to pick up, especially in the Southeast and Florida was hard hit where we have a huge footprint. You\u2019ve got \u2013 you had the impact of the Delta variant, and you also had back-to-school in a lot of these territories at that time. So we\u2019re having a hard time teasing out what was seasonality, what was the impact of the variant. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we gave \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get in the habit of given quarter-to-date sales at this call, but we felt that there was enough change in the sales environment that we wanted to be explicit that our sales have come back a little bit in September after falling a little bit in August. We think some of that has to do with COVID, some of that has to do, maybe there is a little bit less seasonality in the business. There is so many different variables impacting us week-to-week, month-to-month right now. It\u2019s very difficult to tease out. And so we\u2019re just being as transparent as we possibly can. You know where we\u2019re at quarter-to-date, and I\u2019m not going to comment on what. We\u2019ve given you guidance for the rest of the year, and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re going to be able to do. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just a follow-up more broadly on inflation, just wondering how you think about the restaurant industry and maybe even retail more broadly. It just seems like inflation is elevated. All industries seem to be raising prices and not getting much pushback from the consumer. I\u2019m just wondering maybe in your view, how does this end, whether for the industry or just for Darden, when you think about inflation versus pricing in the context of trying to drive traffic? Thank you. Gene Lee : Jeff, I guess it\u2019s a very good question, right? So I think \u2013 first of all, I think we could all agree that lower income consumer is going to be disproportionately impacted by increases in inflation. And that consumer is a big part of our guests make-up for our casual brands. So we\u2019re incredibly focused on the longer term pushback, not so much short term. People say, well, we\u2019re pushing this off on the guest, no one\u2019s pushing back. Eventually, there is going to be pushback. And so we\u2019re making a strategic choice, especially in Olive Garden and I\u2019ll say for Cheddar\u2019s, is that we\u2019re being very cautious with pricing, and we want to make sure that this big group of consumers that we service feel as though they can still come to our restaurants and get an extremely great value for what they have to pay. And so I think that those who manage through this prudently, those who really take a longer look, we will get through this okay. I think those who pass through a lot of price that aren\u2019t really managing their costs effectively, I think we\u2019ve got to really think about how we manage our cost going forward. Because at some point, your average consumer could get priced out of casual dining, if it costs too much. And I think myself and my \u2013 and the entire team is really, really concerned about that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the strategic choice that we\u2019ve made with pricing. And so I think we\u2019re thinking about how do we position ourselves to excel in an inflationary environment. Operator : Our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Gene, a question on Olive Garden and the performance there and I appreciate all the factors that you mentioned on that that may have weighed on the sales for that brand. But I was just curious to get your thoughts on whether you think that was particularly acute in the quarter you just reported and some of those factors could ease as the year goes on or how are you thinking about that? Are you assuming those factors continue for the rest of the year or not? Gene Lee : Yes. I think the one thing I would add that I did not mention in the comparables for this first quarter was 2 years ago, we were running buy one take one, which is a significant traffic-driving promotion. And we believe it does have some profitability tied to it. So that was weighing on the comparable performance in Q1. David, I really don\u2019t know. I mean, I think that we\u2019re looking at Olive Garden more on a bottom line perspective than just the top line at this point in time. It makes no sense at all any business today to be advertised and driving sales in the restaurants that are \u2013 you aren\u2019t assured that you are 100% fully staffed and can provide a great dining experience. Until we get to that and we feel certain that we have that every single day without having to deal with exclusions, we\u2019re not going to get out there and try to push people into these restaurants. It just makes no sense to me. And so when I look at what we\u2019re doing in Olive Garden and I continue to just be thrilled and continue to exceed my expectations. And it seems as though we continue to disappoint the sell-side expectations on this. But this is a very, very difficult operating environment. And I think that some of those things, if COVID, if you can tell me what\u2019s going to happen with COVID moving forward, then I can tell you that some of this stuff will ease. But when COVID is still prevalent in our communities, we\u2019re not going to know what the full potential or what I refer to as equilibrium is for a while. David Tarantino : Understood. And on the staffing levels, I just wanted to clarify. I think you might have said that you\u2019re running at about 90% of pre-COVID levels, if I heard that right. What is the targeted level? How does that compare to what you would ideally like to be? Because I think you had some efficiency gains that might lead to, I guess, lower levels than you had pre-COVID optimally. But I guess, where are you relative to optimal level? Rick Cardenas : Yes, David, this is Rick. I did say 90% of pre-COVID staffing levels. Assuming the volume that we have today, right, so volume will drive how much staffing you need. So think about that. We probably need somewhere in the single-digit number of team members in our restaurants. We have some restaurants that need a little bit more because of the location they are in. But as I said, most of our restaurants are fairly well staffed. And so as the volumes start to increase, we continue to hire. And so it really depends on where the volumes end up. But we don\u2019t believe that we would need the same number of people that we did before COVID at the same volume levels with these new venues. Yes. And the other thing that\u2019s happening now is we\u2019ve got team members that are coming into the industry that may not be able to work the same number of hours. So it really all depends on the hours that people can work and the days they can work. So staffing levels in a number of people versus where we were pre-COVID probably isn\u2019t the best indicator, but it\u2019s a pretty good one. And again, as I said, we\u2019ve increased our productivity. So all equal, same number of hours for a person, same number of guest count for someone we would need fewer people. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question today comes from Brett Levy of MKM Partners. Brett Levy : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if we could just go both big picture and then more specific to you guys. If you could just parse out a little bit more on the competitive landscape, maybe a little bit more on the regionality and what you\u2019re seeing out there as well as if you\u2019re willing to share the market share data of how much share you gained in the quarter? And then also, specifically for you, you\u2019ve had great successes on the margins, both through your planning, but just also through your execution. Where do you see margins really hitting a ceiling, and I guess we can either do that for Darden consolidated or at LongHorn and Olive Garden specifically. Thanks guys. Gene Lee : Good morning, Brett. I think let me just comment on maybe some regionality more so than get into the competitive situation. I think that we\u2019ve been very pleased with how California has come back. I spent some time in California this quarter. It was a lot different than what I thought it was going to be. So I think that our sales have come back there since the middle of July, very strong. So we\u2019re very pleased with what\u2019s happening out there. We felt some pressure in Georgia and Florida over the last 6 to 8 weeks with the Delta variant. Texas didn\u2019t have much impact, and Texas seems to have a mind of its own. The Northeast has never really come back from where it was. It\u2019s still performing okay, but hasn\u2019t really rebounded. And then we\u2019ve got pockets today where you just \u2013 you can just look at the heat map for COVID, you know that you\u2019re going to have some sales problems. So you\u2019ve got some Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia issues today. But overall, I mean, I would say there is not a tremendous amount of difference in regionality. As far as margins go, the way I would think about that is we will eventually get back to our framework where we think we can get to 10% to 30% once we figure out where equilibrium is. And I\u2019m \u2013 I don\u2019t think any of us should sit here today and say, what\u2019s the ceiling or where these businesses run long-term. We do think that we\u2019ve made some really great strategic choices over the last couple of years. We\u2019ve transformed our business models. We\u2019ve learned a lot. We\u2019ve learned a real lot through this on how to be more efficient. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us give that up. And as long as we can continue to drive the top line, there is no reason why we can\u2019t hang on to these margins. Brett Levy : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Gonzalez of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Eric Gonzalez : Hi, thanks for the question. I just want to go back to the comment about the quarter-to-date trends. And I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse here, but I was just wondering if you can maybe talk about the different performance of the different brands. Did you see acceleration across \u2013 broadly across all your major brands? Or was it just maybe specific to one or two of them? And then my real question here is on the off-premise business. Recognizing that you don\u2019t want to overwhelm the staff by drawing in traffic with advertising, I was wondering if maybe there is an opportunity to push harder on that off-premise strategy with marketing promotions given that channel likely requires less labor. Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes. No comments on quarter-to-date. We gave you a number which I don\u2019t like to do and that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not going to talk about it anymore. As far as off-prem goes and trying to drive that, it\u2019s very, very difficult to drive that business specifically without discounting. And we don\u2019t want to discount. And there is \u2013 part of the labor problems and dealing with the exceptions impacts off-premise too. It takes less labor, but you still need to cook, you still need all these people to produce the food. And so we\u2019re trying to \u2013 when we think about this, we\u2019re trying to create great guest experiences, whether it\u2019s on-prem or off-prem. And as Rick outlined in his prepared remarks, dealing with these exclusions, I mean, it\u2019s not like we get a lot of notice that we\u2019ve got seven people that are excluded from the restaurant, and I was seven people short for the night. You got to adapt and try to overcome those challenges. And so I think that where we\u2019re at right now, we are doing some things off-premise without discounting. And on the weekends, we have to throttle the off-premise business. In other words, we can\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve got to control how many orders we do every 15 minutes. And each brand has a different way of throttling. Each restaurant can throttle differently. But on average, I\u2019ll give you an idea is that we only take four orders to go every 15 minutes, and there are a lot more orders than that. And so \u2013 and I think that, that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s something that we know we have excess demand, but we\u2019ve got to be able to service the dining and service the off-prem. Eric Gonzalez : From a margin perspective, the exclusion pay, are you able to maybe talk about what that might be just from an expense perspective, recognizing that the sales have an impact, but maybe there is an expense there from paying labor that\u2019s not present. Raj Vennam : It\u2019s not big enough. It\u2019s not a meaningful impact on the P&L. Eric Gonzalez : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Company. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning guys. Just going back to the staffing issues, you talked about at Olive Garden that clearly are restricting the sales capacity. When you look at LongHorn, are they dealing with the same or similar issues from a staffing perspective. Obviously, it doesn\u2019t look like it when you look through the lens of just looking at the numbers. So if they are dealing with those staffing issues, can you just talk about why and the primary difference going on there between the two brands? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Rick. A couple of things about LongHorn, one is they have a smaller total team than Olive Garden does, right? So \u2013 and they actually were in parts of the country early in the pandemic that opened up a lot faster. So their staffing challenges aren\u2019t nearly where Olive Garden would be. And actually, right now, they have more team members than they did pre-COVID, but they are doing a lot more volume. So their staffing challenges are really the same thing on exclusions. And if you think about the exclusions, a lot of it impacts the kitchen. And so as long as they have got enough people working in the kitchen that they have an exclusion, they can continue to drive sales through that. It\u2019s not as big an issue for them. So if you think about a LongHorn, probably 60% of the total team members of a restaurant than an Olive Garden does. And so when you have exclusions, it\u2019s not as big of an impact for LongHorn. Brian Bittner : Okay. Great, thanks, Rick. And just with Olive Garden, aside from the staffing issues, how do you want us thinking about your ability to proactively drive the business in the future with more marketing and more promos? Meaning, are you just so pleased with this new profitability profile of Olive Garden that you really want this to kind of be the new base case strategy moving forward and how the brand operates? Or do you want us analysts thinking that you have this unused weapons that you could potentially deploy if you want? Gene Lee : No, I think this is \u2013 Brian, this is the way to think about it. This is the base business. And what we\u2019re going to try to do is once we figure out where equilibrium is we will develop a strategy and implement tactics to be able to drive the business profitably. What we will want to do is put back in another $100 million of marketing, you only get $400 million in sales. And then you go back to some of the comments I made earlier is that we want to make sure that we\u2019re focused on value. We think that with this inflation going through, there is going to be longer term is going to be \u2013 the winners are they going to be the ones who provide exceptional value to the consumer. And we\u2019re trying to position Olive Garden to be that brand. It\u2019s historically done well in downturns. And if we have a downturn, we want to position it to do really well. I think we will promote again. Don\u2019t get me wrong. We will promote again. We just think we will do it differently. And we are thinking \u2013 we think a lot more about the opportunity cost around the value of that table when we\u2019re extremely busy and how not to have guests sitting at that table paying less than full price. Even though it\u2019s a value proposition, we don\u2019t \u2013 if we want to be value and focus on value, we don\u2019t want to be discounting off a value platform. And I think that\u2019s really important. And so we\u2019ve got to figure that out once we get there. We\u2019ve got contingency plans right now. We think we know what we want to do. But we need to see what the competitive environment is, and we need to see what the economic backdrop is. Brian Bittner : Great. Thank you, Gene. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse. Lauren Silberman : Thank you. So just looking at trends across the brands on a 2-year basis, comp accelerated from the fourth quarter in May, all the segments except for Olive Garden. And I appreciate all the commentary on the differences on an absolute basis. But from a sequential perspective, are the dynamics the same? I\u2019m just trying to understand why just there is no change there. Raj Vennam : Hi, Lauren, let\u2019s make sure we understand the question. Can you repeat the question? Lauren Silberman : Sure. So just looking at a 2-year basis, comps for the quarter accelerated from the fourth quarter for LongHorn, Fine Dining and the other business, reasonably flat for Olive Garden. So I understand all the commentary on an absolute basis on 2-year comps across the brands. Just understand from a sequential perspective from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, if there is anything to call out regarding sort of the factors on the acceleration versus for the other brands versus reasonably flat for Olive Garden? Rick Cardenas : Yes. I\u2019ll just make a couple of quick things. I mean, when you think about like the other business, we got all \u2013 mostly Yard House back in the quarter. And Fine Dining, we got a lot more full capacity back in the second quarter. LongHorn has just the \u2013 steakhouse segment has just done extremely well. So I think that\u2019s really the big change. Raj Vennam : Yes. And I think the other thing is really the starting point is not apples-to-apples. That\u2019s what we keep trying to come back to is Olive Garden had a lot of \u2013 we talked about the promotion in Q1. We had a lot of market \u2013 the best \u2013 one of their best promotions and we had a lot of marketing dollars in there. So when you \u2013 when you\u2019re trying to compare it to the 2 years ago number, your starting point is off. That\u2019s where we would argue that\u2019s 10 points lower or more. So if you start with that, Olive Garden accelerated. And that\u2019s where there is some volatility when you look at that by brand because of the promotional differences. Lauren Silberman : Okay. Very helpful. And then just on loyalty. You previously tested a loyalty program across select restaurants. I think we\u2019ve seen a lot of brands implementing them or looking to implement a full service date. So do you have any updated thoughts on the potential for a loyalty program across the system? Or what you saw in tests as you think about it? Rick Cardenas : Hi, Lauren, it\u2019s Rick. Yes, we eliminated \u2013 well, we stopped the test of loyalty right when COVID started. We didn\u2019t believe it was the right thing to do during the time that we were making sure that we can get our restaurants open and up and running. We are working right now on everyday value. As we\u2019ve talked about for Olive Garden, we want to make sure that our value perception continues to improve. It\u2019s already great in all of our brands. And so right now, we haven\u2019t decided to even test again. That may come down to \u2013 may happen someday. But what we don\u2019t want to do is provide a loyalty program that provides a discount to the highest used consumer. So if we have a loyalty program, we will work on something that\u2019s different. Now I will say we were seeing positive trends in our loyalty program before. But that was a point-based discounted program that in the long run, we don\u2019t think is the right way to do loyalty in the restaurant business. Operator : We can move on to Dennis Geiger of UBS. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. First, Raj, just wanted to see if you could quantify the impact of the Thanksgiving shift on the quarter by chance? Raj Vennam : Yes. I would say at a high level, it\u2019s probably, think of it as about a 1% impact on a 2-year because we\u2019re comparing to pre-COVID, as you look at it, yes, think of it as about a point impact. Dennis Geiger : Yes, thank you very much. Great. And then just wanted to come back on the technology front some impressive digital results as it relates to the digital mix of off-premise, so just wanted to get a sense for any additional opportunities that you can share that can support either that off-premise business or even the dining business as it relates to the top line or even some additional margin efficiency opportunities. I think geo-fencing is kind of an interesting one that you have highlighted, so, curious if there is anything to share there and how close that might be or any other opportunities on the tech side? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Hi Dennis, this is Rick. Just a broad message on technology first is our goal is to implement technology really that reduces friction across every part of the value chain and while we respond to growing desire for choice and personalization from our guests. They want choice, they want to be personal \u2013 they want personal experiences. And so one of \u2013 a few of the things that we did in the first quarter, just to give you an idea, we added Apple Pay and Google Pay to olivegarden.com. We were already able to use PayPal to pay for you To Go order. And now over 25% of our mobile app transactions are paid via PayPal and these other wallets, where it\u2019s much more convenient to our guests to pay. We have updated the curbside, I am here experience for our guests when they have to go. Still not including geo-fencing, but it\u2019s coming as well. And we have just started AB testing for Olive Garden and online recommendations for items. I am not going to talk about what we are doing in future quarters, but we have more improvements. We continue to invest in this digital platform. Our goal for guest facing is to lead our segment when it comes to relevance and convenience for our guests. And we will continue to do that. Will we lead the restaurant industry, no, the quick service players are going to probably spend more and do more things in technology, but we are going to learn what they are doing and see what we can bring to our space. But we are going to lead the full-service restaurant space in technology for guest facing. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Operator : We can go to Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good morning. Two quick ones, on off-premise, can you talk about catering as an underlying trend than what you are seeing in catering? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Nicole, we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of pickup back in catering yet. We did see during COVID more catering to homes than to businesses. But since business spending and people still haven\u2019t gone back to offices, we haven\u2019t seen a huge pickup, but we are seeing some. We are seeing some growth in catering, but it hasn\u2019t been dramatic. We will see what happens during the holiday season this year. But right now, not a huge, huge jump in catering from what happened while COVID was going on. Nicole Miller : And then just a really high-level question around fine dining, you numbers are up like the industry peers, if not better. What is a fair assessment of some of the pluses and minuses of what we might think about for social or corporate gatherings coming up for the holiday season? Gene Lee : Yes. I think it\u2019s all going to depend on where we are with this variant and what the levels are, especially in some of the bigger markets. I would sit here today and say I think it\u2019s going to be a robust holiday season. I think we have a robust holiday season for all our restaurants in all of retail. I think that the consumer is still fairly healthy from a financial standpoint. And we will know more in the next six weeks to eight weeks as we start thinking about we start seeing the bookings. One trend that we have seen over the last six weeks to eight weeks is we have seen a lot of cancellations of larger parties or gatherings inside the fine dining restaurants as people aren\u2019t as comfortable gathering in big groups as they may have been in the mid-summer. But I would expect this to be a robust holiday season if the variant is under control. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Operator : We can now move on to Jeff Farmer of Gordon Haskett. Jeff Farmer : Good morning and thanks guys. Just quickly wanted to follow-up on some of the menu pricing and value questions that you guys received, I think you pointed to holding menu pricing obviously well below inflation levels, but that has moved higher for you. So, I think menu pricing sit at roughly 1.5% in the last quarter. Where do you think menu pricing could go this quarter and over the balance of the year considering that that inflation \u2013 total inflation number has ticked up for you? Raj Vennam : Yes. Hi Jeff, I will speak to the year. What\u2019s contemplated in our guidance is pricing just under 2%. So, if you think about our total inflation being 4% in this \u2013 in the forecast we provided, our outlook we provided, we are assuming pricing just under 2%. Jeff Farmer : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then different topic, a lot of your peers, casual dining peers have been pretty aggressive in taking these delivery menu pricing premiums, which have improved the margin structure profile for that delivery offering. I am just curious, has that changed your opinion about potentially pursuing delivery, considering that there is a little bit better margin profile out there for that sales channel? Gene Lee : No. Jeff Farmer : Alright. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Mullan of Deutsche Bank. Brian Mullan : Hi. Thank you. Just a question on the long-term development opportunity for Olive Garden, you made commentary in recent quarters, a bit less worried about cannibalization you might have been in the past, more optimistic on the number of units. So, this question is what\u2019s your current thinking on the long-term potential here? Is there an actual number you have in mind? Could there be 1,000 restaurants? Could there be more? Just any color on your updated thinking? Gene Lee : Yes. I don\u2019t think we want to put a number. I will say more than 1,000. We think that there is a pathway to get there. I think it\u2019s dangerous to say, I have been in this business doing this for a long time, and every time we run a brand, we put out numbers that we think are potential. The brand is really strong. We kind of get through those numbers pretty easily. So, let\u2019s just say we \u2013 one of our underlying belief is that convenience is going to continue to matter. We are going to need to build restaurants closer to where people live. And we also believe in, especially in Olive Garden that we can build in more remote areas that have these large, what I would call these like 60-mile trade areas where people travel in and out to get things and dine. And so we are pretty excited about where we can take Olive Garden, especially if we can maintain over 20% off-premise. That opens up some more trade areas. We just continue to open Olive Gardens and amazed. And we continue to be amazed at the volumes we do and then the returns that we are getting. So, we definitely think we can get over 1,000 fairly easily. Brian Mullan : That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull of Stifel. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning guys. Gene, I wanted to get your perspective on what you think is driving the industry labor shortage and how the industry can create maybe a stronger employee proposition to attract talent? Gene Lee : Yes. First of all, I don\u2019t think the labor shortage is just the restaurant industry, I think it\u2019s a national problem. I think that we see it with our vendors. We see it in other places. We all have associated maybe with some other companies that we see this challenge every single day. So, I do think that as we think about the restaurant proposition, I think we have to all understand what do restaurant team members want. I mean they want an opportunity to be able to work in an environment that is well run. They want flexibility. They want growth depending on what they are using the job for. And a lot of restaurant jobs are pass-through. They are kind of \u2013 let\u2019s get from point A to point B. And I think as we have to continue to find ways to improve that proposition. I think that one of the things that I am really most proud of is how many people that come into us as an hourly employee and that we are able to get into management. We got \u2013 in the last three months or four months, we have got almost 500 team members we have taken from our hourly ranks and moved them into management ranks. And I love that growth. I love that opportunity. When I am in the field, I would love to meet these people and they are just \u2013 they are so excited about their future and their potential. So, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think those who have resources, and I think this is where scale is going to matter, too. Those who have resources that can create employment proposition that\u2019s stronger than others will attract people. There is no doubt that I think that we are in a lot better shape than others in this \u2013 with labor at this point in time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to come down to be an individual situation, which company and, more importantly, it gets down to the restaurant manager, the GM and inside each of that box, can they create an environment where people want to work. And that\u2019s how we will attract people. Where we have our best leadership, we do not have people problems. Chris O\u2019Cull: One thing you didn\u2019t mention was pay. And I am just curious if you think continuing increasing pay at kind of healthier rates or the rates that we have seen recently, if you think that will address the employment issue at all? Gene Lee : No, I think you got to have competitive pay. And I think that\u2019s only one aspect of the employment proposition. There has been pressure on wage now for a few years, even before COVID. I think there will be pressure on wage as we move forward. But I don\u2019t think it all comes down to just pay. I mean, I think if you \u2013 I don\u2019t think the problems for the industry go away just because we are going to \u2013 if we pay more. Chris O\u2019Cull: Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. I think the restaurant expense line was down 110 basis points on a 2-year basis in the quarter with comps up 5% over that time. Could you talk about how the company is doing this? And how much of that do you think is sustainable productivity longer term in your view? Raj Vennam : David, this is Raj. So, restaurant expenses per operating week were on an absolute basis, were slightly below. I think we are at about a point below where we were pre-COVID. We have found some efficiencies through the pandemic on some contract services and some R&M. I do think some of the costs will come back in a little bit, but it\u2019s still going to be a point of leverage. I mean a line that we are going to continue to see some improvement versus pre-COVID. Is it going to stay at the 110, 120 range, probably not. It all \u2013 again, also it depends on where the sales are. But we are managing \u2013 that\u2019s one line where we have been able to manage well and keep it fairly flat or actually slightly below where we were pre-COVID. David Palmer : Just a quick follow-up on that part is what are some specific things that are going on there? And then I just \u2013 separate question on the marketing and promotion side. I am wondering how you are thinking about marketing and promotion spending as you see some of these COVID era forces easing, a variety of them. So, more specifically, do you anticipate marketing and promotion spending returning to fiscal \u201819 levels in fiscal \u201823? Thanks. Raj Vennam : So, let me answer the last question first. No, we don\u2019t expect it to get back to that at this point. But then on the restaurant expense line, like I said, it\u2019s really contract services. We continue to look at our vendors and continue to work with them on how to kind of optimize, streamline some of this, and that\u2019s part of that. There was a little bit less R&M that has been catching up. And I think by Q1, we are more closer to pre-COVID levels on that line. But there is a little bit more on that line that I think will come back. But beyond that, there is really no specific one item here or there. I mean there is music, there is other stuff that we talk about, but these are \u2013 it\u2019s in multiple places. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Andy Barish : Hey, good morning guys. Just a couple of kind of short-term questions, which I am sure you love. On the September numbers that you talked about, can you just give us a sense of the noise in the quarter so far? I know there was a Labor Day shift, I think with 2 years ago, obviously, weather. Just trying to get a sense of what you can tease out given all the other variables? Raj Vennam : Yes. Hi Andy. So, we actually don\u2019t have a Labor Day shift because our fiscal years \u2013 we are giving you fiscal comps and our labor \u2013 because of the 53 weeks that we had in fiscal \u201819, we actually have apples-to-apples for Labor Day. There was clearly some impact from Hurricane Dorian that about 2 years ago that we had talked about that impacted the first few weeks a little bit. High level, maybe a point or so at the time, I can\u2019t recall exactly, but that\u2019s what I would say. Andy Barish : And then just finally on the margins sequentially, this is usually a quarter where you see a couple of hundred basis points of sequential decline in margins given the volumes are usually the lowest. Is that somewhat predictable this year, or just too tough to tell given everything going on out there? Raj Vennam : So, let me answer it without getting to the specifics on that. Q2 is one where we do think because of the low volumes and low margins to begin with, you are probably going to have a little bit more improvement than a typical quarter. But I would say that Q2 is also one quarter where we are probably going to have the highest inflation as we look at where we are sitting, right. And so, it\u2019s going to be higher than Q1 in terms of inflation. Andy Barish : Okay, helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to get back to labor and staffing in particular. I heard you were adding 1,000 net new employees per week, I think you said, which obviously is a great achievement. Can you talk about the quits rate at Darden just overall turnover and just as you are kind of hiring 1,000 people net, which obviously is much more than that gross? How you are feeling about some of the real-time operating metrics that you look at in terms of where those are versus standard? And assuming there might be a tick below, how quickly you think you can ramp back up to where you would like to be? Rick Cardenas : Yes, John, this is Rick. On the turnover front, we are actually starting to see our turnover get improved dramatically from where it was kind of during COVID and even coming right out of COVID. We are still well better than the casual dining industry in turnover and especially in the first 90-day turnover, right. And that really is a testament to the training that we are doing to these new team members when they are coming in. Now, turnover is still higher than it was pre-COVID, but it\u2019s getting much better, and it\u2019s still much better than the industry. John Ivankoe : And on the operating side? Rick Cardenas : Say it again? John Ivankoe : Sorry. And on the operating side, I mean, considering you are hiring so many new employees, I mean, 1,000 net is obviously much more than that gross. I mean if that \u2013 what that\u2019s translating in terms of some of your real-time operating metrics relative to the past? And if there is an opportunity to maybe improve on the margin given how new your overall staff is? Rick Cardenas : Yes. I would say if you think about the percent of our team members that are in the first 90 days, they are not as productive as team members that are \u2013 have been with us for a year. And we do have a higher percentage of team members that are with us for the first 90 days than we were 2 years ago. So, there are some productivity improvements that we can do for those new team members. And we are spending a little bit more in training than we did 2 years ago because of that. And so there might be some chance to offset some of those things. But that will just come from inflation down the road. But yes, operating, we are operating well all of our operating metrics. If you think about our guest satisfaction metrics, they are still at the same levels they were over the last three months or four months, even with these new team members. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo. Jon Tower : Awesome. Thanks for taking my questions. First and I apologize if I missed this one. But Raj, did you quantify the headwind that the exclusions had on OG sales during the quarter? And then second, Rick and Gene, throughout this call, you hit on the benefits of scale and how important that is to your overall business and frankly, how well your business has been doing despite the challenges that the industry has been facing. I would assume that many of your smaller competitors in the category are feeling the pain more acutely than you are. So, I am curious, given the benefits of scale your company could bring to the table, has your appetite for adding brands to the portfolio grown at all over the past six months or so? Gene Lee : We did not quantify the \u2013 any impact on sales from the exclusions. That\u2019s something that\u2019s \u2013 we can\u2019t do that. No, we have no methodology to do that. As far as M&A goes, I mean, we are at the same place. We are a platform company. Management and the Board continue to evaluate options. And when we find an option that we think that makes sense, maybe we will do some. Right now, I would just pivot to say that we are extreme \u2013 as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we are really focused on growing our existing brands. We love how healthy our brands are, vibrant and how good strong the business models are. We think opening our own restaurants right now is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Jon Tower : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro of Raymond James. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks. Just two quick ones for me, on the quarter-to-date, can you confirm that average weekly sales volumes also improved sequentially? Was the percent increase kind of more driven by lapping easier seasonal comparison, September is usually lower back-to-school? And then Raj, what level of G&A is bedded in your fiscal \u201822 guidance? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Okay. Brian, for September quarter-to-date, the numbers we are referencing are versus pre-COVID. So, as you rightly pointed out, there is a seasonality as you come into September. September is, I think, generally the lowest seasonal month for us and the industry in casual space. But with that said, on the G&A front, like I said, if you take out the $15 million of the unique items that we had this quarter, that would be a good run rate to use as you look forward. Brian Vaccaro : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just had two quick ones on unit growth and real estate. It feels like similar to yourselves, there is a number of brands that are talking about accelerating unit growth kind of coming out of the pandemic. So, I am just curious for your perspective on the real estate environment in terms of availability price. Are you seeing that kind of competition play out? And then secondarily, you have given several eloquent answers about why it makes so much sense to put up your own new units. I am just curious why you think 3%ish is kind of the right level at this point? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes. Unit growth, its acquiring sites as this was hard as it was pre-COVID. I mean it\u2019s people are out there competing not just restaurants or just not restaurants competing for space. I mean retailers use the spaces that we use. Banks use the spaces that we use. There are a lot \u2013 there is a lot of competition out there. It\u2019s definitely getting more expensive. We are seeing construction costs start to moderate. I will tell you that having been an investment-grade credit does help with landlords. And how we behave through the crisis and how we paid our rent is not forgotten with these landlords. So, I think that we have a very exciting group of brands to put on pieces of property and people are excited as Darden as the tenant. As far as why is 3%, where we believe the right number to be, it comes down to people. I think that the most important decision we make on running this kind of business is who is going to be the management team in that restaurant. And we need to make sure we have people that can handle that responsibility. Especially in our smaller brands, it\u2019s really tough to really ramp up that growth because you rip through your human resources quickly. Every time you open a restaurant, you really have two new general managers. You have taken an existing General Manager and Managing Partner from an existing business, putting them in a new business and then you got somebody new in the existing business. So, you have two businesses at risk. And we are doing this for the amount of years that I have done it. I think that for Darden, 3% growth rate is really maxing out our human resources and our ability to do this correctly. And it takes a lot to open a restaurant. It takes a real lot to open a restaurant, and we need to do it right. And if you don\u2019t open a restaurant right and get it right in that first six months, they tend to be a problem for up to 3 years. And that\u2019s why we are pretty conservative on how we think about this. Andrew Strelzik : Great, very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : We can go to Chris Carril of RBC Capital Markets. Chris Carril : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. So, you offered some commentary around guest-facing technology, but curious to hear your thoughts on investing in technology that helps on the labor side. I believe you mentioned tech related to eating in-restaurant operations, but maybe anything else that\u2019s related to hiring or related to scheduling? Any additional detail on tech focused on labor and staffing would be helpful? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Chris, this is Rick. We do \u2013 in the restaurant-facing things that aren\u2019t guest-facing, our primary goal is to improve productivity and simplify processes. We believe we have a world-class scheduling system, and that does a great job taking the General Manager\u2019s forecast and scheduling a great schedule. What isn\u2019t world-class, and it is the user interface for the manager to make it easier for them. So, we continue to do things to make it easier for managers to do things faster, so they can get with guests and they can train their team members and be with guests more. We have some things for our team members and what we have done with To Go in the kitchen. And we are looking at machine learning and AI to do better forecasting. So, there is a lot of things that we are working on, especially in the kitchen, making it easier to order and receive product, do inventory and those kind of things. On the service side, we are testing a few things that may make it easier for them. But what we don\u2019t want to do is have technology override the experience for the guests. So, we will continue to make these investments in our technology, in our kitchen technology and our To Go technology to help improve productivity. Chris Carril : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just quickly, just following back up on the topic of reduced industry supply from competitor closures. Just curious if you have any observations you can share from markets where perhaps you saw more competitor closures versus markets where there were less closures, right? Just really just trying to get a sense of to what extent there has been any \u2013 or to what extent there has been a benefit from industry closures? Thanks. Gene Lee : I would say there is two ways to think about it. Number one, in your Tier 1 trade areas, you are not going to see a lot of closures, right. So, even in a below average restaurant can make it in a Tier 1 environment, unless the rent is too onerous. So, you are seeing more of the closures in your secondary and tertiary sites, especially from independents in the casual space and some chain restaurants. Now in some of the Tier 1 sites, you are seeing some independent closure on fine dining. I believe that those will be the first to come back. Those are built out as restaurants. They will get recapitalized very quickly going to let chef and other owners. So, I do think those will come back. But I would summarize this by saying you are not seeing in your Tier 1. You are seeing it more in your tertiary areas where you have seen a lot of closures. Chris Carril : Got it. Okay. Thanks for all the detail today. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Kalicak, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Thanks, Kevin. That concludes our call. I would like to remind everyone that we plan to release second quarter results on Friday, December 17th, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you, sir. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are; Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of those measurements are included in the presentation. Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing second quarter performance as a comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic impact on the business and limited capacity environment that we operated in during the second quarter of fiscal '21. We plan to release fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 24 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks, Rick will give an update on our operating performance and Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2022 financial outlook. Now I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, we had a fantastic quarter. Sales trends remained strong throughout the quarter as all our brands stayed laser-focused on creating memorable guest experiences. Despite the toughest inflationary environment we've seen in years, we achieved strong profitable sales growth. Our ongoing success navigating the pandemic is a testament to the power of our strategy driven by our back-to-basics operating philosophy and the strength of our 4 competitive advantages. Our disciplined commitment to our strategy has allowed us to manage this environment well, while returning significant cash to our shareholders. People and product will continue to be our focus and Rick will share more details about that in a minute. Additionally, our teams have done a great job managing inflation effectively, and Raj will provide more color on that during his remarks. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they delight our guests and help create lasting holiday memories. This time of year, is also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business, which is why we're committed to serving our guests, our team members and our communities. One of the ways we serve our communities is by helping fight hunger. This fiscal year through our foundation, Darden provided $2.5 million to help our partners at Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 15 food banks to support mobile pantry programs, and distribution in communities facing high rates of food insecurity. We are uniquely positioned to help, and by leveraging our scale and relationships with partners like Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we're proudly doing our part to help get food into the hands of people who need it. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our team members for everything you do to serve our guests, and our communities. And I wish you all a wonderful holiday season. Finally, earlier today, we announced that effective May 30, Rick will succeed me as Chief Executive Officer and will join Darden's Board of Directors. This is the right time for this transition, and I look forward to continuing to serve as Darden's Chairman. Our company is in a clear position of strength, and this is also the right time for me and my family. I'm excited for Rick, who's been a tremendous partner over the last seven years, and is one of the best strategic thinkers I've worked alongside. Our brands have tremendous opportunity ahead of them, and Rick is the perfect person to lead Darden into the next chapter. On behalf of the Board, Darden's management team and our 170,000 team members, I want to congratulate Rick, and wish him all the best. Rick? Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Gene. Good morning, everyone. It is an honor to be appointed Darden's next Chief Executive Officer, and I'm grateful to Gene and the Board for their confidence in me. It is humbling to lead 170,000 outstanding team members who nourish and delight everyone we serve. I was incredibly fortunate to work with each of Darden's CEOs, so I have a strong appreciation for the legacy of leadership I am inheriting. By upholding our commitment to operational excellence, and maximizing the power of the Darden platform, we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and shareholder value. Turning to the quarter. Our restaurants continue to execute at a high level. Our focus on simplifying operations to drive execution remains our top priority, which is why we once again paused any new initiatives during the quarter in order to eliminate distractions and allow our operators to focus on running great shifts. This pause also ensures they can zero in on people and product, as we navigate through the current staffing and supply chain challenges. From a people perspective, we feel good about the progress we've made on the staffing front. Across our brands, manager staffing levels are above historical norms, and team member staffing levels continue to improve. Our new hiring system has made it easier to source talent, giving our management teams more time to focus on successfully onboarding and training new team members. We also continue to invest in our team members, further strengthening our industry-leading employment proposition. Earlier this year, we committed to increasing the minimum hourly earnings for our restaurant team members to $12, which includes income earned through gratuities by January 2023. However, given the strength of our performance, we are accelerating that timing to January 2022. This primarily impacts entry-level roles such as hosts, busters and dishwashers. And with this change, we expect our restaurant team members will earn, on average, approximately $20 per hour. Our people are the key to our performance. We work hard to be the employer of choice in our industry, and we're proud that our retention rates for managers and team members are both in the top quartile, and we will continue to invest in them to retain and attract the best talent in the industry. On the product side, our supply chain team continues to do a great job, making sure our restaurants have the products they need to serve our guests. Our inventory levels are strong, and the team's ability to meet the needs of the business can be seen in the fact that we shipped more cases in the last two quarters than at any time during Darden's history. The ability to maintain supply continuity for our restaurants minimizes distractions and allows our operators to focus on executing at the highest level, whether our guests are in our dining rooms or enjoying the convenience of To Go. During the quarter, To Go sales continued to benefit from the strength of our digital platform. This platform not only makes it easier for our teams to execute, it makes it more convenient for our guests to visit, order, pay and pick up. Off-premise sales accounted for 28% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during this quarter and 11% of Darden's total sales. Finally, we successfully opened 12 new restaurants during the quarter, including a flagship Yard House in Times Square, with minimal staffing challenges. The time to build a new restaurant is longer today than it has been historically, and we are also beginning to see longer lead times for kitchen equipment and technology hardware. Regardless, we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year. To wrap up, I also want to recognize our team members in our restaurants and our support center, for your tireless efforts in creating exceptional experiences for our guests. I wish you all a safe and happy holiday season. Now I'll turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, 37% higher than last year, driven by 34.4% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. Average weekly sales grew by more than 7% compared to pre-COVID. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.48. Total EBITDA was $335 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 14.7%. The significant business model improvements we made over the past year and half, combined with strong sales, resulted in margin growth of 270 basis points compared to pre-COVID. We expect this to be the highest quarterly EBITDA margin growth this fiscal year as this quarter has the most opportunity given its low seasonality. We continue to return significant cash to shareholders, paying $143 million in dividends and repurchasing $266 million in shares, totaling over $400 million of cash returned to investors in the quarter. And while we're happy with our performance, cost pressures continue to exceed our expectations on both commodities and labor with total inflation of 6% this quarter. Our teams continue to demonstrate agility in managing through this environment. This quarter, we implemented several mitigating actions to preserve the strength of our business model while balancing the impact to our guests and team members. One of these actions was taking additional pricing. For the second quarter, total pricing was 2%, and we expect back half pricing to approach 4%, resulting in total pricing of just under 3% for the full fiscal year. We continue to execute our strategy of pricing significantly below our overall inflation to strengthen our value leadership position by leveraging our scale. This level of pricing covers most of what we consider to be the structural and long-lasting impacts of the current inflationary environment, and absorbing what we consider to be more short-term fluctuations, while providing future flexibility should there be a need. For the rest of the fiscal year, we expect commodity and labor inflation to peak in our third quarter and then start to slow down as we enter the fourth quarter, and lap commodities inflation of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. Now turning to our P&L and segment performance for the second quarter. We're comparing against pre-COVID results in the second quarter of 2020, which we believe are more comparable to normal business operations, and with how we've been framing our margin expansion opportunity. For the second quarter, food and beverage expenses were 220 basis points higher, driven by elevated commodity inflation of 9% as well as investments in food quality, portion size and pricing significantly below inflation. Restaurant labor was 90 basis points favorable, driven by sales leverage and efficiencies gained from operational simplifications, and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures. Hourly wage inflation during the quarter was almost 9%. Restaurant expenses were 130 basis points lower due to sales leverage, which more than offset higher utilities costs. Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 230 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant-level EBITDA margin for Darden was 18.8%, 230 basis points better than pre-COVID levels. G&A expense was 40 basis points lower, driven by savings from the corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021, a decrease in mark-to-market expense and sales leverage. Turning to our segment performance. Second quarter sales at Olive Garden increased 5% versus pre-COVID, strong performance, especially as we were wrapping against nine weeks of never-ending possible. This sales growth, combined with the business model improvements at Olive Garden, helped drive a segment profit margin increase of 320 basis points, even while offsetting elevated inflation. LongHorn continued its strong sales growth with an increase of 22% versus pre-COVID. However, inflationary pressures, including double-digits for commodities, were at their highest level in the second quarter, resulting in reduction of segment profit margin by 80 basis points. Sales at our Fine Dining segment increased 22% versus pre-COVID, as this segment continues to see a strong rebound in performance. Segment profit margin grew by 140 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodities inflation. Our other segment grew sales by 7% versus pre-COVID and segment profit margin by 250 basis points. This segment continues to perform well, and we're pleased to see the business model transformation persist. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. We updated our outlook for the full-year to reflect our performance year-to-date and our expected performance for the remainder of the year. We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11% from pre-COVID levels. Same-restaurant sales growth of 29% to 31%, and 35% to 40% new restaurants. Capital spending of approximately $425 million. Total inflation of approximately 5.5%, with commodities inflation between 7% and 8%. Total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%. EBITDA of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion, and the annual effective tax rate of approximately 14%, and approximately 130 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.35 and $7.60. This outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID, similar to our previous outlook of 200 to 250 basis points with flow-through from pricing and higher sales, helping offset elevated inflation. Now we'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Bittner at Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Thank you so much for the question and good morning. And first and foremost, congratulations to both Gene and Rick on the big announcement today. Gene, I know this is not goodbye yet, but I just want to say, it's truly been a pleasure as an analyst to witness what you've done to reshape and better position the Darden enterprise over the last seven years. My question is related to pricing and cost. And it's not surprising that you moved your total cost inflation guidance up a bit given the turbulent environment, but your EBITDA margin guidance at its midpoint is unchanged versus your prior inflation guidance. So you're obviously taking a bit more price, which you talked about in your prepared remarks. Should we interpret these actions as a firm commitment to the EBITDA margin goals that you've been talking about? And are you confident that you have the pricing levers if it's something you need to continue to use in the future to hold the line on these margins? Or is this about as far as you want to go on pricing for the foreseeable future? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Yes. Hi, Brian, this is Raj. I think as you alluded to, we have - we committed to the 200 to 250 at the beginning of the year, and we've shown through the two quarters now that we're adjusting our business model, adjusting our thinking on pricing based on where our business model is coming out. So as we look at our P&L, we continue to look at opportunities to manage costs better. And we are focused on doing some of that before we take pricing. But with that said, we preserved a lot of flexibility, and we have - and we are tapping into some of that. But we do believe we have more dry powder if needed. And I think the way we're thinking about it is really some of these excess sales are going to help offset some of this elevated inflation. The other piece I mentioned in my prepared remarks was that we're really focused on pricing to cover for the structural parts of it, and then trying to kind of weather through the short-term fluctuations. And - but we are committed to the margin growth. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Charles at Cowen. Andrew Charles : First and foremost, echo Brian. Gene, congrats on a story career, not just at Darden, but RARE as well. And Rick, congrats to you as well for a very deserved promotion. I had two questions. The first one is Olive Garden saw steady improvement on a two-year basis in 2Q without really changing the advertising and promotional strategy much. And as you guys mentioned, really focusing on operations. And as we're - at the start here of calendar 2022, how do you think about the competitive environment changes that are likely to occur this year? And how this will impact your marketing promotion plans that thus far, really not changed that much over the last few months? Rick Cardenas : Andrew, this is Rick. First of all, I just want to say how proud I am of the work that Dan and his team has done, keeping with our strategy. We did have trends improved in Q2, and we exceeded industry 2 year comp growth. So thanks for noticing that. I think one of the things that we've been thinking about through marketing spend is we're going to continue to look for equilibrium and react accordingly to whatever happens in the marketplace. Advertising will always be a part of Darden's mix because of the scale advantage they have. And if and when we increase our marketing spend we'd expect it to earn a return compared to where we were if we didn't have any marketing spend. So we're going to continue to see what happens. We don't - we know that there's some advertisers out there with some heavy TRPs. We had $44 million less in media this quarter than we did two years ago. And we feel good about where we were. Andrew Charles : Then Rick, just a follow-up question. The Olive Garden off-premise to 28% was pretty steady from 1Q to 2Q. This had been decelerating in quarters before that as the dine-in business picked up. And I know historically, you'd said longer term Olive Garden off-premise sales would likely settle at 20%, at least. But as the recent experience led you to believe that off-premise mix can perhaps be 25% plus longer term? Rick Cardenas : Andrew, yes, you mentioned our To Go sales at Olive Garden were a little bit higher than they were in Q1. We had a - this is a typically lower volume quarter for us and the To Go sales stayed up there. So that helped our total percentage. To answer your question about what we expect it to be, we do expect it to be higher than our 20% that we said. It is a little bit stickier than we thought. You guys were all right about that, a little stickier than we thought. We're not going to necessarily say, we should expect to be at 25%, but probably above 20%. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Eric Gonzalez at KeyBanc Markets. Eric Gonzalez : Thanks for the question. I'd also like to give my congratulations to Gene and to Rick. My question is it looks like November was a relatively strong month for the industry as the Knapp-Track accelerates to a little over 6%. And can you talk about the sustainability of that trend line? How much of a pull forward of demand is that given the earlier holiday shopping? And maybe which of your brands might have benefited more from that phenomenon? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Eric. Yes, we saw the same increase in November that the industry did. And as I said, Olive Garden was ahead of the industry, and so with LongHorn. What I would say is it's too early to tell if it was a pull forward from shopping. We do know that retail sales were a little bit more online this year than a normal kind of after Thanksgiving, and some of the retailers were closed on Thanksgiving Day. But it's too early to tell about that. We do have a shift, as we've said before, that Thanksgiving shifted back into our second quarter from our third quarter two years ago, and we're seeing that kind of impact this quarter. So still too early to tell, but the holidays do lineup pretty well for us. I will caveat all that by saying weather is the biggest fluctuation in this quarter, and we'll see what happens. If weather hits during a holiday period, then that could be a little bit of a challenge on the comp. Eric Gonzalez : And then just on the seasonality of the business. I think Raj was talking about how EBITDA growth was highest in the second quarter. I'm guessing there's a lot of staffing that needs to happen during the holiday period, just given that the overall number of crew members is higher. So can you talk about what the margin implications are for the third quarter? And how staffing in this environment might impact the margins? Raj Vennam : Yes. Eric, I think when you think about Q3, it's historically has been a strong seasonal quarter, right? From - the volumes are higher. Our margins are really high. I mean if you go back to pre-COVID, I think we were in the 15-plus range for the third quarter when our annual was around 14%. So the point I think we're trying to make here is that, once you start approaching that 17-plus percent, it starts to get harder-and-harder. So that's really what we're trying to talk about is that, there was a lot more opportunity in Q2, because you're able to leverage that low volume period some of the fixed costs better, and it just gets harder-and-harder when you're at the high volume. The staffing is higher. We do staff - we want to staff - over staff, especially during peak periods, during the holidays, so that's part of that. But overall, 17-plus is - starts to get harder. Operator : We'll go next to Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Chris O'Cull: Thanks for taking the question. I'd also like to congratulate Gene and Rick. Gene, it's been a pleasure to follow the success you've had over the past 20 years, covering RARE and Darden. So, congrats. So, Rick, given the promotional level remains low at Olive Garden, was the acceleration in the comps you think due more to an improvement in staffing and capacity utilization quarter-to-quarter? Or have you seen customers really start to respond to some of the ongoing quality improvements the company has made there? Hello? [technical difficulty] Operator : Standby. Just one moment, Chris. And you, Rick join. Rick Cardenas : Sorry about that, guys. Sorry. Chris thanks a lot for the question. This is Rick. As a reminder, the second quarter is our lowest seasonal quarter. We did run NAPB two years ago. So, we're really proud of the fact that we comped over two years ago without never any possible running. And this was really aided by the point you made up in staffing, aided by productivity enhancements we made during the quarter, and the fact that our two - new team members were moving up the learning curve more quickly and becoming more productive. And there could be something about vaccination rates being above Q1 levels, so maybe people are more comfortable dining out. And the fact that we have, as you mentioned, made these investments in our core items. They are : we've made great investments in the items that people really want. The value ratings are great, and we're just executing at a high level. Chris O'Cull: That's helpful. And then just one other question related to commodity inflation. I don't know if this is for Rick or Raj, but I'm wondering if you have any insights into how processors, packers, distributors are going to pass through the inflation that they're experiencing. And what I'm trying to understand is how much commodity inflation could be permanent versus temporary? And whether you believe restaurants can get back to that kind of pre-COVID cost of sales if commodity prices were at comparable levels to that period? Gene Lee : Chris, it's Gene. Let me just jump in here. And I think about this, the commodity infrastructure pre-COVID was able to feed the world without a lot of inflation. And that's what the world getting richer. And so, I believe that the commodity infrastructure will get back to an equilibrium where we'll be able to produce the food needed to feed everyone. And I don't think there'll be a lot of inflation in that. I think where the inflation is going to come in, in commodities is going to be whatever labor impact there is to grow and deliver that food. And so, I think we still have 12 to 18 months to - for that to all work its way out. But there was something happening over the last decade where we weren't seeing a tremendous amount of inflation in food. And I think it had to do with technology and other aspects. And I think that all that global capabilities are still there. And so, I'd just end by saying what we don't know is - what - how much labor is involved in each product to grow and deliver and harvest, and so on and so forth? And what are the impacts the labor is going to have on the commodities. And so, I think we're in a wait and see - I don't know - I mean I think the end of your question was, we're going to get COGS back to historical levels. Yes, I think over time, it will take time, but I think these models will all drift back to the same what I would call prime cost model, we add labor and COGS. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Well, good morning and hats-off, Gene, and congrats, Rick as well. Gene or Rick, first, just on - can you talk about the wage increases. I guess broadly, when I see a number like $12 an hour, when you compare it to other retailers or even some others and other segments in retail of restaurants, it still seems low, I know you're top quartile payer in your industry. Do you think the casual dining industry in general, though, is maybe underpaying relative to others in retail, and there's the need just to continue to advance that? And maybe if you could just unpack the 12 - the hybrid number it includes gratuities. So maybe what is the back of the house starting wages, for example, just so we can maybe better benchmark without including the gratuities which we don't really have exactly a handle on. Gene Lee : Yeah. John, I think where I'd start was, we basically said, we expect our average to be approximately $20 after this goes into effect. Now very few people in our company make minimum wage. This is what I would call an entry-level wage, and more rural America. And so - in the major cities, you're not hiring anybody for $12 an hour today. This is an increase in the guarantee to our workforce, will probably have more impact on Cheddar's than any of our other brands. And so starting wages or wage rates very, very, very much depending on geography and overall demand. We have people that - in our environment that make $25 to $28 an hour in the back of the house. And in some parts of the country, you're doing that same job for $18 an hour depending on the environment. And so I don't believe - in your macro question around this casual dining paying too little, I don't think that's true. I think casual dining is paying the appropriate rates in the marketplace based on supply and demand. And I think that - I think our teams are doing a very, very good job of looking at the overall situation and ensuring that we're paying probably a little bit more of the competitive wage in each market to ensure that our restaurants are fully staffed. And we're encouraged by Rick's comments that our restaurants today are better staff than they were last quarter and they're better staff in the quarter before. And we still have strong, strong retention rates. And I think that the way we think about it - I'll leave you with this, the way we think about it is that there may not be enough service workers to staff every restaurant in America, but there's enough service workers out there to staff Darden's restaurants, and that's what we're focused on. John Glass : That's great to hear. One follow-up, Rick, I think you mentioned putting on pause some initiatives to focus on operations right now. What are some examples of those initiatives that you've put on pause? Are they sales-driving initiatives that we could think about coming back over time? Are they more marginally - I don't know what they are, but what maybe is some examples of those? And when do you think they come back? Rick Cardenas : I think about a couple of things that are not directly related to training and staffing. So those initiatives, we're still working on making sure that we've got our restaurants staffed and we've got our restaurants staffed and we've got our people trained. But things like new product development, that for years, we've done a lot of new development, but we're focusing on just developing one or two products a year that are really great. And so we thought it was right for us to not go ahead and do that during this time when we can keep managers focused entirely on staffing their restaurant, making sure they train their people. So that's an example. We're still doing a lot of things here in the support center that are getting ready to gear up, a lot on the technology front, but that was one example. Operator : We'll take our next question from Peter Saleh at BTIG. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you and good morning and congrats to both Gene and Rick. A couple of questions on my end. I think you guys mentioned longer lead times to open units, really getting some of the equipment in there. Can you give us a little bit more color on that? Are we talking weeks or months? And do you see any end to that? Is that something that you think persists for a while? Or is that kind of more short-term in nature? Rick Cardenas : Yes, this is Rick. We're talking weeks, not months, a couple of weeks here or there. We may have a restaurant or two that might go a little bit longer than that, but on average, we're a few weeks. And we are starting to order a lot of these long lead time items a lot sooner, and actually holding them in inventory, which not driving our inventory costs up, but making sure that we have the kitchen equipment to open the restaurant when the restaurant is ready to open. So not very long. Peter Saleh : And then just lastly on my end. Is there any other technology or any other processes that you guys are implementing or looking at maybe kitchen equipment or other that could help reduce some of the labor hours necessarily in the restaurant? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Peter. We've always focused on our technology in three places, and I'll talk about the two big ones, guest-facing and restaurant technology. So if you think about what we're doing on the restaurant side. We are doing a lot of things to help improve productivity, simplifying processes for managers so that they don't have to hunt and pack and do other things so that they can spend their time training their people. But we don't foresee bringing in technology that will reduce the number of people that we need to do the job. We are a full-service restaurant company, and we're going to maintain that to provide the service that our guests expect. We will bring technology into help that, but not to necessarily replace. Gene Lee : Peter, one of the things that I think that's most interesting is machine learning for forecasting, forecasts forecasting our business is - forecasting our restaurant business is one of the most important things that we do every single day. And we think there's some real upside in the machine learning around that, and our team has developed some pretty slick stuff. And I'm fairly excited about that potential. That turns into productivity. If you can predict your business correctly, then you can really increase your productivity at the store level. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Carroll at RBC Capital Markets. Chris Carroll : Thanks and good morning. And I also want to echo my congratulations to both Gene and Rick on the announcement today. So just following up on pricing. Clearly, a still challenging cost environment, but curious to hear how you're thinking, how you expect today's pricing levels to be received by guests. And how does that pricing flow through the different brands? Are you expecting to take relatively more pricing at your higher-end brands, while keeping pricing closer to historical levels for the others? Gene Lee : Yes. Hey, Chris, yes, let me start with the latter question, first. Yes, we do. So when you look at our overall pricing, I'd say you almost you can assume that Olive Garden and Cheddar's are going to be below the Darden level of pricing and all other brands are going to be higher. Obviously, the spectrum being the fine dining will probably have the highest pricing. As far as the guest reactions, obviously, we track this over time. One of the things we noticed - one of the key factors is how much do you price relative to CPI. And I think as we look at how we have been pricing we've been pricing a lot below that. That helps - that gives us a lot more comfort in the fact that the elasticity - we're not hitting that portion of that curve that's actually more elastic. So at this point, the level of pricing we have is significantly below CPI, which means it's fairly inelastic impact. Chris Carroll : And just as a follow-up, at the risk of asking this question too early, but can you provide us with any sense on whether you're seeing any shift in guest behavior in recent weeks in response to just latest COVID concerns perhaps any observations on a regional basis that would suggest there is or is not any change in demand levels today? That would be helpful. Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes. I would - that's a pretty simple answer, no. We haven't seen any change in behaviors in the regional. It's real early in this - what seems to be this next wave. I mean I think if you study the New York Times map, you could see this surge heading towards New England for a few weeks now. And so that's been a part of the country that's been most sensitive into, maybe what I would call, overreacting. So - but we'll see. I mean we - as of today, we haven't seen any big change I would just say that there's significant COVID fatigue out there, and it's going to take a lot to modify a certain percentage of the population's behavior. There's a certain percentage of the population that is going to react to this, but there's a certain set of it that's just going to continue on. All you got to do is look at stadiums and concert halls to see who those people are. Operator : We'll go next to Brett Levy at MKM. Brett Levy : Great. Thank you. And best of luck to everyone in their next endeavors. So thanks, Rick. Thanks, Gene. When you think about the guidance items that you provided, and obviously, you've unpacked a lot with the commodity and the inflationary talk on labor. Where do you still see the greatest opportunities beyond the sales line to improve your fundamentals at the unit level? And when you think about your CapEx, you obviously raised it to the high end. Can you walk us through how you're thinking about where that comes from, and just your capital thoughts for the year? Thanks. Gene Lee : Yes. Brett, it's Gene. I'll start with the fundamentals. I think the fundamentals for us right now is how do we bring along the most - the population of new employees - the percentage of the population of new employees, how do we bring them along. And as Rick said earlier, make them as productive as possible we can and bring our brands to life the way we wanted to do so. And as we head into the busiest part of the year, we're just laser focused on trying to keep things simple and ensure that we can execute at a high level. We know that our competitors are having similar - the same problems that we have, and our goal is to out-execute them and win guest loyalty through this very difficult period of time. And so I think that's really where our advantage is right now. We're better staffed. We've got - we're doing great training, and we're really confident that we're executing at a high level, and that's what our - that's what our research is telling us. Raj, you want to take the CapEx? Raj Vennam : Yes. Look, clearly, in this environment with inflation, there are construction costs on the CapEx that are going up a little bit. But overall, CapEx levels given - while they are higher related - what we said was the high end of the guidance we had provided earlier, the efficiency of this capital spend is still very high. We're actually still - especially with the improvements we made at the unit level, the returns are really strong. So even with the elevated CapEx, we're getting stronger returns than we did before COVID. Brett Levy : If I could just follow-up on labor with one quick question. Where do you see yourselves right now in terms of where you want to be at staffing levels? And how that compares to pre-COVID staffing level? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Brett, this is Rick. I'll start with the second part. We're at about 95% of pre-COVID staffing levels, where in the end of the first quarter, we were at 90%. So we continue to increase that percentage. But I will say that, we don't - because of the productivity enhancements that we've made over the years in these brands, it means we don't need as many people as before. So a majority of our restaurants are well staffed. The exclusions that we've seen are still the most complicating factor. As exclusions for COVID, they still - the most complicating factors, especially on the weekends when we're busy. So we feel good about our staffing levels. We just want to keep trying to make sure that we get people that can work and not be excluded and continue to hire people every week and train them. Operator : We'll go next to David Palmer at Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Congratulations, Gene and Rick. The on-premise traffic in the US full service segment, it's down in the high 20s versus pre-COVID levels. And that's a pretty striking number. Perhaps you can comment on why you think that is? What are the biggest reasons for this at this point? Is it covered comfort levels diminished capacity out there or something else? And then focusing on Darden, how much is on-premise traffic down across your major brands versus pre-COVID levels? And I'm curious, are you really not assuming an on-premise traffic recovery in the second half of your fiscal 2023 guidance? Thank you. Raj Vennam : David, let me just answer the first - the part about the on-premise traffic, and then I'll let Rick or Gene jump in on the other aspects of it. We are not seeing the level of decline you're talking about. We're not 20% down on on-premise. We are - when you look at on-premise overall across the system, we're probably in the single digits of decline. So that's - so I think that's different from what you're referring to the industry is, but we are - yeah, and LongHorn, actually on-premise is higher than pre-COVID. And so - and the overall Darden in the single-digits decline, but not double digits like you're alluding to. Rick Cardenas : Yes. And I'll take the - I'll take the other part of that. As we've been making investments in our off-premise experience, making it easier for our guests to order pick up and pay, we still see people coming back more often and more often on the off-premise side. That's why we think the off-premise is going to stay at a little bit more elevated level, which could become very convenient, so maybe people won't come in as often. But we believe that in the long run, we'll get back to our pre-COVID levels of on-premise experiences as we continue to invest in our food as we continue to increase our staffing levels, as people become more confident and comfortable going out to eat. We believe that in the long run, we will get back to our in-restaurant experience. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much and congratulations, Gene and Rick. Rick, you have some big shoes to fill. I had one follow-up on the last question, and then another. The follow-up is just related to what you just mentioned about expectation to get in-restaurant dining back to full strength at a certain point. I just want to then couple that with Olive Garden and LongHorn's performance in the earlier stores that have returned to full in-store dining. Just wondering what the range of averages of that To Go businesses, I know you mentioned it's 28% and 15%. Just trying to get a sense of the range around that because it would seem like fantastic win if you could get the on-premise back to 100% and still hold on to what you suggested might be north of 20% at Olive Garden in terms of To Go. So any color you could add in terms of how much of that you think is incremental would be great. Gene Lee : Yes. Jeff, it's Gene. As Rick alluded to earlier and stated that we believe that this off-premise is stickier than what we originally thought. And Rick gave you guys credit, you guys were right. We were wrong on that. We don't get to say that often. But it seems as though that the technology that we've created and the friction we've taken out that experience and our ability to deliver a quality experience has made this a lot stickier. And we don't know - we can keep wanting to going back to equilibrium. We haven't got to equilibrium. We're not close to equilibrium yet. So we don't know what the long-term run rate is going to be off-prem and on-prem. I mean, I would say that when we look at on-prem, there's still some regional differences based on how people think about COVID. I think when I look at on-prem, I think staffing continues to be an issue. It's getting better and better. I also think that throughput - when we look at our sales, during the week, we're a lot stronger on a comparable basis, Monday through Thursday than we are on the weekend. And we think some of that has to do with one staffing to the productivity of the people working in the restaurants, and that we believe that as they become more proficient and develop more repetitions over time that we'll actually have some more throughput through - on the weekend, where we know we have excess demand right now. We have a lot of restaurants in our system that are doing more guests in the restaurant today on-prem than they were pre-COVID. We still have pockets where we're struggling a little bit. And so I think that that's the real opportunity. As I look at the opportunities as we move forward, we've got - in full service done, we've got 11 - or overall dine-in, we got 11% less restaurants to service what we believe is going to be aggregate demand that's going to end up being as strong or greater than pre-COVID. And if we do what we've been doing all the way through this, investing in our product, investing in our people, we're going to capture our market share. Jeffrey Bernstein : And then my follow-up just related to the comments you made about labor. It does seem like the industry is improving of late. Just wondering your thoughts on to what we should attribute that. And you had mentioned that staffing is still a big challenge for you. It seems like it's pretty much back I think you said you're now back to 95% of staffing and you don't need to get back to 100%. So I'm just wondering where is it that you have the greatest challenge from a staffing perspective, if you're that close to that full 100%, you really don't need to get back to that full 100%. Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes, Jeff, I think we - obviously, we probably struggle most in our lower-end brands where your check average isn't as high, and your business models don't afford you some of the luxuries that our other business models afford from a pay structure standpoint and you got the - basically the lower check average yield you a lower tip in aggregate. So those businesses struggle a little bit more. They also tend to be high-volume businesses, so you're running through a lot more guests through those businesses. And so, I think that, I think there's been a couple of things contributing to improved labor in the restaurant industry, obviously, getting away from the subsidies and unemployment I think people getting more confidence that they can enter back into the workforce. I think that childcare probably still the biggest barrier today for people getting back into the workforce. But I think things are better than they were 90 days ago and they were a lot in they were 180 days ago. Operator : We'll go next to Lauren Silberman at Credit Suisse. Lauren Silberman : I also wanted to ask about the wage investments. As you look across the portfolio, are you seeing greater challenges in your ability to recruit or retain employees and any differences geographically? And then how do you assess the risk that you'll need to make another big wage commitment next year? Rick Cardenas : Lauren, this is Rick. We aren't really seeing a whole lot of differences across the country on staffing, not any more challenging in Texas as it is in New York. We're staffing our restaurants, and we're seeing the pickup. We've actually implemented a new system. As we mentioned, it's increasing our speed of hire. The one thing we've got an incredible employment proposition. When we make an offer, people accept it, and that's a great thing. And so, I think that to me, is the biggest nature. Our employment proposition is so strong that people want to come to work for us. As it relates to future need to increase our minimum kind of guaranteed wage. Right now, we're looking at - the number that we have right now at $12 is the right thing for us. As we said, and Gene mentioned, we average over $20 - around $20 an hour after this change, and we'll continue to monitor that and see where we need to increase wages on a market-by-market basis. Lauren Silberman : Great. And just a follow-up on price covering most of what you view as structural and absorbing the short-term fluctuation. Can you expand on what you view as transitory? Is it primarily just the commodity piece or anything related to labor? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : No. We view labor as actually more sticky. So, it really focuses on the commodities, is where we see some of the transitory, especially on the proteins front where you already see some of that coming back, right? You saw beef prices pick up, especially middle states, and they're coming - you're starting to come - you see them come down. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger, UBS. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Gene and Rick, a big congratulations to you both. Just first question, I wanted to ask another on labor. Curious if you could speak to where labor efficiency or productivity was in the quarter? And then just regarding the pull forward of the minimum wage increase announcement, how much of that of the wage inflation target for the year that you noted is related to that pull forward? Rick Cardenas : Yes. Let me start with the second part of the question on the $12 wage. That really isn't costing us very much in the grand scheme of things. It's a very small portion of the wage inflation that we're seeing in the back half of the year. And so, I'll leave it at that. On the productivity side, we're more productive than we were - when we were two years ago. We're about as productive as we were in the first quarter versus two years ago. But I will say, remember, our second quarter is the lowest sales quarter. So productivity is a little bit more difficult to do than in Q1 and Q3. Dennis Geiger : Appreciate that, Rick. And then just one more question, just on the consumer and recognizing some of the pandemic impacts here could make this question typical. But, sort of, what are you seeing right now across consumer demand behaviors overall consumer health, and then how you think about the consumer going into 2022. Is there anything on the lower income consumer yet that's starting to concern you? Just broader thoughts and perspective there would be great. Thank you. Gene Lee : Yes. The consumer has never been healthier, right? I mean, you look at all the statistics out there, when you look at the personal balance sheets and where the consumer is at, I think they're learning. I think they\u2019re learning how to manage through the inflation. And I would expect - and as we transition to calendar 2022, I would expect the consumer behavior to continue to be strong. It's just that, there's a lot of talk about inflation. And inflation has been a horrible thing to the lower-end consumer. But when you really think about - if you look at the share of wallet when you think about gasoline, it's still historically low, even at current prices. And so I think people are making choices. I do believe that we're still transitioning this experiential economy, and I think people want experiences after 18 months of not having experiences. And I think going out to eat is an experience that people want to have more regularly than they've had over the past two years. And so, I feel really good about where the consumer is. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Andy Barish : Gene, I\u2019m just happy, it\u2019s showing in Colorado, finally. Quick question on - can you give us a little bit of a of Cheddar's, kind of, review in terms of the progress that's made here during the pandemic. And from a people side of things, which I think has been the biggest challenge, are you building bench strength to start to see a noticeable ramp in the unit growth in fiscal 2023 for that brand? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Andy, this is Rick. We're really proud of the work Chedder has done on the people front. Let me give you a couple of statistics without getting into too much detail on our P&L. They've added - they're back close to where LongHorn and Olive Garden is on the percent of their general managers that have been general managers for a year or more, where they were way far away from that a couple of years ago. Their management turnover continues to improve. I believe the last 45 restaurant general managers are managing partners that they added were all promotion within. You couldn't say that a couple of years ago. We've got a strong, strong pipeline that we're building of managers. And we do expect to have more openings in fiscal 2023 at Cheddar's than we did in - I'm sorry, in - yeah, in fiscal 2023 at Cheddar's than we had in fiscal 2022. So we're really excited where they are, partly because of the business model improvements they've made, which we don't highlight, because they're in the other segment, but they've had a significant improvement in their business model, which gives us even more confidence that they can grow with this pipeline that they're building in people. Operator : Our next question comes from James Rutherford at Stephens. James Rutherford : Thanks for the questions. Rick, marketing is still one of the biggest sources of margin expansion within your business. What main factors will you consider as you work to determine when it's time to start adding some marketing dollars back into the business incrementally? Rick Cardenas : Yes, James, thanks for the question. As we mentioned in an earlier question, Olive Garden will always be a marketer because of their scale. The advantage that they have in their size, gives them the ability to spend money in marketing. And we'll continue to look at the time when equilibrium comes. We still have a lot of demand to come into our restaurants today. We have reduced our marketing spend overall. And as I said, as we increase - whenever we make that decision, I don't want to tell you when we would do that based on strategic implications. But whenever we would make that decision, we would ensure that that marketing is profitable, whether it's - when we compare to what we would do if we didn't have that marketing. So we have had a couple of hundred basis points of improvement in marketing spend. I would tell you that even if we increase our marketing dollars, we will still have some margin improvement or margin maintained with marketing. So don't assume that when we bring marketing back, it's going to basically reduce our margins by the amount that we bring it back. James Rutherford : My second question is on LongHorn, which has clearly benefited from strong execution, as well as general robust consumer appetite for stake as a category, what do you think it will take to retain these high sales levels if and when the consumer potentially begins to shift back to more of a value-focused mindset? Rick Cardenas : Yes. Thanks for asking about LongHorn. Todd and his team have been on a journey for years. And that journey has been to invest in food quality. As we've mentioned before, we've improved all of our stakes. We've increased the size of our stakes. We've increased our portion sizes of our sides, and we've improved our execution of all of that food. And so yes, the state category has been helped by consumer demand, but we believe that we will continue to execute at this level and continue to grow LongHorn. I can't tell you what our comp will be in the future, but we're proud of what they've done over the years to continue to invest and make sure that they have the best product. They're number one in quality and casual dining, and they continue to do those things. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Mullan at Deutsche Bank. Brian Mullan : Thank you. I'd just like to echo all the congrats to both Gene and Rick. Just question on fine dining, specifically related to development. I know it's a smaller piece of the puzzle. But Gene, can you just talk about how you see development in this segment over the next, say, three to five years? Is there a lot more room across the country for your brands? And if you could discuss any structural changes in that segment or learning throughout pandemic might have that change your answer from what you would have said two years ago, if at all? Gene Lee : Yes. Two parts to that answer. Number one, we think that we can push Capital Grille in suburban areas a little bit further than what maybe we have thought in the past. We've had some recent openings that give us confidence that there are additional trade areas, in which we can compete with that brand and get a great return on our investment. And then secondarily, the real opportunity is, can we take [Eddie V's] and get it to mirror Capital Grille and get to the same size company. We are thrilled with our - what we refer to as our COVID Eddie V's for the Eddie V's that we've opened during COVID. They've all gone to the market very well, and accepted very well. Our business model is really strong and getting stronger. And there's no reason why we can't get that from the high 20s into the low 60s and do that very profitably. Now again, that's a three to 40 a year. You've got to wait for the right sites, but we're just - we're thrilled. And for those who - anybody that travels to Nashville, please go visit our new Nashville Eddie V's. It's just a spectacular, spectacular venue and doing extremely well. So we're confident that Fine Dining will still continue to be a big contributor to what we're doing. And the margin structure - we just have a lot more flexibility in that business to deal with some of this inflation that we don't have in our casual brands. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Tarantino with Baird. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning, everyone and wow Gene, what a terrific career, congrats on your decision to retire. And Rick, my congrats on your promotion. Rick, I had a question about sort of a big picture view of the long-term strategy at Darden. And I just wanted to ask with the upcoming transition to you as CEO, certainly, not much needs to change, but just wondering your thoughts on what maybe some new strategic priorities or new priorities for you as you take over the CEO role. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : David, thanks for the question. I just want to first say that I've been with Gene for his seven years as the CEO, partnering on developing our strategy. And I really think the strategy that we have is the right strategy. We've got our four competitive advantages. We're going to continue to invest in those advantages to make them stronger. We're a platform company that helps our brands succeed and driving back to basic operating philosophy. We are going to continue to improve our operations execution and continue to invest in our competitive advantages. I don't see a big change in our strategic priorities, partly because that was a big part of writing them. So it would be a little weird if I did change those. But we'll look and see as we go through our five-year plan process, which we just did last year. So there's not a whole lot for us to talk about right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital. Andrew Strelzik : Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to first just clarify on the commodity commentary. I think you said that inflation would peak in 3Q when you called out the inflation comparison in 4Q from the year ago as part of the reason why that would ease this year. So - but you also mentioned that some of the underlying commodity prices have eased as well. So does the outlook reflect that underlying kind of easing? Or is there a timing dynamic where that's not included in that? And then my question is really on unit growth, and just at this point, the visibility to hitting the high-end of the framework that you've talked about in 2023. I know you talked about some construction cost increases and delays, which doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but just wanted to see about the visibility and anything that you can comment on the brand mix would be great. Thank you very much. Raj Vennam : Hi, Andrew, this is Raj. So on the commodities front, yes, we did see - the way we think about it is we're looking at what we have covered. And then based on our best estimate of where the costs are going to be, right? When you look at the cadence of some of the Q2 was around 9% commodity inflation. We expect Q3 to be a little bit north of 10%. And then I think by the time we get to Q4, because we're wrapping on elevated number two years ago or a year ago, that it's not going to be at size. So the way we are looking at it is really on a two-year basis, what does it look like? And I think if you're looking at it on a two-year basis, we're hovering around 10% to 11%, and that's where we expect Q4 to be - to land as well. And so that's why there's a big difference between Q3 and Q4. I mean, I guess at this point, on the unit growth front, we feel pretty - we still feel confident that we have a good shot at getting to the high end. There may be a few slips here and there, but we still think that 55% to 60% is a good number to think of. Obviously, a few - four or five could get pushed out. But at this point, we're still targeting that higher end. Operator : We'll go next to Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Jared Garber : Thanks and certainly, I would like to also echo my congratulations to Gene and Rick. Exciting to watch you both progressing your careers. I had two questions. One on the top-line in Olive Garden and one on cost. You noted that you're lapping over the near ending possible from two years ago. Can you help frame maybe what some of the headwinds were in that business? Obviously, the Olive Garden trends seem like they're pretty strong. But just any color on maybe what you were lapping and the headwinds that you saw related to that that would have essentially pushed that to your comp a little bit higher? And then on costs, Raj, I appreciate all the color on the commodity front. If I look at your deck, it looks like on beef, you're very, very low contracting at this point, about 25% versus the normal 80%, 80%-plus. I just wanted to get a sense of exactly how you're thinking about beef purchases and maybe some of the risks that beef prices move higher. Rick Cardenas : Hi, Jared, it's Rick. I'll comment on the other headwinds at Olive Garden, if it's never any possible with providing not much of a comment. We don't want to talk about the impact that never any possible had. We know it was a negative impact over the years, but the profitability wasn't as high as the guests that we're doing today. And so we decided to reduce the dependency on ever any possible this year because we didn't need to drive volume into our restaurants. As we think about why we had a better performance, even lapping the earning possible, as I said, it was productivity. We just got better at serving the gas when they came in the restaurant. Our To-Go business stayed strong, which is a very productive business for us. But as we look forward, we don't know if we'll bring and when we'll bring that possible never-any back because we have a never-ending abundance every day with our never-any first course. Gene Lee : Yes. Hi, Jared, on the coverage on beef, I think, really, the way we're thinking about it is, at this point, the forward premium is too much. And there's really - this is really purposeful. We feel like there's opportunity to be more short and not be long given where the levels are. To the extent there is risk, I mean, I think what we've shown - I think we've demonstrated over the last two quarters that if inflation ends up being higher, we'll be - our teams are agile will react, we'll adjust accordingly. But we have a pretty good line of sight into what we think the costs are going to be, and that's where we're sitting here, but could this change. Yes, but we'll adjust, and we'll still get to the commitments we made. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe at JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Thank you very much. Since the transformative rare acquisition, that's obviously brought in Gene, the business has made a number of acquisitions with Cheddar's, Yard House, AUVs. And I did want to get a sense of maybe this is where there could be a little bit of a difference in the CEO change. In terms of appetite or potentially even need for future acquisitions, and I ask this, obviously, in the context, the organizational ability, which I'm sure you have about the organization's desire, especially as there's probably a number of businesses that are out there that you could acquire with probably not adding much G&A, if at all, based on what your scale is. But I just want to get your sense in terms of what you see in the current market, and as we kind of think about the Darden business over the next 24 months or so, if we could potentially see something else? Rick Cardenas : John, this is Rick. I'll just start by saying, I've been involved with some of these acquisitions, but our management team and Board regularly evaluate all of our alternatives. How do we allocate capital, how do we manage our business to achieve our long-term goals? And M&A is part of that. And we'll continue to act the same way we have over the last 10 years or 15 years since we bought rare. Gene Lee : Yes. And John, I'll just jump in and just say that, we are thrilled with our current portfolio today with the business model enhancements that we've made to these businesses. We do not need to do something to achieve our long-term framework. And we believe that, we'll - I believe, I won't - probably I won't be driving it, but I believe that we'll continue to be opportunistic if the timing is right. But at the end of the day, we love our portfolio of brands today, of market share as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro of Raymond James. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks and good morning. Just two quick ones, I had two quick clarifications as most of might have been asked. But on menu pricing, are you currently at around 4% today? Or are you working towards that level? And where do you expect pricing to be as we move through Q3 into Q4 for your fiscal year? Raj Vennam : Hi. Brian, we are not at that level. The level we're - I would say, we exited the quarter around 3-ish. And for the Q3, we expect to be in the mid-threes, and Q4 would be a little bit, north of - in the low-fourths. Brian Vaccaro : All right. That's helpful. And then, the Thanksgiving shift, I just wanted to confirm that, that was about 100 bps headwind to the comps versus 2019, and that should reverse in the fiscal third quarter. Is that right? Raj Vennam : Yes. But I would caution that Q3, again, is a high-volume quarter, so just be careful how you read into that. But yeah, it was a headwind in Q2. And it should help in Q3. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joshua Long of Piper Sandler. Joshua Long : Thank you for taking the questions, squeezing me in and again, echoing congratulations to everyone on their next chapters. Gene, following on some of the comments you made about the kind of COVID fatigue and the experiential nature that we're seeing in terms of consumer dining choices. Curious if you might be able to provide some context around your high-end brands, especially as we head into year-end, around some sort of return to a more normalized celebratory occasion. I imagine that's more on the social high-end dining and some of your high-end brands. But curious if you're seeing any sort of business customer return or kind of what your thoughts are or what the teams thought kind of the equilibrium there overtime would be on the high end? Gene Lee : Yes. I think we're still experiencing the business travel at the level of pre-COVID. But we are - as you've seen from our results, we're experiencing some fairly really strong sales, I would just say - I would tell you that our holiday bookings are very strong. The demand for private dining is very strong. I would say it's smaller groups than larger groups. But overall, the demand for Fine Dining experiences, holiday celebrations is strong. And I would expect it to be strong throughout. And so, I think that business is going to be a very interesting business. As business travel returns, I think that a lot of people have really enjoyed the experiential part of Fine Dining, and it's something that we're not going to give up easily as we move forward. So, I love the business. I think we've really positioned those well, and I think they'll continue to do well. Operator : With no other questions holding, Mr. Kalicak, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing comments. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you. That concludes today's call. I'd like to remind you that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday, March 24, before the market opens, with the conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call, and happy holidays. Operator : That will conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing third quarter performance is a comparison to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic's impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We plan to release fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, June 23, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks, Rick will give an update on our operating performance, Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2022 financial outlook, and then Gene will have some closing comments. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. Gene Lee : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter was one of stark contrast, and I'm pleased with our performance in this highly volatile environment. Our team did a great job controlling what they could control. In fiscal December, we achieved record sales while meeting our internal profit expectations that were contemplated in the guidance we provided in December. However, in fiscal January, which is a high-volume period for us, the Omicron variant significantly impacted consumer demand, restaurant staffing and operating expenses. We also experienced substantial weather impacts, all of which resulted in significantly lower sales and earnings than our internal expectations. Finally, as COVID cases declined and the operating environment normalized, sales improved throughout fiscal February, and we had strong results that exceeded our internal expectations. Sales strength has continued into March. Quarter-to-date, our average weekly sales are slightly ahead of our February actuals, and these trends are incorporated in our guidance. When we talked last in December, we could not have predicted the impacts Omicron would have on our business. In fact, the dramatic spike in cases create the most difficult operating environment since the initial onset of COVID two years ago. Rick will provide more details on the impact it had on our staffing levels in a moment. Omicron also created additional pressure on expenses at the restaurant level as we saw higher levels of sick pay and we incurred significant overtime costs due to staffing shortages caused by exclusions. The January spike also caused further supply chain disruptions, and we now expect inflation to be higher in Q4 than when we talked in December. We have implemented pricing actions to mitigate the impacts of rising costs, and Raj will provide more detail in his remarks. We recognize that all of us in the industry faced additional risk due to the current geopolitical environment such as higher inflation and further supply chain disruptions. However, I'm confident that Darden can compete effectively in any operating environment. We have a strong balance sheet and the right strategy in place, driven by our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture. And our brands are relentlessly focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service, and atmosphere. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thanks Gene and good morning, everyone. Our restaurant teams are focused on executing at the highest level in creating exceptional experiences for every one of our guests. That's why we are committed to doing what it takes to have the people we need and the products our guests expect when they choose to dine with us. From a people perspective, we are seeing positive momentum in applicant numbers, and we feel much better about where we are now in terms of overall staffing. Our focus will continue to be on hiring and more importantly, training our new team members to reach the productivity level required to enable us to operate at optimum staffing levels. Our biggest staffing challenge during the quarter was managing the impacts of team member and manager exclusions due to Omicron. To provide some context, at the peak, team member exclusions in January were three times higher than the monthly peak we experienced with Delta. While we did get some help as the CDC guidelines for exclusion were reduced from 10 to five days, 8% of our total workforce was excluded at some point during January. To put a finer point on this, in the month of January, we had over 13,000 team members excluded for a total of more than 65,000 exclusion days. I am really proud of how our teams managed through the impacts of Omicron. As it moved across the country, we had some restaurants that were down as much as 40% of their staff and others that needed to limit their hours were temporarily moved to takeout only in order to operate effectively. As Omicron began to fade, our teams kept the same level of focus on staffing and training to provide a great guest experience, which resulted in record sales for fiscal February. Valentine's Day was strong across all our brands, and that is a testament to the excellent job our operators are doing to ensure their restaurants are staffed and ready to serve our guests. In fact, on Valentine's Day, Olive Garden served more than 1 million guests with approximately 35% of sales off-premise. On the product side, our supply chain team is working hard leveraging our scale to ensure our restaurants have the products they need to serve our guests. Our inventory levels remained strong and some of the logistical challenges we had been dealing with began to improve in December. However, Omicron impacted staffing for our supply chain partners in January as well. For labor intensive food production, this resulted in reduced supply and increased cost at a time when protein prices typically shift down from the heavy holiday buying season. Our distribution partners also experienced warehouse staffing challenges and driver shortages. Thus, we had expedited shipping costs and utilized more spot rate haulers in the quarter. Between those impacts and dealing with back-to-back winter storms, our team did an admirable job of maintaining supply continuity for our restaurants. Together, all of these factors increased our expected annual inflation, and Raj will provide more color on that in a moment. To Go sales remained strong during the quarter as our brand and our guests continue to benefit from the strength of our digital platform. Off-premise sales accounted for 30% of total sales at Olive Garden and 16% of total sales at Longhorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 63% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 12% of Darden's total sales. Before I turn it over to Raj, I want to thank all of our team members who have shown tremendous resiliency and dedication in the face of constant change. Two years ago, we closed our dining room and did not know when we would be able to reopen them. Since then, we have dealt with multiple COVID waves, and our teams continue to demonstrate incredible flexibility and perseverance while creating exceptional guest experiences. Today, we are hopeful that we are near the end of the COVID-19 as a pandemic and that we will be able to live with like we do with other viruses. As I visit our restaurants and talk with our team members, they say each day feels a little more normal, and they are invigorated by the energy that has returned to our dining room. Our team members are the best in the business. I'm inspired by their winning spirit and confident that Darden's best days are ahead of us. Now I'll turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results for the quarter, I want to expand on Gene and Rick's comments regarding the impact of Omicron and winter weather on our third quarter results. When looking at the fiscal months, actual sales for December and February were close to our internal expectations that were contemplated in the financial outlook we provided in December. And we met our profitability expectations in December and exceeded them in February. In fiscal January, however, we were significantly below our sales and profitability expectations as COVID cases surged, causing increased staffing shortages and reduced demand. We also experienced more severe winter weather than historical averages. As a result, sales were negatively impacted by over $100 million. This sales slowdown coupled with additional expenses related to sick pay, overtime and increased inflation, negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.30 and was more than 100 basis points drag on EBITDA margins for this quarter. Now turning to the detailed results for the quarter. Total sales for third quarter were $2.4 billion, 41% higher than last year, driven by 38% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 33 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.93. Total EBITDA was $395 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 16.1%, 50 basis points better than pre-COVID. We continue to return significant cash to shareholders, paying $141 million in dividends and repurchasing $382 million in shares for a total of over $520 million cash returned to investors in the quarter. We ended the quarter with $555 million of cash on the balance sheet. We continue to see increasing cost pressure with inflation -- with total inflation of 7% this quarter, which was higher than our previous expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, we began taking additional pricing in the third quarter and have also implemented additional actions to further preserve the strength of our business model while balancing the impact to our guests. For the third quarter, total pricing was 3.7% and for the fourth quarter, we expect our pricing to be approximately 6% compared to last year. As a result, we now expect pricing to be just over 3% for the full fiscal year. This is well below our updated total inflation expectations of 6% for the year as we continue to execute our strategy of pricing below overall inflation to strengthen our value leadership position. Turning to our P&L and segment performance for the third quarter. We are comparing against pre-COVID results in the third quarter of 2020, which we believe are more comparable to normal business operations and with how we've been framing our margin expansion opportunity. For the third quarter, food and beverage expenses were 270 basis points higher, driven by elevated commodities inflation as well as investments in food quality, portion size and pricing significantly below inflation. Our commodity inflation this quarter was 11%. Restaurant labor was 50 basis points higher, driven by wage inflation, higher sick pay and overtime expense as a result of Omicron. Hourly wage inflation during the quarter was just over 9%. Restaurant labor as a percent of sales in fiscal December and February was better than pre-COVID as these months did not experience the same scale of headwinds from Omicron. Restaurant expenses were 80 basis points lower, as our teams continue to manage controllable expenses. Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 190 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant-level EBITDA margin for Darden was 19.4%, 50 basis points below pre-COVID levels for the quarter. However, both in December and February, restaurant-level EBITDA margins grew by almost 100 basis points compared to pre-COVID. G&A expense was 90 basis points lower, driven by savings from the corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021, a decrease in mark-to-market expense, lower travel expenses, and sales leverage. Turning to our segment performance. Sales and segment profit margins significantly increased versus last year for all of our segments. As we compare to pre-COVID, all segments, other than Olive Garden, grew sales. Olive Garden sales were slightly lower due to disproportionate impact Olive Garden experienced from the significant increase in COVID cases. This is because Olive Garden's geographic footprint and guest demographics make it more sensitive to COVID case counts. Additionally, Olive Garden continues to have significantly less marketing and promotional activity, which is a headwind to sales growth when comparing to pre-COVID. The January impact from Omicron I discussed earlier resulted in all of our segments experiencing lower segment profit margin in the quarter relative to pre-COVID.  Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. We updated our outlook for the full year to reflect our performance year-to-date and our expected performance for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.62 billion, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 29% to 30% and approximately 35 new restaurants; capital spending of approximately $425 million; total inflation of approximately 6%, with commodities inflation of approximately 9% and total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%; EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion; an annual effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%; and approximately 129 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.30 and $7.45. This outlook implies full year EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID of roughly 200 basis points, still within our previous expected range. This outlook also implies fourth quarter sales between $2.52 billion and $2.59 billion and EPS between $2.13 and $2.28, which is higher than what was contemplated in the previous outlook we provided in December. As Gene said, our quarter-to-date average weekly sales are slightly ahead of February, and that is incorporated in this guidance. Looking forward to fiscal 2023, we're providing some preliminary guidance for a few items. We expect to open approximately 60 new units in fiscal 2023. We project total capital spending between $500 million and $550 million. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 14% for fiscal 2023. Now, I'll turn it back to Gene. Gene Lee : Thanks, Raj. This morning marked my 31st and final earnings call in my years leading Darden. So all the analysts who support us, thank you for believing us, our vision and our ability to execute. And for those of you who didn't always believe in us, thank you as well. You motivated me more than you will ever know. I want to thank our shareholders for the trust they have shown us and by investing in Darden. I will miss our time together, whether it's a one-on-one meeting, a group meeting or one of the many dinners we shared over the year. And finally, thank you to all the team members in our restaurants and our support center for the lifeblood of our company. I look forward to seeing you in our restaurants in my new role as Chair. I began this journey 45 years ago as a high school kid busting table. I've learned a lot of lessons throughout my career, but two in particular have served as guiding principles for me. First, when it comes to making decisions, you have to make sure both your guests and team members win. When those two critical stakeholders win, it's a good decision. Second, this is a simple business. Malcolm Nance [ph] said it best. The restaurant business is simple, but simple is hard. To be successful in the restaurant industry, you must have great people who consistently serve outstanding food and an engaging atmosphere. So I may have bored you with my back-to-basics operating philosophy, running great restaurants will always require intense focus on the fundamentals. As I transition into my new role as Chair, I'm confident Darden is set up for success. Rick is ready to lead the company, and he and his team will do a great job. Now, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open, please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. My question is about the margin outlook given the inflation environment you're facing. And I think you had previously guided to 200 to 250 basis points of margin expansion relative to pre-COVID levels. And it looks like you're going to comment in on that range for the fiscal year. But as you think about the forward-looking outlook, beyond this year, do you think that is still in play as you think about the inflation as you move into fiscal 2023, or do you think that needs to change? Raj Vennam : Hi David. Good morning, this is Raj. So, let me just step back and talk about margins. When we began the year, obviously, things have changed quite a bit from the environment today relative to how we started the year is very different. We started the year with 3% inflation assumption and pricing closer to 1.5%. And here we are, three quarters in, we're looking at 6% total inflation, and our pricing has only gone up by about 1.5%. So, we started with 1.5% and now we're just over 3% for the full year and still are able to get to that 200 basis points. So, we really feel good about where we are getting to by the end of this year. We'll share more details in June call in terms of how we're thinking about fiscal 2023. But I think in the current environment, considering the situation we're in, we feel good about where we expect to be for this fiscal year. David Tarantino : Got it. And then just a follow-up on that. You are -- sounds like you're leaning in a bit more on pricing with the fourth quarter being up 6%. I guess how did you arrive at the decision to take that much pricing? And how do you feel about the consumers' ability to absorb that level of pricing? Raj Vennam : Yes, I think if you actually look back to what we've done over the last few quarters and actually last couple of years, we've taken very little pricing. We said all along that we wanted to preserve the flexibility. We wanted to -- we approach pricing very conservatively. And so we've been trying to hold off on pricing as much as the inflation would have dictated. And I think where we are now is 6%. While 6% seems high on -- in terms of how historically we price, considering the environment and considering what we're pricing over two years, we don't think it's too much. Obviously, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to price below inflation. And like I said earlier, this year, we're pricing 300 below. And as inflation creeps up, we're going to have to try to manage through that, but it's going to be a combination of pricing and productivity initiatives. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you. And Gene, congrats again on a great run as CEO. Gene Lee : Thank you, David. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations, Gene. We seem to be sitting here at a point in time when operators and investors are increasingly concerned about lapping stimulus and doing so at a time when gas prices are surging, and this does not seem to be impacting your outlook based on your comments around March and based on the implied 4Q revenue guidance, which implies very strong trends. So, can you just comment on the environment out there? And maybe why Darden seems to not be prone to it. Gene Lee : Brian, I think -- this is Gene. I think one comment, and I'll let Rick jump in here, too. But one of the things that gives us confidence around pricing -- increasing the pricing level to 6% is that our wage rate at the lower end are increasing higher than that. So we're seeing almost double digit when you look at our direct labor. So we believe that wage inflation throughout the country is rising at a pretty rapid rate. And so we believe that the consumer can handle that right now based on where things are today, right? The environment can shift pretty quickly on us here. But what we're seeing today is that consumer demand remains fairly strong. And as this environment seems to be very different than a lot of other environments we've operated in the past, where we\u2019ve got a lot of headwinds impacting the consumer, but wages are increasing rapidly and especially more so on the lower end. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Brian. And I'll add to the current environment. As you think about what's going on in Ukraine, first of all, I want to say our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine, but the fact is we don't know how long the conflict is going to last. And so we don't know how long that's going to do anything to the environment itself. We're focused on controlling what we can control, confident in our ability to manage our business effectively in any operating environment. The other thing to think about is restaurant supply is down 13-ish%, 14% from pre-COVID. And so that gives people that want to go out, and people do want to go out, fewer options, and we are a great option for them. So -- and then last thing I'll say is you'll notice that our guidance range is a little bit wider than it normally would be in a quarter at the end. And that's just because of the uncertainty that we're feeling, but we feel good about the guidance we gave. We just gave a little bit bigger range just because of what we're going through today. Brian Bittner : Great. Thank you Gene and Rick. Operator : We'll go next to Brett Levy, MKM Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brett Levy : Great. Thanks for taking the question, and Gene, your comments will be surely missed over the next few years as we come out of these more challenging times. When you think about your operating model and all of the -- with inflation, labor shortages, all of the rising pressures on the consumer, how should we think about what you can implement in terms of technology? How conservative you want to be in terms of newness to the menu over the next, we'll say, two to six quarters? How should we think about what you can really monitor on the controllables to drive productivity versus your need to stay front-footed? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Brett, it's Rick. And a couple of things on that question. So on the technology front we continue to have the same goal. It's implementing technology that reduces friction across the value chain, wherever that friction is, and responding to guest growing need for personalization. We don't anticipate using technology to take people out of the system because this is a full-service restaurant and full service company, and we believe that consumers want a human interaction. In terms of menu, we've been clear that we really like the reduction in menu and what it's done to provide our guests with the dishes they want at high-value dishes that they want and make it easier for our teams to produce them. And we can continue to get better. If we add new items, we take another item off. And so we're going to be consistent on making sure our menus stay at the levels they are today within a very small percentage up or down. On the controllables front, we still have some costs that will be coming in over time. But as we look to the future and project as we think about sales going forward, we would expect to get some productivity, but we don't think margin is going to be moving very much from where it is today. We'll talk about -- more about that in June as we think about our fiscal 2023. But just if you think about our long-term framework that we've had, it was 10 to 30 basis points of margin improvement. We got seven years of margin improvement in two years. And so we have to make sure that we manage that and consider that margin improvement we've made over the last couple of years. Brett Levy : And then just one quick follow-up. When you think about the mix of your consumers right now shifting either to a higher-value product for the pursuit of value, have you seen any material movement in the mix, I guess, by Olive Garden, by LongHorn and then just across the consolidated? Rick Cardenas : No, Brett, we haven't seen any movement. Brett Levy : Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John Glass : Hi, thanks. Good morning, Gene. I don't think you bored any of us. I think, actually, you taught us all a lot about the industry. So thank you for that. On -- Raj, on commodities specifically, I know you've provided some insight on the deck here about through May. Do you have the sort of the contract beyond that, or do you think it's too early given the volatility? Do you have any visibility, I guess, into 2023 on at least that expense item? Raj Vennam : John, we are obviously starting to have conversations. We have -- we are -- I would say, from a -- compared to historical situation, we're probably less contracted and we're working through those over the next few months, and we'll have more to share in June. But the forward premiums are too high to contract that far. John Glass : Thank you for that. And then just related to your comments about pricing and the consumer can tolerate that pricing, how are you thinking about your promotional tactics in '23? Do you start to come up with alternative plans if the consumer is weaker than you expect? Are you starting to revisit your thoughts about the marketing spend in the business? How are you preparing if, in fact, consumer demand starts to weaken? And what are some of the tactics just broadly that you think you could employ to continue the sales momentum? Rick Cardenas : Hey, John, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. I will say we're not going to talk too much about 2023. But I will say, we've got contingency plans for anything. If the economy slows down, we've got some plans. We won't talk about what they are. If the economy stays strong, then we'll continue what we're doing. And so until we see what that is and where it is, we don't really want to comment on what we would do. John Glass : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Mullan at Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian Mullan : Hey, thank you. Thanks for the development color on fiscal 2023. Just wondering if you could speak to how that pipeline is building beyond that on a multiyear basis. And it would be great to hear your thoughts on what you're seeing from a competition for site perspective. Are you seeing other large chain casual diners out there looking at these same sites? Just anything different or notable that force going out versus how the environment was prior to COVID when there were more restaurants. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Brian, we're continuing to build our pipeline for fiscal 2024 and beyond. And as we've said before, we'd like to get closer to the higher end of our long-term framework in the future. As we're seeing competition for sites, we aren't seeing as many people competing for sites, but there are still brands that are out there growing and competing for site. And so as we continue to build the pipeline, we will continue to compete for some of those sites. I will say, add to that, we are taking over some sites and building some restaurant and converting some to our brands at an economical rate. And they're really great sites. Those brands just didn't stay through. So we'll continue to build our pipeline. We still have some cost inflation in there, but our business model has improved so much that is offsetting that by more than enough. And we feel good that we'll continue to build our pipeline. Brian Mullan : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Peter Saleh of BTIG. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question and congrats again, Gene. Gene, I think several quarters ago, you had mentioned that you were seeing about 10% fewer units in casual dining versus pre-pandemic, but there was, I think, a lot of speculation still in the category and people opening up restaurants. Are you still seeing that? Is it still fairly competitive out there in terms of development, or has the environment -- the inflationary environment kind of pushed that down a little bit and made that subside a little bit? Gene Lee : Yes. I think if you go back -- and what I was trying to say back then was that there was a lot of speculation, especially by some of the big REITs out there that were willing to take on some real estate and leave it vacant for a while and the carry costs were less. We haven't seen any real change in that. My expectation would be, as interest rates rise, there'll be less speculation in the real estate market and people will be less likely to allow their buildings to sit dark for a period of time. And so, as Rick said before, in the prior question, we're building our pipeline. There's competition out -- there, not a lot of chain restaurants out there competing. There's a lot of smaller regional players out there competing for space. At the end of the day, most landlords want a Darden guarantee signature on their property. We get to look at most of the real estate out there in the United States, and we get first look at it. And if we can make it work, we're going to -- we'll sign a lease and we'll try to put the right brand on there to maximize the opportunity. Peter Saleh : Thank you for that. And then, just on the development for 2023, can you give us a sense on how much of that development is coming from Cheddar's? Rick Cardenas : Yes. It's going to be somewhere in the low single digits, maybe as much as 10, but lower single digits to as much as 10. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Jeffrey Bernstein at Barclays. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you. Gene, thank you for your steady leadership and friendship over the years and for setting an example for the industry to follow. So a question on the off-premise business. It seems like it's stickier than we would have thought, I think you said 30% at Olive Garden, 16% at LongHorn. Just wondering if you can maybe share the split between delivery and pickup within that current trucks sales and maybe where you think that's going to settle? I mean it just seems like a lot of this is here to stay. I'm just wondering whether there's any chance you guys would reconsider opening up to maybe third-party delivery aggregators. It seems like the consumer expects it and the consistencies improve, the fees are eased. I don't want to see you guys lose out if this is kind of where the future is going. So, any thoughts on that would be great. Thank you. Gene Lee : Hey, Jeff, this is Gene. I thought you'd wait until I leave the room to ask about third-party delivery. I'll let Rick take that. Rick Cardenas : Hey Jeff, thanks for the question. Gene and I are in the same place on what we believe with third-party delivery. We still don't like that model. We don't think it's the right thing for having someone get in between us and our guests, and a couple of points. Olive Garden has grown their To Go business significantly. And in many ways, faster than others have grown it with third-party delivery without that margin hit. Now, our takeout sales increased in Q3 from Q2, partly because of the influx of Omicron. And so people shifted again back to a To Go experience. We're seeing a little bit of a shift back to on-premise in Q4. We don't know where equilibrium is going to be. And when we get there, it will probably be higher than where we were before COVID, but it's not going to be at the levels they are today. And so we'll continue to make investments that we need to take the friction out of the order, pick up and pay experience so that people don't consider getting delivered. Now, you did ask about our delivery. We do have large party delivery for Olive Garden and that's a good business for us. It's a minimum order size. It gives us enough time to prep the order and deliver it to our guests and actually do a little bit more of a setup for it. I mean, so we really feel good about that business, but we never say never, but the likelihood of us getting into third-party delivery anytime soon is pretty low. Jeff Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Dennis Geiger of UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you and Gene, congrats on a remarkable run. Wanted to ask on the staffing situation a bit more. Sort of where are you now on staffing levels relative to where you'd like to be? And kind of related to that, as it relates to wage inflation, recognizing there's a lot your mind, or is it too soon to make that call? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Dennis, this is Rick. Thanks for the question on the staffing side. We feel -- as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel much better about where we are in our staffing today than we did three months ago and three months before that. We continue to add around 10,000 people working per quarter, basically at the end of the quarter from the quarter before. Our staffing levels are greater than 95% of pre-COVID staffing levels. We don't need as many people as we did before because of our productivity enhancement. That said, we want to make sure that our team members that we have are fully trained and productive. And as we said, exclusions were pretty tough in the month of January, especially. In terms of wage inflation, we are, as we said, seeing a continued increase on applicant flow. And so while it hasn't reversed kind of the starting wage trends, it's actually starting to stabilize, but we don't know where that's going to land. But right now, it's starting to stabilize a little bit. And we'll know more as that applicant flow continues to pick up and people feel more comfortable working again after -- as Omicron hopefully become more of an endemic versus a pandemic. Dennis Geiger : Great. And just one more there, Rick. As it relates to the competitive environment and the industry, you spoke to it some, I think, as it related to real estate opportunities. As it relates to market share, perhaps how are you thinking now about the small chain independent situation? Has it gotten better or worse as you look ahead? Has the opportunity for you to pick up share, because of closures, permanent closures, maybe more challenges that are coming, given all the inflation? Has that -- have your thoughts there changed at all on what that means for Darden's brands? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Dennis, our thoughts haven't changed as the economic environment continued to struggle over time, as Omicron picked up, more restaurant close. I mean, so there are fewer restaurants today than there were last month and the month before and the month before that. They'll eventually get filled. And our -- what we want to do is be there to fill some of those restaurants and pick up that market share. As we think about the future, we've said that we're going to increase -- hopefully get to the high end of our framework and new units. But those restaurants will eventually come back and be better than they were before. Our restaurants will be better than maybe the ones that were closed. Dennis Geiger : Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Chris O'Cull at Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chris O'Cull: Thanks. My question relates to just consumers' value perception of Olive Garden. Rick, I'm curious if you've seen any change in the value perception as more orders have shifted to off-premise over the past couple of years, or if your strategy of pricing below inflation, as others have taken more aggressive pricing has had any impact on Olive Garden's value perception? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Chris, we haven't really seen a big impact in our internal data on a change in value perception at Olive Garden. We track both on-premise and off-premise. Olive Garden continues to increase their overall satisfaction from five years ago. There's a slope up versus most customers are actually more dissatisfied across the American consumer satisfaction index. We're bucking that trend. All of our brands are bucking that trend. And so we haven't seen a big change in value ratings for Olive Garden, and we'll continue to monitor that. We don't think the pricing actions that we have taken are going to change that dramatically because we're still, as Raj had mentioned, much lower than most full-service restaurants combined over a two-year period. Chris O'Cull: That's helpful. And then just with marketing dollars down about 50% [ph] from pre-COVID levels, and other chains are starting to spend more on advertising, is there any concern at all that Olive Garden may lose top my mind awareness if marketing spend isn\u2019t increase more aggressively? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Chris, as you mentioned, we are lower in marketing spend than we were pre-COVID. We're going to continue to wait for the equilibrium. I'm really proud of the work that Dan and his team has done, keeping with our strategy. And so we have been marketing. But we're marketing our Never Any First Course to remind everybody about the value they get every day at Olive Garden. We're not doing promotional marketing, but we're talking about the value they get every day. And we'll continue to look at our marketing spend over time. And if the time we bring that back up, we would expect to earn a return on that, as we said on the last call. We feel Olive Garden is large, and one of their advantages is their scale, means that we will be marketing at Olive Garden. We just want to find the right time to continue to increase that, but it probably won't get all the way back to pre-COVID levels, but we'll see where equilibrium comes. Chris O'Cull: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Gonzalez at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Eric Gonzalez : Hey, thanks for the question. And Gene, congrats on a fantastic career. It's really been a pleasure to follow your success over the years. My question is about the consumer environment. You talked about the rise in low-end wages being offset to some of the cost pressures out there. I'm also wondering if we might be experiencing some post-Omicron pent-up demand in March. Will the consumer might be less sensitive to price increases? So perhaps you could talk about how sustainable you believe the current momentum might be and maybe what factors might contribute to that sustainability? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Eric, this is Rick. I'll talk about the sustainability. We've guided where -- what we think our Q4 will be, and that includes everything we know today. And it talks about what our comp sales will be and what our total sales will be, which was higher than what we would have guided in December for Q4. There might be some pent-up demand for Omicron, but there's enough demand for COVID. And it might have been Omicron, but it's other things. And so we're going to continue to see what the equilibrium is. We keep coming back to that word equilibrium. What do we look like when everything is back to a more normal state, and it's a steady state. And we're not there yet. We've got geopolitical risk and other things, which is, again, why we have a wider range in our outlook for Q4 than we normally would at this time. Eric Gonzalez : Fair enough. And maybe on labor costs quickly. You mentioned the heavy exclusions costs due to Omicron. I'm just wondering if you can comment on turnover levels and then maybe quantify how much of a drag, if you're seeing any excess staff training relative to normalized levels. Rick Cardenas : Yes, turnover levels in the last -- you think about turnover the way we manage it. It's over a 12-month period, and you've got a lot of kind of fluctuation over time. But turnover levels are getting a little bit better for us in the long versus where we were just a few months back and months before that. We still have 90-day turnover at a higher level than we'd like it to be. So that's why we're focusing more on training even more and specifically on our new team members to make sure they get up to speed and they understand what our business is all about. And I'll let Raj talk about the other part. Raj Vennam : Yes. On the expense side, I'd say just purely the expense part of it probably impacted our margins by about 20 to 30 basis points related to all the Omicron impact, whether it's overtime, sick pay or training, all that stuff is probably in that 20 to 30 basis points range. I remind you, that doesn't include the deleverage from sales mix. So that's the other part of it that impacts the margins, too. Eric Gonzalez : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Nicole Miller at Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead. I apologize. We lost your line. We'll go to Andy Barish with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Andy Barish : Yes, one \u2013 one quick follow-up. Just, Raj, on the $100 million sales impact you quoted, I was a little confused. Was that the Omicron impact and the winter weather impact? I just wanted to make sure I heard that okay. Raj Vennam : Yes, it was the impact of both in January. We were specifically referring to the impact in January, yes, from both. Andy Barish : Okay. and then, Gene, if you could kind of publicly impart a little bit of final wisdom on -- I mean, what would you be looking for? What would typically show up in consumer behavior if the consumer was starting to feel stressed from environmental factors? Gene Lee : Yes. I think -- I mean, obviously, we've been trying to regress a bunch of different variables back in the past recessions to try to give us a chance to understand what the leading indicator may be. I think this one is so different because of the geopolitical risk involved, because of a pandemic that, hopefully, we're going to switch to endemic and we're able to live with this virus going forward. I think that it's going to take a fairly solid recession to really have some impact on the consumer. I think the consumer balance sheet is stronger than it has been previously. And I think the biggest variable going forward that as I think about it, it's different than every other recession or a period that we had a real slowdown is that, there's so many open jobs today. And when you think about what really causes a recession, it's employment. And as things slow down a little bit, it's just -- it's not -- I just don't see companies, especially where the supply chains have been somewhat broken and inventories levels are low, I don't see us getting to a higher -- a significantly higher unemployment level anytime in the near term, barring something really happens bad with what's going on overseas. And so I just think this one is different, because of where employment is. It's not like we've perfectly matched everybody that's willing to work with a number of open jobs. We have so many open jobs today. And I look at our shop here and say, 'Boy, if we had to come in and cut some more overhead, it would be almost impossible to do, because we have a fair number of open jobs here.' So that's the one variable that I think is so different in this environment. I don't know how it's going to play out. But remember, we're in a business where, like in an Olive Garden, if three or four tables don't come in tonight and 12 to 16 guests, it's going to have a pretty big impact on the business over time. So we're fighting -- I always say, we're fighting for that last four top. That last four top is so profitable, and we need to make sure that we continue to create great value and we got to operate well. And I think that's the big thing out there today is that the operator -- I think casual dining restaurants and full-service restaurants in general is, we just need to operate better. I think we got sloppy during COVID. We've had to do things to just stay open and get by. We got to get sharp again. And I think our teams are doing a great job. But I think as an industry, we've got to earn the right from the consumer to pay what we're asking them to pay. And we've got to provide a really true full-service environment. Andy Barish : Thanks again. Operator : And we'll return to Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. And Nicole, your line is open. Please, go ahead. Nicole Miller : Thank you so much. I hit the hang-up button versus on mute, so I apologize. Two quick ones. On Olive Garden, in, let's say, a normalized environment, you had mentioned the sales and marketing. Can you talk about and reconcile a little bit marketing in the framework of discounting? Because it seems like a lot of investment has gone back into the store and into the plate really consumer-facing areas. And so it also seems like it would be tempting with sales just down a smidge to go back to discounting, but maybe that isn't the right strategy. Could you just talk about that a little bit? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Nicole. We are really pleased with the strategy that we have. We believe that it's better to provide an experience with a great guest experience that are people -- or people, our core guests that are willing to pay for that experience. And we would rather not discount. We took out all discounting out of Olive Garden in all of our brands at COVID. I mean we haven't added that back. Others have started to add that back, but we are continuing to maintain our strategy of keeping the discounts out of our brand. Again, as the environment changes, if the environment changes, we will consider anything, but we have a lot of options. Our biggest option is to increase our marketing spend, whether it's -- even undiscounted just to get our strategy, our message out at Olive Garden of a never-ending first course. That is a great value. And as we think about limited time offers in the future, if we have them, they'll be at a different construct than we had before. But again, when equilibrium comes and we know which way we go, that's when we'll act. Nicole Miller : And then if that equilibrium does not come, I'm curious about Cheddar's, not that anyone would or could move this quickly. But if it's a weaker macro period, do you press on value and marketing the value of Cheddar's and/or even grow the units as fast as possible? It seems like that's one of the best or better value propositions in the portfolio. Rick Cardenas : Hey Nicole, Cheddar's is a great value. That is their advantage as well, value. And we're continuing to improve the experience at Cheddar's, improve the food, improve the service experience while keeping prices much lower and pricing much lower than our competition, which is just going to improve the value perception even more. Cheddar's doesn't have as much scale to do kind of the TV kind of advertising. Our best advertising at Cheddar's is when you get your check and you see the price that you're paying and you tell your friends. We're going to continue to do that and find other ways with digital and other things if we need to, to ramp up marketing in our brands. And in terms of new unit growth, those pipelines take a while to build, right? So, we're building them now. You can't kind of turn on a dime if the consumer gets a little weaker and say we're just going to open that quite a few more of one brand versus the other. But we believe in Cheddar's, and we believe that they have a lot of growth ahead of them. And we're going to continue to build a pipeline of people and of restaurant to capture that opportunity. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Andrew Charles at Cowen. Your line is open, please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. Gene, best wishes on a well-deserved retirement and Rick, best of luck to you in your new role. The mix of digital sales as a percent of off-premise grew this quarter to 63% from 60% of sales previously. And Rick, I know you said the equilibrium -- where the off-premise mix can go is unclear relative to that prior 20%-plus target. But is there another boundary for how high that digital mix of off-premise can go? And then I have a follow-up. Rick Cardenas : Yes, I don't think there's a limiter of how high the digital mix will go other than 100%. But there are still people that want to call in and dial in and pick up their order. They may not be as comfortable with the technology. We're trying to make it as seamless and smooth as possible. But we're even making that experience better for the people that dial in, how do they pay and how do they pick up. So, we're doing things on the technology front that maybe they don't see as much, but that we can get better so that they can still do the dial-ins for us. We would like to see the digital percentage continue to grow as part of off-premise. It just simplifies the operation in the restaurant. There's fewer things that the team members have to do to pick up the phone, et cetera. But there are some long-standing guests that just like to call, and we'll continue to offer that service to them. We will not eliminate dial-in to get the percentages up. These percentages have grown because of the investments that we've made and will continue to make. And hopefully, they'll continue to grow. Andrew Charles : Great. And then just relatedly, can we expect to see a higher mix of digital marketing in 2023 versus 2022 to drive a higher digital off-premise mix and help increase data collection, or will the focus of the 2023 marketing message pivot back to driving more dine-in sales? Rick Cardenas : Andrew, we're not going to talk as much about what's going on in 2023. I will say that whatever the environment looks like, whether we need to drive more dine-in sales versus off-premise, we'll do. We don't really do a lot of digital marketing on the off-premise, so most of our marketing is for on-premise. And so if we do any off-premise marketing, it will be an increase. So pretty much most of our marketing is -- I'm sorry, if we do any off-premise marketing, it will be the increase. Most of our marketing is on-premise. Andrew Charles : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Lauren Silberman at Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Lauren Silberman : Thank you. And Gene, I also echo everyone's comments about your leadership. So on the accelerating commodity pressures, beyond additional price, can you talk about any other levers you're looking at in the supply chain to help offset some of the commodity pressures, any flexibility in some of ingredients and sourcing? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Lauren, we really like the way our menu works right now and the taste in our food. So we don't have a -- we don't expect to go in there and change ingredients significantly to offset some of these costs. We'll continue to work with our supply chain partners to get the best prices that we can get for the product. I will say, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're going to do whatever it takes to get the products that our consumers value and that our consumers expect to have when they come in to eat with us. We're hoping that eventually this inflation environment gets a little bit better, but we think we can compete in whatever environment there is. Lauren Silberman : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Carril at RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chris Carril : Thanks and good morning. Gene, congratulations and wish you all the best going forward. So just on the additional pricing you'll take beginning this quarter, can you provide any further detail on how you're planning to implement this additional pricing across the portfolio, maybe specifically at your largest brands versus your higher end brands? Raj Vennam : Yeah. I think, Chris, the way we've talked about before is our philosophy is generally to price less at casual dining. And obviously, that can vary from quarter-to-quarter. So I don't want to get into the exact specifics because these numbers change monthly, quarterly because it's a function of what we're wrapping on and how this goes. But generally speaking, there's a lot of science that goes into how we go about pricing and there are -- and that is very analytical, but there's also a lot of art that we've gained over time, the intuition that we've developed looking at data over time being in this business for a long time. Chris Carril : Got it. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, Raj. You mentioned productivity initiatives to also help offset these incremental cost pressures that you're seeing. So can you expand maybe on what some of these productivity initiatives look like? Is this just more related to new employee training? Raj Vennam : I think it goes back -- some of that is that, but I think it goes back to the things that we did through COVID. A lot of the stuff is a continuation of what we've done with simplification. We continue to find opportunities to simplify. And then as Rick said in his comments, as we're hiring new people, our focus is on training them to be more productive. So there is a lot of new people in our system right now, and we want them to be at their best, and that takes time. Chris Carril : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. The question was also just on the staffing, and I guess who the applicants are in 2022 relative to 2019. It was curious or good to hear that your overall turnover levels, I guess, on an annual basis are beginning to improve. But how would you -- I guess, I think you described your overall productivity and the hospitality elements of your employees. I mean, is this still basically the type of employment class that you expect to get back to fiscal 2019 hospitality levels, or have there been some changes, including your menu simplification, that might actually allow the calendar-2022-and-beyond class to actually execute better than what you've done in the past based on some of the process changes that you've made? Rick Cardenas : Yes, John, to answer the question directly, I think we can get better, continue to get better with this class because of the menu simplification we've made. When reducing our menus the way we did has made it a lot easier to run a restaurant. The managers spend a little less time on individual items and teaching people on these items that we didn't produce very often. I mean we just get better at producing the same things over and over again, which are the things that our guests want. We've had a couple of things that have happened through COVID that have been good for us. One is we've hired some folks that maybe we wouldn't have looked at before, maybe it's her first job. But giving someone their first job and teaching them to do the things the way we do it is a good thing for us. Maybe in the past, we would have said, 'You needed to have a lot of experience in a restaurant before you come to work for ours.' But we're seeing that some of these folks that we're hiring that are new to work, we're teaching them how to work the way we want them to work and it's actually working out for us pretty well. We also have seen a lot of rehires. A lot of people are coming back to work for us that have left us over time. And a lot of our managers are rehires. And so while people may have left the industry during COVID, a lot of them are coming back, and we feel really good about the fact that they're coming back to work for us. John Ivankoe : That\u2019s helpful. Congratulations again, Gene. Operator : We'll go next to David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Congrats, Gene, on a heck of a career. All the best to you in retirement. I have a question about Cheddar's and Darden\u2019s acquisition strategy going forward. Cheddar's has gone through a lot of change before COVID. I think some of that was more painful and slow than you would have expected, but it seemed to have reached pretty transformational levels with labor productivity during COVID. So could you talk about Cheddar's new unit returns today? And what that unit growth could possibly look like going forward for that brand? How fast can it ramp? And I have a quick follow-up on this. Rick Cardenas : Hey, David, let me just say how proud I am of John Wilkerson and his team and what they've done over COVID over two years of significantly changing the business model at Cheddar's to make it a much more investable proposition for us. As we said in one of the earlier questions, kind of the new unit opening range of low single digits to high -- to up to 10, we'll probably open more than we've had since we bought them. And we'll continue to build that pipeline as we continue to strengthen the team. The great thing that they have done is build the team to be ready to open restaurants. And that wasn't ready when we got them. And so, I can't tell you how big Cheddar's will be, but I can tell you that they have a big addressable population. The values that they provide, the value that they provide for the consumer and the food that they have, means there's a lot of Cheddar's that can be built out there. How many? I can't tell you until we get some more of these open. I will say, the restaurants that we've opened through COVID had done really well for us, and we feel really good about the fact that we can open more Cheddar's. Dave Palmer : And, I mean, I don't know, maybe you want to circle back on the unit returns part of that? But I also have a follow-up just on sort of what that means, as you're getting past Cheddar's, are acquisitions going to be even more in focus for you? And I just think it's worth just noting how unusual it would be if Darden were to become, sort of, get an acquisition premium, if you will. Because right now, there's not many play -- not many companies out there. You can see an acquisition strategy paying off in an accretive way, where the multiple reflects that, like that rinse-and-repeat credibility on acquisitions. So maybe you want to comment on that capability? And how much of this is going to be a focus for you going forward. And thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes, David. If you think about our acquisition strategy, we've made four big acquisitions since 2007. And that should still be part of our strategy going forward. We've proven that we can get synergies. And we've proven over time, it takes a while that we get these brands up and running and ready to go and grow. But our management team and Board regularly evaluate that, and nothing is going to change as we go forward. We believe Darden is a platform, a platform that can add brands that help Darden grow and continue to build our biggest advantage, which is scale. Dave Palmer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Jared Garber : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And, certainly, appreciate all the great color on the quarter, and I think on the consumer as we think, I think, ahead for the rest of the year. Many of the questions have certainly been asked and answered, but I wanted to get a sense of maybe some other strategies that you're thinking about in terms of making the consumer value proposition stronger outside of the price dynamic. So wondering if you can comment on how loyalty plays into your thinking here, whether that's a brand-specific program or something across the platform. Or are there any other, sort of, strategies that you're thinking through that might improve that value proposition outside of just stronger menu and sort of better value pricing? Rick Cardenas : Hi, Jared. As we think about our strategy and value proposition, it's really what we've been talking about for years in our basic, simple operating philosophy : food, service and atmosphere. We're going to continue to invest in food, make it better and make it more consistent every time you come into one of our restaurants. We're going to continue to improve our service, and we're going to make sure our atmospheres are great. In terms of -- while we, again, price, continue to price, is our expectation below our competition and below inflation, we believe that, that is the best way to build value. Loyalty, we've looked at that before. We may look at it again. I'm not quite sure that, that's where the value comes from is to give a discount to your highest core consumers. Our goal is to build an additional visit to our core consumers, and we've been doing that without discounting because we're giving them what they want at a price that they think is a fair value for them and a great value for them. And we'll continue to do that going forward. Jared Garber : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : We'll go next to Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Your line is open, please go ahead. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for sneaking me in here and Gene, congratulations, just to echo all the thoughts there. My question was on the idea that the pent-up demand post-COVID itself and not just Omicron, and given all the -- how data-intensive you are, I'm wondering if you can share any data on how many -- whether you're seeing consumers come back in that haven't come in, in a couple of years, maybe how material that is, whether you're really seeing a shift in consumers kind of more post-COVID. And then a separate question is just on regionality. I think as investors are concerned about what gas prices might be doing to consumer, it's higher prices in different regions and specifically in the West Coast, whether you're seeing any kind of more pronounced near-term impact as you think about maybe your quarter-to-date trends, whether there's much variability there. Rick Cardenas : Jake, in terms of kind of the pent-up demand over -- for COVID versus Omicron, yes, we're seeing some consumers that haven't been with us for a couple of years in our dining rooms and are dining, right? So, there were -- there are still a percentage of people that didn't feel comfortable going out even as Delta kind of waned and people thought maybe COVID was kind of done at that time. And so we're still seeing guests that are coming back and there'll probably be some more that come back. We're still a little skewed. If we think about our skew of demographics, we're still a little bit lower in our mix of those over 65 because, I think, they felt a little bit less comfortable, but that mix is getting better. And in terms -- I forgot the second part. Jake Bartlett : Geography. Rick Cardenas : Yes, in terms of geography, the geography piece, I'm sorry, Yes, I don't think we're going to get into the geography in just three weeks, right, quarter-to-date. I will say that the geographic impact in Q3 were much more related to Omicron than they were for anything else, depending on what that geographic region felt about COVID versus not, but not getting into kind of the gas prices in just a really short period of time because they're already -- the gas prices kind of moved up and moved down a little bit over those three weeks. Jake Bartlett : Got it. And just a quick follow-up. I think there's more concern about the lower-income consumer. And Gene, you mentioned just that's where the low-income consumer is seeing the most wage inflation. So, I appreciate that offset. But are you seeing any differences in maybe in quarter-to-date or February in terms of the types of consumers that you're exposed to? Any insight there as to whether there's -- one is a little more wobbly than the other or whether they're kind of all performing about the same? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jake, we're not really seeing a big material difference in consumers through February, March based on anything that's going on in the geopolitical environment or what's going on with inflation. Jake Bartlett : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Sure. Operator : We'll take our final question from Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Nick Setyan : Thank you, and thank you Gene, for all of your wisdom throughout the years. My question is specifically on just lead costs, given the importance of pasta and bread. It would be just very helpful if you could frame your exposure in some way, whether it's a percentage of the food basket or this is the pricing we would need to take to offset it. Is there any way you can frame your exposure if we should be worried about it? Raj Vennam : Yeah. Nick, maybe I'll just dimensionalize it for you. When you look at our food basket, wheat makes up about 7%; call it, 2% to 3% is pasta related; and then the rest is bakery and bread. So that's really where the exposure to wheat directly is. We're continuing to see what happens in that market, and we'll work with our vendors to just make sure we get the best price we can in the environment we're in. Nick Setyan : Great. Thank you. Operator : And with no other questions holding, Mr. Kalicak, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing comments. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Jess. That concludes our call. And I'd like to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 23rd, before the market opens, with a conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Please go ahead. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Maureen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden\u2019s President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing fourth quarter performance is a comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, this is because the results from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 are not meaningful due to the pandemic\u2019s impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during those periods. This will be the final quarter that we provide comparisons to pre-COVID. Moving forward, we will provide comparisons to the prior year. We plan to release fiscal 2023 first quarter earnings on Thursday, September 22 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and full year before discussing our focus moving forward. Raj will provide details on our Q4 and full year financial results and share our fiscal 2023 financial outlook and then Rick will close with some final comments. Now, I will turn the call over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. This is our first conference call since Gene\u2019s retirement, so I want to take a moment to thank him. Gene never wanted the spotlight on himself and he is probably listening right now and telling me to move on. But Darden is stronger today and better positioned to navigate any operating environment because of Gene\u2019s leadership. And personally, I know I am better prepared for my role, thanks to Gene\u2019s mentorship. So, on behalf of our 180,000 team members, thank you, Gene, for putting our guests and team members first and for leading Darden with a steady and decisive hand. As you saw from our press release this morning, we had a very good quarter, even in this highly inflationary environment. For the quarter, we exceeded our sales expectations and our earnings were in line with our outlook. Overall, fiscal 2022 was a solid year. Each of our brands strengthened their business models, while our restaurant teams remain disciplined and executed well in a challenging environment. We stuck to our strategy, continue to price below inflation and ended the year with significantly better margins than pre-COVID. As a result of this business model improvement and our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned as we begin our new fiscal year, in what remains an uncertain environment. Raj will share details for the quarter and the full year in a moment. But first, I want to spend my time reiterating Darden\u2019s strategy, which is not changing and will remain our focus moving forward. Our brands benefit from Darden\u2019s four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture, but none is more evident in our financial results than our scale. To quickly dimensionalize our scale advantage for you, our total sales are more than 2x our closest full-service restaurant competitor more than 2.5x the next closest. We also have higher than average annual restaurant volumes; lower overhead costs, which we achieved by centralizing our support functions and margins that are significantly higher than our competitive set. Our scale creates cost advantages that our brands could not achieve individually. A great example is the fact that each of our specialty restaurant brands : the Capital Grille, ADVs, Seasons 52, Yard House and Bahama Breeze, achieved record results for the year, even in the midst of historic inflation. We will continue to leverage our scale and our superior financial position to make long-term investments in our business. First, we will continue to invest in our brands\u2019 value propositions by underpricing inflation over the long-term. This is the biggest investment we make every year. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our scale to invest in technology that enhances the guest experience and simplifies operations. Finally, it is our people who bring our brands to life and we will continue to invest in them so they can grow and thrive and help us do the same. At the restaurant level, our strategy comes to life through our back-to-basics operating philosophy. This philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere, has never been more important than it is today. Our restaurant team is focused on being brilliant with the basics, ensures we put the full in full-service dining. The work our brands are doing to drive execution by simplifying our processes and menus puts our restaurant teams in the best position to deliver great guest experiences and its working. Olive Garden\u2019s overall guest satisfaction scores are at all-time highs. Additionally, on Mother\u2019s Day, the Olive Garden team delivered record performance. Mother\u2019s Day was the highest sales day and second highest guest count day in their history. We also continue to make key investments across our portfolio to position each brand for long-term success. For example, LongHorn Steakhouse has made significant investments over the past few years in the quality of their food. They continue to lead the casual dining industry on food quality and taste of food, which propelled them to over $2 billion in annual sales for the first time. Similarly, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen is a value leader and the investments they have made to simplify their menu and price below inflation has resulted in improvement in their industry-leading value ratings. Finally, as I mentioned, our specialty brands had record performance for the year, which was due to the investments they made during COVID and the scale advantage of Darden. Our strategy remains the right one for the company and we will continue to execute it to drive growth and long-term shareholder value. As we begin our new fiscal year, we continue to experience significant inflationary pressures and we will stick to our strategy of pricing below inflation and our competitors over time. While we can\u2019t predict the future, we are focused on managing the business for the long-term and the power of Darden positions us to navigate this environment better than anyone else. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, 14.2% higher than last year, driven by 11.7% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 33 net new restaurants, which included one temporary closure that will reopen in fiscal 2023. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.24. Total EBITDA was $431 million and we returned significant cash to shareholders, paying $137 million in dividends and repurchasing $237 million in shares for a total of $374 million of cash returned to investors in the quarter. We continue to see increasing cost pressures with total inflation for the fourth quarter of 7.5%. During the quarter, we took additional pricing to help offset a portion of the growing inflation that brought total pricing to 6% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. This is well below our annual inflation of just over 6% as we continue to execute our strategy to strengthen our value leadership position. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L, compared to pre-COVID, food and beverage expenses were 300 basis points higher driven by investments in both pricing below inflation and in food quality. For reference, food inflation in Q4 was 12% versus last year. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points lower driven by hourly labor efficiencies gained from operational simplifications, which were partially offset by continued wage pressures. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7% versus last year, primarily driven by hourly wage inflation of approximately 9%. Marketing spend was $48 million lower as we remain disciplined in our approach to marketing activities, resulting in 230 basis points of favorability. G&A expense was 140 basis points lower, driven by our corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021 and sales leverage. As a result, we achieved restaurant-level EBITDA margin of 19.9%, 40 basis points above pre-COVID levels and quarterly EBITDA of $431 million. Total EBITDA margin for the quarter was 16.6%, a 170 basis point improvement to pre-COVID.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%. We ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $282 million, which was 10.8% of sales. All of our segments had higher total sales and higher average weekly sales per restaurant. Segment profit dollars were higher for all segments as well. Olive Garden and Fine Dining segments also grew their segment profit margin, while LongHorn and other business segment had lower segment profit margin this quarter, driven by higher level of inflation and other investments in those businesses since pre-COVID. Fiscal 2022 proved to be another unpredictable year. We experienced strong demand early in the year as capacity restrictions were largely removed. Additionally, we faced reduced demand and staffing challenges as the Delta variant emerged in the fall and the Omicron variant followed in December and January. Finally, inflation increased throughout the year. In fact, our total inflation doubled from our original expectation of 3% to just over 6% for the full year. Despite all of those challenges, we were able to deliver $9.6 billion in total sales and achieved diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.40, in line with our internal expectations and at the higher end of the annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. This year\u2019s strong top and bottom line performance drove over $1.5 billion in EBITDA from continuing operations, resulting in 15.9% EBITDA margin, nearly 200 basis points higher than pre-COVID. We also invested almost $400 million of capital in the business, returned over $1.6 billion to shareholders, and ended the year with $421 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our strong operating model generates significant cash flows. In fact, since 2017, we have averaged EBITDA growth of 9.5% annually. Our balance sheet is well situated at just 1.8x debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal 2022, well below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x and provides us flexibility for the future. The strong balance sheet, coupled with our disciplined approach to simplifying operations, under-pricing inflation and driving profitable sales growth, positions us well for the future. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023, we expect total sales of $10.2 billion to $10.4 billion, representing growth of 6% to 8% from last year, same restaurant sales growth of 4% to 6% and 55 to 60 new restaurants; capital spending of $500 million to $550 million; total inflation of approximately 6%, and we plan to continue under-pricing total inflation with annual pricing of approximately 5%. Furthermore, we expect commodities inflation of approximately 7% that\u2019s heavily weighted in the first half of the year; hourly labor inflation of approximately 8%; an annual effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%; and approximately 124 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.40 and $8. Heading into 2023, we expect the commodities inflation rate to increase in the first quarter from the 12% we had in Q4 and then to moderate significantly, ending the year roughly flat. So due to this significant unusual timing, we would like to provide some context on the cadence of quarterly earnings expectations. With the first quarter commodities inflation in the mid-teens, we expect a low double-digit percentage decline in EPS from last year. For the second quarter, commodities inflation eases a bit to the low double-digit range, resulting in flat EPS to last year. And for the back half of the year, we anticipate low single-digit commodity inflation and positive EPS growth. As a result of our strong performance and our fiscal 2023 outlook, our board approved a 10% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.21 per share, implying an annual dividend of $4.84. This results in a yield of 4.2% based on yesterday\u2019s closing share price. And with that, I will turn it back to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thanks, Raj. I want to close by thanking our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout a challenging year. As a publicly traded company, we strive to earn a profit and create long-term shareholder value. And while we are proud that our average annual total shareholder return has always been at least 10% for any 10-year period as a public company, there is a larger purpose to what we do and that is to nourish and delight everyone we serve. As a restaurant company, we continue to nourish our guests with delicious, high-quality food. But to us, it means more than that. We want to nourish the spirits of our guests to delight them with great service in an atmosphere that enables them to reenergize and connect with family and friends over a great meal. We also want to nourish and delight our team members by providing competitive wages and benefits while giving them opportunities to build meaningful careers within our company. With more than 1,850 locations and 8,000 leadership positions across our restaurants, we provide a pathway for thousands of people across the country to transform an entry level job into a lifelong career. Helping others realize their potential and achieve their dreams is one of the things that makes our industry special and that\u2019s why a central tenet of our approach to team member development is a commitment to promote from within. We are proud that more than half of our restaurant managers\u2019 positions are filled by our hourly team members. But their growth doesn\u2019t stop at the restaurant manager level. In fact, more than 15% of our officers began their careers with us as hourly team members. Finally, we want to nourish and delight the communities where we operate and our team members call home. When we open a new restaurant, we make a positive impact by creating an average of 100 new jobs and serving the local community. We aim to make a difference by helping tackle issues that we are best equipped to address, like fighting hunger and sourcing food with care. So our purpose, to nourish and delight everyone we serve is not limited to just sales and earnings growth, rather, it\u2019s about sales and earnings growth as a way to make a positive difference in the lives of millions more guests, tens of thousands more team members continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. Now, let\u2019s take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs. Jared Garber : Hi, thanks for taking the question this morning. Obviously, I appreciate all the guidance that you provided. We are entering what maybe a more challenging macro environment. So just wanted to get a sense of, I guess, what are the underlying assumptions in your guidance on both the top line and the cost. I know you went through a couple of them on commodities and pricing. But as it relates to consumer spending maybe in the near-term, what you are seeing and then the outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. What are some of the assumptions underlying that guidance? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Hey, Jared. Good morning. This is Raj. Hey, look, this is our best estimate based on the data and information we have today. Obviously, like everyone else, there is a lot of uncertainty out there and you see that we have a wide range similar to last year to kind of reflect that underlying uncertainty. And with that said, we have shared information around commodities and what we estimate and we actually even provided the quarterly cadence on that front. And we are focused on things we control. And I actually want to have Rick chime in on the consumer, what we are seeing with the consumer and our expectations, high level. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Jared, I will start by saying the consumer sentiment right now is at the lowest it\u2019s been in 60 years, according to the University of Michigan. But one of the benefits of our portfolio is we have a wide range of consumers. Our data indicates that higher end consumer hasn\u2019t seen the same impact as consumers at the lower end of the spectrum and consumers at the lower end, especially at Cheddar\u2019s, has shown signs of check management and they do make up a smaller percentage of our current guest base than it is six months ago. So, the impact that inflation is having on that lower end consumers is showing a little bit, but we incorporated that in our guidance. Jared Garber : Great. Thanks for that. And I guess just sort of one follow-up there. How do you think about sort of the tools that you have in the toolbox, if the consumer does slip a little bit more and maybe it\u2019s more than just that lower end at Cheddar\u2019s. But how are you thinking about some of the tools you have to maintain that higher level of sales growth as we go throughout the year, whether that\u2019s discounting or promotions? Obviously, you have done a lot of work in the last couple of years on limiting some of that, particularly at Olive Garden and LongHorn. So just want to get a sense of how you are thinking about the levers that you have to pull for the year? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jared, for competitive reasons, we are not really going to get in too much into detail in our plans. But as you have seen over the last couple of years, our teams have done a great job being flexible and reacting to changing dynamics. We won\u2019t overreact. That\u2019s as you know, that\u2019s not really the way we work. We won\u2019t overreact. We are going to continue to focus on profitable sales growth and manage the business for the long-term. If the consumer slows dramatically, if we see a big slowdown in consumer traffic, we would also expect the rate of inflation to decline as well. And just to give you an idea, 1% decrease in the rate of inflation is more than offset, that is more, more than offset the 2% decrease in traffic. And so that should still help us get within the range of our guidance. As you think about our media message and what we are doing, Olive Garden\u2019s scale provides them the opportunity to use media to get our message out to many guests. That\u2019s one of the benefits of scale. We believe we can drive traffic by highlighting the value we provide everyday through an abundance of our never-ending first course. And if you look at our current media message right now, it speaks to one of our most craveable items, our Alfredo sauce that we make in-house everyday. It reinforces the core advertising and core equity at Olive Garden that we have invested in over the last 2 years and that ad is the highest rated ad we have had in years. And so our strong margins give us an optionality if we do promote, but we don\u2019t expect it to be at a deep discount. So, we do believe we have the tools in our toolbox to keep traffic at a better level in the industry, but we won\u2019t do things that will hurt us in the long-term for short-term benefit. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler. Nicole Miller : Thank you and good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the marketing spend embedded within guidance and also, more specifically, the message. I am thinking around Olive Garden, which has been about more about brand equity than any call to action in terms of price point. So what are you thinking in terms of marketing? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Hi, Nicole. We don\u2019t expect a significant increase in marketing, maybe within 10 basis points of what we had spent in 2022 as a percent of sales. As we look at Olive Garden, specifically, as Rick mentioned, we are focused on really further strengthening the core equities. So, the advertising, the messaging is going to focus on the brand equity, the never-ending abundance and any message that further enhances that is really what we are focused on. We don\u2019t see a need to do, like Rick said a deep discounted promotion there, but promotions that actually help elevate the brand equity. Nicole Miller : And then just a follow-up and last question, what kind of staffing levels, I mean, I imagine at the two big brands pretty much, where you at, capacity is not the right word, but fully staffed, fully staffed? So what kind of staffing levels are embedded and how does labor inflate, if at all, in 2023? Thanks again. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Nicole, this is Rick. Right now, we have more managers per restaurant than pre-COVID. And so at the manager level, we are really well staffed. We are continuing to add new team members. But as I said, we have 180,000 team members now, which is what we had pre-COVID. So we\u2019re back to the level of our team member staffing from pre-COVID. That said, we still have pockets of restaurants that can improve their staffing levels, just like at pre-COVID. So we still have restaurants that could have a little bit more staffing level. But in general, we\u2019re staffed right where we were before COVID. Raj Vennam : And then just on the inflation, labor inflation hourly wage is around 8%, and total labor is somewhere around 6%ish is what we have embedded in the guidance. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Jeff Farmer, Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Jeff Farmer : Great. Good morning. Thank you. So it looks like LongHorn\u2019s average weekly sales are up more than 25% versus pre-COVID levels. Olive Garden sales are up about 5%. I\u2019m just curious what your view is in terms of the factors that have contributed to that large gap in sales growth across the two concepts over the last couple of years? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Jared, this is Rick. Thanks for noticing how strong LongHorn\u2019s performance has been and the fact that Olive Garden is still up versus pre-COVID. I will start by saying, if you think about what we started at LongHorn and reducing the dependence on price point and promotions on advertising, we did that before COVID, and we had almost finished before COVID started. And throughout COVID, they continue to make significant investments in their food, and the quality of their food and have improved their overall execution in the restaurants. So they have had a great run of sales over the last couple of years versus pre-COVID because of the things that we did going into COVID and that we continued during COVID. Olive Garden started that process a little bit later, right? Olive Garden before COVID was still doing significant discounting and price-pointed promotions. We had started to wind off of some of those, but we still had quite a few of them. In addition, remember, we\u2019re significantly below our pre-COVID levels in marketing at Olive Garden. And that was driving some guest count that we think weren\u2019t as profitable as the guest counts that we\u2019re getting today. So the marketing that we\u2019ve done has helped. The marketing we\u2019re doing today is still driving some traffic, but it\u2019s driving the guests, our core guests that come to us because of the everyday value. And finally, I want to say Olive Garden\u2019s margins are really strong. So while their sales may not be as strong as pre-COVID as LongHorn, they have made a huge improvement in their business model and have the best margins basically in casual dining, which gives us flexibility to do the things we need to do going forward if we need to. Jeff Farmer : That\u2019s helpful. And just a quick follow-up, you touched on this, but with that steep decline in consumer confidence, is there a relationship between that decline in consumer confidence and just sort of a softening of consumer health versus your job applicant flow, the pace of hiring, we just talked about staffing levels, but as the consumer comes under a little bit more pressure, has that actually been a little bit of a silver lining in terms of hire? Rick Cardenas : Well, we\u2019ve seen our applicant flow growth grow over time, even before you started to see the decline in consumer sentiment. As the beginning of the fiscal \u2013 as the beginning of the calendar year started, we had mentioned in our last call that we have seen significant applicant flow, and that\u2019s helping us on kind of leveling off our wage inflation over time. But \u2013 So I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the exact relationship. But as consumer confidence wanes and maybe people feel a little less comfortable in an environment, they\u2019d be more likely to come back into the job market. And that would be a good thing for us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now move on to our next question from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Just wondering if you can give us some color on the near-term comp trends just so we can assess that consumer sentiment slowdown, whether there was any change in trajectory by brand, perhaps through the fiscal fourth quarter into June, or change in purchasing patterns. I think you mentioned maybe a little bit of mix shift down at Cheddar\u2019s, but just wondering if you can give some color on other brands or as compared to traffic. Just trying to get a sense for whether there is any early indication across the broader portfolio of a sign of perhaps slowing consumer spending. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jeffrey. I want to talk about the trends throughout the quarter. And if you think about our comps throughout the quarter, they stayed strong, and they actually continue to build from March, April to May. But the industry actually started to see some declines from March, April to May in same-restaurant sales. I want to be clear on the check and a little bit of the check management at Cheddar\u2019s, it\u2019s not dramatic. It\u2019s small. We\u2019re not seeing it at our other brands as much. Actually, we\u2019re not seeing it at our other brands. But I also \u2013 the point that I made about the mix of consumers at the lower end of the spectrum, that\u2019s across all of our brands. It\u2019s not just at Cheddar\u2019s. So it\u2019s across all of our brands. Just to give everybody some comfort about \u2013 not comfort, but just talk about the quarter, the industry sales have slowed from May to June. And we have seen that as well. But some of this might be a return to normal summer seasonality that we didn\u2019t see last year. As the dining rooms reopen and people felt more comfortable, we didn\u2019t see the normal seasonal patterns that we typically do. The industry comps do social softening, but quarter-to-date across our portfolio, we are exceeding the industry and we are within our annual guidance range. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just more broadly, as you think about full year \u201823, it seems like the midpoint of your earnings range would be maybe in the 4%ish range and then the dividend, you mentioned 4%. So 8% total shareholder return seems to be little bit below your 10% to 15% long-term target. I know you mentioned that over a 10-year period, you\u2019re proud to be consistently delivering within that range. But for fiscal \u201823, it doesn\u2019t seem to necessarily be sales-led considering what looks like strong comp growth in the assumptions. And your pricing of 5% is pretty close to the 6% inflation to protect the margins. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can give some color on where you see the shortfall, at least within your own guidance. Again, the sales seem to be strong and it seemed like you\u2019re pricing to protect the margins. So just whether it\u2019s just conservatism or just keen to give a wide range, just trying to get the assessment for where you see the potential earnings shortfall coming from? Raj Vennam : Hey, Jeff, look, we still believe that 10% to 15% is the right target long-term. But however, any given year, that might be different. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re choosing not to pass along all of our inflation to our guests and for a couple of reasons, right? We don\u2019t think all of this cost is permanent. For example, chicken, dairy and wheat, which are a significant portion of our basket, especially at Olive Garden, are highly \u2013 at a very high level right now. We don\u2019t believe that\u2019s very sticky for the long-term. And so we think it\u2019s prudent to be cautious and preserve flexibility rather than pass through these \u2013 some costs that may not be permanent. The other part of this is when you think about comp, our sales growth is mostly driven by the pricing. We mentioned that we have about 5% pricing for the year, and our guidance is 4% to 6% on SRS. So we\u2019re not assuming a significant traffic growth going into the year at the midpoint. And so I will just end by saying, we are really focused on the long-term, and we do not want to overreact to near-term pressures, even if that means that some short-term margin erosion are not able to get our long-term targets in any given year. That all being said, I mean we still have a pretty strong business model. Our margins are well ahead of where we were pre-COVID. Even in the guidance we provided, that implies margin improvement to pre-COVID. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from David Palmer from Evercore. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Helpful color so far. You mentioned the high-income versus middle-income factor and might be \u2013 and that might be a differentiator in the trends and the pricing power lately and even that in the softness we\u2019re seeing through June. I wonder to what degree you think family-oriented visits, that larger party size paid by one person versus the closer to two people, per check is a differentiator as well and as a factor for the Cheddar\u2019s and the Olive Gardens versus the stake in Fine Dining lately? Rick Cardenas : Yes, David, we haven\u2019t really seen a big difference in mix of families with family \u2013 larger families versus smaller families. But what we have seen in the Fine Dining is some of the urban markets are coming back a little bit. And we\u2019re seeing private dining coming back. So those are large parties, too. So they are not necessarily families, but they are large parties. The private dining is coming back in the urban markets in our higher-end brands. But we haven\u2019t seen a real shift down from our families going out to eat, even at Olive Garden Cheddar\u2019s, because family visit at Olive Garden and Cheddar\u2019s is still a lot less expensive than a family visit in other places. So we haven\u2019t seen that change very much. David Palmer : Thank you. And then just on food inflation guidance, the second half, how \u2013 what\u2019s your visibility there? How hedged and contracted are you? And I know you guys are proud of the fact that you guys have a good balance when you have weakness in the top line in the industry, oftentimes, you get some relief. So I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re maybe being less hedged in the second half to allow yourself if the industry does get softer to benefit from that in terms of your food costs, and I\u2019ll pass it on? Raj Vennam : Yes, David. So we are fairly well covered for the first half, but we are choosing to not cover as much for the back half, for we want to stay short given where the trends are and given what we think is likely to happen. So we want to preserve our flexibility should the environment get better on the commodities front. And so you saw that, I think, we shared this morning about 70% coverage for the first half, maybe a little bit north of 75% for the first quarter and the second quarter being closer to that 70% or just under. But we\u2019re fairly covered for the first half. Operator : Our next question today comes from Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Lauren Silberman : Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones. Are you seeing any regional differences in performance across the brands? Rick Cardenas : Hi, Lauren, a little bit of regional differences, but it\u2019s really when we compare to prior year. And it\u2019s really driven by the fact that some parts of the country opened a lot faster last year than others. So we\u2019re seeing some pretty good performance in California because they didn\u2019t have a whole lot of growth last year. We\u2019re seeing some good growth in New England, which, again, was a little bit slower to reopen in the Pacific Northwest. But we are positive in all of our regions. It\u2019s just a little bit \u2013 quite a bit more positive in those that didn\u2019t open as fast last year. Lauren Silberman : Great. And then just on on-premise versus off-premise, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing there at Olive Garden and LongHorn? Where is on-premise traffic running versus pre-COVID? Any color there would be helpful? Rick Cardenas : Yes. Without talking about traffic, I think traffic on to-go is a little bit different because of some of the catering. So we don\u2019t necessarily talk traffic as much as we do on sales. But if you look at our sales versus pre-COVID at both Olive Garden and LongHorn, our sales and to-go are much higher, and they are still higher. But in the fourth quarter, our traffic \u2013 our sales in to-go went down a little bit from the third quarter, partly because the third quarter had Omicron and our in-restaurant sales have actually continued to grow. So as our sales have gone down from Q4 to \u2013 Q3 to Q4, our in-restaurant sales have more than offset that. We\u2019re still seeing strong to-go performance across our two big brands and in Cheddar\u2019s as well. And Olive Garden is still above 25% to go for the quarter, and LongHorn is right at around 15%, which is much higher than they were pre-COVID. Operator : We will now take a question from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. I wanted to revisit how you would approach a downturn in consumer spending if we were to get one. And if I look back to the last major recession we had, Olive Garden clearly held up very well, and LongHorn did not hold up as well in terms of their sales performance. So wondering \u2013 I know that was early days in your ownership of LongHorn. I\u2019m wondering your specific thoughts on LongHorn and would pull for that brand this time around if we do get a downturn versus maybe what was the case last time. Rick Cardenas : Yes, David, this is Rick. Thanks for that. If you think about where we were back in the last downturn, yes, we had just bought LongHorn not too long before that. So we\u2019re still going through integration, through the challenges of integration, and it was our first big acquisition. So there are probably more challenges than we have as we continue to move forward. And as you\u2019ve seen from every acquisition we\u2019ve made since then, we have some initial comp declines in doing so. Olive Garden performed very well for a couple of reasons. One is they are a trusted brand. And as consumers think about their spending during a time where they are minimizing their spending, they go to brands they trust. And that\u2019s something that typically happens in a recession or in something along those lines when people are really trying to figure out where to spend their hard-earned dollar. But Olive Garden was also pricing a little bit during that time. And we want to make sure that we don\u2019t get into that same situation, we overpriced and then run into a challenge a couple of years later, which is what happened with Olive Garden. So what I would also say is the steak category is a great value right now. If you think about what LongHorn has done over the last couple of years, as we\u2019ve said, they have increased the size of most of their steaks. They have increased the quality of most of their steaks, and they are executing their steaks better than they ever have. There is in-restaurant execution of steaks grilled correctly is at record highs for LongHorn. And so consumers see the value in what we put on the plate with cost of sales for every dollar they spend at a steakhouse, they get more food on the plate. So they are starting to see that a little bit better. I can\u2019t tell you what this \u2013 if there is a recession or a slowdown, what consumer is going to be impacted by that. But I can tell you that we\u2019ve done a lot of things over the last years and even since the last recession to strengthen our business models, to strengthen our brands so that we can react in whatever way we need to, depending on what happens. We feel really good about what Olive Garden has done, what LongHorn has done, what all of our brands have done to prepare for anything that could happen to us. David Tarantino : Great, thank you. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit more about any thoughts on the competitive environment this year or assumptions that you have. And if you care to weigh in sort of on whether a more pressured consumer should be a benefit for your business or maybe for larger chains in general just based on some of the commentary you\u2019ve made already. And I don\u2019t know if you want to opine here at all. But as it relates to delivery, given the cost there, in a more challenged environment, is that again something where you may maybe sort of underweight that channel versus some other larger brands, if that could potentially be a benefit for you as well if that\u2019s at all part of your consideration set, if you care away in any of that? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Dennis, this is Rick. The competitive environment is not the same kind of environment that we had before COVID. If you think about what a lot of our competitors have done is to bring in things to drive sales, third-party delivery, kitchens and those things, which actually maybe have done a little bit to hurt their margins. We\u2019ve simplified our operations to improve our margins over time. I think with the margin pressure and inflation pressure that others are seeing, it might be more challenging for someone to do some deep discounting to drive traffic. And so I think you might be right on to something here around if the consumer starts feeling more strapped, will they be willing to pay the kind of rates they have to getting food delivered or they would just decide to go pick it up. And if they do, we have what I believe is the best to-go pick-up experience in casual dining with the investments that we\u2019ve made in technology to make it easier to order, pick up and pay. And we keep making investments in those areas to make it easier for our guests. I think it was about 60% of our total to-go sales were digital, which equates to 10% to 12% of our actual sales completely, whether to-go or not. So we\u2019ve made some great investments to make it easier for our guests to order, pick up and pay. And if that means that the guests that we used to do delivery, in a downturn, they stop doing it, and they still want to get great food at home, they can get ours. Dennis Geiger : Very helpful color, Rick. And I guess just one more as a follow-up on the technology piece. You touched on it then and I think during the prepared remarks, the focus and the investment in technology. Anything you would highlight as it relates to the biggest opportunities for this year on the tech digital side of things be it sales, maybe even some margin efficiency type of initiatives. Anything beyond you can kind of just framed out there? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Dennis. We continue to make investments in technology. Without getting into too much detail for competitive reasons, we continue to strengthen the consumer proposition and eliminate friction for our guests. And that\u2019s something big for us, is to take any friction the guest has out by incorporating technology that\u2019s not directly really in their face, but it takes friction out. But we\u2019re also doing a lot of investments to make the managers\u2019 jobs easier and our team members\u2019 jobs easier, which don\u2019t show up directly at the guest, but it does show up in better execution at the restaurants. So for example, we are using machine learning and AI to do forecasting at our restaurant, and that\u2019s significantly improving our forecast accuracy at the restaurant, so that managers can schedule better, schedule people and guests who are coming into the restaurant and order food more accurately and get food more accurately to reduce waste. So that should help on the efficiency side. But those are things that are kind of not first-level order driving traffic, but it\u2019s things that make our restaurant managers jobs easier, so they can spend more time with their team members to train them and more time with their guests to make them feel special so that people come back. Operator : Thank you. We will now move on to a question from Andrew Charles from Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. My first question, Rick, is just around off-premise, that this is the fourth quarter now where you guys are running off-premise around a 25% to 30% sales range, holding on quite strong and quite sticky as the dine-in business rebounds. But before COVID, you guys were saying that Olive Garden could be a 20%-plus off-premise sales mix. Do you think just given the recent stickiness and strength of that, that it\u2019s more likely we will see this hang in around 25% plus? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Andrew. We are running at 25% plus now at Olive Garden. And we have said throughout COVID that we expect our off-premise sales as a percent to be higher than they were pre-COVID and probably higher than the 20%. We\u2019re still not quite at equilibrium yet. And we want to make sure that we get to equilibrium before we kind of give a new goal. But I will say that we expect it to be higher than it was pre-COVID, and we expect it to be higher than that initial kind of 20% goal, mainly because of the investments that we\u2019ve made, and what a great job our team members do to make sure that their guests get their food on time and it\u2019s accurate. Those are very important qualities for our to-go experience, and we\u2019re making some more investments for the guests to understand whether food is in the process and things like that to hopefully keep our To-Go business at the higher end of that range, while our dining rooms continue to build. But when we get to equilibrium, we will have a better idea. Andrew Charles : Great, thanks. And then can you guys compare kind of a historical target for 10% to 15% total shareholder return, just given that now we\u2019re seeing two consecutive years of top line in excess of that target and margins that are probably not going to make that 10 to 30 basis points expansion. Recognize that 10% plus is still the target here, how would you say the factors are going to be different, just given this is the second consecutive year of the dynamics that we are seeing. Raj Vennam : Yes. I mean, look, given the uncertainty environment this is probably no the best time to update the components of the framework. We still believe 10% to 15% is the right target. How we get there will vary year-to-year. And again, this is a long-term target. This is not a 1-year target. And so when we have a better \u2013 when we get to a better place, maybe use Rick\u2019s word of equilibrium, we will put something out there that incorporates all of that and our assumptions going forward that will lever the components of how we get to 10% to 15%. Operator : We will now take our question from Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Raj, can you help us understand how sensitive margin performance is to various levels of comp sales? And I would assume that relationship is not linear. So at what point do you see a meaningful margin degradation if you experience softness in consumer spending? Raj Vennam : Chris, I think I would kind of point back to the comment Rick made earlier about thinking about comp without the context of cost mix is not the best way to think. Because we think that they move in tandem, maybe there is a little bit of a lag. But if the consumer environment gets really soft, that should kind of make its way into inflation being less than we have and the cost pressures being less than we have. So, it\u2019s not a pretty straightforward linear equation. And obviously, I think what we say is you saw how our teams kind of remain flexible and figure out how to work through the environment, whatever environment we operate in. And so I will just reiterate that we are going to stay disciplined, and we are going to not overreact to near-term pressures, but focus on making sure we are making the right bets for the long-term and operate the best way we can in the environment that we are dealt. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thank you. And then I had a follow-up on the commodity outlook. What\u2019s giving you confidence that you could see some relief in some of the key commodity costs beyond fiscal \u2013 the first half of the year or fiscal 1Q at least? Are there specific factors that you are aware of that make that scenario more likely, or is it driven by macro outlook for the consumer like you just mentioned that maybe that cooling demand helps commodity prices? Just trying to get some understanding or what gives you confidence you could see flat inflation in the back half \u2013 or in the fourth quarter? Raj Vennam : Yes. Sure. So, here is what I think the way we think about it is, one, first of all, you got to remember the wrap on how high they were this year. Second quarter \u2013 I mean third quarter this year was 11% and the fourth quarter was 12%. And we are wrapping on those. And fourth quarter this year was wrapping on 4.5% a year ago. So, on a 2-year basis, when you look at where we were for the fourth quarter, we were about 16.5%, 17%. So, next year first quarter or this Q1 in FY \u201823, we are starting high. So, one, that\u2019s the dynamic that we take into consideration, right, where are the levels of pricing and what are we wrapping on. When you look at it through that lens, we expect that to get better. The second piece is we are starting to see, in some specific products, the price is breaking a little bit from the elevated levels they have been, right. So, whether it\u2019s beef that\u2019s come down a little bit, even chicken, for instance, is not at the highest levels it\u2019s been recently, so it\u2019s starting to come down a little bit. The other factor we have is what happens with the fall harvest on the grain side. So, we do expect, right now, we think from the information we have, better harvest season, and that should help a little bit with the grain. So, these are all factors we are taking into consideration. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but this is our best estimate at this point. Operator : Thank you. We will move on to our next question from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Thank you and good morning. First, Rick, just on pricing on the 5%, can you just reconcile where you think the industry is on pricing? So, how much your pricing you think below not just inflation, but also your competitors\u2019. And just more broadly, how do you think about pricing on a portfolio basis? Are you pricing to each brand\u2019s relative inflation, or are you willing to take more pricing at certain brands where you just think there is more or less elasticity, so you get it. And therefore, we shouldn\u2019t think about it as a brand-to-brand, but as sort of on a portfolio basis. Is that how you think about pricing? Rick Cardenas : Yes, John, I will answer the second part of your question, and I will give Raj to answer to the first part of the question. So, when you think about pricing across our portfolio, one of the biggest benefits of Darden is we have got a portfolio and we serve a lot of different consumers. And so our pricing will be different depending on the brand and depending on kind of the consumer that they serve. And so we would expect our pricing to be closer to inflation at the brands that can support that, which are more likely the brands at the higher end of the consumer spectrum, and our pricing to be below inflation at the brands that we want to protect their value. And those brands are more like the casual brands, specifically Olive Garden and Cheddar\u2019s, who have made significant business model improvement so that we can go ahead and take a little less pricing than inflation. So, that\u2019s the way we think about pricing. We look at the inflation rates those brands are seeing as well and see what kind of level of pricing we would like to take. But generally, generally, we would price our higher-end brands or more affluent consumer that can absorb some of that pricing and is a little less elastic than we would on the lower-end brands. And I will let Raj talk about the competitive pricing. Raj Vennam : Hey John, I will start with the broader macro overall FSR CPI. This is not new to you guys. You know this last published data from last month was 9% on a 1-year basis and over 12% or 13% close to on a 2-year basis. And then when you look at the breakdown of that, from what we understand, the chains are taking less than the independents. So, when we look at our closest competitors, they are probably close to that 6% range between 5% to 6%, depending on who you are looking at, but the average is closer to 6%. But then these are larger chains. But the small chains and independents is where you are seeing double-digit pricing. Again, that\u2019s the competitive intel we have. So, with that said, you asked a question about flexibility we have. I think part of what we have said all along has been that we want to be under pricing until we feel like certain things are permanent, and then we start to slowly increase that. We feel great about the pricing level that we have because, especially when you look at it versus where the overall industry is and where our nearest competitors are, we are better. And then actually we are even better when you look at it on a 2-year basis. And so really, that\u2019s kind of what drives us. But also, it does give us some flexibility should there be a need. And that\u2019s what we are trying to do is protect ourselves, preserve our flexibility. And if there is a need and if we feel like we can pass through some more, we will do that. John Glass : Thank you. What is the impact of inflation then on the build cost of new restaurants? Anecdotally, some smaller chains have talked about a pretty material increase in construction costs of new builds. So, what is your view on that in 2023? [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Kevin, I believe your line might be on mute. Raj Vennam : Sorry. Thank you. So, I was saying the construction costs, we are seeing about, call it, low-double digit increase in construction costs. And when we look at our overall returns, because of the business model improvements we have made through COVID, we are still getting pretty strong returns. In fact, I would argue, our returns are better today than they were even before COVID even with the increased construction costs because of the improved margins. With that said, we are starting to see the costs not continue to go up as much. So, we are starting to see that rate of change start to kind of plateau, if you will. And then what we are doing is trying to find opportunities to kind of do conversions that can help save a few hundred thousand dollars on a build, right, $0.5 million to $600,000 if we kind of take an existing shell and convert that. And so we have been doing some of that at our brands. So, we are trying to find ways to manage through that, but the costs are still pretty elevated. Operator : And we will now move on to our next question from Jon Tower from Citi. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks. I appreciate for taking the question. First, on the inflation side, I think we hit pricing quite a bit earlier, but I am curious to dive into the idea of during COVID, you were able to find quite a few productivity enhancements across the portfolio. And I am just curious to know if there is any more opportunity there should, say, inflation persists above and beyond what your expectations are currently for the year. Rick Cardenas : Hey Jon, this is Rick. Yes, you mentioned that over the last few years, our brands have done a great job simplifying their operation and with significant productivity enhancements. We are going to continue to look for more. I will say, during the last year, we had significant training costs that, as we continue to ramp up people, we would hope that the training dollars would go down. It wouldn\u2019t be the same kind of level of productivity enhancements that we had before during COVID, but there should be some enhancements to help mitigate a little bit of the wage inflation, but not enough to offset the wage inflation. Jon Tower : And then just following up, I think earlier in the call, you talked about the company\u2019s core competitive advantages and particularly highlighted the scale, and the company\u2019s balance sheet has some significant advantages versus the industry. So, I am curious how would you see yourselves taking advantage of that, particularly in an environment where you might see some closures of independents and/or some of your smaller competitors needing to slow down growth. I am just curious, in the past I believe you have used these slowdowns as an opportunity to find some of the best real estate in the industry. How are you thinking about taking advantage of a potential macro slowdown? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jon, we continue to look for more real estate, especially if the macro environment slows down for the smaller competitors. I would say there are some industry estimates that, this coming up fiscal year will have no net unit growth. We are growing units. And so that could give us some more opportunities to find some sites. We have, I think we mentioned in our guidance, 55 to 60 new openings this year, which is a lot higher than the 37 net we had the year that just ended. And that we will continue to try to get more to that level of growth in units. And we have the balance sheet and the cash position to do that. And just as importantly, we have got the leadership pipeline that we have been developing to get people ready to open those restaurants. So, we feel like putting the \u2013 stepping the \u2013 putting our foot on the gas on unit growth, which is what we have always said, we have been saying that for a couple of years, is something we would do, but not to slam the accelerator down. We will continue to be measured in our unit growth and our goal would be to get to the higher end of our sales from new units in the framework that we had announced before. Operator : Our next question today comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Andrew Strelzik : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I will just ask one, and I wanted to follow-up on the food inflation and the coverage question, and I understand why you don\u2019t want to be as covered for the back half of the year. But the question is really about the ability to get coverage further out should you have wanted to go that route. Is that getting any easier with some of the broader demand uncertainties if you wanted to do that? Are those conversations or the asks to extend further out getting any better, even if that hasn\u2019t totally converged maybe with your expectations. Raj Vennam : Yes. I think it\u2019s the price certainty is the pace that is a little bit of an issue, right. When you talk to our \u2013 so the coverage, yes, you can get the product coverage, but we are trying to get a product coverage with price certainty. And that\u2019s where we still don\u2019t believe \u2013we are still not in a place where that is in a great place for the back half. As we look at what the suppliers think we should be paying and what we believe we should be paying, there is a disparity there. And that\u2019s really why we don\u2019t see it \u2013 we don\u2019t feel like we need to do anything right now and just have that optionality. Andrew Strelzik : But I guess the spread or with some of the demand uncertainties you have spoken about now, maybe some cracks here or there, maybe the view on the other side of that conversation isn\u2019t the same. But has the spread narrowed at all even if it hasn\u2019t converged all the way, or it\u2019s still kind of stayed the same? Raj Vennam : Yes, for sure. Yes. Things are \u2013 yes, the spread has narrowed, but again, our expectations are going down even more, right. So, I think that\u2019s part of the discussion here. So, it\u2019s not \u2013 yes. Operator : We will now take a question from Brett Levy, MKM Partners. Brett Levy : Rick, thanks for taking my question. Just going back on the development side, you talked about the willingness to grow and an ability to grow, but you also talked about not wanting to get too far ahead. Where do you see the greatest opportunities within the brands right now? And also just from a net flat growth environment out there and a strong balance sheet, how are you thinking about supplementing the current portfolio with additional brands? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Brett, we would like to see all of our brands continue to grow. At the more specialty brands, those sites are specific, and we want to make sure we have the great sites for them. So, it just depends on when a great site comes available. We may have some higher growth in 1 year and maybe a little bit lower growth in the next year. But for more casual brands, we would like to continue to see that ramp up versus the year before. And the fact that we are going from 37 to 55 to 60 should tell you that most of our brands are going to see an acceleration in unit growth. As it relates to your second part of your question on M&A, I will say that our biggest competitive advantage is what we talked about is our scale. And one way to build on that is to do an acquisition. And so we will continue to speak with our Board and use our strong balance sheet and our cash position to evaluate any alternative to allocate that capital. But we do believe that we have the ability to do both, to increase the number of units that we are building and to do M&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. Actually as a perfect follow-up to Brett\u2019s question, on the M&A side, I guess where are we in that spectrum? I mean you have announced $1 billion for buyback, which could presumably be used for M&A. You do have borrowing capacity, at least looking at what your investment-grade credit rating is. I mean in terms of, I guess Darden kind of being excited and being in the market and being proactive looking for things versus sellers that, in all reality, will have to accept the price for their business today that was very different than 6 months or 12 months ago. I mean I guess how maybe you want to talk about it in this term, hopefully, it\u2019s a fair question. I guess how close are we to a deal that really could matter relative maybe to some previous periods? How are the stars lining up or not lining up? Is that something could maybe get done in the near-term versus longer term? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Hi John, I can\u2019t tell you if we are closer or farther away from now versus where we were before. As equity prices move quickly and on the downward trend, so you got to get to what\u2019s a fair valuation level for the seller. And so I can\u2019t tell you if we are there yet or not. I can tell you that we will continue to evaluate, and we would like to continue to build our scale, and M&A is one way to do that. But when we do a deal, everybody will know. And we are always talking to our Board about M&A and the best ways to allocate our capital. John Ivankoe : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks. Very helpful call so far this morning, so thank you. Just wanted to come back to the conversation around the consumer, in the past recessions, I think you have seen a trade down at Olive Garden and some of the brands with trading down with fewer appetizers, desserts, strengths and maybe in some instances, consumers trading out of entrees into appetizers as their main meal. It doesn\u2019t sound like you have seen any of that at some of the core brands clearly at Olive Garden. I just want to confirm that. And two, Rick, I would just love to get your opinion on the probability of a recession or the consumer outlook, given where you sit and what you see in the environment right now? Rick Cardenas : Hi Peter, to answer the first part of your question, we haven\u2019t really seen a lot of check management at any of our brands. We have seen a little bit at Cheddar\u2019s. But part of that is because they also introduced a great limited-time value stake, which might have mean people were trading away from appetizers to the stake on their menu, which is a T-bone, at a very great value compared to the competition. But we had seen some management of check at Cheddar\u2019s. In regards to the probability of a recession, I am not an economist. I can tell you what the economists are saying, and they are saying somewhere in the 40% range. At least some of them are saying that over the next 12 months. I can tell you, we will be prepared for that if and when it comes. I would hope to not see one. But if we do, we are going to be prepared. And I think we are better prepared than most of the people we compete with because of the margin differential that we have versus them and what we have done over the last few years to simplify our menus and what we have done to make sure our restaurants are fully staffed. And I would say one last thing is, if you think about our management turnover in our restaurants, it\u2019s significantly below the industry. So, they have seen more things than others have. Maybe they haven\u2019t seen a recession, but they have seen what happens when guest counts turn soft for even if it\u2019s a month, maybe others haven\u2019t. So, we are going to be better prepared, we believe, to handle. Plus, we have got great everyday value. You think about what we have done over the last couple of years in pricing below inflation and pricing below our competition, that means our value differential continues to grow. And we have got, I think what\u2019s a great place, we have got Olive Garden, which is an iconic brand that people trust that has improved our value. We have got Cheddar\u2019s, which we didn\u2019t have in the last time there was a recession, that\u2019s the value leader in casual dining. So, while I can\u2019t tell you what the probability of a recession is, I can tell you, I believe that we are well prepared to deal with whatever comes our way. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we will now move on to a question from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to circle back on your industry sales comment that you mentioned about June slowing a bit. Could you help us level set the magnitude of slowing that we have seen within casual dining over the last few weeks? It\u2019s just a little difficult of those, given the Father\u2019s Day shift, if you are trying to compare back to \u201819, also some differences in the year-on-year compares, I think moving through May and June as the industry recovered last year. So, any help there would be much appreciated. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Brian, when I talked about the kind of the sequential slowdown, it was versus prior year, so not worrying about pre-COVID. The only comment I had about pre-COVID was the seasonality differences. But you are right, Father\u2019s Day is something, but we are going up against the same week last year in Father\u2019s Day. So, Father\u2019s Day to Father\u2019s Day should have been the same. And we talk about magnitude, it\u2019s a couple of hundred basis points of the industry. It\u2019s not like the industry went negative completely, but it\u2019s closer to flat than it was before in the month of May. Brian Vaccaro : Okay. Great. And then circling back on the consumer, how do you break it down? You talked about the low income versus other income categories and seeing differences in behavior. Could you just update us on what percentage of your guests or sales are from the low versus middle or upper-income consumer for Olive Garden and LongHorn, however you kind of bracket that out? Rick Cardenas : Yes. I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail on the percent of our guests that are at the low end. The lower end consumer typically would be more of an Olive Garden consumer or Cheddar\u2019s consumer, more likely a Cheddar\u2019s consumer. And it makes up a portion of their guests, but not a majority of their guests. But the other thing is, remember, we have got a portfolio of brands that impact every segment of the economy and all the different economic stratifications of guests. So, we feel like we have got the ability to deal with whatever comes our way, as I said, and would \u2013 but don\u2019t want to give you the specific percentage of those consumers. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, as we have no further questions, that concludes our Q&A session today. And I would like to hand back to Kevin Kalicak for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you. That concludes our call. I would like to remind you that we plan to release our first quarter results on Thursday, September 22, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks again for participating in today\u2019s call. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Jake. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings on Friday, December 16, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing first quarter performance as a comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and our focus moving forward and Raj will provide details on our financial results. Now, I will turn the call over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our press release, we had a solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging inflationary and uncertain macroeconomic environment. This was also the first quarter where we began to see the industry return to normal seasonal patterns. I'm proud of the way our restaurant teams are performing. Our brands remain focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere, while at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Our people bring our brands to life every day, and our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level, even with a lot of new team members as our staffing has returned to normal levels. Our team's ability to be brilliant with the basics is driving strong guest satisfaction across our brands. These satisfaction measures at Olive Garden are at or near all-time highs, and steaks grilled correctly scores at LongHorn Steakhouse are the highest in their history. We remain focused on creating great learning environments for new team members to ensure they are fully trained and execute to our standards. Further, our ongoing investments in our team members helps reinforce our strong employment proposition. This focus takes on added significance as we open value creating new restaurants, which further strengthens our scale advantage. During the quarter, we successfully staffed and opened nine new restaurants and we remain on track to open 55 to 60 new restaurants this fiscal year. We also continue to invest in our digital platform and To Go sales benefited from these investments during the quarter. To Go sales accounted for 24% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% at LongHorn Steakhouse and 13% at Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Digital transactions accounted for 32% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 10% of Darden's total sales. Our technology investments have created an infrastructure that reduces friction for our guests and our operators, and we will continue to invest in technology that benefits both off-premise and in-restaurant dining occasions. We are also leveraging our scale to help mitigate the impact of heightened inflation. During the quarter, we continued to experience significant commodities cost pressure, and our supply chain team did an excellent job of working with the suppliers to minimize or offset cost increases to the extent possible. Inflation remains a headwind for consumers as well, particularly those in households making less than $50,000 a year. Olive Garden and Cheddar's have more direct exposure to these guests. Looking at guest behavior across our entire portfolio, we are seeing softness with these consumers, while conversely, we are seeing strength with guests and higher income households. Even in this environment, our brands are made committed to our strategy to price below their competitors. Since we emerged from the height of the pandemic, you have heard us talk about the search for equilibrium or more normal business trends. During the quarter, we saw a return to historical seasonal patterns which we did not experience last year. As we have discussed in recent calls, finding that equilibrium will inform our brand's marketing strategies. As we execute our plans, we will be very selective in bringing any promotional activity back. And any promotional activity we introduced should be evaluated with the following filters. First, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations, which allows our teams to consistently deliver exceptional guest experiences. And finally, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing that in a way that drives profitable sales growth. As an example, Olive Garden's unique competitive advantage is never ending abundant craveable Italian food. That is why the television advertising progressed from spots that feature their never ending first course to those that are now focused on they're made from scratch sauces and anything they do going forward should continue to elevate this core brand equity. I am pleased with the progress our teams made executing against their strategic priorities during the quarter. Our strategy is working, enabling us to grow sales, increase market share and invest in our people and our brands all while continuing to earn -- to return capital to our shareholders. Last month, we held our annual leadership conferences, which provide a powerful way for us to engage with every general manager and managing partner across all 1,875 restaurants. These restaurant leaders hold the most influential role in our company and the opportunity to interact with them and listen to those closest to the action is invaluable. Our leaders return to their restaurants aligned to their brands operational priorities and motivated to continue winning. In order to win, we must stay focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy and leveraging our four competitive advantages as we continue working in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. Our guests, our team members and the communities where we operate. One of the ways, we serve our communities is by fighting hunger. Once again this year, Darden is helping Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 10 member food banks to support mobile pantry programs and food distribution in communities with the highest need. With the addition of these new trucks, 25 different food banks have received a truck since January of last year. Of course, our philanthropic giving would not be possible without the passion our restaurant teams have for nourishing and delighting our guests. On behalf of our leadership team and our Board of Directors, I want to thank our 180,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guests and communities. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We had strong absolute results in the first quarter and continue to be pleased with the efforts of our restaurant and support center teams to drive sales, effectively manage spending and navigate a challenging environment. We're lapping record first quarter performance from last year, which was driven by a resurgence in demand, more efficient labor with staffing levels below our standards and many other costs that had yet to be reintroduced into the business as we recovered from the impacts of the pandemic. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.4 billion, 6.1% higher than last year and driven by 4.2% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56. Total EBITDA was $340 million, and we paid $150 million in dividends and repurchased $199 million in shares, returning a total of $349 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter. In the first quarter, total inflation was roughly 9.5% and total pricing was approximately 6.5%, almost 300 basis points below inflation. We expect total inflation and our gap between pricing and inflation to have peaked in the first quarter. We also expect inflation to moderate throughout the remainder of the year while our pricing gap should narrow in both the first and -- I'm sorry, both the second and third quarter and then reverts in the fourth quarter. And while we have commodities inflation risk in the back half of the year, we have pricing plans ready to put into action, which will help preserve our targeted gap to inflation for the year if we see inflation higher than our expectations. Consistent with what we expected and communicated in the June call, the significant level of pricing below inflation pressured all aspects of our P&L in the first quarter and drove margins well below last year. As we look to the second quarter, we expect margins to decline less than they did in the first quarter and then grow versus last year in the back half. Now looking at the details of the P&L compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 280 basis points higher, driven by commodities inflation of 15%. Restaurant labor was 50 basis points above last year, driven by hourly wage inflation of just over 9% and wrapping on last year's elevated productivity. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7.5%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points above last year, driven by higher repairs and maintenance expense due to supply chain challenges and utilities inflation of 16%. Marketing spend was 20 basis points higher as we increased testing of both digital and television marketing. G&A expense was 130 basis points below last year, driven primarily by two factors. First, mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation plans was lower by about $7 million and as a reminder, this -- due to the way we hedge this expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Second, equity compensation expense related to retirement eligible individuals and our incentive accrual, while both in line with our plan were significantly less than last year. Operating income margin of 10% was 220 basis points below last year, but 60 basis points above pre-COVID levels. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%, and we ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $194 million. Now looking at our segments. All of our segments outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. And as Rick mentioned, we began seeing a return to normal seasonal sales patterns. This was evident in our monthly same-restaurant sales compared to last year when we did not experience typical seasonal softness. Same-restaurant sales for June were in the mid-3% range. July was in the low 1% range, and they were approximately 8% in August. Sales at Olive Garden were 3.7% above last year, and average weekly sales were 101% of the pre-COVID level despite the significant reduction in promotional activity and couponing versus that time period. As we talked about in the past, we believe the pre-COVID marketing and promotional activities historically drove double-digit traffic. And when we look at our average weekly traffic at Olive Garden, we're retaining over 90% of pre-COVID indicating that traffic trends are flat to above pre-COVID levels when considering historical marketing activities. LongHorn sales were 6.6% above last year, and average weekly sales were 126% of the pre-COVID level. Sales in our Fine Dining segment were 8.6% above last year, and average weekly sales were 120% of the pre-COVID levels. Our other segment sales were 9.9% above last year, and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-COVID levels. Despite all of our segments having higher sales above last year, the high levels of inflation and wrapping on last year's inflated earnings when many costs had not fully returned to the business, pressured segment profit margin below last year for all the segments. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We reiterated all aspects of our guidance in this morning's press release, culminating in diluted net earnings per share between $7.40 and $8 for the year. Finally, looking at the second quarter, we've seen continued strength in our sales trends with quarter-to-date sales above the high end of our annual same-restaurant sales outlook range. We also expect commodities inflation close to 13%, pressuring the second quarter EPS to be flat to slightly below last year. In what continues to be an unpredictable year, we're confident with the underlying strength of our business model and in our team's ability to effectively manage through it. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll begin with Brian Mullan with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Mullan : Hey. Thank you. Rick, in the prepared remarks, you referenced seeing some continued softness with the lower income consumers with the most exposure at Cheddar's and Olive Garden. Just to the degree you'd be able to comment, is that consumer feeling incrementally more pressure than they were when we heard from you three months ago or does it feel more stable to you right now? It would just be helpful to hear your thoughts given all the crosscurrents. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Brian. Thanks for the question. The consumer at the below $50,000 is feeling a little bit worse than maybe before, but gas prices are helping. So if you think about that consumer at $50,000 a year and below, gas prices make up a big portion of their income. And actually, that consumer spends more money on gas per person than any other income group above them. So as gas prices came down, they started feeling a little bit better, but we'll see what happens with gas prices going forward. And if I can clarify one other thing that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I said that To Go sales were 32% -- I'm sorry, digital sales were 32% To Go of off-premise. They were actually 62%. So sorry about that. Brian Mullan : Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up question on marketing. You did touch on how you'll approach it from here, if you were to bring it back. But if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit on how you will approach that. I know the goal is to make sure you're driving restaurant profit dollars for the organization. But maybe from a capability perspective or from how you measure ROI, is there anything different going forward than maybe how you would have did this three or four years ago as you bring it back -- if you do bring it back? Rick Cardenas : Yeah. I'm not going to get into detail on if we're bringing it back. As I did say in the prepared remarks, if and when they introduce promotional activity, it should elevate brand equity in which we've been doing for the last year or so at Olive Garden, it should be simple to execute and not be at a deep discount. Our goal with anything we do promotional activity or anything else we do to drive sales is profitable sales growth and we have ways to measure ROI. The things that we learned through COVID and even -- and we knew before when LongHorn started to reduce their kind of limited time offer price point, deep discounted promotions is there was a lot of work involved in getting items that we don't usually have in the restaurant, getting that through the supply chain, training it. And so there were a lot of costs there. And so as we think about future potential kind of communication methods and the way we talk about our products and promote, as I said, is going to be things that don't make it more complicated, much more complicated in the restaurant, but it has to focus on our brand equities and not be a deep discount. Operator : We'll now move to our next question, which will come from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, just on the near-term results. I'm just wondering how did the actual comp and earnings compare to internal expectation for the first quarter. And as you think about fiscal 2023, I know the guidance was unchanged, but it would seem like the lower end more likely in a slowing macro. I'm just wondering whether we're missing something in terms of your expectation for a comp reacceleration or more significant inflation easing or more cost savings. Just trying to get a sense for the first quarter relative to the rest of the year? Raj Vennam : Hi, Jeff. This is Raj. So when we think about our plan and our actual internal expectations and our estimate, we're basically just -- told the board that we're basically back on plan. We're really in line with our internal expectations. As we look specifically at the quarter, was there a little bit of a miss on the sales side? Yes, but not as big as you guys might think. And then overall, profitability was in line and actually slightly ahead. But again, quarter-to-quarter, there is some volatility. As the quarter started or as the year started, we started to see the seasonality return to normal and that was really one of the things that changed how we thought about the business. And if you look at versus pre-COVID, how we trended, the traffic retention was actually pretty similar in Q1 to the way it was in Q4. So there's a lot of noise when you look at year-over-year because of the reopening last year and especially if you think about California that reopened in the middle of June or late June that helped Olive Garden and, to some extent, Yard House, you're wrapping on those levels. So that's why there's a lot of noise year-over-year. But I think the best way to look at it is versus pre-COVID. And when we look at it through that lens, Q1 was actually, like I said, pretty consistent with the performance we had in Q4. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just to follow up, the comps. I think you mentioned in August, you were running roughly or you ran roughly 8%. That seems like a significant acceleration versus the June and July, and I think you said in September, you're running above the 4% to 6% that you guided for the full year. So I'm just wondering if you can share any thoughts in terms of why you think you saw such a sharp reacceleration versus maybe June and July, I didn't know if it's just all that compares on a multi-year basis or maybe, Rick, as you mentioned, the easing gas price is helping. Just trying to get your thoughts on the reacceleration and your directional assumption for the rest of the year. Thank you. Raj Vennam : Yeah. I think I would, again, go back to the reference to pre-COVID. And if you actually look at it through that lens, you're going to find that August, while year-over-year was higher, it wasn't that big of an increase versus pre-COVID. Is there a movement of a point or two between the month-to-month when you look at it versus pre-COVID? Yes. But in general, we're actually fairly consistent, and I think it's just -- I know it's hard because it's three years ago, but that's really the baseline you got to look at. If you look at it through that lens, our cadence actually looks pretty reasonable. It doesn't look like there's a huge acceleration. Now, there are some specific things related to unique -- in the promotional activity for the brand that when we wrap on that, the pre-COVID retention might be a little different. And that is part of how we look at it, and we take that into consideration as we estimate the business. And that's where you see the retention may be a little bit different month-to-month because of the promotional activity we might be wrapping on versus pre-COVID. But when you exclude that, in general, it's actually been fairly consistent and our estimate essentially assumes that going forward. Operator : We'll now move to our next question, which will come from John Glass, Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Thanks very much, and good morning. Rick, first of all, can you just talk about the competitive intensity, promotional intensity in the industry. Everyone presumably is seeing the same pressure on the low-end consumer. So are you seeing more of competitive activity, versus I heard some of your competitors talk about reducing promotional activity just to repair their margins. So there's a lot of crosscurrents here. How do you perceive what's going on in the industry from a competitive intensity standpoint right now? Rick Cardenas : Yeah. We aren't seeing a lot of significant promotional activity. Other than a couple out there, there's one brand out there doing an all you can eat promotion that they did before COVID at the same price point. There's another brand out there doing an all you can eat promotion at a much significantly higher price point than pre-COVID. But I think you mentioned it, margins are challenged in a lot of these competitors. And so the ability for them to do significant discounted promotions to drive traffic may not be something that they do. Now, if food costs come way down, they might start talking about promotions and price points. But the margins that you see out there versus pre-COVID might make it a little bit harder for them to do some significant deep discounting. John Glass : That's great. And then you talked about your own low-end consumer, particularly at Olive Garden being under pressure. Do you intend to target those consumers to stimulate the return to your restaurants or do you view this as like, look, right now, they're not probably dining out as much and so no matter what you do, it doesn't really change their outlook on dining? How do you think about recapturing those visits? Rick Cardenas : Yeah. I think a couple of things. One is, let's not read into it that we're seeing a huge, huge reduction in that consumer. We're seeing a little bit of change in the behavior from that consumer, but not huge. And so we don't want to change what we do just to capture a segment of the population. We want to continue to focus on what we've been doing, especially at Olive Garden is to earn one more visit from our loyal guests. And our loyal guests span a lot of income levels. And so anything we do is going to help drive more loyalty from our existing guests, whether they are at below $50,000 or above $50,000. Remember, we said that $50,000 income consumers make up a portion of Olive Garden, but it's not a majority. And so, a majority of our consumers still are above that, and that consumer, especially above $100,000 is doing very well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now take a question from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Jared Garber : Great. Thank you for the question. Raj, I wanted to ask about the commodity inflation and the outlook maybe from here for the next three months to six months. I think you said there's some risk in the back half of the year. And it seems like maybe the second quarter inflation guide is a bit higher than what we have been expecting based, I guess, on some recent commentary. So, wanted to just get a sense of what you're seeing and how you're contracting forward, and then maybe when we can start expecting maybe some inflation easing, particularly on beef, I think we've seen some easing in the inflationary environment on some of the costs there. So, I just wanted to get a sense of how you're planning for that to flow through throughout the year. Thanks. Raj Vennam : Yes, Jared. I think, first of all, I want to remind you that the commodities inflation, when we talk about inflation is really a function of what we purchased last year at what price. And for us, I'll take one great example is, we had a great chicken contract. I think we were buying boneless chicken breast in the range of, call it, mid-$1 range and as you all know, I think over two, three months ago, the price of that was as much as $3.50. And I think this week, it's come down to almost $1.80, $1.85, right? So, it's come down a lot. The pricing level, we are definitely seeing the movement in the right direction. But we had expected some of that to happen as we guided. And in fact, directionally, things are moving consistent with what we expected, maybe not as quite as fast as we thought. But it's not that far off. I mean our commodities inflation for the year -- at the beginning of the year, we said we're around 7%. We're probably looking at closer to 7.5%, but that's not a huge change given the volatility we've had in the market. But as we get to the back half, we do wrap on some of these elevated costs. And so, as we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do expect, as we get into Q3, to be more in that mid-single digit range. And as we get to Q4, probably more close to flat to slightly deflationary year-over-year. The other thing is we have -- our coverage, it's really still hard to get coverage too far out. And as you can saw from this morning, I think we showed it in the amount of coverage in our slides here. I think we have 50% coverage over the next six months. And in fact, when you look at the next three months, that's just over 70% but then after that, it's only -- it's closer to 30% coverage. And so, it's still hard to get -- the forward premiums are still high, and we -- especially when things are coming down, we don't want to lock ourselves and not have that optionality. But again, as I said in my comments earlier, if it ends up being a little bit higher, we have headroom in pricing to be able to deal with that. Jared Garber : Thanks. Operator : We'll now move to Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Go ahead, please. Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Raj, I was hoping you could just level set us for the second quarter. The comps you said were above the 4% to 6% range quarter-to-date. But, if the comps relative to pre-COVID are pretty steady for the rest of the quarter, would that imply much variation? Raj Vennam : So, I think, much variation -- I want to make sure I understand the question right. When you say much variation from like month-to-month within the quarter, if that's the case, yes, there is some, because of -- again, if you look at -- I have to go back, look at exactly the pre-COVID numbers. But I know that, like I was mentioning earlier, there is the promotional activity that you have to take into consideration as a base. So when we look at pre-COVID, we tease out the impact of promotions and look at that, and that's how I -- we say that's fairly consistent when you look at it, taking out the impact of the promotional activity from then to now. But are we seeing that versus pre-COVID or are we a little bit better September to-date? Yeah, but it's not meaningful -- it's not big enough to really call it a trend change. Chris O'Cull: Okay. I was just trying to figure out if October, November comparisons relative to COVID or pre-COVID or relative to last year even are much different from what you have in September, you're wrapping in September. Raj Vennam : I don't believe so. I'm trying to think if there is a holiday shift in November, but that's the only thing I can think of. But I don't think there's any change. Yeah. Chris O'Cull: Okay. And then assuming the holiday is following -- assuming the holiday is following a more normal seasonal pattern this year, which of your brands do you expect to be impacted the most on a year-over-year basis? For example, I would think fine dining's performance might accelerate if we have a normal holiday season, but I wasn't sure how all the brands might be impacted. Raj Vennam : Actually, I think by the time we got to the holiday season last year, obviously Omicron was a factor that started to kick in late into the holidays, and we expect third quarter to be an outperformer on the comp side because of that wrap on that. But outside of that, when we look at our segments, I don't know that there's anything unique that this year holiday wrap that would cause them to be different from where we were before COVID. And I just want to remind you, last year, December was a record sales month for us. It was really -- the Omicron impact was kind of basically the last week of December leading into January. Operator : We'll now move to our next question. That will come from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks for the question. I appreciate the details and the commentary on pricing. Just wondering if you could speak to what you've seen to-date as far as the customer response to the pricing and kind of how that impacts your go-forward thoughts, obviously, marrying that up with how you spoke to inflation. Raj Vennam : Yeah. I'd say, generally, the pricing flow-through is consistent with what we would expect. I think, Rick mentioned earlier, when you look at the lower income, is there a little bit of erosion on the add-ons? Yes, but it's not meaningful enough for us to say that there's a pushback on pricing, but mind you, we're pricing a lot less than our competitors. And as you think about the fact that the last quarter, our pricing was 6.5% roughly that compares to full-service CPI of 9%. And in fact, and then -- and I'll just point out that when you look at it over a two-year basis, we price 7.5%. And I think, FSR is close to 14% on a two-year. And that just gives you a sense of the fact that we may not be seeing what some others might be seeing, because we haven't taken the levels of pricing that the industry in general has taken. Dennis Geiger : Right. Appreciate that. And then just I'm wondering if you could speak to dining room traffic levels currently. Where that stands? What kind of runway you may still have within the dining room and the benefits there, if To Go stays elevated? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Well, I think we've said in the past, there's not a huge difference in profitability between dining room versus take off-premise. The margin differential is de minimis across the portfolio. Is there some difference from brand to brand? Yes. But when you look at through the portfolio, the levels of profitability is not that different. And as we look at -- if you're looking at what the impact might have if the mix changes, I wouldn't say that changes the margin that much. And again, we -- two quarters in a row, now we are seeing consistent off-premise level. So, we'll have to see how that plays out over time. But I don't expect the margin to change materially based on the change in mix. Operator : David Tarantino with Baird has our next question. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. Raj, I just want to clarify a couple of comments you made on the underlying sales trends. So, my question really is specific to Olive Garden and how you're viewing the performance for the first quarter relative to what you were seeing prior to the first quarter. It sounds like maybe you aren't viewing it that differently, but I just wanted to clarify just the way we would calculate kind of multiyear comps. It did look like a slowdown, but then you did have that promotional activity pre-COVID. So I guess, when you sort of make all the adjustments you're making for Olive Garden specifically, how are you viewing the performance of that brand in the first quarter? Raj Vennam : Yeah, David. Look, we're actually very pleased with the work that Olive Garden team has done in keeping with their strategy. And I'll tell you, as we look at our guest count retention, which is the way we look at it, Q4 Olive Garden guest count retention was in that low-90s, call it 91%, 91-ish and in the first quarter, they were basically in that range. So they're within 0.5 point of what Q4 was. Was there -- I think year-over-year, there are a lot of dynamics, which is why I think there's a little bit of that confusion as well. But when you look at it on a three-year, traffic retention from Q4 to Q1 at Olive Garden was pretty consistent. And then, the other thing I'll point out is Q1 before COVID, what we're comparing to is the quarter where we had buy one, take one for nine weeks of the -- eight or nine weeks of the quarter. And then we also had a big launch of a second promotion that had high TRPs and couponing. And in fact, so when you actually exclude all that, we feel like Olive Garden was actually in a great place. And that's the point we're trying to make is that, I don't think -- we are -- us being close to the business and understanding the details, when we take out those noise -- take that noise out, Olive Garden's performance has been pretty consistent. David Tarantino : Great. That's helpful. And then on the quarter-to-date number, I think you said last year, you were doing comps versus pre-COVID around 7%, if I'm not mistaken. So, if you're north of 6% versus that number, it would imply a pretty big acceleration versus what we've seen in recent quarters. And it didn't sound like you were viewing it that way. So I guess, could you reconcile that math for us in your comments that maybe you haven't seen an inflection? Raj Vennam : Yeah, David. I think a couple of things. One, you got to take into consideration the pricing difference between over three years from the first quarter to the second quarter. Then I think when we look at traffic, yeah, I mean it does -- like I was mentioning earlier, there is a little bit of an increase versus pre-COVID. But when we take out the impact from promotions from three years ago, it's not a huge step change. So that's the other part that I think you're missing is like September, three years ago, we did not have the same level of promotional activity at Olive Garden as we did in June and August -- or the first quarter of this year. So that's another factor that plays into how we look at it. Operator : Now moving to a question from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks. Appreciate all the color. I just wanted to come back to that conversation around the guest count consistency at Olive Garden and just kind of pair that with the commentary you guys made earlier. So just trying to understand, I think last quarter, Rick, you had mentioned that there was some check management at Cheddar's. I think this quarter, you're talking about some slowdown or weakness with the consumer under $50,000 of income. Just trying to understand how that's manifesting itself right now in these two brands. Is it more traffic declines or is it check management? Just trying to understand that in the context of what Raj just indicated on guest count retention at Olive Garden. Rick Cardenas : Hey. Thanks, Peter. All right. We're getting a lot of questions on traffic at Olive Garden. I just want to reiterate, we're really proud of the work Olive Garden has done and Dan has done and the team over the last couple of years. What they've done to simplify their operation, to improve margins over time, over pre-COVID has been great. They outperformed the industry this year, this quarter in both sales and traffic. And as I shared in our prepared remarks, within our portfolio, they have more consumers at below $50,000. That doesn't mean that we're worried about the below $50,000 consumer because it hasn't been a significant move in traffic from that. Yes, we've seen some check management a little bit. And as we've said, it's not significant. So, our media is a lot lower. There's a lot of reasons for the performance at Olive Garden and the performance at Cheddar's. But we haven't seen much check management, maybe a little bit at Cheddar's. Peter Saleh : Understood. Okay. Very helpful. And then just on the marketing expense for the full year, I think you guys had indicated previously, maybe that would be up about 10 basis points. I think in the first quarter, it was up about 20 basis points. Are you still on track for maybe just a modest increase this year or do you think you guys will maybe take that up slightly given the trends so far in the first quarter? Raj Vennam : Peter, this is -- actually, I don't think it has anything to do with the first quarter trends. But as we look at our plans, I think we're basically within that 10 basis points to 20 basis points, and quarter to quarter, it might vary. But you might see some quarters at 20 basis points, some at 10 basis points, but that's still what we expect to do for the year. Peter Saleh : Thank you very much. Operator : We will now hear from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Thanks. [Technical Difficulty] I think there may be some confusion in how you're talking about (ph) trends relative to pre-COVID because clearly Kevin Kalicak : Brian, your line is breaking up. Can you clear your line? Brian Bittner : Can you hear me? Hello? Operator : We hear you better now. Go ahead. Brian Bittner : Okay. So you can hear me, okay. I just -- I think I want to address, I think there's some confusion in how you're talking about trends relative to pre-COVID. Because clearly, we as the analyst have no way to strip out impacts of promotions like you do when we speak to your underlying trend and you speak to it excluding promotions, it\u2019s kind of apples versus oranges to our models. So like for instance, if you hold anywhere near this 6% comp for 2Q, it would suggest 400 basis points of acceleration in the pre-COVID trend from where you were in the first quarter. And so I think what we're trying to figure out is there's something happening that's more positive in the business recently than you're leading on or conversely should we expect that one-year trend to come down a lot moving forward to kind of keep that multi-stack trend intact, if that makes sense. Raj Vennam : Yeah, Brian. I mean, I understand where you're coming from. But I think there's so much uncertainty in this environment for us to basically say that what we saw in the last three weeks or four weeks and then just to be able to say that should be the new number, and that's how we should look at it for the full year. That doesn't make sense. If we look at what happened over the last six months, consistently there's a little bit of movement from week to week. But when you come back and look at it over a larger period of time, call it six or eight weeks, it's pretty consistent. And that's really what we're looking at it through that lens. And I get the point around the promotions, and you don't have visibility to some of that. But even if you just look at the absolute number, I think for Q1 -- Q4, it was, like I said, 91%, 91% to 92%, and Q1 was basically 91% of pre-COVID at Olive Garden, for example. So it's actually pretty consistent from Q4 to Q1 at an absolute quarter level. Month-to-month, week-to-week, there is some volatility, but that's really -- that's where the promotions come into play. Brian Bittner : Okay. And just going back to the first quarter on Olive Garden, I know you were happy with its performance and again stripping out the promotions, great noise in how you look at it versus us. But obviously versus the quarter before, it did slow materially in the trend versus \u201819 or versus pre-COVID, whereas all the other segments and brands really held steady. And I guess the question is does Olive Garden have a bigger return to seasonality factor in its business and the other brands? And also, what percentage of Olive Garden is exposed to that under $50,000 consumer relative to the other brands? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Brian. So Olive Garden did not have a different seasonal pattern than the other brands, so the seasonality pattern was very consistent with Olive Garden with LongHorn and Cheddar's. The difference in kind of the two -- the three year difference or pre-COVID difference, as was something that Raj said. In the summer of 2019, we had buy one, take one in the first quarter at Olive Garden. It was the first time we did it in the first quarter. So it was about, I think, a 2 point swing that we had from Q4 to Q1. But the seasonality was very consistent across when you compare. As the $50,000 income, Cheddar's and Olive Garden are fairly consistent. They're a little bit higher than they are at LongHorn. But it's not anywhere near the majority. And so we're not going to give you an exact number, but it is higher than LongHorn, but it's not significantly higher. Brian Bittner : Okay. Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Sure. Operator : Andrew Charles with Cowen has the next question. Go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. Given the return of seasonality in the industry that could weigh on Olive Garden seasonally like fiscal 2Q, within the reiterated revenue guidance though, what gives you confidence that you'll see the benefit of seasonality in fiscal 3Q and fiscal 4Q the strongest fiscal quarter -- the strongest seasonal quarters for the business as the consumer backdrop, particularly at the low end, is a bit shaky here? Rick Cardenas : Yeah. Well, when we talk about return to seasonality, it's based on the consumer backdrop there is today, it's not necessary -- if something changes dramatically, you might see some different seasonal patterns. But my guess is you'll still see the same flows month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. It just might be a little bit lower, a little bit higher depending on where the consumer is. The only difference that we'll see -- and that's versus pre-COVID. When you think about versus last year, we are going to have the Omicron wrap that we have in January basically and a little bit of February. So that should help versus last year on a Q3 basis. But as we talk about seasonality, it's really more about the consumer returning more to normal based on COVID, not on the economy, because we're basically assuming that the economy stays somewhere around where we are. If it gets a little worse, that might impact inflation in a positive way for us. And as we said in the call in the first quarter, if food costs go down 1%, it's better -- it offsets a 2% decline in guest count. I'm sorry, if total inflation goes down 1%, it impacts -- it's the same impact as a 2% change in guest count. Andrew Charles : Thank you. Operator : And Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse has the next question. Go ahead, please. Lauren Silberman : Thank you very much. I have a quick follow-up on Olive Garden. So it seems like the headwinds in the reduction and discounting impact were outsized in the fiscal first quarter, given all the promotions. To be clear, excluding the promotions, were three-year trends closer to positive mid-single digit and is that what you'd expect for the rest of the year? Rick Cardenas : I would say on three-year trends in sales, we would be positive even more than that because we were positive to three years ago in sales right now. On the traffic side, what we've said in the past is the marketing activity and the spending that we've done in marketing is probably around a 10% impact to traffic. And Raj mentioned that in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter, we were in the low-90s to traffic to pre-COVID, and that's mostly driven by all of the media that we did before and the coupons and all the other things. But it was something that we wanted to do, and we expected to see some traffic miss from that. And so total sales would be higher and guest count would be higher if we were in the same kind of marketing mix we were before. Lauren Silberman : Understood. And then just -- I wanted to ask about on-premise traffic across the industry. It's still down despite closures. Any perspective on why that might be the case and which occasions still haven't fully recovered, especially as we enter what seems to be an increasingly challenging consumer environment? Rick Cardenas : Yeah. I think a couple of things. The off-premise experience is a lot better across a lot of places. So, people have other ways to get their food from casual dining than they did before. And so that could lead to a little bit less dining room traffic, especially as there are still some consumers that don't want to go out to eat. While a lot of people think COVID is over, there are some that don't. And so even with restaurant closures, a lot of the closures happen in independents in urban markets. And so some of the suburban markets are still doing well and they didn't have as many closures. So -- but what Raj was mentioning earlier, with margins being basically the same for us on off-premise versus on-premise, because we don't have that delivery charge, then we're okay wherever it is. We want our dining rooms to be more full, and you're starting to see them fill up. Not all the brands are back to pre-COVID levels. LongHorn is above pre-COVID levels in traffic. And so we feel good about all of our brands and what they're going to do. The good news is if our dining rooms aren't back to full, we've got capacity. And as we continue to see some improvement, as we continue to do the things that we have been doing over the last few years, focusing on simplification, making it easier for our teams to do what they do, investing in our food, investing in our teams, then we're going to have an even better experience as guests come back, and they are coming back. So, that just gives us more opportunity to grow in the long run because our dining rooms in some of our brands aren't back to pre-COVID levels. That's being offset in most of our brands by To Go. Lauren Silberman : Thank you very much. Operator : Moving to Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Jeff Farmer : Thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. So, can you update us on where you see G&A dollars for the full year considering what we saw in the Q1? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Jeff. I think for the full year, we're probably still close to that $400 million, which is where I think we were before COVID. So, three years of inflation and other things, growth costs all help offset the corporate restructuring savings of over $25 million or so that we got. So, I would say, at this point, our estimate is closer to that $400 million for the full year. Jeff Farmer : Okay. And then there were a couple of mentions about this. But as we approach that January-February timeframe when you saw the most significant Omicron headwinds, is there any color you can provide on the magnitude of sales headwind that you potentially saw over that January and February time period? Raj Vennam : Yeah. I think last year, if you go back, we talked about that impacting sales by about $100 million -- call it, in that $90 million to $100 million range. So that's really the tailwind as you look at it year-over-year on the sales front. Jeff Farmer : Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : We'll now move to Jon Tower with Citi. Go ahead, please. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two for me. First, Rick, your comments earlier in the prepared remarks and answering some of the questions about promotions only coming back on if they're profitable. Does that mean that we may see historical promos of the past show up again, but priced at a level that's more profitable to Darden, so for example, I'm thinking like Never Ending Pasta at Olive Garden? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jon. We're not going to discuss our plans for competitive reasons. But as we've said a few times today, anything that we do should emphasize our brand equity and be more profitable than they were before. Jon Tower : Okay. And then I guess just following up another comment earlier in the call, the idea that you're seeing strength in that higher income households for those over $50,000. Can you just talk about how that's showing up in the business either across the brands or within brands? Are you seeing, say, for example, higher traffic growth at Olive Garden in that subsegment or is it more about the check growth? Just curious if you could suss that out a little bit. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jon. I think there's a few ways to kind of tease that out. One is look at our Fine Dining business and how well they're doing and the sales that they've had. Even though in the first quarter, the urban markets hadn't reopened yet really much and a lot of people hadn't gone back to work. We had a significant difference in Fine Dining in the suburban markets versus the urban markets. That's tightening now with people going back to work. But Fine Dining is doing really well. Many of our other brands in the other segment, you've got Yard House, you've got Seasons 52 doing very well because of that consumer. And at Olive Garden, our mix has changed and so our consumer is a little bit higher. And so think about LongHorn. LongHorn caters to a little bit higher consumer and their sales are still strong, and traffic is still strong versus pre-COVID. So there's a lot of ways to see it. And we're seeing the ability as we take price in some of the Fine Dining brands, there's really no pushback. So we think that that is a broad-based benefit for us because we have a portfolio of brands that kind of run the spectrum of the consumer. And so when one segment of the population isn't doing as well, the other segment is, then we are still okay. And then if it flips the other way, we're okay. And so right now, there's just one segment of the population that's being hurt a little bit more by inflation than others. And the good news is we've got brands that aren't impacted by that. Jon Tower : Thank you. Operator : Moving on to Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Go ahead, please. Eric Gonzalez : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just maybe one about your guidance. It was encouraging to see that you reiterate all the components of the outlook. Raj, last quarter, you commented that the guidance implies full year margin in 2023 will exceed that of pre-COVID levels. But if I look at where things fell in the first quarter, the 17.5% was about 50 bps or 60 bps below where you were in the first quarter of 2020. So the question is, do you still expect those store-level margin to exceed pre-COVID levels for the full year? And second, can you give us a bit more color on how you expect the margin to progress throughout the year and what some of the levers outside of pricing that you can pull to bring it back up? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Eric. Let's say, we always talk about margins at the operating profit level or EBITDA level. The reason we do that is because there's a lot of difference. If we manage G&A better, that give us flexibility to put more costs into the investment into the four walls. So we don't focus as much on the four walls as the full because for us, at the end of the day, it's the total portfolio, right? Where are we for the whole P&L? Where are we from an EBIT margin, where are we from an EBITDA margin. If you look at it through that lens, first quarter was higher than pre-COVID by about, call it, 60 basis points on the profit level and 40 basis points when you look at it through EBITDA, so let me start with that. And then as we look at the full year, do we still expect restaurant-level margins to be better than pre-COVID? Yes, that's what's embedded in our guidance for the full year. The cadence of that is going to be that we have -- if you recall last year, the first and second quarter had the most improvement versus pre-COVID. So that's why you saw a year-over-year decline in the first quarter. We expect that to narrow a little bit in the second quarter, but still decline versus last year, but still ahead of pre-COVID. And then as we get to the back half, we expect to be higher than last year. That's what's embedded in our guidance. And part of that is the shrinking gap between pricing and inflation. And again, this was planful as we went into this year. And so we expect -- at this point, we expect it to play out that way. Eric Gonzalez : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to the value and pricing discussion. And you noted -- I know I'm asking this question amid all the inflation, but you noted chicken breast prices having come back and you mentioned that beef having -- prices having come back. So I guess if we do go into kind of a more deflationary environment, you do see commodity costs really pull back. How do you think about promoting value throughout your brands? And do you feel like we end up in a position where maybe we're offside from a value perspective as maybe a casual dining group? I know we used to talk about food at home, food away from home. I don't know if you -- how you think about that risk, but just curious for your thoughts on the levers, maybe if we were to go into that scenario. Rick Cardenas : Yeah. If we're going to in a scenario that food costs deflate even more or reduce even more than we have in our estimate already, because remember, what I've said in the June call and even today is we continue to expect food cost to go down, the inflation to go down from where it was in the first quarter. And I'm assuming that our competitors are assuming the same thing. That said, we don't anticipate changing our messaging to be a pure value play. We think we have value on all of our brands every day based on the investments that we've made in our food, the improvement that we have in our service, and our brands are going to talk about whichever ones do any kind of communication, they're equities. And at Olive Garden, it's never ending craveable abundant Italian food. At LongHorn, its quality and they talk about quality. It doesn't have -- they don't have to talk about price. And at our other brands, we talk about -- at Cheddar's, it is about (ph) value. So if Cheddar's talks more in digitally, it will be about value because that's their equity. So we're not going to change our marketing based on what's happening with food cost. We're going to market based on our strategy. Andrew Strelzik : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I apologize if I missed this. You mentioned staffing being back kind of to normal levels. But can you just give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of turnover and application flow? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yeah. We continue to get a significant increase in applicant flow across the country. We have a new talent management system. We've had it for over a year. And that system allows applicants to automatically schedule their interviews, et cetera., and we've got so many interviews scheduled. We're going to have to figure out how to maybe slow that down because managers, all they're doing is interviewing in a lot of places. So we've got a really good applicant flow. As we said, we opened quite a few restaurants this quarter. All of them were fully staffed with great people ready to go. Our turnover, our manager retention is much closer to pre-COVID levels. It's pretty close to pre-COVID levels and well better than the industry average, our manager retention. And our team member retention is also well above the industry, but it's not quite back to pre-COVID levels. So our teams are focused. And as we mentioned, we had our general manager/managing partner conferences last month. And most of those conferences we're talking about ensuring that we train our new team members and improve retention. We think that's a key for us going forward, and we'll continue to focus on trying to get our retention levels back to pre-COVID levels. Operator : We'll now move to our next question. That will come from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. I think you said all traffic at Olive Garden is down 9% versus pre-COVID. Raj, I think you said that that's the inverse of the 91%. And if To Go mix was up maybe 9 points since then, the dining room traffic would be down more than that, maybe mid-teens or something like that. So maybe you can confirm if that's about right. But I'm wondering how much you look at that traffic gap in the dining room versus pre-COVID is an opportunity that you can invest against in a good ROI type of fashion versus traffic that was simply not profitable and not worth chasing with TV advertising, LTOs or coupons because just not efficient spend and you've got a healthy reset with COVID. Raj Vennam : Yes, David. I think let me start by saying your numbers are right. That's accurate. The -- yes, does that present an opportunity in the dining room? Absolutely. But we're going to go about it in a manner that's actually sustainable and that's where we go back to -- over the last three years, we've invested so much into underpricing inflation. If you look at where Olive Garden's pricing has been over the three years, combined -- full three years combined is at 10%. When you look at where full-service CPI -- restaurant CPI was for the same timeframe, it's 17.5%. So we've actually significantly underpriced the industry and actually, I would argue, significantly underpriced, maybe not to the same extent our competitors. So that is the way we believe to build back that guest. And Rick mentioned getting that one extra visit from our loyal guest, we think this is a sustainable, durable way to really get our guests back, it's going to take time. It's not a one magic, let's drive people in today or tomorrow. It's just going to happen over time. And I would argue that we're starting to see the fruit of some of that, but it takes time. Rick Cardenas : And I just want to add one thing, David, which is what you said. Some of those guests that we were doing in these dining rooms might not have been as profitable as we'd like, right? We had a lot of coupons. There were times when we had five coupons in one week at Olive Garden, when we were running never any possible, right? And so we had to ask ourselves, is that the right thing to do to drive traffic, just to have a full restaurant if that traffic really isn't very profitable. We do a lot of work when they're there. And so are we better off with a loyal guest that doesn't need all of those discounts to come in, and we can serve them. They know what they're going to get. They get a consistent experience. So everything Raj said, I agree with, but our strategy is to -- we've significantly reduced discounting. It's such a small part of the number of checks, very, very minimal, and we'd like to keep it that way. David Palmer : The other comment that you said in the opening comments, I think you said that customer satisfaction levels were near highs. I don't know if there -- I'd have to go back and check, but what brands maybe we're talking about there, that's pretty striking because I think the industry customer satisfaction levels are near lows. I mean they've kind of gotten roughed up by a tough labor market, so are you finding that you've sort of your gap to the peers has dramatically shifted and the reason I ask that is because given your strategy, we see obviously best-in-class operators, they have very thin marketing and promotion budgets. So to some degree, if there might be a return on the customer set gap that you might be thinking about at this point. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, David. We specifically mentioned Olive Garden being at or near record highs, and we talked about LongHorn having their stakes grow correctly at record, but I would tell you that Cheddar's is at a record high for us in the time that we've owned them. They've got the highest satisfaction. They've got the lowest dissatisfaction they've ever had. We've got the same thing at Olive Garden, high satisfaction at LongHorn. I believe they're at their highest overall ratings or if not at the highest, are as close as they've been because cooking the steak right is a big part of satisfaction. At our other brands, at Seasons 52, satisfaction is really high. So we haven't really seen -- we've actually bucked the trend on consumer satisfaction, not just in the category. If you look at consumer satisfaction or customer satisfaction over the last few years, it's been on a decline. Ours is not. And we think it's because of what we've done over the last few years and even the last five or 10 years to continue to improve our guest experience to continue to add more value on the plate and to be consistent. We've got a core group of team members that work in every one of our restaurants that have been there a long time. Our restaurants are fully staffed in general. We've got pockets of restaurants that are understaffed, but those are the same kind of pockets that we had before COVID. And so we believe that the things that we've done over the last few years have helped improve guest satisfaction because we've got great loyalty members. So is that part of the reason that we aren't -- we don't have to do as much versus others on the marketing front? Perhaps. But what I would say, it gives us even more confidence that if we do turn on some media that we're going to execute really well and delight even more people. David Palmer : Thanks. Operator : And with Bank of America, Sara Senatore. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Just two follow-ups, please. One, you made the point that your collective gap between food away from home and your own pricing has been quite wide, but you also said that you expect that gap or your inflation -- your input inflation and your pricing gap to narrow. So I guess is there a -- which presumably means your gap with -- the collective gap with the CPI overall will also narrow. Is there like sort of a specific ratio you'd like to keep or I guess how do you think about that, the importance of having that very wide gap, but at the same time, seeing it narrow a little bit as perhaps support for margin? So just that was one question. And then my second question is just on margins overall as you think about versus pre-COVID, I guess, my sense is that the big changes are in Cheddar's in particular. But as we think about kind of structural earnings power, what's the right segment margin, can you give any guidance among -- across the different segments, Olive Garden, LongHorn and then the Fine Dining and Other? Just to get a sense of what normalized earnings should look like by segment? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Okay, Sara. That's a lot. So let me start with the pricing gap first, and then I'll get into the margins. So the comment we were making was specifically quarter-to-quarter movement in the year. But what we're targeting for the year is about 100 basis points gap to our inflation. This is not necessarily reflecting the food away from home or that, but I don't anticipate that our gap to the full-service restaurant CPI will shrink. This is more about what's going to happen over the -- by a lot. Maybe is there a 50 basis points movement? Sure. But is it going to shrink a lot? No. What we're talking about is we are targeting for the year, as we said at the beginning of the year, we said approximately 6% inflation -- total inflation and approximately 5% pricing. And we're continuing to -- we're just saying that we'll continue that. But the gap is the largest in the first quarter. It's really a function of year-over-year and the commodities being at those highest levels. So as they come down, the gap to that inflation will narrow and might actually even reverse a little bit in one quarter in the fourth quarter. But the point here is that when you look at it over time, our gap is still pretty wide. And we expect that to remain that wide relative to the full-service CPI and implied also relative to competitors. So that's the thing on the pricing side. As far as margins versus pre-COVID, our guidance implies that our margins will be less than last year; however, they will be still higher than pre-COVID. It still implies, call it, 40 to 50 basis points erosion versus last year for the full year. However, on the -- versus pre-COVID still somewhere close to 150 basis points is what that implies. As far as individual segments, I think the benefit of the portfolio is that our ability to react differently to different situations. And so to the extent, we have -- we don't want to put a specific target by segment, because that really boxes us into a corner. And the way we would think about it is if the consumer on the high end is doing well, maybe we get a little bit more margin from there and invest in the places where we need to. And so, we're thinking long term to get to this portfolio number, but we continue to kind of really evaluate that and play it by the year based on the environment. And so we want to just be more nimble on that front. Sara Senatore : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Now, we'll move to a question from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. Good morning. So first question, I'd like to understand a bit better on kind of the markers that you're looking for, for the marketing expense to accelerate as a percent of sales, in particular, if it's not kind of additional softness in traffic, what are the markets that you're looking for? Rick Cardenas : Yeah. I would say that this year, our marketing is going to be 10 basis points to 20 basis points above last year. What are specific markers we're looking at to significantly increase marketing? There's quite a few. One is we're going to continue to -- we're testing right now in some digital marketing and other media to see which one drives the best ROI. And when we feel like it's time to turn that on, we will. We're going to make sure that our turnover is back to a more reasonable level. Our guest experience is still great. But there's no one individual marker that we're going to say this -- when this happens, we're going to turn on media. We just don't want to let our competitors know what the markers are. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. And then the follow-up on unit growth. So, we noticed that on a Fine Dining basis, there was a reduction of -- a net reduction of 3 units. So, I'm wondering, is there going to be a different composition in terms of kind of the plan of your portfolio going forward or was the reduction just a kind of a quarterly reduction that you don't expect in the longer run? Rick Cardenas : Yeah. A couple of things. One, we had one of our restaurants catch fire and it had to close temporarily. But yeah -- and we have -- yeah, we moved Capital Burger into the other segment versus Fine Dining before, and there's three Capital Burgers in there. But we opened a restaurant in Fine Dining, but we only had one total closure. So, our total openings across the year are going to be consistent with what we said in June. Operator : We'll now hear from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Brian Vaccaro : Good morning, and thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the labor environment. And you said staffing levels are less of an issue, and your guest stat metrics are strong. So maybe this is less of an issue for you. But on the -- it seems like retention, training, rebuilding teams and culture seems to be a significant challenge for a lot of companies in and outside of the restaurant industry. So, could you talk a little bit about how you're navigating these challenges, what changes or adjustments you've made? And what are some areas where you still see opportunities to improve on the labor front? Rick Cardenas : On the labor front or the staffing front. So a couple of things. One, yes, when we hire -- when we have a lot more hires than we normally do, because we were trying to fill our restaurants back up and when our turnover is a little bit higher than it used to be, that leads to higher training. But we've got a great employment proposition. We're continuing to build up our certified trainer ranks. Some of them left the industry when COVID happened. So we're going to -- we're just going to ensure that we do what we did before COVID. We're going to make sure when we hire somebody, they get onboarded like they should at a Darden restaurant that they go through the training, all of the training, and they're not just kind of thrown into the wolves because of short staffing. The fortunate thing is we're not really short staffed. So we have time to spend to train our team members. In our industry, like many service industries, most -- a lot of the turnover happens in the first 90 days. And so when you spend the time on training somebody and they leave within 90 days, there's a lot of cost. So we're focusing our efforts on hiring the right people and training them to our standards, so they don't leave in the first 90 days. And if we can just get that back to close to pre-COVID levels, our retention is going to be back to pre-COVID levels and that will save a lot of money on the P&L. Brian Vaccaro : That's helpful color. And, Raj, I think you said hourly wage inflation up around 9.5%, up a little over 9% in this quarter. I guess, with staffing levels recovered, I'm curious to what degree do you expect hourly inflation to moderate over the next few quarters? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Brian. We expect for the full year to be around 8%. So that has implied, there's some moderation as we go through the year. Yeah, you're right, we started with a little bit over 9% in the first quarter. But again, we had -- if you look at last year cadence, you got to look at that there was a step-up in the back half of last year. So as we wrap on that, we don't expect it to be at those levels, yeah. Brian Vaccaro : All right. Thank you. And then last one for me, shifting gears just for a second. I guess, I wanted to ask about the path to sustaining higher margins in a post-COVID world and I realize COGS is a big piece, but I ask it in context of Olive Garden store margins that are sort of for the first time running a couple of hundred bps below pre-COVID levels. And, I guess, where do you see ultimately COGS settling out over a multi-quarter or 12-plus months out from here? And maybe if not getting that specific, maybe just walk through or remind us the line item dynamics that you need to play out to achieve higher margins in a post-COVID world? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yeah. Hey, Brian. I'll start and then turn it over to Raj on maybe some line items. But if you think about Olive Garden, Olive Garden had the highest inflation of any brand at Darden this quarter. You had a lot of chicken inflation. Olive Garden sells a lot of chicken. There was inflation in wheat and inflation in cheese. And so that basically is Olive Garden's menu. And so that's why you saw a little bit more of a margin squeeze pressure at Olive Garden, but we have a portfolio that allowed Olive Garden to continue to price the way they've been pricing. And so, we would expect, over the years, our cost of sales to move back towards where it was before. And so we made some investments during COVID to shift some cost -- some spending from marketing to cost of sales. We did that at LongHorn. We did it at Olive Garden. But we would expect our cost of sales to get back to a more reasonable level over the next few years. It's not going to happen in one year. It's going to happen in over a few years as food cost becomes more normal. But if Raj, you want to add any more color on the different margin line items. Raj Vennam : Yeah. I would just say, obviously, in the near term, from a margin perspective on the line items, we expect food cost to be higher. We expect, but everything else to be lower than pre-COVID. If you look at, restaurant labor is better than pre-COVID because of the productivity improvements, restaurant expenses are better than pre-COVID. Marketing is better than pre-COVID and then G&A is better than pre-COVID. So these are all the other line items that are actually helping fund some of the -- deal with this higher inflation and helping fund some investments we've made into the plate. But then, as Rick said, over time, we'll continue to evaluate what makes sense and as inflation kind of normalizes or gets deflationary on the commodities front, that gives us more room to kind of balance back over time. Brian Vaccaro : Thank you very much. Operator : Now we'll hear from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. Rick, at the very beginning of the call, I think it was you, Rick, so I apologize if I'm making this up. There was a mention on technology investments that could potentially influence both the on- and off-premise experience. Could you, I guess, elaborate a little bit more in that? I mean is that more kind of employee-facing work that could potentially drive some efficiencies or are there any customer-facing initiatives that you're seeing, particularly on the off-premise side that you think could increase sales? If you could just elaborate a little bit, what that means, I guess, both over the near and medium term in terms of opportunities that the brands may have on the technology side from this point forward? Rick Cardenas : Sure, John. I want to start by saying, we've got a great team on the IT team that does a lot of work on the guest experience and the team member and the manager experience. We've been spending a lot of our efforts over the last few years improving the To Go experience because that's where the business was. And we'll continue to make investments in the off-premise experience. We've got some things that are in test now that will help the guest on the off-premise experience. But we've also got some things that we're working for the restaurant managers to make it easier for them to do their job. So, if the manager job is easier, then they can spend more time with our team, our team can be trained better and spend better time with their guests. And so we're going to be spending some time and energy on focusing on things that make their managers' job easier. And we're also still doing some guest-facing things at the restaurant, but not overtly in their face. And so how does somebody get on the wait list a little easier? How does somebody check in to the restaurant a little bit easier? How do they pay for their check a little bit easier? So there are some things that we're still working on across all those dimensions. And the benefit of our scale is we can do that, we can test it in one restaurant and in one brand and move it to the other brands, and it kind of leverages that IT spend across more restaurants. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Chris Carril : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on off-premise. Can you talk about how that roughly 10 point swing in Olive Garden off-premise sales mix versus pre-COVID levels potentially impacts the check or maybe mix specifically versus those pre-COVID levels that we're comparing to? And then as you're thinking about the balance of the year, does your guidance assume that off-premise mix stays steady from here? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Chris. Off-premise mix, I mean, I think pre-COVID we were running close to 15%, 16%, so 8% more than that. That doesn't really change the check that differently. There is a little bit less beverages, but there are other add-ons. So when you look at overall, it's not a big difference. The other thing is catering, is one mix that could -- that has an impact on the check average. But again, it's not huge at this point, but that is something that we have seen some resurgence in. In fact, when you look at over the last two quarters, while our total off-premise mix stayed pretty consistent at Olive Garden at 24%, there's more of catering and a little bit less of individual To Go, but ended up being 24% of total sales, but it was just a different mix. So that's really the only mix change we've noticed on the off-premise, but really no major impact on the check. Chris Carril : Got it. Raj Vennam : And then as we look at guidance, I mean that -- there's really not a lot of -- we don't -- again, I think we kind of expected this to come down a little bit. But given where we've been over the last two quarters, we're not assuming a big change or a big decline in off-premise in guidance. But our belief is that to the extent there is some change there, that's offset with dine-in. Rick Cardenas : And one last thing. Just so you know, the third quarter is generally a highest off-premise experience, right, because you get a lot of catering, a lot of parties. So, what I would say is after Q2, we might -- it is what it is, but Q3 may be higher than you would expect because of what normally happens in our third quarter in To Go. Chris Carril : Got it. That's helpful. And then just returning to labor costs, I think you mentioned, you expect wage inflation to be about 8% for the year. But what's your total labor inflation outlook, just inclusive of any kind of productivity measures or any shifts in hours, anything like that? Raj Vennam : Yeah. The total labor is somewhere in that 6% to 6.5% year-over-year because last year -- we already got all the productivity last year. So, we don't see a year-over-year significant improvement in productivity. In fact, as I was mentioning, first quarter, we were wrapping on elevated productivity from last year. But 6% to 6.5% for total labor is how we're looking at it, that includes the indirect labor as well, the manager salary and all that stuff. Chris Carril : Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Now, we'll hear from Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities. Nick Setyan : Thank you. It would be really helpful if you could just tell us what the pricing at Olive Garden is and what it's expected to be for the full year versus LongHorn. And then just a clarification. Was the -- month-to-month volatility in the quarter, was it largely driven by Olive Garden or was it very similar across the brands? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Let me start with the latter first. The month-to-month volatility was actually pretty much across all our brands. I think we kind of had -- June was, like I said, mid-3s for the portfolio. That delta between Darden and Olive Garden was pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter -- I mean, month-to-month during the quarter. So there wasn't a huge one segment or one brand that was driving the volatility month-to-month. On the pricing side, I don't want to get specifically to a brand, but I mentioned already that when you look at over three years, Olive Garden's pricing has been 10%. And Darden's pricing is also basically 10%, 10.2%. So it's within Olive Garden being such a big part of our portfolio. What we say about Darden pretty much represents what Olive Garden is going to be. Nick Setyan : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Kevin for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Thanks, Jake. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you, we plan to release second quarter results on Friday, December 16, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Operator : And once again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 23, before the market opens followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-Covid when discussing second quarter performance as a comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence's casual dining benchmark, excluding Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.  During our second fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales increased 3.6% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 5.7%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and our focus moving forward, and Raj will provide more details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2023 financial outlook. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Ricardo Cardenas : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and happy holidays, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter. All of our brands performed at a high level by remaining focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere. At the Darden level, we continue to strengthen and leverage our 4 competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Being brilliant with the basics starts with achieving and maintaining appropriate staffing levels in our restaurants. Across our brands, our teams are doing a great job of ensuring we are ready to run 14 great shifts a week. At each of our brands, we are fully staffed at the team member level, and manager staffing is at historic highs. As a result, our teams are executing more consistently, which in turn is driving strong guest satisfaction across our brands, according to both internal and external sources. During the quarter, 4 of our brands achieved all-time high internal guest satisfaction ratings and the others remain near all-time highs. Also, within Technomic industry tracking tool, a Darden brand was ranked #1 among major casual dining brands in each measurement category. I am particularly proud of Olive Garden's performance. During the quarter, they brought back their most popular limited time offers, never any possible. As you may recall, when I talked last I shared that any promotional activity or brands introduced should be evaluated with the following 3 filters. First, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations which allows our teams to consistently deliver exceptional guest experiences. And third, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing that in a way that drives profitable sales growth. Three years after it was last offered, the 2022 version of never any possible checked all 3 of these boxes. First, it leveraged Olive Garden's iconic brand equity by perfectly reinforcing their competitive advantage of never-ending abundant craveable Italian food. Next, it was amplified by only offering existing menu items with limited add-on choices, which made it easier to execute, resulting in great guest experiences. Finally, it was priced $3 higher than in 2019, which significantly improved the margin of this offer while still providing tremendous value for our guests. Never ending possible exceeded expectations, and we saw a step change in Olive Garden's positive gap to industry traffic during the 7 weeks at ramp. I'm even more encouraged by this performance, given that it was supported with about 3/4 of the media past years. Going forward, the team will build on their learnings and share insights across our brands but this may be the only limited time offer we do at Olive Garden this fiscal year. Across our brands, we continue to drive strong execution of the off-premise guest experience through ongoing investments in technology that reduce friction for our guests and our operators. For example, many of our guests still prefer to call in their to-go order. However, taking payment over the phone or when the guests arrived is both inefficient for our teams and inconvenient for our guests. To help address this, we rolled out online payment for call-in orders during the quarter, enhancing convenience for our guests and making our to-go specialists more efficient. To-go sales remain sticky across our core casual dining brand, accounting for 25% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% of Longhorn and 13% at Cheddar's. Digital transactions accounted for 62% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 10% of Darden's total sales. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams, and they have enjoyed welcoming even more guests back into their restaurants this season. In fact, the Capital Grille, ADB and CD52 enjoyed all-time daily sales record on Thanksgiving Day, and bookings for this holiday season are encouraging. The holidays are also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business. and we embraced a higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve, our guests, our team members and our communities. One of the ways we serve our communities is through our harvest program. One in 8 households in our country live without consistent access to food. To help fight hunger, our restaurants donate fresh, unused food to local food banks and nonprofits in their communities on a weekly basis throughout the year. Since the inception of this program, more than 131 million pounds of food have been donated, which is the equivalent of more than 100 million meals. The impact of our harvest program takes on added significance during the holidays. And I am delighted that our teams are helping to make a difference in some in communities across the country. I'm so proud of the focus and commitment our teams continue to display. Their disciplined approach in executing on our strategy is what enables us to succeed regardless of the operating environment. This is evidenced by the fact that just last week, we surpassed $10 billion in sales on a trailing 52-week basis for the first time in Darden's history. On behalf of our senior leadership team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 180,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guests and our communities. I wish you all a wonderful holiday season.  Now I'll turn it over to Raj. Rajesh Vennam : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, 9.4% higher than last year, driven by 7.3% same-restaurant sales growth along with the addition of 35 net new restaurants. This same restaurant sales performance outperformed -- outpaced the industry by 370 basis points and our same restaurant gas counts are performed even more as they exceeded the industry benchmark by 550 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.52, an increase of 2.7% above last year. Total EBITDA was $330 million, and we returned $249 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter, consisting of $149 million in dividends and $100 million in share repurchases. Total pricing for the quarter was approximately 6.5%, 200 basis points below total inflation of roughly 8.5%. Now looking at the details of the P&L compared to last year, Food and beverage expenses were 240 basis points higher, driven by commodities inflation of approximately 13%, which significantly outpaced our pricing. As we expected, chicken dairy and grains continue to be categories experiencing the highest levels of inflation. Produce especially let us was much higher than expected due to poor growing conditions and weather-related events in the quarter.  However, our scale and vendor partnerships help minimize this impact relative to the general market. National labor was 30 basis points better than last year, even with total restaurant labor inflation of 7%. Our restaurants continue to run efficient labor despite hourly wage inflation of 8.5%. National expenses were 20 basis points favorable as we leveraged higher sales that more than offset elevated inflation on utilities as well as higher repairs and maintenance expense. Marketing expenses were 30 basis points higher than last year as we increased media support for the reintroduction of never-ending possible. This was in line with our expectations heading into the quarter. G&A expenses were 40 basis points below last year, driven by sales leverage and a lower incentive accrual, which was in line with our plan. This favorability was partially offset by higher mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. And as a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Page 13 of our presentation illustrates the roughly 20 basis point reduction to operating income from mark-to-market expense and the 150 basis point benefit to the tax rate. The effective tax rate of 12.1% this quarter would have been 13.6% without the impact from the hedge. Now looking at our margin performance versus pre-Covid, we grew operating income margin by 160 basis points, while underpricing inflation by more than 500 basis points. Increased food and beverage costs were more than offset by improved productivity, reduced marketing, and other cost savings initiatives. Looking at our segment performance. All of our segments significantly outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. Sales at Olive Garden were 9.2% above last year driven by same-restaurant sales of 7.6%. Average weekly sales at Olive Garden were 104% of the recovery level. LongHorn sales were 9.7% above last year with same-restaurant sales growth of 7.3%. Average weekly sales at LongHorn were 125% of the pre=COVID level. Sales in our Fine Dining segment were 7% above last year, driven by Same Russian sales of 5.9% and average sales -- weekly sales were 117% of the pre-covid level. Our other segment sales were 10.5% above last year -- with same-restaurant sales of 7.1% and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-covid level. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We have updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the back half of the year. We now expect Total sales was $10.3 billion to $10.45 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 5% to 6.5%, 55 to 60 new restaurants; capital spending of $525 million to $575 million, total inflation of approximately 7%, and we plan to continue underpricing total inflation with annual pricing of approximately 6%. Furthermore, we expect commodities inflation between 8% and 9%. An annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 123 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. All resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.60 and $8. Looking at the third and fourth quarters, we expect the EPS growth rate year-over-year to be fairly balanced. In the third quarter, we estimate the outsized sales growth from lapping Omicron last year to be partially offset by underpricing inflation by approximately 50 basis points. In the fourth quarter, we expect inflation to further moderate on our pricing gap drivers contributing to margin growth. Now to wrap up, let me say that we're very pleased with how our teams are managing their businesses and delivering strong results. We remain disciplined in adhering to our strategy and providing value to our guests in the face of strong inflation. We're confident in the underlying strength of our business model and our team's ability to continue managing through this unpredictable environment effectively.  Now we will open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Eric Gonzalez : Just a real quick one on the promotional strategy. I think you said that never any possible will be the only LTO that you run this year. But you also brought back that $6 take-home offer, which I'm guessing you would consider to be an LTO. But -- so maybe you could talk about your expectations for that offer? Because if I remember correctly, that was a fairly strong comp driver in the past. Ricardo Cardenas : Eric, thanks for the question. Never any possible, we said in our prepared remarks is maybe the only limited time offer, likely only been a limited time offer. As you talk about the $6 take home, that's on our core menu. So it's not considered limited time, it's on our menu. But for competitive reasons, we're not going to discuss any more promotional plan details. And so we're going to continue to use our filters that we mentioned, first, elevating brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to live; second, simple to execute; and third, not at a deep discount. As you'll probably see on ATV today, we're currently airing our open big pastas, which are core menu items for us. So they're not a limited time offer, and it includes our new Ravioli Carbonara, none of these items are discounted. So we're going to stick to our strategy, as Raj said, core growth, core discount growth, and we're going to react accordingly. Eric Gonzalez : And then just on the marketing spend, do you still expect to be in that 1% to maybe 1.5% range for the year? Rajesh Vennam : Yes, Eric, we're going to be close. So I think that as we said, it should be close to 1 -- we said 10 to 20 basis points above last year. That's how we think about it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Brian Bittner : Congratulations on strong results. question on Olive Garden also. The underlying same-store sales this quarter showed a clear inflection versus the last few quarters, and particularly relative to the other brands, the 3-year comp accelerated to above 11%. And how much of this dynamic would you attribute directly to bringing back never-ending possible at the strong price point you did in -- and how much would you attribute to other factors? And do you believe this kind of underlying trend on a 3-year basis is sustainable? Or should we be tiny modeling a more conservative 3-year term moving forward for Olive Garden? Ricardo Cardenas : Yes, Brian. First, let me say how proud I handle the work Dan and his team have done working on keeping with our strategy at Olive Garden. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, Olive Garden already had a positive gap in same-restaurant sales to the industry before never-ending possible, and that gap increased when we brought never-ending possible back for 7 weeks. So it ran about half of the quarter. We're not going to kind of talk about how much nevering possible and contributed to the quarter, but it was a good jump for us. And so as we think about the rest of the year, our guidance contemplates continued strength in Olive Garden, but probably not at the strength that we had for nevering possible. Remember, this is an iconic limited time offer, uniquely positioned, and it covers all 3 filters that we mentioned. And as I said in our prepared remarks, we have exceeded our expectations. So -- and that's a pretty pleasant surprise for us. If you think about given the higher price point, the lower media support, but it does speak to how iconic that brand offer is and the things that Olive Garden brings in such a compelling way. And then finally, we haven't run in 3 years. So guests were really excited for the return, and it fits really well in our second quarter. So if you think about our lowest volume quarter of the year second quarter, never any possible helps keep our traffic a little bit higher so that we don't have to think about bringing team members hours down and then bringing team members back when the holidays go up. So we really were appreciative and we really love with the work that Olive Garden did and where nevering possible was. But not to say that our 3-year stack is going to stay the same as it did in Q2. Brian Bittner : And Rick, just more broadly, just you have a seat where you get to witness the consumer across multiple different brands. You have one of the best seats to kind of see how the consumer is behaving. There's obviously a lot of cross currents out there, and there's a lot of different views on where the consumer is going into calendar 2023. Can you just maybe describe your view of the consumer and how you're feeling about the overall consumer into '23 and maybe some puts and takes? Ricardo Cardenas : Yes, Brian, I won't necessarily talk about 23. I'll just talk about what we're seeing, not being an economist, I listen to what they have to say. But as you all know, everybody on this call knows, consumer spending drives the U.S. economy. The -- we've seen a shift in spending though, from durable household goods or durable goods to leisure services, and the restaurant industry has benefited from that shift. Casual dining same-restaurant sales improved from Q1 to Q2 and our positive gap to the industry improved even more during that time. So one of the benefits of our portfolio, as you mentioned, is we have a wide range of consumers. We serve a lot of them all across all of the spectrum. And our data indicates the higher-end consumer hasn't seen the same impact as consumers at the lower end of the spectrum. But if you think about the prepared remarks, sales at Thanksgiving were a record for Fine Dining and Seasons 52 and bookings for this holiday season are encouraging. So it seems like the higher end consumer is doing pretty well. And I know there's been a lot of talk over the year about consumers that's below $50,000 in income because high inflation impacts that consumer more disproportionately, but we've seen a little softness in that consumer over the last 6 months, but the mix of the 50,000 income and under is still above pre-covid levels for us. Even though that shift has come down a little bit, we're still above pre-covid levels at the 50,000 and below. And I would say, keep in mind that a lot of our consumers below $50,000 are single, are retirees are living in multigenerational households. So maybe $50,000 goes a little bit farther for that consumer. But without commenting on the future, we have seen a pretty good performance across all of those consumers over the last few months other than the fact that the 50,000 below consumer is lower than it was 6 months ago, but still higher than it was pre. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Andrew Charles : Great. Notwithstanding the strong 2Q performance and the higher fiscal 2023 guidance, but if we were to see some macro deterioration impact the industry in fiscal 2020 -- your calendar 2023, excuse me, what's kind of the pecking order or your preference of magnitude of how you'd respond to that? Should we expect perhaps a tighter taking of the belt and just more of a focus on reducing overhead? Will we expect you guys to potentially invest more in the marketing, potentially invest more to value. How do you think about the contingency plan if we were to see some deterioration in calendar 2023? Ricardo Cardenas : Andrew This is Rick again. If we see deterioration in the calendar 2023, we always look at ways to tighten and find ways to improve productivity and improve our administrative expenses. We think we're actually really good at doing that. So if something gets really -- shifts really badly in the wrong way, we're going to find ways to at least find places to tighten. On the marketing spend, Raj talked about what our marketing spend is for the rest of this year and for the whole year. We don't anticipate making a big change in that no matter what happens over the next 6 months. We're going to continue to use the filters that we mentioned. And I will say Olive Garden, as I said before, we'll always have advertising in their mix because of their scale. But we're going to stick to our strategy of core growth. We're going to react accordingly to whatever happens. And as we've said in the past, and Raj said it too, if and when we increase our marketing spend, we'll expect it to return -- to earn a return compared to what it would have been without the spend. So we're going to -- as you've seen us in the past, we react when things happen, and we think we'll do the same thing going forward. Andrew Charles : Very helpful. And if I could sneak one in to Raj, what's the small step hire in CapEx guidance as you maintain new store openings? Is that construction costs were perhaps running a bit higher than expected, there are some incremental investments in technology or something else we should be thinking about? Rajesh Vennam : It's truly inflation on the construction costs and some equipment costs as well. So it's really -- a lot of it is new restaurant related. Some is on the -- even on the facilities CapEx, there's a little bit higher inflation. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Just a question on traffic, particularly on-premise. If you look at the industry numbers, on-premise traffic is down double digits for casual dining. And even Olive Garden is not back to where it was. I wonder how that informs your strategy? Do you feel like that's an opportunity? Or you just have to be patient, particularly with some lapsed users, maybe that under 75,000 household income user but maybe this isn't something you want to chase either. So I'm wondering how you view that as opportunity that informs the strategy. Ricardo Cardenas : David, if you think about what we've done over the last few years, we have significantly reduced marketing spending at Olive Garden. And we've talked in the past at how that could be about a 10-point drop in traffic for us. But we're focusing on driving core users to Olive Garden, core gas versus promotional users. And so what we see as an opportunity, we've got more capacity in our restaurants than we did before. But a lot of that in-restaurant experience has moved to the off-premise experience. As you see Olive Garden still at 25% off-premise where prior to COVID, it was much lower than that. So we see it as an opportunity to continue to focus on our strategy of pricing below our competition, pricing below inflation by finding other cost savings to help offset that and give our consumers a great value so they don't need a promotional message to come in and they just get a great value every time they come. David Palmer : Actually, on your slide deck, I just had a quick question on Slide 20. Your food inflation outlook looks like it's less inflationary on many of those line items, beef, chicken, dairy oil versus what you had previously, but your food inflation outlook is still the same at 7%. Is there some offset to what we're seeing? And I'll pass it on. Rajesh Vennam : Yes, David, it's really the fact that last 2 quarters were 15% was in the first quarter, second quarter was 13%. So as you look at the back half, really, Q3, we're thinking it's going to be mid- to high single digits and then Q4 is closer to flat. So if you do that, what that translates into on the year is closer to that 8% to 9% that's really the difference. I think when we spoke the last time, we expected a step change from the first half to the second half. And we are seeing that. However, it's not as big as we thought. It's still a pretty big change. I mean, as I just mentioned, we're going from mid-teens to high single -- mid- to high single digits as we get into Q3 and close it to flat for Q4. So pretty big change, but there were a few there are a few items that are higher than we would have expected, namely dairy, grains and produce, and quite a bit of this is weather-related and so that's actually baked into our expectations going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Jared Garber : Great. Thanks for the question. I think this was the first quarter that we've seen or the largest quarter of opens at Cheddar's and maybe several years. So I just wanted to get a sense of an update on the brand. I know it's a little bit of a lower income skew there as well. So maybe some commentary on the performance there and what you're seeing from a customer standpoint and if there's anything in terms of regionality where these new units were opened. Just any update on the brand would be great. Ricardo Cardenas : Jared, let me talk high level about chatter and talk a little bit about the opening. Cheddar's has made significant improvements in their business model. versus pre-COVID, even with significant inflation, they had a lot of productivity enhancements with the simplified menu and a streamlined menu so that we felt more comfortable opening restaurants at a quicker pace. Not only that, they have really built their leadership pipeline and have been able to staff all of these restaurants with managing partners that have run Cheddar's, and we have a pipeline of more ready to go as we open restaurants. So yes, this was our highest quarter of openings for Cheddar's. We opened 7 restaurants. Rajesh Vennam : Yes, versus last year. We had 7 restaurants versus last year at Cheddar's 4 in the quarter. And we -- those restaurants are performing really well. So they're primarily in markets close to where Cheddar's already exists. It's not like we're -- we have a lot of restaurants opening in brand-new markets. But we are looking at newer markets to open Cheddar's in. But as we mentioned early on in the acquisition of Cheddar's, we thought we had more room to infill markets that they already have restaurants. So that helps us leverage our scale in those markets that helps us leverage our supply chain and our people. Ricardo Cardenas : But again, high level, really proud of the work that JW and his team have done at Cheddar's, really proud of the progress they've made in staffing their restaurants, building their pipeline, and we're seeing some pretty strong performance in these new restaurants. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Harbor of Morgan Stanley. Brian Harbor : Maybe just to follow up quickly on the commodity comments. Do you see any kind of risk to the second half just based on some of those items that are -- have kind of surprised to the upside recently? Or are those things that can't necessarily be contracted? How do you feel about that at this point? Rajesh Vennam : I think there's always risk. As you think about, that's why we have a range of 8% to 9% as our assumption going in. We'll have to see how this plays out, right? I mean some of the stuff, like I have mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, Q2, the impact on product produce especially led us -- no one expected that. It came out of nowhere. It was weather related. There were 2 hurricanes and Florida, 2 hurricanes in Mexico, they just really destroyed the crops. And that cycle stuff is always a risk. We contemplated some of that in our guidance. Brian Harbor : Okay. And then you made the comment about just sharing some of the lessons from never ending possible at your other brands. What are you thinking about there? Is it kind of a change to promotional architecture? Or are there things you\u2019re not doing at some of those brands that you could be doing to kind of echo never in possible? A \u2013 Ricardo Cardenas : Yes. As you think about never ending possible, there were other things that we did during that time. We did a little bit more digital testing and those kind of things that we can leverage across our brands. But \u2013 more importantly, those filters that we use on what we\u2019re going to communicate. We\u2019re very strong and helped our brand \u2013 helped Olive Garden continue to build their business, elevating brand equity, very important, and we\u2019ve learned that, simplified the offer. We\u2019ve learned that and not a V discount. So all the investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years to price below what the consumers are seeing in inflation means that we don\u2019t have to really go into the net discounting range \u2013 the never-ending possible was $3 more expensive than it was in the past, and it was still a strong promotion for us. But that\u2019s not to say that everybody is going to be on television now, right? So Olive Garden is the 1 that has the real scale to be on television. The other brands have learned things about the digital testing that we did and just the fact of the construct of the promotion. Operator : Our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. David Tarantino : My question is on unit development and your comment, Raj, about construction costs escalating. And I just wondered if you could comment specifically on the returns you're getting on the recent openings or the expected returns you're getting on your upcoming openings? I know there's a lot of moving parts and I guess the main question is, is the numerator of the return equation keeping up with the escalation in the denominator? And are you seeing similar returns? Or are you getting to a point where the returns are starting to come down? Any color there would be great. Rajesh Vennam : Yes, David, let me start by saying pretty much on average. Our new restaurants exceed cost of capital by quite a bit. We had a big margin to begin with. Now the construction costs have gone up, so have our unit economics. So if you look at overall performance of where we are, I just mentioned earlier, our operating income this quarter was 160 basis points higher than pre COVID. So our 4-wall unit level economics have gotten better that helps mitigate some of the construction cost increases. Now with that said, we already -- we obviously want to continue to maintain the pace of opening. But we continue to monitor inflation in construction costs. And we are being very disciplined. There are a few times where we have walked away from some deals because the cost was too high even though that would have probably exceeded our cost of capital. We're just being a little bit more selective on that front. Now all that said, we're starting to see some green shoots on the construction side. The last few bids, I think, were more closer to or below -- slightly below elevated budget. But at least it's a positive sign. So we think there are -- there's some -- potentially this could lead to some decrease in the level of inflation over time. David Tarantino : Great. And I guess a follow-up to that is, are there projects going on inside the company to try to trim costs out of the box I know -- I think a prior question commented, the dine-in traffic has been softer for the industry. Are you thinking about building smaller dining rooms or anything of that nature to get the cost equation down? Ricardo Cardenas : David, as we think about our prototype designs for the future, we always look for ways to trim costs out of our prototypes and find new ways to build the new materials to use. We have built some slightly smaller prototypes or at all of our brands, not necessarily because of the to-go versus the dining room but because it makes it to go experience a little easier by shifting where that to-go area is. Remember, the dining room is the least expensive part of the building. right? So if you really want to take a lot of the cost out of the building, you got to take the cost out of the kitchen. And we think we've got a great kitchen, but we'll find ways to rightsize the prototypes for the market that they're in. without overcomplicating so that we have 50 different prototypes. But we, as I said, our development team is focusing on finding the most efficient building in the markets that we compete in. We've also taken some existing sites as restaurants have closed or their leases have expired for other brands. we've actually gone in and infilled those restaurants, which are slightly less expensive because you don't have some of the framing costs and some of the plumbing. So it helps us in that respect. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Curious as it relates to pricing, if you could speak a bit more to kind of what you've seen to date as it relates to the customer response to the pricing, obviously, with the strong sales trends, I'm assuming not a whole lot, but any thoughts with respect to resistance or customer feedback to pricing and how that impacts how you think about pricing going forward? Rajesh Vennam : Dennis, I think the reaction is not that dissimilar to historical meaning we are getting a pretty decent flow-through from pricing north of 90%. And so really not seeing any major pushback. We haven't seen any moderation on the check mix. There have been things here and there where maybe advertiser pricing, we may not have gotten the exact level of flow-through. But overall, when you look big picture, it doesn't look like there's a lot of resistance. Now we are pricing a lot less than our competitors. So I don't know what is happening with the industry itself, but our pricing is well below the industry. And maybe that's part of what -- why we're not seeing a lot of existence. Dennis Geiger : Great. I appreciate that, Raj. And just one more. Just wondering if you could speak a bit more to the staffing situation and the execution in restaurant. I think very encouraging that you spoke to being fully staffed, manager staffing levels at all-time highs, feedback scores from the customers sounds strong. But as it relates to the level of execution currently versus the potential, is there anything with respect to maybe the 10-year of your average employee right now, may be shorter than pre-COVID that can build going forward? Anything there as it relates to where operations are now versus maybe where you would -- where they can go or where you'd like them to go. Ricardo Cardenas : Dennis, we have a lower tenure today than we did before COVID because of the turnover over the time through COVID. Our turnover is still elevated from the pre-Covid levels, but it's getting better and it's getting -- we're working on getting it closer to what our pre-COVID turnover levels were. As we've mentioned in prior calls, our focus is on training these new team members and getting them more efficient and getting them more productive. And as we continue to get our turnover levels down, that will continue to be a focus for us. also training our existing team members to make them better and give them more opportunities to learn and grow. So we will continue to train. But your point on a slightly lower tenure that is true. And we think as our tenure gets back to more historical levels, which is going to take a little while. But as it does get back to historical levels, then we will improve our productivity slightly from there, too. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Carril of RBC Capital Markets. Chris Carril : So clearly, a lot of focus on Olive Garden this morning, but I was hoping you could provide some more thoughts on LongHorn and just the continued momentum you're seeing there. Maybe just any thoughts on how the brand is performing relative to the category? And then just anything else you're seeing that's driving the continued strong sales there. Ricardo Cardenas : Yes, Chris. Todd and his team, as we've said in the past, have been on a journey investing in quality and portion and that continues to pay off. They had over 7% same-restaurant sales this quarter. coming off a very strong result last year, right? So it was a pretty strong performance for Longhorn. Raj mentioned average weekly sales are longer and 25% above the pre-COVID levels. Now the state categories benefit over time, but Longhorn is holding their own in that stay category. They're doing really well. I would say traffic, unlike most of casual dining traffic in the long run down room is up versus pre-Covid. And it's, I think, one of the only full-service restaurant companies out there that have positive traffic in the dining room of anybody of scale. So we're really proud of what they've done. Remember, they were on the journey of simplification before COVID. So they're ahead of everybody else in our portfolio on where they were. And so they didn't have to worry about kind of flushing out that promotion guest that already happened. So really proud of what they're doing. I will also say the state category in general is doing well because they've got a great value. The state category in general has a great value. If you think about what we put on the plate for the dollars you spend, the consumers know that. And so we're going to continue to provide a great value at Longhorn and at all of our brands, but particularly a long run with the quality focus they've had, the simplicity that they've always had and the culture that Todd's building. Chris Carril : Great. And then maybe just following up on the earlier comments around the consumer. Can you provide any more detail in terms of like what you're seeing regarding mix contribution to the comp any kind of trade up or trade down, any shifts in behavior there, if any? Ricardo Cardenas : Yes, Chris. If you think about the mix, we're not going to comment as much about the mix impact to comp we did have a strong performance for everything possible that helped our comp. But we're not seeing -- as Raj said earlier, we're not seeing a big check management. We're not seeing a lot of shifting in mix because we've got a very strategic way methodical way we price so that we don't get mix changes when we take price because we've learned this system over time, and it's a proprietary way we do it, -- we use it with our data scientists here. So we haven't seen a whole lot of mix shift. And as I said in the beginning, we've seen -- and the economy has seen a shift from good to services. So that could be why you haven't seen a whole lot of shift in mix in our business and maybe in other -- maybe in our competitors' businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Two questions. The first one just on the competitive outlook. I'm just wondering whether you've seen any change in competitive behavior. Again, you're obviously servicing all ends of the spectrum here. So just wondering what you're seeing from the competition. I know some are concerned of a potential uptick in discounting to drive traffic if commodity inflation were to continue to ease, I know that's contrary to your strategy, to make sure not to deep discount, but just wondering what you're seeing across the competitive landscape? And then I had one follow-up. Ricardo Cardenas : Jeff, we haven't really seen a lot of deep discounting in the competitive landscape. There aren't many that are even on television. We've got one of the brands that had come off of TV over the years that have indicated they might come back on, but they're not talking about the discounting when they knew that. I think as Raj mentioned, our margins are about pre-COVID levels. I think we were maybe 1 of 2 companies in the public space that had improvement in margin versus pre-COVID. And most of them are talking about trying to improve their margins. So I'm not going to talk about what I think they'll do, but I'll get you back to what we're going to do. We're going to continue to focus on our filters to evaluate our promotional messaging or any messaging that we do, elevating brand equity, simple to execute, not at a deep discount, sticking to our strategy of core guest growth and reacting accordingly. So whatever the -- whatever our competitors do, we'll watch, but we're going to stick to what we've been doing. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then the follow-up is, broadly speaking, as you look at your fiscal '23 guidance, whether Raj, on the specific numbers or Rick, just in terms of the broader thought process. But what do you think is to prioritize the best to worst line of -- or in terms of all your guidance components, whether it's comps, inflation, earnings, prioritize the best to worst line of sight to any of those. Just wondering what you find more or less difficult to potentially forecast as you think about the next few quarters going into potentially slowing economy. Rajesh Vennam : Well, I think the biggest -- all the one that's going to have the most uncertain data is the traffic. I mean, what kind of traffic are we going to see? And we -- obviously, we've used a wide range of roughly 3% on the back half to accommodate some consumer shifts, but there's a meaningful change. That's -- obviously, that's something that could have an impact. That's really the big one. Dennis, inflation has been heard deferent, I mean there have been a multitude of factors that have been impacting inflation, right? You start with start off with the supply shortages and other things, labor impact. But now as labor starts to come down or get into a better shape, you've got weather events, obviously, global events. So there's a lot going on. inflation is probably the second one. And to me, those are the 2 things. Outside of that, I think everything else was probably pretty well buttoned up. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Peter Saleh : Great. Just 2 questions. First, on the never-ending possible promotion. Do you feel like the benefit of that never never-ending possible promotion, does that extend beyond the promotional window the 7 weeks? Are you able to hold on to those guests even though they might be purchasing something else on the menu? Ricardo Cardenas : Yes, Peter, as we think about any promotional activity or any limited time offer activity more specifically. We want to make sure that, that limited time offer still elevates brand equity as we've said before. And so we think there is a little bit of a halo over that. Now is it going to be as strong as when you've got the promotional message coming out there, a limited time offer message, probably not. But as we've said -- I think we said in prepared remarks, our year-to-date, our quarter-to-date comp sales are equivalent to our year-to-date comp sales. So it's not like we've seen a big slowdown since we stopped never-ending possible. Now that's across Darden, not necessarily across Olive Garden. But I think that's the idea of marketing or messaging is that should endure longer than the limited time offer, and we think this one did. Peter Saleh : Great. And then just on the competitive environment as it relates to new restaurant formation, there's been a lot of discussion around the surge in construction costs. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing more specifically on new restaurant formation from the competition, maybe more specifically independents? Are you seeing more newer restaurants being built? Or is there a pullback in development given the surge in construction costs? Any insight on that would be helpful. Ricardo Cardenas : Yes, Peter, there are always new restaurants being built. The question is how many are closing to offset the new restaurants being built. As trade areas move, you're going to see restaurants open. But as we think about the number of units that have closed since pre-COVID, but it's still double digits. We're not seeing that number get smaller or bigger, right? So it's starting to level off a little bit. But some strong competitors still opening restaurants on a net basis. We are opening restaurants on a net basis, but we're not seeing a whole lot of net unit growth in total for the full-service restaurant space. Now as the construction costs start to weigh and as Raj mentioned, maybe you'll see a little bit about that. But I think the margins make it a little bit more challenging. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Lauren Silberman : Rick, you mentioned 4 of the brands that are running at all-time high internal guest satisfaction levels. What do you think is driving these record levels? And any sense of how this might compare to guest satisfaction across the industry broadly? Ricardo Cardenas : Well, Lauren, I would say what's driving it is the things that we've been doing over the last few years. We talk about simplicity and how simplicity makes it easier for our teams to do what they do. And if they don't have a lot of different things they have to learn and execute, it gets easier. As we streamlined the menu over the last few years, as Gene even mentioned it a year ago, streamlined the menu, you have more items being -- fewer items being made more often. That means the team gets better at those items versus having these 1 or 2 items that you sell in a week. So that helps experience. Our team members have left to learn on the selling side because there's fewer items. So they get -- they understand the items more. Now what we've seen in our performance is our performance in our brands are getting stronger. We're not necessarily seeing the competitor situation move. They might have been flattening out or maybe a couple here or there have gone a little bit on the negative side. But our satisfaction, we're really proud of it. We're proud of both the internal measures and the external measures. And then finally, I will say we've made significant investments over the last few years in our food and in our people. and that will eventually show up in guest satisfaction, and it has. So we feel really good about what we're doing. And our brands having -- being #1 in all of the categories for Technomic, having a Darden brand being #1 in gets the first time ever. That's amazing news for us. And we're going to continue to do what we've done to improve satisfaction, to make it easier for our restaurant teams to do what they do and to invest in our people and invest in our food. Lauren Silberman : Great. And just a follow-up on the holiday season. Gift card sales are generally pretty important for early calendar '23. Anything you can share on what you've seen with gift card sales so far this season? Rajesh Vennam : I see they're pretty consistent with last year. I don't -- I mean, again, there's also gift card sales, the day before Christmas matters a lot. So there's still a little bit of time to go. And then we haven't discounted. We -- a lot of -- before COVID, we used to have some offers for gift cards. We have stop doing that. So pretty much all of our big brands, we don't discount. We don't provide any additional discount to buy gift cards. So for us to see the strength we are seeing without any discounts, we feel pretty good. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Sara Senatore : Just a follow-up on the capacity comments. I appreciate the detail on sort of net growth I guess my sense is though that there's growth coming from chains and shrinkage coming from independents. So maybe capacity, if you will, hasn't come down quite as much as unit count would suggest, given the chains tend to, I think, have bigger boxes and higher volumes. So I guess I'm just wondering if you have any kind of thoughts on that, this idea, there's this notion that maybe it's been more of the chains that have gotten hurt and therefore, there's still a fair amount of capacity out there being added. And then I just have a quick follow-up question on labor, that was, I guess, in line with expectations of the wage inflation, but we've been seeing such a moderation in wages, I guess, I'm trying to understand for some concepts, perhaps. So I'm trying to understand if there's maybe a difference across markets or geographical or segments, full service versus maybe limited service where statutory minimum wage increases have more of an impact. Just any color you can give on that because I would have expected, I guess, a bit more moderation there. Ricardo Cardenas : Sarah, this is Rick. I'll take the capacity question and I'll give Raj to get the labor question. So on the capacity, you're absolutely right. We've seen more independents, which some -- in some places are a little bit smaller in total seats than the chains. But I don't know if you can get 11% of the restaurants to come out and have capacity in seats grow. We have seen the chains that still are -- still opening restaurants, but not at the level they were before, and it's not helping offset all of the other capacities coming out of the system. And with the inflation on construction costs and the margins that a lot of folks have, it's a little bit harder to open restaurants as Raj said earlier, we've actually walked away from deals even though they were above our cost of capital because we thought we had some better deals. We're not quite sure that everybody can do all of that and still get -- open their restaurants and still get the same kind of returns they were getting before. So long answer to your question, but capacity is impacted by what kind of restaurant is opening or closing. And you're absolutely right. The independence is generally a little smaller. And so capacity seats are probably not down as much as units are down. Rajesh Vennam : Yes. And on the labor side, as you look at where we started the year, the hourly wage rate in our first quarter was mid-9. So I think we said 9.5%. Second quarter was 8.5%. So you saw like a full point change in the rate of inflation. We expect that to continue to go down maybe 50 basis points a quarter for the next 2 quarters. So we are seeing moderation Obviously, this takes time in terms of once you give somebody an increase, that's there, that impact for the full year. And then as we bring on new people, we are seeing that the -- there's not as much pressure on the starting wage as it used to be. It's still high. It's still way higher than pre cover, but it's not -- it doesn't continue to go -- it's not continuing to go up. And so hopefully, that answers your question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Andrew Strelzik : I just had 2 questions going back to kind of the food cost outlook. The first one as you move towards flattish commodity inflation or what have you in the fourth quarter, is there an opportunity to be a little more aggressive locking in where you can to improve that visibility on the cost side? Or are there still challenges doing that or maybe you think prices are going even lower. And so that's at play. So curious how you're thinking about that, number one. And number two, it seems like you're maybe a bit more optimistic on where food inflation is headed than some of the commentary from your peers recently. I know there's the food basket, there's timing differences. But I'm curious if there's anything else maybe that's driving that divergence in particular, I'm wondering if maybe this is the scale benefits playing out. So curious how you think about that as well. Ricardo Cardenas : Andrew, there's a lot in there. So I'm more to try to just address all the pieces. Let's start with the ability to lock in I think for some products, we have that for some, we don't. Like if you think about beef, for instance, I don't think -- I think a lot of suppliers are innovating more. They want to see what's going to happen with supply and really understand the price. So at this point, very few suppliers are willing to last beyond 90 days. So that's truly a structural issue in terms of really the ability, I guess, on that. But there are other products where we can lock in, and we are locking in. So we are continuing to kind of look at wherever there's opportunity to lock in at a good price, we're doing that. That's why you saw that for chicken, for example, we're 90% coverage for the back half. So we did find a price that we thought was good and we -- and closer to flat to last year as we get into the Q4 of this year. So we lock some of that in. And so we are playing it by the year. Our supply team chain team does a great job kind of really thinking through the best strategy to minimize inflation for us while leveraging the relationships. Obviously, as you mentioned, scale helps. Our contracts are bigger, and that gives us the ability to have a little bit more leverage. And again, this is Big part of this is long-standing relationships our teams have built teams have built with the suppliers that help us get to a better number overall rate that we pay. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher O'Cull with Stifel. Christopher O'Cull: Question relates to margin. And Raj, EBITDA margin has been up about 110 basis points, I think, relative to 2019 in the first half of the year, and I think your guidance kind of implies that the margin could be up 120 basis points or more in the second half of the year. I'm just wondering if you're expecting G&A to continue driving that improvement? Or are you looking for the restaurant margin to become a bigger contributor to the back half improvement? Rajesh Vennam : Yes. I would say that G&A actually the way -- because of the way we do incentive accruals, G&A is going to be probably higher in the back half than the first half. The restaurant-level margin should improve relative to pre-COVID in the back half versus where it was in the front half. But overall, if you step back, look at overall, your point is right. We do expect growth in the back half now. I'll point out that the starting point is way higher for the back half because our margins were very high in the back half to begin before cold. So we had more room to grow in the first half, and you saw that. But G&A, definitely, we expect G&A in the back half to be higher as a percent of sales than it was in the front half. Christopher O'Cull: And just secondly, the segment margin at Olive Garden, I think, compressed about 320 basis points year-over-year this quarter. Can you help parse out what drove that? And how much of it was intentional in terms of menu or labor investments? And how much of it was just due to inflationary pressure? Rajesh Vennam : It's really inflation. If you think about the 3 items I mentioned that have the highest inflation -- had highest inflation in the quarter, chicken, dairy, and we -- well, that's all has gotten for you. We got 20-plus percent. They have a little over 20% inflation on the commodities this quarter. So that -- when you take that into consideration and look at the fact that we only had 6.5% pricing at Darden level and Olive Garden, obviously, would be pretty close to Darden price in our price level. That's the biggest piece. And then one other piece I mentioned on the call was lettuce while we did not experience the same level of inflation as the general market, it was a big surprise. It was, call it, $4 million to $5 million impact in the quarter, that's meaningful. Operator : Our next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Danilo Gargiulo : I was wondering, in the context of potentially slower market environment, what gives you the confidence to raise the outlook for same-store sales? And in particular, on which brands you are elevating your expectations. Rajesh Vennam : Well, so actually, let me kind of explain how we got there. If you think about our pricing we had in the earlier guidance was 5%, now we're at 6%. We raised the coupon of our sales by 0.5 point. So essentially, we're saying on the top end, we're actually brought down traffic by about 0.5 point. And then on the bottom end, we basically raised it by the full point, which kind of gets to that pricing. So that's really the driver of our change in guidance. then the costs out of the cost -- we have some visibility into costs and we have some ranges around the ones where we have some risk, and that's how we came up with this guidance. Danilo Gargiulo : And can you also provide some context on perhaps the frequency of visits of your consumers by brand and whether you're seeing the frequency differently today versus historical averages, maybe by by some type of consumer cohorts or brands? Rajesh Vennam : No. I think look, our casual dining average frequencies and we call it in that 3 to 4x. And what we see with the core -- all of our brands are seeing over time, the investments we've made pay off and transmitting into a slight tick up in frequency. But again, this is a slow build. We always believe that we -- that's our bet is that this takes time. But we are seeing -- it is -- we're seeing signs of positive momentum. And I think is the fact that we outpaced the industry by over 500 basis points on traffic, tells you that things we've done over time are translating into some increased frequency. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro of Raymond James. Brian Vaccaro : My question is on Olive Garden. I think you said it was outperforming the industry comp even before the launch of the ring Pasta, which I think is a change versus the last several quarters. And -- just curious, what do you attribute that to? Have you seen the lower end consumer trade down in recent months? Anything in your data there? Or maybe it's execution and guest scores that are starting to kick in and really gain traction on traffic maybe some other dynamic you might offer up. Ricardo Cardenas : Yes, Brian. Oliver outperformed in Q1 as well. Just the outperformance got a little bit better. When you think about where we were last year, I would say that Olive Garden was probably more fully staffed than maybe some of the other brands in the first quarter of last year. And so other brands may have had a little bit of benefit from more team members. We continue to believe that the investments we made in Olive Garden will continue to pay off over time. And their staffing levels are back to where they were pre-COVID. There are improvements that they've made since pre-COVID in their food. And then finally, Olive Garden, California last year was a big jump for us, and we have a lot of restaurants in California, maybe there wasn't as much across the industry. And so -- that's why we believe that our gap to the industry got better from Q1 to Q2, even though it was positive in Q1. Brian Vaccaro : All right. That's helpful. And sorry if I missed it, but on pricing, what was menu pricing in the second quarter? And what's a reasonable expectation moving through Q3, Q4 on menu pricing, just how you're thinking about that? Rajesh Vennam : Yes, Brian, it was approximately 6.5% in Q2. And for the full year, we're saying it's going to be closer to -- so the way to think about it is Q3 is likely going to be low 6s, and Q4 is likely going to be closer to 5%. Operator : Our next question comes from John Evanko with JPMorgan. John Evanko : Guys, it's nice to see you coming back to brilliant with the basics. I mean, I think we probably first used that maybe 20 years ago or so. So it's definitely like a trade markable quote for you guys. And especially in the context of increased turnover. And I'm just curious in terms of like where you're seeing that, why you're seeing it first. Are you seeing some of the very high kind of unexplainable like fast quits like some others are? Or are you seeing -- is it a 6-month term over 12-month turnover 24? Is it happening in front of house, back of house? And is there anything that you can do to, I guess -- and the answer might be no, but can you make it a better job for them? And when they are leaving Darden, are they going to other restaurants? Or are they just going to other types of employment? Ricardo Cardenas : John, The -- John Evanko : Yes. I mean what is the -- I'm trying to determine what is you guys, what is the industry versus just what is the change in employee. Ricardo Cardenas : Yes. No problem. Yes, brilliant with the basics. It's been here since the jelly days. I remember when that was coined a long time ago. So we've been talking about reeling with the basics for quite a long time. And we believe that we got a little bit more basic, which is the right thing, right? So simplifying our menu, we went to the basic things and we did that better. That said, if you think about our turnover today versus what it was pre coved a lot of the turnover, at least over the last 6 months was 90-day turnover, right? So you come in to start work and then you leave within 90 days. A big chunk of our turnover was during that time period. So we -- all of our general manager conferences happen in August. And the focus and theme August and September, I guess, the theme of those conferences were making Brand X Y Z an even better place to work. how do we continue to make the team member experience better by giving them the tools that they need to do their job, treating them with respect and listening to their concerns. Our turnover is improving. Now I think about where the turnover happens. It generally happens in more of the entry kind of jobs. Our higher turnover is generally in the host area dish area. And generally, in the kitchen, we have more turnover than in the front of the house. That said, we've just completed our engagement survey with Gallup, and we feel really good about the engagement in our team. and we're going to continue to make our brands better places to work by continuing to invest in our team and continuing to teach them and give them opportunities to grow. So where they're going? Don't know, right? So we don't necessarily do exit interviews for every hourly team member on where they're going. But I would guess many of them are leaving the industry. We do have a lot of people that come to work for us that a board for others. So I can't say that we don't have people leave us to go work somewhere else. John Evanko : And gosh, over an hour ago, you guys -- one of the first comments you made on the call was manager staffing, I think, at historic highs. I mean is that the GM and all assistant manager positions or -- just give a little bit more color in terms of the stability in that essential role. Ricardo Cardenas : Yes, John, that is all manager positions in our restaurants. So General Manager, Well, general manager, it's a little bit harder to be all-time high, if you have one general manager for every restaurant -- that makes sense. But we're pretty close to that. So if you think about our restaurant manager staffing, it's at all-time high. We have more managers per restaurant today than we did before COVID. And part of it is because we are giving them opportunities to grow and we are proud of the fact that we do a lot of promotions from within. So when somebody knows the brand they're working for and they become a manager there, there's a little bit more loyalty to that brand. So -- and then the other thing, when you think about all the things we did during COVID, we made sure that our managers were we didn't really eliminate our manager teams during Cove. We kept them on because we knew how important they award to bring our team members back. And that's why we feel like we're well staffed and we're fully staffed to manage level. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nick Setyan of Wedbush Nick Setyan : Just a follow-up to an earlier question. I think you said you expect total restaurant labor inflation to go down by 50 bps sequentially through the end of the year from the 7% that we saw in Q2, that would imply for the year something around 7%, maybe slightly lower than 7%, but your total inflation guidance is 7% with 8.5% commodity inflation at the midpoint. So just maybe reconcile how we get from the combination of where total labor inflation and commodity inflation guidance is versus the total inflation guidance. Rajesh Vennam : Yes. I think the point here is you have to look at other line items. So utility is probably in that mid-teens -- low to mid-teens. That's part of it. And then we are seeing all other costs being in the low to mid-single digits. So when you take that into consideration, the total inflation of is what we're expecting. So yes, you're right, total restaurant labor inflation is approximately 7%. And you combine that with 8.5%, the big point of that 8% to 9% on prudent beverage. And then utilities in that mid-teens and all other costs low to mid-single digits, that's how you get to 7% on the total. So we're talking about the total cost base. That includes everything. Nick Setyan : Got it. And then as we kind of think about the inflation gap versus food at home, the gap has been pretty favorable for restaurants for a few quarters now, and that's potentially narrowing and maybe even may reverse next year in terms of calendar '23. How are you thinking about the promotional cadence and the overall competitive environment as that grocery gap maybe even reverses. Ricardo Cardenas : Yes, Nick, if you think about what people get when they go to a full-service restaurant, they get more than just the food. They get the experience. And that was -- that's what people are coming to us for. a great value already, but there's more than just the commodity that we put on the plate. It's all of the service, all of the other things that people get to do and being able to sit and spend time with their family and friends. And so yes, if there's a little bit of a shift in away from home versus at home, we still think we've got a great value proposition. That said, we're not going to get into what happens in promotional cadence happens, right? So if our competitors start doing significant discounting promotions, Can't say what I think they'll do. I just think their margins are -- makes it a little harder to do that. We're going to react the way that we've been talking about. We're going to continue to focus on driving our core guests driving profitable sales growth, and that's our focus for now in the near future. Operator : Our next question comes from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Jake Bartlett : My first one is on the commentary of expecting less traffic than before. So taking the traffic assumption down by 50 basis points. And I just really want to understand what is driving that? It seems like the -- in the second quarter, it seemed pretty solid or not diversion from expectations. So are you -- the question really is your outlook for the next 2 quarters a little bit less than you were thinking before? We've seen when [Navtec] put out for November, the slight deceleration year-over-year but also a deceleration versus '19. So if you could maybe comment on that -- on the industry and what -- how concerned investors should be about a deceleration just on the industry-wide in November? Rajesh Vennam : Jake, I think you're activating too much signs to this method here because when we look at how we do this, the midpoint of our guidance is about 75 basis points higher than last time with 1% pricing. So really, what we changed the midpoint by 25 basis points on traffic. That's within the margin of matter of many models we build. I mean, I wish we only had a 50 basis point margin effect around our models. It's obviously a lot wider. I hate to admit it, but I don't think -- we're not experts at prognosticating this business on. So we're doing the best we can, and that's our best estimate at this point. Jake Bartlett : Okay. And maybe just within that, if you could talk about just what you assume in your guidance for a macro environment. We're seeing, obviously, continued wage inflation. But if you build in -- others have talked about a modest recession or what have you. What is your basic framework on a macro perspective that's embedded in your sales outlook? Rajesh Vennam : Well, I think what we're incorporating is some potential shifts, changes in consumer behavior. That's why you have a range of 3 percentage points on traffic. If you look at the back half -- and if you look at -- translate that into the guidance range we have, that implies a range of 3 points, that is to accommodate potential changes in consumer behavior, but not a step change. And I said earlier, if there is a major step change, that's not really contemplated in our guidance. Jake Bartlett : Great. And then a quick question on G&A as a follow-up. I believe the guidance kind of -- before you've been talking about $400 million as being a good number for the year. You're running significantly behind that run rate in the first half, you commented that you expect it to go higher. But just roughly, what should we expect for just G&A as a whole for the year in '23 -- fiscal '23? Rajesh Vennam : Yes, Jake, at this point, our best estimate is $390 million. Operator : Thank you. At this time, it appears we have no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back to management for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Thanks, Todd. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday, March 23, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great holiday and happy new year. Operator : This will conclude our call today. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2023 fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, June 22nd, before the market opens followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing third quarter performance is a comparison to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence\u2019s, casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, and Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen. During our third fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales increased 7.2% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 3%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and our focus moving forward, and Raj will provide more details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2023 financial outlook. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter on both the top and bottom line. We significantly exceeded the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic, outperforming more on traffic than we did on sales. We also continued to underprice inflation, resulting in lower overall check growth relative to the industry. Our ability to make this investment and provide strong value to our guests reinforces the power of our strategy, which comes to life through our four competitive advantages and executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy. I am particularly proud of the way our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level by being brilliant with the basics. This intense focus on providing great food, service and atmosphere enables them to consistently create memorable guest experiences. During the holiday season, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse set new all-time weekly sales records, only to break them during Valentine's week. In fact, all of our brands achieved record total sales for the quarter. Of course, none of this would be possible without having the right people in the right roles ready to serve our guests. Our restaurants continue to be well staffed and our manager staffing remains at historic highs. Our leaders work hard to ensure each of our restaurants is a great place to work. During the quarter, several of our brands were recognized as industry leaders by Black Box Intelligence. LongHorn and Eddie V's received the Best Practices Award, which evaluates the brand's employee retention as well as sales and traffic performance. Olive Garden, The Capital Grille and Seasons 52 were honored with the Employer of Choice Award, which is based on workforce data, including employee turnover and gender and racial diversity. We know from our recent engagement survey results that our overall level of engagement is very high, and our team members understand what is expected of them at work. This is helping drive high guest satisfaction metrics, both internally and externally. Data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index shows customer satisfaction is down across all industries. However, across all of our brands, our internal guest satisfaction ratings remain exceptionally strong. In fact, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Yard House and Bahama Breeze achieved all-time highs during the quarter. Additionally, for the second consecutive quarter, the Darden brand was ranked number one among major casual dining brands in each measurement category within Technomic\u2019s industry tracking tool. Even with the traffic growth we achieved during the quarter, to-go sales remained strong, accounting for 26% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% at LongHorn and 12% at Cheddar's. We continue to leverage technology to make it easier to order a pick up and pay without having to pass the added expense of third-party delivery on to our guests. Our teams are executing the off-premise experience at a high level. For example, to-go orders accounted for 33% of Olive Garden's total sales on Valentine's Day, and they significantly improved their ratings for both on-time and order accuracy for that day. For the quarter, digital transactions accounted for more than 62% of all off-premise sales and 10% of Darden's total sales. Finally, we opened 7 new restaurants during the quarter across 7 states. Our new restaurant opening teams continue to do an excellent job of hiring and training new team members and successfully opening these locations. We are on track to open 25 net new restaurants during the fourth quarter, and I am confident in our ability to do so because of our well-prepared leadership pipeline and the tremendous support teams we have in place. We are fortunate to have the best team members in the industry, and I am proud of the focus and commitment they continue to display. On behalf of our senior leadership team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank all of our team members for everything you do to nourish and delight our guests and each other. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We had high expectations for the third quarter sales growth as we were wrapping on last January\u2019s Omicron outbreak and several weeks of severe winter weather that combined to reduce sales by over $100 million in the third quarter of last year. Exceeded those high expectations, posting record total sales of $2.8 billion, which was 13.8% higher than last year, driven by 11.7% same-restaurant sales growth along with the addition of 35 net new restaurants. This same restaurant sales performance outpaced the industry by 450 basis points, and our same-restaurant guest counts performed even more as they exceeded the industry benchmark by 700 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.34, an increase of 21.2% above last year. Total EBITDA was $448 million, and we returned $272 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter, consisting of $148 million in dividends and $124 million in share repurchases. Total pricing for the quarter was approximately 6.3%, 70 basis points below total inflation of roughly 7%. Now looking at our margin performance compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses rose 110 basis points, driven by commodities inflation of approximately 9%, which was higher than we anticipated going into the quarter and significantly outpaced pricing of 6.3%. Chicken, dairy and grains continue to be categories experiencing the highest levels of inflation, but each improved versus prior quarter as we expected. However, beef inflation increased from the second quarter level and drove the majority of our higher-than-anticipated commodities inflation this quarter. Restaurant labor was 120 basis points better than last year as we benefited from sales leverage and our restaurants continue to run efficient labor despite hourly wage inflation of 8%. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7%. Restaurant expenses were 40 basis points favorable to last year as we leveraged higher sales that more than offset elevated inflation on utilities as well as higher repairs and maintenance expense. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points lower than last year, driven by sales leverage. G&A expenses were 40 basis points higher than last year, driven by the timing of our incentive compensation accrual and other expenses. Operating income margin of 12.6% was 30 basis points better than last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%, and we ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $287 million. Now looking at our margin performance versus pre COVID, we grew operating income by 70 basis points, while underpricing inflation by more than 400 basis points since pre-COVID. Increased food and beverage costs were more than offset by improved productivity, reduced marketing and other cost savings initiatives. Looking at our segment performance. All of our segments significantly outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. Sales at Olive Garden grew 13.9% above last year, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 12.3%. Average weekly sales at Olive Garden were 108% of pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 22.5% was 150 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage and labor efficiencies. LongHorn sales grew 13.5% above last year, with same-restaurant sales growth of 10.8%. Average weekly sales at LongHorn were 127% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 80 basis points below last year, driven by elevated commodities inflation. Sales in our Fine Dining segment grew 13.2% over last year driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 11.7% and average weekly sales were 113% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 21.8% and was 110 basis points below last year, driven by elevated commodities inflation. Our other segment sales grew 14.1% above last year with the same restaurant sales growth of 11.7% and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 14% was 20 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage and labor efficiencies. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We have increased our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of $10.45 billion to $10.5 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 6.5% to 7%, approximately 55 new restaurant openings, capital spending between $550 million to $575 million, total inflation of 7% to 7.5% and annual pricing of 6% to 6.5%. Furthermore, we expect commodities inflation between 9.5% and 10%, the annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 123 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.85 and $8. This outlook implies fourth quarter sales between $2.73 billion and $2.78 billion, same-restaurant sales between 3% and 5%, diluted net earnings per share between $2.43 and $2.58. It also implies higher commodities inflation than we last communicated. We now expect commodities inflation that is solidly in the low-single-digit range for the fourth quarter versus the closer to flat estimate we shared with you on the last earnings call. Increase in commodities inflation is primarily due to higher-than-anticipated beef costs. For fiscal 2024, we anticipate opening 50 to 55 new restaurants and capital spending between $300 million and $325 million related to new restaurants and another $200 million to $225 million related to ongoing restaurant maintenance, refresh and technology spending. And while we don't normally provide a commodity outlook this early for the next fiscal year, we are anticipating low-single-digit inflation for the total commodities basket in fiscal 2024 led by high single-digit inflation on beef and produce. We expect all other categories to range from slight deflation to low single-digit inflation. With that, I'd like to close by saying that we continue to be very proud of how our teams are managing their businesses to deliver strong results in this dynamic environment. Now, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Chris Carril : So, I just wanted to talk or ask first about the top line trends. So, I guess, just given the choppiness in the comparison to last year, could you talk about the progression of sales through the quarter? Maybe specifically what you saw following the Omicron lap, and maybe perhaps what you're seeing in the current quarter just as we're trying to get a sense of where trends are shaking out kind of on a normalized basis? I know, Rick, you spoke of the strength around the Valentine's Day. So, any detail beyond that point would be great. Raj Vennam : Hey Chris, this is Raj. Good morning. So, when we actually look at our underlying traffic trends versus pre-COVID, excluding the noise from holidays and weather and promotions, they've actually been fairly stable month-to-month and that has continued into the fourth quarter. And basically, everything we know of the quarter-to-date is incorporated in our guidance. But when you step back and look at versus pre-COVID, it's pretty stable. Chris Carril : And then, I appreciate the preliminary commodity inflation outlook for FY24. So, thanks for providing that this morning. Any thoughts on -- or any guidance you could provide on how you're thinking about just pricing here going forward just relative to that commodity inflation outlook that you're providing for FY24? Raj Vennam : Yes. Chris, I think the way we think about pricing is we look at total inflation. And I think as we talked about, over the last three years, we\u2019ve underpriced inflation by over 400 basis points. And also, we\u2019ve underpriced full-service CPI by over 600 basis points. So, we created a significant gap between our competitors, and it positions us well as we head into the next year. We'll share more thoughts on our fiscal 2024 pricing plans the next -- in the June call. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Brian Harbour : Yes. Thank you. Maybe just a question on the labor side. I know that you're in a very good place right now on staffing. Do you still see -- as you look into next year, do you still envision taking up wages continually. And I think, obviously, we're in an environment where it's important to kind of retain people and continue to pay better than your peers. How does that kind of factor into what you expect from a wage inflation perspective going forward? Rick Cardenas : Hey Brian, this is Rick. Let's talk about our staffing. As we mentioned on our call, we're very well staffed. We have more managers per restaurant than we\u2019ve ever had in our history. So, we feel really good about where we are. We\u2019re not going to talk necessarily about what our wage growth will be next year. I will say that even before COVID, wage inflation was in the mid-signal-digit. So, we will continue to work with whatever the economy comes our way and however we can handle that. But we have a great employment proposition. Our turnover is significantly reducing. It's getting closer to our pre-COVID levels. And we still think we've got room to improve our turnover. We're hiring great people and we're being as discerning as we had been before COVID. So, we feel really good about where we are. And we'll talk about our inflation targets and our pricing and all of those things in June. Brian Harbour : Thank you. And maybe just on capital spending. I know you kind of took up the low end of that. But what's driving that? Is there -- is that more of an inflationary thing, or is there any sort of bucket of spending that's running higher at this point? Raj Vennam : Well, I think we've talked about inflation being one of the big things, right? When you look at construction costs have gone up quite a bit, especially when you compare it to pre-COVID, and we're ramping up growth. So, we do have -- I think this year, we said we're approximately 55 new units and then we talked about next year kind of in that 50 to 55 as well. So, it's really a function of the increase in construction costs. I think on the construction cost front, especially the FF&E for new restaurants has been growing quite a bit. And so that's -- it's -- you're seeing a 25-plus-percent increase in those costs related to pre-COVID. So those are really the big drivers. But having said that, given the improvements we've made to our business models and where our unit economics are, we still have pretty strong returns on our new units, and we continue to want to grow that. And that's why we do want to try to target as much growth as we can. Now, we're going to be disciplined in how we do that. But we have -- we're being a little bit more selective, but still, we feel like we have opportunity to take share. Operator : Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. David Tarantino : My question, I guess, Raj, if you could just tell us what level of pricing you are running in the fourth quarter. And just trying to frame up the comp guidance of 3% to 5% and what might be implied from a traffic perspective in that number. Raj Vennam : Yes. David, I think we have -- basically, we're going to be under 6%. So call it, 5.5% to 6% is probably what we're running or expect to be running in Q4. David Tarantino : Got it. And then, I guess then the guidance implies maybe slightly negative traffic. And I was wondering if you or Rick could you comment just on why you think that is? And is it a macro issue, or is it something else in your view? And maybe, Rick, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the current macro environment given all the volatility we've seen lately. Just how are you thinking about kind of the outlook for the next several quarters? Rick Cardenas : Yes. David, let's talk about the macro for the macro consumer. But if you think about where our guide is for the next quarter, if you look at it versus pre-COVID, you take out the Omicron change and the Never-Ending Pasta Bowl change that we did in Q2. When you think about pre-COVID, our trends are very similar, even what we're thinking about for Q4. So -- but as you think about the state of the consumer and the state of the economy, we've said this in previous calls, there's been a shift in spending from durable goods to services, restaurant businesses are benefiting from that. What's interesting is, for most of calendar year 2022, customer sentiment was pretty bad, but consumer spending was significantly high. So even though they were thinking that things were bad, they were still spending. And so, we think as long as the unemployment rate is low and wages are increasing, consumers should continue to spend. Casual dining same-restaurant sales improved sequentially each quarter during the fiscal year and our positive gap to the industry improved, especially in traffic. So, we feel like what we're doing is really helping us. I will also say the data from our proprietary brand health tracker suggests that most consumers are not pulling back from restaurant visits and they do not appear to be trading down from full service to limited service based on the data that we have. Now there is a tension between what people want and what they can afford. Consumers continue to seek value, which is not about low prices, consumers are making spending trade-offs. And food away from home is one of the most difficult expenses to give up because going out to a restaurant is still an affordable luxury for them. And so, what does that mean for us? For our brands, we believe that operators that can deliver on their brand promise and value will continue to appeal to consumers, despite economic challenges. And that's what we remain focused on doing, no matter what happens in the industry and whatever happens to the category. David Tarantino : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. The first one, just on the implied fourth quarter earnings guidance, looks like that's growth of maybe 8% to 15%. I know last quarter, you talked about maybe the third quarter and the fourth quarter should be pretty even in terms of growth both quarters. The third quarter grew 21%. So, it just looks like you're maybe tempering the earnings growth algo for the fourth quarter relative to the third. Just wondering whether you view that as conservatism or perhaps it's the modest uptick in inflation. Kind of how you think about the sequential trend from an earnings perspective in the fourth relative to the third quarter? And then, I had one follow-up. Raj Vennam : Hey Jeff. It's actually what you said. It's the commodities inflation. We did -- as we said last call, we thought Q4 was going to be flat, closer to flat. And then now that we're saying that's in the -- solidly in the low single digits. So, when you kind of layer that in, that's where the growth is a little bit less. But outside of -- that's really the primary dynamic that's different. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just following up on the macro question with interest rates still on the rise. I'm just wondering how does that impact your business or how you manage it, if at all, in terms of new unit growth, which seems to still be stable or how you think about borrowings or whether you think it impacts consumer behavior, maybe any return of cash decisions? Like, how does that come into play, if at all, as you manage the business? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Jeff, this is Rick. The interest rates really aren\u2019t making a huge impact in our business. We actually have a significant balance in cash. So, higher interest rates has actually given us a little bit more interest over time. You think about our new restaurant openings that we have seen inflation, as Raj mentioned. And so, we're being prudent in looking at some of these deals and saying, you know what, we might wait just a little bit of time to see if we can get a second bid sometimes during this year, we're only getting one bid for some of these sites. So we want to be prudent. But the interest rates really haven't done anything for us. And if you think about the consumer, they're still spending. We'll see what happens when these credit card balances, which were at record highs in December, come due, but they're still spending today. So, so far, nothing in our space. As it pertains to return of cash, we have a very strong dividend as we announced it again today. We feel like that's one way we return our cash to shareholders. We'll talk about our capital returns coming up in June. But it hasn't really changed our outlook and what we think about our long-term framework. So, if you go back to our framework and how we return cash to shareholders, we've got targets for our rough dividend as a percent of our earnings and how much we buy back in shares. This year, we've bought back somewhere in the $400-and-some-odd million and our share count target that we gave you would imply a little bit more in the fourth quarter. But we'll talk more about our return on cash and our long-term framework in June. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. And Rick, just to clarify, I think you mentioned before that you've seen relative stability in sales through the fiscal third quarter and even into March. Just from the outside looking, and I mean, with the most recent banking noise and things like that over the past few weeks. Does that lead to greater volatility day to day or week to week, or do you really not see it in the restaurant sales line, despite all the headlines that create so much noise for the broader macro? Rick Cardenas : Well, Jeff, I think if you think about March, when you think, volatility will happen in March just because of shifts in spring break. So you have to take that into account. But trends are fairly consistent. So, when you think about a state might change where the spring break is. So, that will show volatility at restaurants. But in general, we feel like our trends haven't really changed much. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Long with Stephens. Josh Long : In terms of the context of relative visibility in your business, how are you thinking about the marketing and the messaging opportunity as we go into the back half of the year and then into fiscal '24? I mean, still at kind of lower levels versus what we have seen on marketing spend basis versus prior years. Are you comfortable with that? Is there any reason to kind of adjust that strategy as we go into what could be a more challenging or potentially volatile macroeconomic environment? Rick Cardenas : Hey Josh, this is Rick. We're not going to get into too much detail on our promotional plans, but I would say that our marketing spend isn't going to be significantly different year-over-year. It might be 10 to 20 basis points either way, up or down as we think about next year. But as we've said before, advertising is always going to be part of Olive Garden's mix because of the scale advantage they have. And so, we'll continue to leverage that scale advantage with Olive Garden. And we'll use the filters that we mentioned before, to evaluate any marketing activity, elevating -- it has to elevate brand equity. It has to be simple to execute, and it's not going to be at a deep discount. And so, we plan on sticking to that strategy. But if things dramatically change, we'll react accordingly. And as we've said many times in the past, if and when we increase our marketing spend, we'd expect it to earn a return compared to where we would have been without it. So, it should be a positive ROI, and it shouldn't impact our -- it shouldn't hurt our margins. Josh Long : Understood. That's helpful. And then, maybe one follow-up for me. In terms of talking about the restaurant manager pipeline and the fact that you mentioned having more restaurant managers than you've had in your history. Can you talk about the benefits and kind of just the opportunities that unlocks from either a service component or how you should think about -- how we should think about that positively impacting guest experience as we go forward and maybe helping to drive that gap versus the industry a bit wider over time? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Josh. The manager role in our restaurants is the most important role we have, especially the general manager, the managing partner. And being fully staffed there gives them more time to spend with their team and train their team, develop them, make them stronger and just spend that time forecasting their business and spending time with guests. If you're under staff managers, the restaurant doesn't run as well. But the other thing about being fully staffed with managers and have the highest staffing in our history is that that helps us open restaurants going forward, right? If you think about our pipeline of new units, we have about 25 net openings coming in this quarter, and we are ready for it with the managers that we have. So, there's a lot of benefits of being fully staffed managers can spend more time with their team, they can spend more time with guests, and we have the managers to open our restaurants. Operator : Our next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Danilo Gargiulo : Good morning. So Rick, you mentioned that the ability to price below inflation is giving Darden the ability to grow faster than the market in terms of sales and traffic. So, are you expecting the same momentum to continue if inflation decelerates and food at home inflation perhaps increases at a lower pace compared to the food away from home inflation? Rick Cardenas : Well, our strategy has been this strategy for quite a while, and we plan on sticking to it. It's really helped us over the long term on whether inflation has been high or inflation has been low. If inflation comes down or things slow down, a lot of our pricing is already built in for next year based on where we are right now. And so, we'll be able to react accordingly. In the long run, we plan on pricing below inflation. But in any 12-month period, it might be a little bit higher, a little bit lower than inflation. That said, we believe that our scale advantage gives us the opportunity to find cost savings so that we can price below inflation in the long run, to drive a better value for our guests. And as we said earlier, guests appreciate value, especially when or if the economy slows down a little bit, they go for places that they get a great value and they get great consistent experiences, and that's what we intend to provide. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. And maybe, Raj, what caused the marginal deceleration in expectations on net new units? And if you can also comment on your recent comment of strong returns in the new units and that you're going to be a little bit more selective. So, can you share how the real estate strategy is evolving over time? Raj Vennam : Yes. So a couple of things. The new units, I think we talked about, part of it is just the construction delays and the challenges we've had. And we are still opening quite a few. I mean, our expectation for this year is approximately 55 new openings. So, we're opening quite a bit. As far as the comment on the returns, when we look at our new units actually -- especially the recent openings have actually outperformed on the top line more than we expected going into. So, they are actually opening at most of our brands. They're opening at volumes that are exceeding what we would have estimated going into the -- when we approved the capital for the project. So overall, we always had a lot of headroom in our -- in terms of the returns versus our cost of capital. And so, we are exceeding the hurdle by a wide margin even with the increased construction cost. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : I wanted to ask one more on margin and maybe Raj, if there's any update to how you're thinking about holding on to gains longer term that you've seen since the pandemic? I know you've recently kind of spoken more to a long-term total return algorithm rather than sort of an annual margin growth number. But just curious if you have any new observations or thoughts on sort of longer term margin trajectory, given what you've seen recently? Raj Vennam : Yes. Dennis, I think we've talked about this year -- we've been purposeful and deliberate in actually choosing to price where we price, right, over the last few years because of the gains we have had versus pre-COVID. Our intent would be to try to grow from these levels. But in a given year, it can be different. Ultimately, we do go back to that 10% to 15% TSR. That's the EPS growth plus the dividend yield. And how we get there, any given year might be different. But from where we are starting at the end of this fiscal year, we expect to build margins over time. Dennis Geiger : That's great. I appreciate that. And just one more, just on the 24 new openings, can you speak to whether the breakdown by brand will look similar sort of to what you've seen in prior years? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Yes. I think you're going to see a little bit more of Olive Garden openings just because they have the best returns in the portfolio, and they have -- we've shared that we think there is more opportunity for growth coming out of the pandemic. So, you might see 20ish in for them and then mid-teens for LongHorn and then everybody else making up the rest. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Jeff Farmer : Great. Just following up on margins, some of the stuff you just discussed. But you did touch on marketing but your restaurant expense and G&A as a percent of revenue are running at looks like roughly 100 basis points below pre-COVID levels. Do you think that lower cost structure of both the restaurant and corporate level is sustainable moving forward? Raj Vennam : Yes. We always focus on -- that's the opportunity for us. When we talk about our scale benefiting, we always are trying to take costs that are not directly impacting the guest. So, that's really restaurant expenses and G&A are the two places where we think our scale benefits us the most in terms of being able to take costs out, leverage our scale. And so, we do expect those to continue to be -- maintain a wider gap to pre-COVID, positive gap. Jeff Farmer : And then, just one more on the -- follow-up on the lower income customer sort of demand profile. You've obviously pointed to some slowing demand there, but I'm just curious how that manifests itself? Is that sort of reduced visit or check management? How does that show up when that lower income customer changes their behavior? Rick Cardenas : Yes. In the past, we had talked about our lower income consumer, over the last few quarters, the mix shifting down a little bit, but still being above pre-COVID. The good news is we haven't seen a material change in mix from the last time we talked to now in that lower end consumer. But if it manifests itself, it generally starts with managing check. Generally, consumers will manage their check first, and then they'll manage their visits later. And so far, we really haven't seen a whole lot of check management. So, that tells you, based on what I said earlier, consumer sentiment was pretty bad in '22, but consumers still spent. And as people shifted to restaurants, we benefited. So, we haven't seen it yet. We may see it. And when we do, it will start at check probably and then it will impact probably more likely impact our lower-end consumer brands, not that they're lower end brands, they just have a bigger mix of lower-end consumers, and it will impact less our high-end brands. But that's the benefit of a portfolio and the portfolio that we have that we can withstand shocks to one segment of the population. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Andrew Charles : One quick bookkeeping question. Raj, as we think about 2023 EPS guidance, is roughly $390 million still the right number for G&A? Raj Vennam : Yes. That's right. Andrew Charles : Okay. And then I realize that you guys are going to provide 2024 guidance on the 4Q call. But just in the backdrop of this uncertain macro environment, combined with inflation has just proven stubbornly high. Can you talk about your confidence in the ability to deliver 10% plus TSR in 2024 and just the different avenues you could take to get there if we were to see a slowing consumer backdrop? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Andrew, this is Rick. I will say that if you think about our confidence returning a TSR of 10% to 15% in any one year, we've said many times that in any one year, it could be below that or above that. And remember that\u2019s earnings growth and dividend yield. I will say, go back in our history since we've been a public company, we've never had a 10-year period that we have had less than a 10-year -- 10% annualized total shareholder return. So, we feel confident over the long run that we're going to get to 10% to 15%. We're not going to talk about next year. But I would feel like we're pretty confident we should be able to get there. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi. Jon Tower : Awesome. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. I was really -- I was struck by the commentary about your own consumer survey suggesting that your customers are not trading down from limited service -- excuse me, away from full-service into limited service. Frankly, it's counter to what we've been hearing from a handful of operators in recent weeks. So I'm curious to hear from you, is that broadly speaking about just your -- or is that speaking specifically about your brands, or is it more broadly about the full-service category? Number one. And then number two, can you talk about what these customers are telling you as to why they're sticking with your brand versus trading down elsewhere? Are they using you differently now than, say, in years past, when thinking about their own budgeting for going out or eating away from home? Rick Cardenas : Yes. Jon, this is Rick. What we said earlier is most customers aren't. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't any customers shifting from full-service to limited service, but most aren't. And we're not really seeing that in our results. So, others might be, but what we have been doing is providing a great value. We've actually taken a lot less pricing than most of our competition. So, that might be a reason that others might be seeing that when we're not. And we're improving our guest experience. So, at the same time that we've taken pricing that was lower than inflation by Raj said, 400 or 500 basis points versus pre-COVID, we've been improving our experience. Our customer satisfaction is growing. We've had records at Cheddar's and Yard House, as I mentioned already. So, I think that's what people will crave when environments get a little bit tougher. They crave things that provide them a great value. And that gives them a consistent experience. And we've been doing that, and we'll continue to do that. Jon Tower : Okay. So, you're suggesting that this brand survey work you did is more specific to your brands than necessarily the whole full service category? Rick Cardenas : No, I'm not suggesting that it's only our brands. What I'm saying is that most consumers aren't trading down. Some are, but most aren't. And in prior big downturns or things like that, we had a lot -- we had a lot more consumers trade down. We haven't seen that. Now, when I talk about specifically to our brands, our satisfaction is up. Our value is better than it was before. So, there's a little bit of both in my answer, industry and us. Jon Tower : Got it. Okay. Just circling back to the marketing question. I know we hit on it a few times already, but I'm curious what the trigger might be. Are you going to be a little bit more reactionary in terms of waiting to see some slowdown or if there is one that comes before necessarily pulling that trigger? And I understand the context that you put around how you would go after increasing marketing by not necessarily offering deep discounts. But just curious to know what sort of triggers you're looking for in the marketplace? Maybe it's just the slippage in traffic, either relative or absolute before you start spending a little bit more on the marketing side? Rick Cardenas : Hey John, it's Rick. We're not necessarily going to talk about specific triggers. What I can say is we're going to be very prudent in our marketing spend. We've done a lot over the last few years to simplify our business to make it easier to operate and we've done a lot of testing during this time on what marketing really does drive. And when things change dramatically, we may change. But right now, we're going to continue to stick to our strategy of making our communication be much more branded, elevating brand equity, simple to execute, and we don't expect it to be a deep discount. So, we've -- this industry has gone through this before, buying guests, and we're not ones that are going to go out and buy guests. We're going to continue to do what we do and strengthen our business. And if things change, then we may react. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Just a follow-up on that, I think. I know we've talked about most consumers not trading from full service to limited service and certainly giving up dining out, something that people don't want to do, especially when they're employed, but you're guiding, and I assume a lot of guidance over the next three months or so, is assuming a negative same-store traffic. So I guess the question is the grocery in terms of total number of meals consumed is still bigger than restaurants, actually multiple, maybe 2-plus x restaurants depending on how you want to calculate it. Grocery pricing has actually been well in excess of restaurant pricing. It remains so now. When you guys think for it and this is, I guess, a forward-looking question, really a view of your industry. Grocery pricing oftentimes follows commodities. Commodities are expected to drop just in your own language from what was 10-plus percent to very low single digits. Is there like a way to kind of be prepared for grocery kind of retaking relative value relative to restaurants? And is that something that you think about internally and maybe to Jon Tower's question of maybe bringing back some advertising, bringing back some promotion just to make sure that you're keeping customers maybe the bottom 5% or 10%, whatever you want to say, still coming your brand and using the brand even if year-over-year grocery start and other brands, perhaps limited service included start to emerge as a pricing opportunity for them. Rick Cardenas : Yes John, thanks. It's Rick. One of the things I want to let everybody make sure they hear is we're not going to risk margin, significant margin declines because of what happens in the economy. If food costs go down, think about what we've said in the past, a 1% decline in commodity inflation will offset a 2% decline in traffic, all else equal, with us doing nothing. So if commodity costs come down and inflation comes down, we can weather a little bit of a traffic decline and still get to the same EBITDA. So, I think we have to think -- and the industry has to think long term about how they drive traffic through discounting. And we have made that shift and we made that shift, even started it before COVID to drive traffic through better experiences, better overall value and not discounting to a very small -- a small portion of our guest base. So, that's our strategy going forward. If things change, we'll let you know. John Ivankoe : Well -- and I think that's very clear to lesson permanently learned, not temporarily learned, and I think that's important certainly to hear and express. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Chris O\u2019Cull: Rick, you've tied the traffic outperformance this quarter to less pricing than the competition. So, I'm just wondering why you believe consumers are now noticing that difference in relative value. If there was some sort of trigger with a marketing or advertising effort, or what do you think has caused that change this quarter? Rick Cardenas : Hey Chris, I would say that I don't think it's just this quarter. I think it's been a long time what we've been doing. We've been underpricing inflation. Even before COVID, we started underpricing inflation, and we've been putting more on the plate. And so, we've actually invested while underpricing. And so, if you look at variable margin, contribution margin, just take Olive Garden, for example, you can't do the math. But if you look at contribution margin in Olive Garden, it's lower today than it was before COVID. But their margins [indiscernible] are up. So our consumers are seeing that they're getting more value when they come into the restaurants, and that doesn't take -- it doesn't take a week to figure that out. It takes them a long time to figure that out. And that's why when we talk about what we're doing, you have to think about this over the long run because we're not shouting out to the rooftops that we've done this. The closest that we did to that was brought Never-Ending Pasta Bowl back at a $3 higher price to show people that we still have some great value in our restaurants, and Olive Garden being on TV talking about the things that make their brand special. Right now, where we've got back on our advertising and sauces sold and talking about our freshly made cases every day, while we still have a 15-second spot talking about our never-ending first course. And so -- and that never-ending first course is on us. There aren't many brands that actually give you never-ending that for every item that you order. And so, again, it's not something that we necessarily talk about. We don't go out and shout from the rooftops that we have lower prices than others do or we've priced less. They see it as they come into our restaurants, and that builds over time. Chris O\u2019Cull: That's great. And I know you guys have a rich consumer data set. I mean, does your data indicate that certain consumer segments have increased their frequency of visits, especially at Olive Garden? Rick Cardenas : What I would say is versus pre-COVID, our data would tell us that -- that we're getting a little bit younger than we were before COVID across all of our brands, and that's somewhat driven by an increase in to go business. But the great news is a lot of these folks had actually used us for to go for the first time, and that's their first visit to us, are actually starting to come into our restaurant, too. So it was kind of a handshake to come in. And so we're slightly younger, but our consumer segments are fairly similar to what they were before. And that's great news for us. We're also getting a little bit more frequency in our core guests. And that's really what we've been focusing on. So, the good news is our consumers are not that different. They're slightly younger. That means that we don't have to really change what we're doing because we can keep talking to our consumers just like we have been before. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Katherine Griffin : Hi. Thank you. This is Katherine Griffin on for Sara. I just wanted to ask again on marketing, sorry. Just if you could speak a little bit about what you're seeing at other restaurants, if you're seeing them ramping up on marketing and promotional spending? Rick Cardenas : Hey Katherine, this is Rick. You probably see it just as much as we do. But I can tell you that there's a big competitor that just went back on TV and they talked about it before, they did it. And you've got some of these other competitors that are out there a little bit more on television than they were before. That said, Olive Garden still is usually in the top 2 or 3 of advertising spend in our space, and we're doing that through branded kind of advertising versus deals. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Andrew Strelzik : I just wanted to ask about the customer satisfaction scores you mentioned and you talked about records, I believe, or all-time highs at Cheddar's and Yard House and maybe Bahama Breeze as well, but not at Olive Garden and LongHorn. It does sound like they're up, but not maybe as much as some of the others. So I guess I'm just curious what your perception is of the difference between the two, why maybe those aren't up as much and how that maybe is guiding your strategy going forward? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Andrew, this is Rick. Let me start by saying that satisfaction at Olive Garden and LongHorn are significantly high, and our other brands, our fine owning brands are very high. And so it takes a little bit more to move them up significantly versus what we've seen at Cheddar's and Yard House. Cheddar's and Yard House and others have made significant improvements to their brand, significant improvements to service and significant improvement to value, and customers see that. And so, we've had great performance at our -- at those brands that I mentioned, having record highs. But I wouldn't tell you that the others aren't at or near their records. It's just Cheddar's and Yard House actually made a record this quarter. Andrew Strelzik : Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And maybe just one other one about the value proposition. And obviously, you're very positive on how that's driving the comps. We're coming out of a period now -- or the pricing environment overall maybe seems to be settling a little bit. And I'm curious if you've gone through the exercise or maybe just an ongoing exercise where you've looked at where your brands stand and what are the different pieces of the menu seeing now? I'm curious if there's any opportunities to address within menus or within brands, now that maybe things have settled a little bit. Rick Cardenas : I think we always look at what -- where we have opportunities within menus, within brands, within regions of the country, and we will never stop. What I would tell you is we feel really good about where our pricing is, and we feel really good that we've been able to price well below what most of our competitors have done. And that gives us, as Raj said, some room to take a little bit more pricing if we want to take a little bit more pricing. And so, we will always look, and we generally try to price restaurants into strength and not into weakness, and we have a lot of great data scientists here that help us look at that. And we also talk to our operators and get their perspective. So that won't change no matter what happens in the economy or what happens with others. We'll continue to do what we do, and we feel like we've earned the right to keep doing what we've done. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : I think investors are looking at the industry trend and they're thinking about comparisons on a multiyear basis. And they're thinking the industry is going to go flat, something like that in the second half of calendar '23. And so, that's sort of where people's heads are with regard to casual dining. I wonder, do you think that is too pessimistic? I mean, based on what you're seeing because, obviously, four-year trends don't need to stay stable. But if that were to happen, your gap is positive to that industry at this point. And you've been very clear on this call about you're not wanting to pull levers unless it really got bad. But if you're doing 2-plus points better than that and you're coming along in the low single digits, would you not really change your mix too much with regard to the advertising and the value marketing and kind of stay the course? Rick Cardenas : Yes. David, I don't want to talk necessarily about the second half of fiscal -- of calendar '23 because that's fiscal '24 for us. But I think if you look back in history and you look back in other slowdowns, if that is what happens, and you look at some of our brands, Olive Garden significantly outperformed during that time because guests go for -- where they see value and they go to trusted brands, and I think Olive Garden is one of the most trusted brands out there. So, we would expect that we could outperform. I can't say we will, but I think we -- I think that's what our history would stay. And so, we're going to look at our marketing mix just like we've done in the last few years, and we may move it a couple of tenths here or there. But unless something dramatically changes, we don't anticipate doing anything differently. David Palmer : The other thing I was wondering about is just seeing those Cheddar's scores being number one in value, first of all, congrats on all these scores. But Cheddar's has a big TAM potentially. I mean varied menu is a big thing, originally this might have been thought to be bought and become a bar and grill killer that varied menu is a big category and value scores are going to help you move into the center of the country much better returns. So any thoughts about maybe metrics on returns and you're growing 11, 12 units right now a year. Why can't that maybe go up quite a bit as you see that brand where it is today? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yes, David. I would say when we bought Cheddar's, we thought they had a lot of opportunities ahead of them. We still believe they have a lot of opportunities ahead of them. And we're going to be prudent on their growth as we make sure that they have the leadership teams for their restaurant to grow. I said it at ICR that the world is littered with brands that grew too fast, and we're very, very strategic on how we open our -- grow our brands. And so, the days of 10-plus percent growth for a brand at Darden, that doesn't happen very much. And so with Cheddar's, we're going to be prudent. We're going to open in the single digits for a little while to see how they continue to do. And as we infill markets that they already have restaurants in, and we find ways to get into new markets, as long as we have the people to do it, we can grow them. And I will tell you that John Wilkerson and his team have done a great job developing their people to have people ready to open these restaurants. And the more pipeline we have of people, the faster we can open. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Lauren Silberman : On the traffic outperformance, 700 basis-point gap, do you view this level of outperformance as sustainable, or how do you think about the outperformance? Rick Cardenas : Hey Lauren, this is Rick. 700 basis points of outperformance is pretty strong. It all really depends on what the total traffic growth is for the industry. If we do -- if the industry is growing at 1%, do we expect to get 7% every quarter in outperformance, no? And if anybody would say that, I think that's thinking a little bit too hard. We're very pleased with that outperformance of 700 basis points this quarter, but we wouldn't expect to be 700 basis points every quarter. And there might be quarters that we have lower performance and traffic than our competition. But we think about this over the long term. And over the long term, we expect to outperform. Lauren Silberman : And then just on M&A, I know you've talked about that in the past and interested in another brand. I guess what are you seeing in the current environment? Any change in the calls that you guys are getting or valuation? Rick Cardenas : I don't want to get into the detail on calls we're getting or valuations we're getting. All I can say is we've said before, biggest competitive advantage we have is our scale. And one of the ways to build that scale is to buy other brands. And as volatility reduces, price discovery improves. And so, that's what we've got to continue to think about. And interest rates have made some change. So, we still feel like we'll talk to our Board when the right opportunities come to play, and we'll be ready when they do. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Just as we look at the quarter, your EBIT margins obviously expanded this quarter, but it was the first time in many quarters that we saw EBIT margin expansion. And it seems to be primarily driven by Olive Garden when we look at the segments. Olive Garden was the only segment that showed measurable margin expansion this quarter. The other segments were actually down on average. So, can you talk about the drivers of the bifurcation in margin performance for Olive Garden versus the rest of the segments? And is that kind of how the margin trend should continue over the next couple of quarters? Raj Vennam : Hey Brian, any given quarter, I think the brand to brand, it's a function of the pricing versus inflation. So, if you look at -- and frankly, as I mentioned, in the third quarter, beef was the biggest surprise, right? So for instance, our LongHorn and to some extent, our Fine Dining brands, they weren't prepared for that level of inflation. So the pricing hadn't been in place. And like I said in the past, the way we think about pricing is we're not going to overreact to near-term fluctuations. We kind of think about what's truly the more secure part of the inflation and try to price for it. And so, there was a little bit of really noise on that front this quarter that impacted the other segments. With that said, Olive Garden is our largest brand. I mean, that is -- it makes up over 50% of our sales and 55% or more of that profit. So for us to grow, you got to see Olive Garden to have some growth, or it takes a lot of heavy lifting from everybody else to make up. But the other thing with Olive Garden was we did -- some of the costs did moderate from where they were in the second quarter. So if you recall, second quarter, it was the other way around where the margins were deteriorating. And the third piece is Olive Garden was disproportionately impacted by Omicron last year. We talked about that last year. Now, as we wrap on it, they're benefiting from some of that. There were labor inefficiencies last year, so -- especially for them because of their geography and because of the demographic mix of their gas, it hurt them most and now you're seeing them outperform the most. Brian Bittner : And then just a follow-up, the labor margin leverage for the consolidated model was incredibly strong this quarter relative to any recent quarters in the past, and I realize your sales were strong this quarter, above average. But was there anything else going on within the execution of the labor margin this quarter outside of strong sales that you can point to that help that leverage amplify this quarter, so we can think about how labor can potentially be executed moving forward? Raj Vennam : Yes. Brian, I think that's -- so obviously, as you mentioned, sales is the biggest part, but we are seeing turnover get better. And I think we called out last year, we had a lot of sick pay and some inefficiencies in labor last year because of Omicron. And so that's actually also helping. But you do see a quarter-to-quarter improvement, right? I mean, I think we progressed by over 100 basis points from second quarter to third quarter. And that's really the function of sales delta. We had almost $300 million more in sales, and that helps with a lot of leverage. And then the last piece, as I said earlier, is the retention is getting better, and that helps with improved productivity. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim Securities. Gregory Francfort : Rick, my question is just on your -- maybe how to think about margins, not necessarily in '24, but the next few years. Just because within your long-term framework of 10 to 30 basis points, when I look at this year, you had a big step down and a lot of that was food cost pressure. And I'm just wondering if you think that 10 to 30 basis points is the right way to think about it, and maybe does more of that come on the store-level margin side versus the G&A in the next several years? Any updated thoughts on that would be helpful. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Hey Greg, thanks for the question. What I would say, first of all, is we've got that long-term framework of 10 to 30 basis points of margin expansion. We had significant margin expansion during COVID. And we talked about it last year that we'd probably give some of that back this year. So, we had significant expansion during COVID of over 200 basis points, I think to 250, and now we're closer to 150 pre-COVID. And so, as we think about going forward, as we get to our long-term framework and we still think our long-term framework will hold over time. And some of that will come probably at maybe a third to half of that will come below the restaurant level as we think about leveraging other costs. But as traffic grows and same-restaurant sales grow, we should still get some from the restaurant. But G&A should be some of that savings going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Brian Vaccaro : My question was just on labor and operations. There's obviously been a lot of new hires across the industry in the past 6 to 12 months. Are there any metrics you can share that speak to the proficiency of your staff and how that's benefiting operations? And just kind of to what degree you think that that could be driving your widening performance gap to the industry? And then also, would you be willing to share kind of where your manager and hourly turnover is currently running? Rick Cardenas : Yes. Brian, let me start by saying we've had a reduction in turnover, which has been helping us. Our team members are starting to learn more about what they do, especially the newer team members. And as I mentioned earlier, our manager staffing is at pretty high levels. And so, they can spend more time teaching their team and getting more productivity out of their team. Without getting into too much detail on turnover, our turnover is closer to pre-COVID levels than COVID levels. And we would intend to get it back towards those levels. What I would also say is our gap to pre-COVID isn't that different than it was. So, as the industry gets better, we're getting better. And so, we feel like we'll continue to improve. And what we've seen over the last couple of quarters is a really big improvement in turnover. So, I think people now feel like they understand how their -- what their job is and how to do it. We've actually spent a lot more time, as I said on our last call, every one of our General Manager, managing partner conferences in August, talked about how to make our each whatever brand a better place to work -- an even better place to work. It was already a great place to work. And those things are bearing fruit. So, our turnover is getting better. Our first 90-day turnover is significantly improved from where it was just six months ago because of the focus that we're putting on training and making sure that those team members feel up to speed before they get thrown out on a busy Friday. Brian Vaccaro : All right. Great. That's helpful. And I guess my quick follow-up, just on pricing, Raj, I heard your comments on your expectation for the fiscal fourth quarter. But could you let us know how much have you taken or how much did you take in the fiscal third quarter or have planned to take in the fourth quarter? And just thinking with a little more pressure on commodities, has your thinking changed on sort of the arc of your pricing and how quickly you might look to let that moderate over the next few quarters? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Yes, Brian, I think I'm not going to comment on past Q4, but I will tell you that if you look at where the pricing has been, second quarter was 6.5%, third quarter that we just completed was 6.3%, we expect fourth quarter to be under 6%. So the peak pricing for us on an annual basis is behind us. I think it's going -- unless something dramatically changes, we see pricing coming down. And I can -- and I know not to compare to some -- everybody else, but the -- when you look at what's happening in the market, I think most people are on an upward trend on pricing. We think we're actually from here on a downward trend. And -- but overall, though, that's actually translating into the results we've talked about. And then when we started the year, we started with 100 basis points -- target of roughly pricing below inflation for this year of about 100 basis points. I expect us to end in that range. Operator : Our next question comes from John Parke with Wells Fargo. John Parke : I guess there's been a lot of focus on trade down to low end, but I guess are you guys seeing any signs that that middle income consumer is moving more into like your value brands and coming a bit more? Rick Cardenas : Yes, John. We really haven't seen a whole lot of change in mix across of our brands. And I would say value brands versus not, if you look at our release today, we had same restaurant sales ranges between the different segments between I think it was 10.8% and 11.7%. So three of our segments I think actually had 11.7% comp. And our total comp for the company was 11.7%. So it's very consistent across. And all of our brands had very, very strong same restaurant sales. John Parke : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time we have no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Kalicak for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Great. Thanks Todd. That concludes our call for today. I would like to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 22nd before the market opens, with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in the call today. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to the Darden Fiscal Year 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Darryl. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden\u2019s President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings on Thursday, September 21, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. During today\u2019s call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing fourth quarter performance is a comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. And any reference to annual pre-COVID performance is a comparison to the trailing 12 months ending February of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results today refer to Black Box Intelligence\u2019s casual dining benchmark excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen. During our fourth fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales decreased 0.7% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 7%. And during our full fiscal year 2023, industry same-restaurant sales increased 2.7% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 5.5%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks recapping the fiscal year, Raj will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year financial results and share our fiscal 2024 financial outlook and then, Rick will close with some final comments. Now I will turn the call over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter to conclude what was a very strong year. Despite a tough environment, we significantly outperformed the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales and traffic and met or exceeded the financial outlook we provided at the outset of the year. For the full fiscal year, we grew sales by 8.9% to $10.5 billion, delivered diluted net earnings per share of $8 and opened 57 new restaurants. We also opened nine new international franchise restaurants in six different countries, which is the most we've ever opened in a fiscal year. The market responded positively to our performance, leading to a total shareholder return of 32.6% for the fiscal year. We have consistently delivered strong long-term shareholder returns. In fact, since Darden was spun off from General Mills 28 years ago, a period which spans multiple business cycles, the company has achieved an annualized TSR of 10% or greater over any 10 fiscal year period. Our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level by remaining focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere. Our brand's ongoing efforts to drive execution through simplification enable our restaurant teams to create great guest experiences as evidenced by a record-level performance we saw from many of our brands on key holidays throughout the year. Nowhere is it more apparent than at Olive Garden, which achieved the highest sales day and sales week in their history during the week of Mother's Day. This focus on being brilliant [4:33] with the basics leads to strong guest satisfaction scores and our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain at or near all-time highs across our brands. At LongHorn Steakhouse, one of their most important metrics is their steaks grilled correctly score which is at an all-time high. To continue to drive these results, LongHorn recently completed their sixth Stake Master Series, which is their annual grilling competition and training program. Over the course of two months, thousands of culinary team members competed in this highly engaging training program for the right to be crowned champion and receive the $15,000 grand price. Congratulations to this year's Steak Masters champion, Kylie Hall from the LongHorn Steakhouse in Farragut, Tennessee. I am particularly proud of everything the teams in our restaurants and at the support center accomplished in fiscal 2023. For example, Olive Garden successfully introduced Never-Ending Pasta Bowl, which leveraged their iconic brand equity, was much simpler to execute and significantly improved margin while still providing tremendous value for their guests. Throughout the year, several of our brands ranked number one among major casual dining brands in key measurement categories within Technomic's industry tracking tool including LongHorn for food quality and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for value. And several of our brands were recognized as industry leaders in employment practices by Black Box Intelligence. Olive Garden, The Capital Grille and Seasons 52 were honored with the Employer of Choice Award and LongHorn and Eddie V's received the Best Practices Award. Throughout fiscal 2023, our strategy served us well. In addition to our back-to-basics operating philosophy, driving strong execution in our restaurants, Darden's four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and results oriented culture enabled our brands to compete more effectively and provide even greater value to their guests. Our significant scale allowed our teams to successfully manage through the highly unpredictable inflationary environment, while continuing to under price inflation over the long-term. All four of our advantages are unmatched within the restaurant full-service industry. These advantages are leveraged by our portfolio of iconic brands, all generating high average unit volumes with extensive geographic footprints. Our strategy is the right one for our company and our advantages were further strengthened last week with the completion of the acquisition of Ruth's Chris Steak House. Ruth's Chris enhances our scale advantage, fits our culture and complements our portfolio of iconic brands. We are so thrilled to add such an outstanding brand and high-caliber talent. And our experienced team is working hard to integrate Ruth's Chris into Darden with as little disruption as possible. I am proud of the results we achieved in fiscal 2023, and we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and long-term shareholder value. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.8 billion, 6.4% higher than last year, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4% and the addition of 47 net new restaurants. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 470 basis points and same restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 540 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 15.2% from last year to $2.58. We generated $472 million in EBITDA and returned $183 million to shareholders. Total inflation slowed meaningfully this quarter to 4.4%, 270 basis points less than the third quarter, while the rate of pricing decreased from last quarter to 5.9%. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 30 basis points better driven by pricing above commodities inflation of roughly 3%. Chicken and seafood experienced deflation this quarter, helping offset high-single digit beef and beat inflation. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points better driven by productivity improvements. Restaurant expenses were 30 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage. Marketing expense was 1% of sales, consistent with our expectations and 30 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in restaurant level EBITDA improving 80 basis points to 20.7%. Our general and administrative expenses were 40 basis points higher than last year, driven by the timing of our incentive compensation accrual as well as unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the way we hedge this expense, this unfavorability is largely offset on the tax line. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.4% and we generated $316 million in earnings from continuing operations, which was 11.4% of sales. Looking at our segments. Olive Garden, LongHorn and our other segment increased same-restaurant sales by 4.4%, 7.1% and 2.2%, respectively, each significantly outperformed the industry benchmark. The strong same restaurant sales performance drove segment profit margin at each of these segments higher than last year, especially at LongHorn, where segment profit margin of 18.6% was 70 basis points higher than last year. Same restaurant sales at our Fine Dining segment decreased by 1.9%, still outperforming the Black Box fine dining benchmark, excluding Darden, by more than 200 basis points. This resulted in segment profit margin below last year at the Fine Dining segment. This year-over-year sales decline was more the result of a wrapping on resurgence of demand in the fourth quarter of last year, which drove traffic retention to 108% of pre-COVID levels. Looking at traffic retention trends over the past three quarters, Fine Dining has been consistently between 101% to 102% of pre-COVID levels. We expect continued year-over-year traffic softness in our Fine Dining segment as we wrap on the first quarter traffic in fiscal 2023 that was at 107% of pre-COVID traffic levels. We expect traffic to stabilize on a year-over-year basis after the first quarter. As we look at our annual results for fiscal 2023, we had strong same-restaurant sales of 6.8% which outperformed the industry by 410 basis points and our same-restaurant traffic was 510 basis points above the industry. The strong top line performance drove $1.6 billion in EBITDA from continuing operations. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders and ended the year with $368 million of cash. Looking at our fiscal 2023 full year results compared to pre-COVID, operating income margins have grown 140 basis points. Food and beverage as percent of sales increased 380 basis points driven by investments in food quality and pricing well below commodities inflation. Offsetting this unfavorability were improvements in labor productivity, reduced restaurant and marketing expenses and G&A efficiencies. Our strong operating model generates significant and durable cash flows. Since 2018 we have delivered approximately 8% annualized EBITDA growth. At the end of fiscal 2023, our balance sheet was well-positioned at just 1.8 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR well below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times. And when we look at our performance compared to our long-term framework over the last five years, we've been achieved -- we've been able to achieve annualized total shareholder returns of 14.2% as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield. This is near the high end of our target and was driven by annualized earnings after tax growth of 10.2% above the high end of our framework. Cash returns were 4% which is at the middle of our framework. As we look to the future, we still believe that over time our 10% to 15% target for total shareholder returns is appropriate. However, we're increasing the share repurchase range to better reflect the impact of our share price appreciation since we last updated the framework five years ago. The updated share repurchase range is $300 million to $500 million. Before we get into our outlook for fiscal 2024, I want to provide an update on the acquisition of Ruth's Chris which we completed last week. This was financed through a $600 million term loan and cash on our balance sheet, bringing our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR to approximately 2 times. As we move forward into 2024, sales and profits from Ruth's Chris company-owned and operated locations will be included in our Fine Dining segment, while revenues and profits from the franchise locations will reside in our other segment, consistent with the treatment of our existing franchise locations. However, Fine Dining same-restaurant sales results will not include Ruth's Chris until they have been owned and operated by us for a period of 16 months. As we mentioned in our conference call in early May, we expect to achieve run rate synergies of approximately $20 million by the end of fiscal 2025 primarily through supply chain and G&A savings. We also expect Ruth's Chris will be accretive to our earnings per share by approximately $0.10 to $0.12 in fiscal 2024 and $0.20 to $0.25 in fiscal 2025. We anticipate total acquisition and integration-related expense of approximately $55 million pre-tax. Now turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024 which includes Ruth's Chris operating results, but excludes the aforementioned acquisition and integration related expense. We expect total sales of $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion driven by the addition of Ruth's Chris store portfolio, same-restaurant sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and approximately 50 gross new restaurant openings, including four relocations. Capital spending of $550 million to $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3% to 4% which includes commodities inflation of approximately 2.5% driven primarily by beef and produce, while most other categories are flat to deflationary and hourly labor inflation in the mid-single digits. And annual effective tax-rate of approximately 12% to 12.5% and approximately 121.5 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $8.55 and $8.85. And finally, our Board approved an 8% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.31 per share, implying an annual dividend of $5.24. And with that, I will turn it back to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thanks, Raj. All of us at Darden continue to work together in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. During the year, we served more than 410 million guests. We also promoted nearly 1,300 hourly team members into our manager in training program and promoted 320 managers to General Manager or Managing Partner positions. And we continue to invest in our team members' development with new programs like Fast Fluency, which allows them to learn English for free. And our Next Course scholarship program that awarded post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to nearly 100 children or dependents of Darden team members. We also remain committed to nourishing and delighting the communities we serve through our ongoing efforts to fight hunger. As part of our Darden Harvest food donation program, our restaurants donated 4.4 million meals to local food banks in fiscal 2023. We also continued our successful partnership with Feeding America with another $2 million donation from the Darden Foundation that helped provide mobile food trucks to 10 different Feeding America food banks, bringing the total to 25 food banks across the country. The addition of Ruth's Chris gives us the opportunity to nourish and delight even more guests, more team members and more communities. As I said earlier, they are an excellent addition to our portfolio. And I want to welcome, Cheryl Henry and the nearly 5,000 team members from Ruth's Chris. We are excited that you are now officially part of the Darden family. I also want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout the year. We are fortunate to have the best people in the industry and I am proud of their commitment to caring for our guests and each other. Now, we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Jon Tower with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks. I guess I'll start off, I'm curious to -- you had mentioned in your release the idea that the environment has gotten a little bit choppier in the fourth quarter. So I'm curious to see what you would -- if you could articulate what exactly you saw in the backdrop with respect to consumer behavior specifically at your own brands and perhaps industry-wide. And then, I got a follow-up on that, please. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Jon. This is Rick. I mean as we've talked about the choppiness of Q4, it was really fine dining going up against last year's very strong bounce back from Omicron. And so this quarter, as we alluded to at the end of -- in the third quarter, was this quarter is going be a little bit tougher for fine dining because of how they bounced back. And actually, Raj already alluded to the Q1, will probably be the same kind of toughness because of the bounce back last year. But that said, the consumer seems pretty strong overall. And within the restaurant industry and based on our internal and external data sources, there appears to be only minimal switching between lower priced occasions at this point. Not all that is switching, but some. And overall, we're not seeing anything concerning. What I will say, as you think about mix, we've talked about this before, we're not seeing material changes in our check trends across our core casual brands. There is no negative mix at Cheddar's. And we are watching add-ons and trying to understand if there is some cracks there. But we don't see any real cracks there. And -- but one area we're seeing a little bit of check management is with alcohol sales primarily at our higher end brands. And we think part of this is because of the function of last year, similar to the guest count trends we saw in last year, there was probably a little bit of euphoria in check last year. So that's kind of where we think about the consumer. And we didn't really think the quarter was choppy. We expected that to happen and that's what happened. Jon Tower : Got it. Thanks for the clarification. I appreciate it. I'm just curious on the unit growth outlook as well. It looks like you're expecting slower unit growth openings versus what you had previously thought. Is that just a function of integrating Ruth\u2019s and at the same time CapEx went a little bit higher. So could you explain what's going on there as well? Rick Cardenas : Yeah. I think it's not necessarily integration of Ruth's. You think about what we're seeing on openings, CapEx was higher and where we wanted to be prudent as Raj said in the last call, we want to be prudent and making sure that we are earning a return that we really want to earn in our restaurants. And we've had some contractor starting to come back in and bid for sites that they stopped bidding for during the pandemic and even after the pandemic which should make bidding more competitive. We're starting to see that. And so we wanted to be prudent and make sure that we have the right returns and we still have great returns in all of our restaurants and that's kind of where it is. It's not really because of risks. Jon Tower : Got it. Thanks. I appreciate the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Chris O'Cull: Hi, great. Good morning, guys. Raj, I had a question about the guidance. I'm just thinking if you exclude the $0.10 to $0.12 earnings accretion expected from Ruth's in the guidance, it looks -- it would seem to imply EPS growth below your longer-term outlook, particularly at the low end. Are you seeing any indications today that the underlying business could be softening I guess, or are you expecting it to soften over the course of this year? I'm just curious if you can give some color as to why the underlying business seems to be growing at a slower rate. Raj Vennam : Yeah, Chris. I think, look, we're taking into consideration all the information we have, right. We think -- we build a plan based on all the information we have today. And if you look at what the consensus economic forecast is for the next year, it's flattish GDP and that -- in a -- if you look at last year where GDP was growing, the industry will still had negative traffic, right? So while we outperformed quite a bit and we expect to continue to outperform, we're taking that into consideration as we build a plan. But if you look at the midpoint of our guide, you do get to a decent base business growth and that's kind of how we build a plan and then the guidance range is to incorporate some variability around that and that's how we really think about it. Chris O'Cull: So you're not seeing any softening today, you are just kind of keeping a more conservative outlook based on what the predictions are for the economy over the next 12 months? Raj Vennam : Yeah. Well, I would say that it's not softening today. I mean if you look at the last few weeks, I think we're -- our GAAP to industry sale is fairly similar. But as we talked about, Q1, we do expect some softness in Fine Dining, that's just a function of wrap. But outside of that, no, we're not seeing any trends that would -- any recent trends that would indicate that there is a major change in the underlying environment for us. Chris O'Cull: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Eric Gonzalez : Hey. Sure. Thanks. And Raj, just regarding the comp guidance, the 2.5% to 3.5%. Can you maybe talk about what level of pricing you're embedding within that outlook and how that compares to the -- to where you exited fiscal '23 which I think was around 6%? And then also, do you have an underlying assumption for the industry's growth rate for the year? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Yeah, Eric. So the way we think about it is, our comp guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%, we expect to have pricing in the 3.5% to 4%, which would imply a traffic of flat to negative 1.5% for the year for us. That range would imply that. You can extrapolate from that what the implied industry can be. We're not expecting our GAAP to be significantly different going into the year, but we focus a lot more on things we can control. And we look at all the factors we have year-over-year and taking into consideration the macroenvironment and then just build a plan that way. As far as comp -- exiting the pricing, yeah, we exited the quarter with closer to 6% as we said and but we expect that to tick down throughout the year. So start with that, call it, 6%, but by the end of the year, by Q4, we get closer to the 2%. Now, lot of the pricing actions we took last year already impact next year's by about 3%. So the carryover from prior year is probably close to 3% and so that's really where we are. Eric Gonzalez : Got it. And then just maybe as a follow-up to that, as you think about industries traffic remaining challenging and you mentioned GDP being flattish potentially this year, have you noticed any significant uptick in promotional activity thus far? And as the year progresses, how you think your promotional strategy might evolve and what levers could you pull if that's needed? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Eric, this is Rick. We look at what the competitor is doing. And you're seeing some promotional activity in competitors. We've got one major competitor that launched a little bit more TV or jumped back on to TV. But that said, our strategy remains the same on the marketing side. We're going to continue to be -- to have advertising Olive Garden because it's a big competitive advantage for Olive Garden, but we're going to continue to use our filters, first, elevating brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life, it's simple to execute and it's not at a deep discount. So as we talked about in the last call, we're going to stick to our strategy of core guest count growth. We'll react accordingly if something really changes. But when we increase our marketing spend, if we do, we expect it to earn a return. So we don't necessarily expect us to go back into the deep discount craze and that's our strategy and we're going to try to stick to it. Eric Gonzalez : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to just go back to the 2024 EPS guidance, and kind of as a follow-up because as Chris suggested, yes, when you strip out Ruth's, you do have this lower implied core business earnings growth relative to your long-term framework. But the same-store sales guidance is slightly above this framework. So I just want to dig in there a little bit more. Is it being driven by underpricing inflation? I know you said kind of pricing at 3.5% to 4% but inflation is 3% to 4%. So, doesn't seem like you're planning on underpricing inflation that much. Just again trying to understand those dynamics a little better given the comp guidance is above your long-term framework. Raj Vennam : Yeah, Brian. I think the way we look at it is, if you look at our framework or actually even excluding Ruth's -- the middle of the guidance for Ruth's is at $0.11 accretion. If you take that out, we're still in that -- a TSR that's north of 10% at the middle of -- at the middle of the guidance range. Now, one of the things I want to point out is, we haven't been able to buy back shares for almost three months now, because of trading blackout. And so that has an impact on EPS for next year. But even with that, like as we said, we still get to that double-digit TSR when you incorporate the dividend yield and the EPS growth. Brian Bittner : Okay. And the follow up, just as it relates to the total cost inflation outlook 3% to 4%, obviously realized commodities are up 2.5% within that total framework of 3% to 4%. Can you just touch on some of the other assumptions that's pressuring the inflation to be above the commodity outlook? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Brian. It's really labor. I expect the hourly wage inflation to be in that call it mid-single digits. And then their salary to be also closer to that. And some of that is a function of how we choose to pay our people. We are -- our merit increases have been above the industry and we think that's prudent. We want to continue to do that. And that's the type of investment we make to help us sustain the types of performance that we've been able to deliver. You look at a 400 basis point, 500 basis point gap to the industry that doesn't happen, magically. They are lot of things that go into that. And we are very thoughtful about how we make those decisions. Brian Bittner : Thanks, Raj. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions. David Palmer : Thanks. I wanted to ask you about your assumptions on same-store sales through the year. And in particular, if you have any thoughts about -- often a concern about multi-year trend slowing over this next fiscal year and how you're thinking about that potential in your guidance. Raj Vennam : Yeah. The way we're thinking about -- in terms of how we build the plan is that we expect retentions levels to be fairly similar to moderate a little bit relative to pre-COVID from where we were this fiscal year. So not a significant drop-off, but a little bit. But then, I think from a same-restaurant sales perspective, it's going to be driven by the pricing differences. The fact that we're going to start off with the higher price and then the price moderates down to -- the rate of pricing goes down to 2% by -- closer to 2% by Q4. That will have an impact on same-restaurant sales. As we think about guest counts, as I mentioned, the retention, we expect it to be fairly consistent quarter-to-quarter relative to last year. David Palmer : And with regard to advertising, what sort of assumptions are embedded into your earnings guidance for advertising spend? Raj Vennam : We basically are assuming somewhere in that 10 basis points to 20 basis points more than what we spent last year in total marketing. So that's kind of not that different from what we did in fiscal '23. David Palmer : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. Given the slow macro forecast for 2024, I'm curious how that impacts your thinking around Never Ending Pasta at Olive Garden. The one value oriented promotion that fits your provincial framework. I guess the question is, are you open to changing the timing of promotion or perhaps in running it at two different times during the year to keep pace in the potentially slowing macro backdrop? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Andrew. For competitive reasons, we're definitely not going to talk about plan details. We do believe the Never Ending Pasta Bowl is a really strong promotion for us, especially with the changes we made last year. And so we'll look at any PB and if there's things that we can do with it. But definitely not going to talk about if we're going to do it twice. Andrew Charles : Okay. And then, Raj, please help us what's embedded within 2024 guidance for G&A? Raj Vennam : Yeah. I think -- so, especially with Ruth's coming in, you should -- we ended the fiscal year with closer to $390 million. I'd say at this point, our best estimate is probably still maintaining closer to that 3.7% of total sales, which would get you closer to the call it $430 million for the year. Obviously, plus or minus 10 there. But that would be the number we would -- that is embedded in our guidance. Yeah. Andrew Charles : Helpful. Thank you. Raj Vennam : Hey. By the way, as we talk about G&A, I just want to clarify one other thing. We do expect the cadence to be a little different. So, Q1 is probably going to be the highest level, call it closer to $115 million and then kind of tick down $5 million a quarter throughout the -- for the next few quarters. It's how we think about it just from a cadence standpoint. So there are some things that -- sudden specific variables that are influencing Q1 to be higher. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Carril : Hi. Good morning. So, just returning to the same restaurant sales growth guidance for '24, can you provide any more detail on how you're thinking about your largest brands, Olive Garden and LongHorn and how they fit into this? We've been pretty clear so far on fine dining and how you expect comparisons to impact that segment in the very near term. But just curious if you could provide any additional thoughts in your largest brands and how they factor into the comp guide. Raj Vennam : Yeah. I would say the way we're thinking about it is our core casual brands are probably closer to the -- I guess, let's just go through the big brands. Olive Garden is probably -- would be in the middle of the range is our expectation going in. And then LongHorn would be outside of that range to the upside primarily because of stake inflation and the pricing there is probably a little bit higher, would need to be. And then Fine Dining to be a little bit south of that. And that's really how we're thinking about it. Chris Carril : Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then, you mentioned productivity improvements helped to drive the improvement and labor in the 4Q. So how are you thinking about productivity improvements from here maybe in the context of Ruth's and then ex-Ruth's and just how much of a tailwind that could be in '24? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Chris. As we've said before, over the last years, our brands have done a great job improving productivity. We would expect to continue to have some productivity improvements over time, but not to the extent that we had during COVID. As we continue to look at improving training, having turnover come down, that should help productivity little bit. We're not going to have to discuss Ruth's right now. We've only owned them for eight days. So we'll have to just get through the -- getting through integration is going to actually probably be a productivity downer for them for a little bit. So let's let us get Ruth's under our belt for a little bit longer than eight days before we talk about the details there. But as I said, labor productivity, we should expect it to tick better as the year progresses as we continue to improve on our turnover and as we continue to improve our training. Chris Carril : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your questions (ph). David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. Rick, I wanted to ask your thoughts on the current macroenvironment. And I guess your comments that the consumer seems pretty strong right now, don't actually line up with what the industry is seeing in terms of traffic. I mean, traffic down 7%. We haven't seen those types of numbers since maybe '08 and '09. So I'm just kind of wondering what your thoughts on traffic? And I know Darden's been outperforming, but I think even your traffic was slightly negative in the quarter. So, I guess what's your thoughts on what's weighing on the traffic and the overall environment? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, David. Thanks for the question. I did say earlier that we have not seen an impact in the consumer as much as maybe our competitors have. And I think there's a couple of reasons for that. There is a tension between what people want and what they can afford. And even in a slowing economy, consumers really continue to seek value. And it's not always about low prices, it's about execution, it's about what the experience to get in the restaurant or wherever they are. They're making spending tradeoffs. And as I said before, food away-from-home is really difficult to give up if you're executing. And so what we think about it is, what it means to our brands. What it means to what we do every day. And we believe that operators that can deliver on their brand promise and the value that appeals to guests, despite economic challenges, is what's going to get you to win. And that's what we've been doing. So whatever has been happening to the consumer and the economy and the restaurant space, we're going to control what we can control and what we can control is the experience that our consumers get in the restaurants every day and the value we provide. And we continue to hope that we're going to buck the trend of guest counts that the industry has. And we would expect to have a gap to the industry. David Tarantino : Great. Maybe just one follow-up on that. I mean, do you think pricing for the industry has become one of the issues as it relates to traffic? I know, you've priced a little less than the industry. But, I think, do you think that consumers are becoming more price-sensitive in today's economy? Rick Cardenas : I think there might be some price sensitivity in consumers overall, whether it's in the restaurants or what have you. But you think about GDP trends, so over the last four quarters, GDP has continued to tick down and that would mean that traffic would take down everywhere. Whether it's at a restaurant or it's in a retail establishment, wherever it is, as GDP continues to tick down, you would expect traffic to tick down. Yes. The industry saw a little bit more of a hit to that. And I do believe part of that was because of the bounce-back from Omicron last year in Q4. I don't think we were the only ones that benefited from that. I think others did. And so let's see how this all plays out. We've given you our guidance for the year, which does assume negative traffic. And actually assumes less negative traffic than the industry. So that should tell you we think there is a little bit of softness there. But we're going to continue to perform and do the things that we do every day to bring guests into our restaurant. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you. First one was just on cash usage in the share repurchase as part of your long-term algorithm. I guess the midpoint going up by like $200 million. And you bumped the dividend by close to 10% and the CapEx is going up a little bit more than perhaps what you previously thought. I just wondering what's going in the other direction. And I think about in the context of M&A. I mean, I know you have returned to the market with the Ruth's acquisition. I'm wondering whether you're seeing potential for more, maybe the valuation challenges that you've previously noted have been easing. Any thoughts there would be great. And then I have one follow-up. Raj Vennam : Yeah. Let me talk about the cash and then I'll turn it over to Rick for the M&A commentary. So as far as cash usage, if you look at our business, we generate somewhere around $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, our guidance would imply in terms of cash -- operating cash flow. So between the dividend and the CapEx and with the share repurchase, we still would be building cash maybe at an -- if you take all the midpoints of all of those ranges we would still build a cash balance of call it may be close to $100 million. So we're really not tapping into any borrowings sort of that to meet these commitments we have embedded in here. As far as the long term framework share repurchase range, that is really to reflect the change in our share price from five years ago because we haven't updated the framework for five years. So all that change as much as it feels like it's double, that's basically reflecting that our share price has doubled during that timeframe. And so now, with that, I'll just turn it to Rick. Rick Cardenas : I'll just add something to that. If you look at -- think about the cash flow or EBITDA, pre-COVID, our EBITDA was about $1.2 billion and today with based on Raj is saying it's $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion. So that gives us a lot more cash to do those things and increase our share buyback and M&A. And so if you think -- but we've talked about M&A often. M&A adds to our scale which is our biggest advantage. And we continue to talk to our Board, management continues to talk to the Board about our best uses of capital and M&A is one of those. And so but we just got done with the Ruth's deal. So let us do a little bit there. It doesn't mean that we wouldn't be back in the market down the road. But we've got plenty of cash, we've got plenty of debt capacity. Raj said, we're at basically two times adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDAR and that's at the low end of our range. So we have plenty of capacity to do more things. Jeffrey Bernstein : Yeah. And then just a clarification, just wondering if you're going to provide pro-forma restated maybe Darden results for the quarters of fiscal '23 as if you owned Ruth's the entire year. I know it's tough for us to model with a different quarter and year-ends and with Ruth's operating a 50-50 company franchise model, just trying to get some color as to whether or not you'll provide any help from a modeling perspective or any pro-forma type results to give us better insight into the growth rate going forward. Thank you. Raj Vennam : Really the fiscal calendars when you look at the quarters, we're only a month half. We don't plan on restating the history. I think -- and I also want to think about how material it is to the overall Darden P&L. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Sara Senatore : Great. Thank you. First a clarification, which is you talked about the cadence of pricing over the course of the year, is it fair to assume that you're thinking the cadence input inflation will follow suit in the sense of kind of rolling off over the course of the year or is there a reason to believe that maybe the math -- the gap between pricing and inflation might look different and therefore the implications from margins might be different over the course of the year. So that's the first question and then I'll have another one Ruth's, please. Raj Vennam : Hey Sara. Great question. As we think about inflation, we don't expect the cadence to be significantly different. I think we have a little bit more in the first quarter, but not a huge difference. We're talking about 50 basis points to 60 basis points may be different from quarter-to-quarter. So that 3% to 4% range is what we provided for the overall. You can expect first quarter to be closer to 4% and then the other quarters might be close -- a little bit less than that. But then, there's really not a meaningful difference between quarters. So that would imply that year-over-year, there is a little bit of delta in pricing versus inflation, because we are starting with a higher price as we get out of Q4 -- where we exited the Q4 levels. So, I know you also said you had a second question. So I'll wait for that. Sara Senatore : Yeah. Thank you. And then actually, just to clarify on that one and then I'll ask the question, which is, is the implication that by the fourth quarter, you'll be needing to find more productivity gains or something else if you have less price but sort of level loaded inflation over the course of the year. Raj Vennam : Yeah. I think we do expect the gap to reverse by the time we get to the back half. In fact, the way we look at -- when we look at our quarterly earnings that are embedded in our guidance, the cadence, while it's more balanced than last year, we do see Q2 providing the highest-growth while Q4 providing the lowest from an earnings standpoint and Q1, Q3 more in line with the annual growth that we provided. Sara Senatore : Okay. Thank you very much. And then just a question. I know Rick you said, you've only had Ruth's for eight days. But presumably, there's a lot of diligence that went ahead of that. So I know you mentioned $20 million roughly by the end of fiscal 2025 primarily coming through supply chain and G&A. If I look at the restaurant-level margins for Ruth's versus like your Fine Dining, is that -- is supply chain and cost of goods is that the primary difference as I think about the potential to bridge that gap. Rick Cardenas : Well, we've said in the past that most of our G&A -- most of our synergies come from G&A and supply chain. So, when we have in the past that it's about half-and-half whenever we done acquisitions before. So yes, Ruth's should get in the long term benefits from cost-of-sales. Now that said, we may reinvest some of those cost-of-sales and our other brands will get some of the benefits too. So it won't all flow to Ruth's. I will say that there aren't many brands in the industry that we could acquire that actually improve our EBITDA margin at the restaurant-level and Ruth's does. So, across Darden. Now they might not be as high depending on how you look at it as Capital Grille, they might be higher, a little bit lower depending on your definition of restaurant margin. But they're pretty close. And so and because Capital Grille is higher than Darden's average margin, Ruth's helps Darden's margin. So that's a pretty good deal for us. Sara Senatore : I see. Thank you both so much. Very helpful. Rick Cardenas : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your questions. Jeff Farmer : Thank you. Just following up on modeling post-Ruth acquisition, you shared some information on G&A, but anything you can share as it relates to how we should be thinking about both interest expense and G&A moving forward? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Jeff. I'd say, interest expense is likely going to be I think for a year-over-year, we're probably looking at a total of $50 million of which $40 million is related to Ruth's acquisition. And then the other is just the lease interest and other short-term interest rate exposure we have. So that's the thing on the interest. And the G&A, I would just really take into consideration the Darden's G&A and then lay it on Ruth's from what you have. There'll be some purchase accounting that we're working through. So we'll have some updates on that. But that will be more of a geography, more so than a huge impact. We've embedded some incremental step-up in our valuation and in our P&L and that's incorporated in our guidance, but we're not ready to share those details yet. Jeff Farmer : Okay. And just one more. One of your named competitive advantages over the last several years has been this extensive data and insights. But can you share maybe one or two examples of how you were able to leverage that data in '23 and potentially some untapped opportunities as you move forward in terms of harnessing and really analyzing that data moving forward? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jeff. This is Rick. You think about what we're starting to do with data, we are starting to use a lot of AI and machine-learning to help guest count forecast and help our restaurants forecast our business better. And that would move all the way down through the company, right. So if you forecast your traffic better, you order better, you receive better, you schedule better, that's one of the big things that we've looked at is using machine-learning and AI. But we got to remember, one of the things that we do every year as we use data to help look at what our guests patterns are, what we think about guests and how do we market to our guests. We also improve operations execution with the data that we have. But I would say, if you're asking for one big thing -- and is analytics through pricing too. So, we've got a great analytics team here that does help with our pricing. They look at restaurants, they look at categories, look at items, they look at elasticity. And we can do all that in-house because of our scale. Jeff Farmer : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. Danilo Gargiulo : Good morning. I'm wondering what is the integration timeline that you are embedding in your EPS accretion expectations. And how is the previous acquisition of Cheddar's impacting the timeline that you are expecting and what will it take for this integration to accelerate? And I'm talking even beyond the 2024 timeline that you set today. Raj Vennam : Hey, Danilo, we're still working through the steps, but our expectation is a lot of the stuff happens over the next 12 months to 15 months. And so that's why some of those synergies come later because we're not trying to -- we're trying to be prudent. We're going to be thoughtful. We got to design this right, make -- do this right because we want to set it up for success long term. We're and we want to make sure we minimize the disruption to operators. And so everything we're doing, we have a great team working on it. That's actually being very thoughtfully phasing in these parts of integration and how we integrate different parts of the business. And we've learned a lot from our Cheddar's acquisition. Obviously, Cheddar's was more complicated with essentially three different businesses being brought under one roof. With Ruth's, it's not -- it shouldn't be as complicated, but a lot of the learnings we have from our prior acquisitions are incorporated into -- are actually taking into consideration as we plan for this. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. And what set of factors would prompt you to drive higher unit growth versus the data 50%? I know you mentioned more competitive bidding is actually starting to happen. But have there been any internal discussions on potentially international expansion given your recent quarter and also the recent acquisition of Ruth? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Danilo. If you think about our pipeline for this year, most of the pipeline, you have to have already started construction by the time the year -- almost by the time the year started to get them open because it takes a little longer to open a restaurant or build a restaurant today than it did before COVID. So if it's not started by the end of Q1, it probably doesn't open this year. Maybe even if it doesn't start until -- by July, it's hard to open this year. So that's why we've got our kind of guide of about 50 gross openings. When we talk about international, that doesn't incorporate -- that's not incorporated in our unit count because we are committed to staying a company-owned model only in the U.S., not that we wouldn't have franchise in the U.S., but will be only franchise outside the U.S. and Canada. So all of our restaurants outside the U.S., the ones that we opened last year were all franchised. And anything that we open going forward is likely to be franchised as well. Danilo Gargiulo : Perfect. Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Harbour : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question just about fine dining sales. Is that really just kind of about the lapping dynamic or could you provide any comments on kind of some of the different customer sets, whether it's business type of customers versus like a more aspirational customer, if you're seeing anything different there? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Brian. I'd say, first of all, as we said in the prepared remarks, we actually saw a fairly consistent retention related to pre-COVID for the last three quarters at fine dining. What we're seeing is we are seeing a little bit of pullback on the alcohol sales. And we still think that's also a function of wrapping on a significant increase a year ago. Now as we just generally speaking, what we're seeing with the demographics is consumers below 35 or above pre-COVID, but they're below last year. And then whereas 55-plus is still below pre-COVID, but they're similar to last year. So there's a different dynamic year-over-year where you're seeing the younger demographic pull back a little bit year-over-year. And then -- and similarly, on the income side, we're seeing that lower income is above pre-COVID but still below last -- but below last year, whereas higher income flattish to last year or similar to last year, but they are still below pre covert. So those are some of the insights I can share on fine dining. Brian Harbour : Okay. And then maybe just on kind of the labor line. Did you comment on what labor inflation was in the most recent quarter, it sounds like it was like mid-single-digit range. And is there any kind of like slowing in that pace assumed through the course of this year or is it going to be pretty steady or how do you kind of expect that to play out? Raj Vennam : Yeah. Our labor did -- overall labor inflation ticked down about 100 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We were at 6% in Q4. That included wage inflation close to 7%. And -- so that's also a tick down from prior quarter, a meaningful step down. And that actually was a little bit better than we thought for the quarter. Now as we look to the future, as we said, so we ended the year with 6.9% total labor inflation and we said we expect that to step down by about 100 basis points as we go to next year. That\u2019s why we talked about that mid-single-digit inflation. Brian Harbour : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Raj, I'm just curious if there's any update to share on how you think continued margin gains longer term. I know you've spoken a bit more to the long-term total shareholder return algorithm of late. But just curious if anything new on long-term margin considerations and of 10 bps to 30 bps annually is kind of the right way to think about it still? Raj Vennam : Yes, Dennis. We do think that 10 to 30 is the way to think about it from where we are starting this fiscal year. So that's how we restated our framework. And the only change we made is to the share repurchase because we still believe that that 10 to 30 is a good target for us to have for the foreseeable future. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. And then just on the to-go sales across the portfolio to some extent. Sort of where you sit now? And if any kind of latest thoughts on what that could look like, either growth there, sales mix opportunities as we look to '24? Thank you very much. Raj Vennam : Well, so our to-go sales are actually pretty consistent with where we were in Q3. So I think we\u2019re still running at Olive Garden close to 25%, LongHorn on 14 and Cheddar at 12%, which is not that dissimilar to what we had a quarter ago. And we\u2019re doing that without third-party delivery. And we continue to see that we\u2019re able to kind of still get overall sales growth and outperformance versus the industry, while not tapping into these other channels and actually, we\u2019re managing the experience better. We feel like we have continued to execute on that. As we\u2019ve said before, this is higher than we would have expected a couple of years ago. But we\u2019re very happy with it. And our teams are focused on executing at the highest level possible to make sure that we can sustain and grow from here. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you, Raj. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. I know you have actually famously done at a brand level customer segmentation work. You used to talk about that in Analyst Day as many years ago. So I guess using that data or using your current, can you explain how you think about the upcoming repayment of student loans, something that you've been asked about today, it's coming, I think, in September, obviously, the press itself has kind of gotten smart that that's something that's coming and actually might be fairly significant change for at least some cohort of the population. Can you think of -- is there any impact to Darden specifically, have you thought through that? And what might potential responses be? Rick Cardenas : Hey, John. Yeah. We think through that all the time. And we do still do those consumer segmentation studies, and we still do market structure studies. We don't necessarily talk about them externally because we don't want everybody else to see them. But thinking about the student loan impact, yes, they'll start being repaid in, I guess, September around there, but it shouldn't be a material headwind. It will be a headwind. Any time you take money out of consumers' pockets, it's a headwind, but it shouldn't be material because student loan payments are a very small component and it's probably already baked into the economic forecast for GDP growth that we use for our plan. John Ivankoe : And just in terms of like that specific cohort, I mean, whether it's 25 to 44, what have you. I mean I know Olive Garden historically is kind of skewed older. But is there anything that you can kind of help us with us just saying, hey, you have some big percentage of the customer base that's just not going to be affected by all. Is there a little bit more information you can kind of give us as you triangulate it? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Sure. I think Raj talked about our consumer demographics a little bit ago. We're still above pre-COVID on our consumers in the 35 age range or below 35, which is probably the ones that are in their student loan repayment period. And the 55 plus or below pre-COVID last year. So there's probably still some room for some of those 55 plus to come back, and I'm doubting that they're paying student loans back unless they're paying it for their kids. And if you think about our population, we still have a high percentage of our of our consumers that are above $100,000. So hopefully, a student loan repayment wouldn\u2019t impact them too much. John Ivankoe : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Strelzik : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two for me. The first one is on the commodity side. I'm curious if you feel like your visibility into the food cost outlook is improving or the duration to which you have visibility is improving just as the rate of inflation is moderating here? And then the second question is on the unit growth side. You talked about the bidding side and some favorability potentially there. I'm just curious in terms of permitting supply chain equipment. Are there green shoots on that side? Or how are you seeing that evolve. Thanks. Raj Vennam : Hey, Andrew. This is Raj. So on the commodity side, we do have better visibility today than we did a year ago. We actually have, for the first time, I think, in four years, probably have coverage that is actually pretty similar to the way we used to before COVID. I think we have \u2013 as we talked about for the first half, we have a total coverage of 65% of our basket covered and call it closer to that 25% to 30% in the back half color, which is, again, pretty much back to the levels we used to have pre-COVID. So we definitely feel like we have a lot more visibility today than we did before. And then as far as the development side, we are starting to see some signs of improvement. Rick talked earlier about some of the bids coming in better or multiple bids coming in. There\u2019s still some delays in permitting and utility connections with local agencies and stuff like that. But all that said, we do see some green shoots. We think that we believe that the inflation on the action side has peaked it\u2019s still elevated, but it\u2019s not going \u2013 continuing to go up. And in fact, I think we \u2013 the last few bids we\u2019ve had last few construction starts we\u2019ve had \u2013 they were in line with our budget or better. So just make \u2013 starting to see some positive signs there. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Vaccaro : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to circle back on the strength at LongHorn -- it seems like the brand took another step up at least through the lens of average weekly sales volumes, which I think are now up in the mid-30s versus pre-COVID levels. I know the brain has gained a lot of share through the pandemic, but anything incremental worth highlighting that you think is driving this incremental uptick? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Brian. LongHorn has been executing well for the last few years. And I keep -- I want to comment Todd and his team, they've been on this journey in quality, simplicity and culture. That's what Todd talks about every day, investing in quality and portions that continue to pay off. They had almost 7.1% same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter. That was driven by some pricing. They've had more inflation, but they also have had record weekly sales and Mother's Day, and yes, they're 34% above pre-COVID levels in sales versus Q4. And traffic is positive over pre-COVID. So I can't tell you it's any silver bullet and we've talked about that in the past that there aren't silver bullets here. It's about having great execution, investing in your team, investing in your product to drive profitable same-restaurant sales growth. And that's what they've been doing. Brian Vaccaro : All right. And then I also just wanted to circle back on the Roots acquisition and your customer segmentation work. Could you elaborate a little bit on the overlap or maybe more interestingly, the key differences between Roots customer base versus your other fine dining brands or any other differences you think are worth highlighting regarding the brand? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Brian. Let me talk about differences and why we believe that there\u2019s not a whole \u2013 a lot of overlap between the Ruth\u2019s customer and a capital growth customer. But I will preface this by saying, we\u2019ve only owned them for 8 days. And before we closed the deal, we were not allowed to see their consumer data, right? We were still competitors, and we couldn\u2019t see their consumer data other than looking at third-party data that we would have. So we want to start looking at their data to understand it a little bit better. But one of the primary reasons is geography. If you look at \u2013 they have 150-ish restaurants, including the franchise system, and they have restaurants in markets that Capital Grille doesn\u2019t have restaurants in. And even in restaurants to capital, even in markets that Capital Grille has restaurants in, they\u2019re not necessarily close to each other in a lot of those markets. So there isn\u2019t as much overlap as you would expect. And that\u2019s a good thing for us, good thing for Ruth Chris, and it\u2019s a good thing for Capital Grille. And \u2013 but then I would add that if you think about ADBs and Capital Grille, we\u2019ve had this kind of scenario for many years. Where ADBs guests may go to Capital Grille, but they go for different occasions. And we want to learn a little bit about that at routes on the occasion differences. And then finally, I think Capital Grille is a little bit more, going back to geography, a little bit more mix in urban than Roots, an urban core versus Ruth Chris, where Ruth Chris, for example, if you have a restaurant in Birmingham, we don\u2019t have \u2013 or in Destin, Florida. There\u2019s the Ruth Chris. We don\u2019t have Capital Grille there. So there\u2019s reasons that there isn\u2019t as much overlap as you would have thought. Brian Vaccaro : All right. That\u2019s great. I\u2019ll pass it along. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Mine was on labor productivity. You mentioned that you expect some labor productivity improvements in '24, but not a whole lot. I guess my question is around turnover. I would have thought that just the improving labor environment, staffing is kind of, I think, back to pre-COVID levels, but turnover going down, so productivity should be going way up. In terms of -- at your brands, have you already benefited? I mean, I guess, maybe was your turnover not so bad before that's why you're not going to get much of an incremental benefit. If you could just talk about how the labor dynamics and what that could or couldn't do to labor productivity. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jake. Yes, you would expect that as turnover goes down, productivity gets better, and we've started to see that already this year. So our turnover is improving and our productivity is getting better. So it's not like we're going from the highest turnover we've ever had to the lower turnover next year. We've actually started gradually moving to it. And one of the places that gets you the biggest productivity loss is the turnover in the first 90 days. And that's had a very big improvement for us. So you don't -- you have less productivity loss if you have less 90-day turnover. And so we've seen an improvement in turnover. We're still above pre-COVID levels, but we're a lot closer to our pre-COVID levels than we were just last month and the last month before that, the month before that. And we'll continue to improve I don't know if we'll ever get back to pre-COVID level turnovers. But if we do, then that should give us even more productivity enhancements. Jake Bartlett : Great. And then I have a follow-up on unit growth and you gave guidance for 2024. A couple of years ago, you had mentioned your expectations kind of moved towards the higher end of the range. So closer to 3% from the 2% to 3% range. Is that still valid kind of going forward, and it's going to be lower in '24, but longer term, should we think of the higher end of the range is the right point or are we kind of getting back into maybe the middle of the range longer term? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jake. Our goal is still to get towards the higher end of the range. It might take us a little bit more time to get there than we originally thought. COVID has slowed a lot of stuff down in development. The permitting that Raj talked about, equipment that Raj talked about, those things are getting better than all the way back. It would be great if we could get permits as fast as we used to get them. It would be great if we can get utilities turn down as fast as we used to get them. That's just not come back anywhere near where we need it to be. And as we think about construction costs, getting back to a more normal level, Raj mentioned that we've had the last few contracts that we've bid out have come in better than what we expected. And that's a good sign for us. So that will help us get back to that higher end of our framework. And I would also remember, we don't talk about this very much, but that framework includes M&A. And while we would like to get to the high end of the framework just with organic growth, M&A is prime work. And the thing is when we shared that framework earlier today, the five year delta, the five year impact to the framework, had no M&A in it. And we were still within our -- within probably the mid-range of our unit growth. So M&A is part of that. It is part of our capital allocation. So -- but we would still like to get to the high end without M&A. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Park with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. John Parke : Hey. Good morning. I guess as we think about the segment profitability into '24, are there any segments that you guys see as outliers either in terms of improvement or pressure that you are expecting? Raj Vennam : Well, I think it's fair to affect that, that as we talked about, fine dining is going to have a tough ramp in the first quarter. So -- but as far as we think about year-over-year, we expect all our segments to get a little bit better. That's kind of how we plan the year, and that's what we push our teams to do. John Parke : Got it. And then kind of just on the pricing side, so I guess in the beef inflation that you're seeing, is it fair to assume the LongHorn and find I think pricing is above that range and Olive Garden [indiscernible] is below? Raj Vennam : Yeah. That\u2019s a fair assumption. John Parke : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your questions. Gregory Francfort : Hey. Thank you. I just have two quick follow-up on labor. The first is, I guess, within that 5% labor inflation that you're expecting, how much of that's going to be statutory this year? And how much of it maybe still market pressure. And then maybe a correlated question is, as you guys are going out there at a higher new work is you're talking about turnover, the wage that it costs to hire somebody new today -- have you seen a break in that or a material break in that wage? I'm just curious as I think about how much easier it's not for you guys to hire people. Thanks. Raj Vennam : Hey, Greg. So just let me start by clarifying. We did not say it's 5%. We said mid-single digits, and I want to make sure that it's not treated as a 5%. I think our plan actually assumes a little bit north of that, but our guidance range embeds something closer to that 6% for wage inflation. So I just want to clarify that. And then as far as the regulatory piece, the minimum wage impact, that's about just under 2%, I think, for the full year, maybe 1.5% to 2% is what we have there. And then beyond that, it's just the normal merit increases and other stuff. Now as far as the comment -- the question around wages and, clearly, the environment has gotten a lot better, we are doing a lot fewer out-of-cycle adjustments than we were doing even six months ago. So from that perspective, there is clearly a lot of, I would say, for lack of a better term, positive science in hiring environment, in the starting wages, all those things getting a lot better than where a couple of quarters ago. Rick Cardenas : And if I can just add one thing to that. If you think about our turnover coming down, that means we don\u2019t have as many people we\u2019re hiring as we were before. So we didn\u2019t have to hire as many people now than we did before. And so the wage, even if the wage break didn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s still not as big a deal for us, but the wage break is starting to happen. But the fact that we don\u2019t have to hire as many people helps us as well. Gregory Francfort : Awesome. Thank you, guys for the perspective. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Kevin Kalicak for closing remarks. Kevin Kalicak : Thanks. That concludes our call for today. I\u2019d like to remind you that we plan to release our first quarter results on Thursday, September 21, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks again for participating in today\u2019s call, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Daryl. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings on Friday, December 15, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing first quarter performance as a comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence\u2019s, casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. During our first fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales increased 0.9% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 4.2%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter, and Raj will provide details on our financial results. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Kevin. We had a strong quarter as we continued to outperform the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic. For the quarter, total sales were $2.7 billion, an increase of 11.6% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.78. We also opened 10 new restaurants in nine different states during the quarter. Our ability to drive profitable sales growth is a testament to the strength of our business model and adherence to our strategy. We continue to strengthen and leverage our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and a results-oriented culture, while our restaurant teams remain intensely focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere. This focus on being growing with the basics continues to drive strong guest satisfaction. In fact, our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain at or near all-time highs across all our brands. Additionally, several of our brands continue to rank number one among major casual dining brands in key measurement categories within Technomic\u2019s industry tracking tool, including LongHorn Steakhouse for food quality and taste, and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for value. Our team members bring our brands to life each day, and we know engaged team members are vital to creating great guest experiences. That's why our brands are focused on leveraging their unique cultures to strengthen team member engagement. For example, LongHorn Steakhouse created the Grill Masters Legends program that honors Grill Masters, who have grilled more than 1 million stakes throughout their career, which typically takes more than 20 years for a team member to accomplish. Five Grill Masters Legends were honored during the quarter, bringing the total to 25 team members, who have received this recognition. Also during the quarter, Yard House completed its first Best On Tap competition. Known for having more than 130 beers on-tap, Yard House tested its bar tenders from every restaurant, giving them the opportunity to showcase their beverage knowledge, parting expertise and service skills. Congratulations to this year's winner, Alyssa Hurley from the Yard House in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, who was named Best On Tap. Programs like these give us an opportunity to celebrate team members who play a critical role in the guest experience and who serve as torchbearers for their brand culture. One of the most significant ways our brands drive culture is through their annual leadership conferences, which provide the opportunity to get in front of every general manager and managing partner across all our restaurants to discuss the plans for the year and generate excitement among our operators. I was pleased to see the high levels of engagement and strong alignment on what our restaurant teams must do to continue creating exceptional guest experiences across each of our iconic brands. To further strengthen our brands, we are focused on highlighting what makes each one unique. That's why when it comes to marketing, any activity our brands undertake is evaluated through three filters. First, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations, which allows our teams to consistently deliver memorable guest experiences. And finally, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing so in a way that drives profitable sales growth. A great example of this activity was the Capital Grille's, Generous Poor event that took place during the quarter. This specially curated wine experience allows guests to sample award-winning wines that pair with items on the Capital Grille menu. And in the second quarter, Olive Garden is bringing back Never Ending Pasta Bowl, which brings to life its competitive advantage of Never Ending Abundant Craveable Italian food. Olive Garden's eClub members received a special invitation to begin enjoying NEPV this week. This guest favorite returns for everybody on Monday and will be offered at the same price point as last year. Turning to Ruth's Chris. Since the day, we announced the completion of the acquisition, we have been guided by three key objectives. First, we want to preserve the team member experience and the brand's unique culture. Ruth's Chris has many long-tenured team members and we are committed to ensuring this is a people focused process. The team is engaged and we have strong buying across the executive and operations leadership levels, all of which helps ensure a smooth transition. Next, we want to maintain and even strengthen the guest experience. Ruth's Chris is an incredibly strong brand and it ranks as one of the top brands across multiple metrics within Technomic\u2019s industry tracking tool. We now expect to realize more synergies than we originally anticipated and we plan to reinvest some of them in the guest and team member experience. Raj will provide more details during his remarks. And last, we want to successfully migrate Ruth's Chris under the Darden platform. The team leading the integration is wrapping up the planning stage and we're about to embark on the hardest part, the actual conversion to new systems and processes. We know that it's not easy, which is why we plan to complete it in phases over the next nine months to limit disruptions as much as possible. Looking across our entire portfolio, I am pleased with the quarter. Our strategy is working, we continue to grow share, strengthen margins and make meaningful investments in our business while returning capital to shareholders. And while I'm proud of our continued success, there is a larger purpose to what we do, and that is to nourish and delight everyone we serve. Not just within the four walls of our restaurants, but in the communities that our guests and team members call home. September is hunger action month and we are uniquely positioned to help fight hunger. This marks the 20th anniversary of our Harvest program. Since 2003, our restaurants have collected excess nutritious food that was not served to guests and prepared it for weekly donation to local non-profit partners. Over the life of the program, we have donated the equivalent of more than 113 million meals. And for the past 13 years, we have partnered with Feeding America to help fight hunger. Over that time, the Darden Foundation has donated more than $16 million to support their network of more than 200 food banks. Last week, together with our partners, Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we added 10 more refrigerated trucks for mobile food pantry programs at 10 local food banks. To date, we have added a total of 35 trucks across Feeding America food banks in 18 states. Our ability to make a difference in the fight against hunger would not be possible without the efforts of our 190,000 team members and their passion to nourish and delight everyone we serve. I'm grateful for everything you do to help make our company successful. Now I will turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.7 billion, 11.6% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 77 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steakhouse restaurants, same restaurant sales growth of 5% and 46 legacy Darden net new restaurants. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 410 basis points and same-restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 430 basis points. First quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.78, an increase of 14.1% from last year's reported net earnings per share. We generated $388 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $300 million of capital to our shareholders with $159 million in dividends and $143 million of share repurchases. As we look at pricing and inflation during the quarter, we had total pricing of approximately 6%, which was 300 basis points above total inflation of roughly 3%. Now looking at our margin analysis compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses were 130 basis points lower, driven by pricing leverage. While beef inflation continues to track in line with our expectations, most other categories are seeing slight favorability. As a result, total commodities inflation of approximately 1% was better than our expectations. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points better than last year, driven by productivity improvements. We expected these productivity improvements to start materializing in the second quarter, but we began realizing them sooner. Pricing and labor inflation were roughly equal at 6%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points favorable as leverage from higher sales more than offset elevated repairs and maintenance expense. Marketing expenses were 20 basis points higher than last year consistent with our plan and including impacts from Ruth's Chris. All of this resulted in restaurant level EBITDA of 19%, 170 basis points higher than last year. G&A expenses were 110 basis points above last year, driven by three primary factors : first, higher incentive compensation due to significant growth in sales and EPS for the quarter and wrapping a very low incentive accrual in the first quarter of last year. Second, approximately $9 million of stock-based compensation expenses related to the immediate expensing of equity awards for retirement-eligible employees. And third, the addition of Ruth's Chris. Impairments were 30 basis points unfavorable to last year. We're wrapping on a $5 million gain from last year and we incurred $3 million of impairments related to a handful of closings anticipated for this year. Interest expense increased 30 basis points versus last year due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings after tax was 7.9% of sales flat to last year. Now turning to our segments. Sales increased at Olive Garden and LongHorn driven by same-restaurant sales and traffic growth. This sales growth along with labor productivity and higher overall pricing related to inflation drove segment profit margin increases of 230 basis points at both Olive Garden and LongHorn. Fine Dining segment total sales increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants, but same-restaurant sales were negative at both Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s consistent with what we indicated on our earnings call last quarter. This resulted in lower segment profit margin for fine dining than last year. As we anticipated, the year-over-year same-restaurant sales decline in our Fine Dining segment was the result of ramping on a resurgence of demand in the first quarter last year that drove traffic retention to 107% of pre-COVID levels. Fine dining traffic retention in the first quarter of this year was 100% of pre-COVID levels more in line with the retention levels for the prior three quarters. The other business segment increased sales driven by positive same-restaurant sales and the addition of Ruth's Chris franchised and managed locations royalty revenue resulting in 140 basis points of segment profit margin growth. As a reminder, all of our franchise operating results are included in the other business segments. Now, I'd like to provide an update on Ruth's synergies. As Rick mentioned, we've identified more synergies than we had initially expected and are choosing to reinvest some of them in the guest and team member experience at Ruth's Chris. Previously, we anticipated $20 million in annualized run rate synergies. We now expect approximately $35 million of gross run rate synergies and other cost savings and we anticipate investing approximately $10 million into the business, resulting in annualized net run rate synergies of approximately $25 million. And for fiscal 2024, we now expect approximately $12 million of net synergies. Finally, as shared in the press release distributed this morning, we are reiterating our full year financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our outlook still anticipates adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.55 to $8.85, including Ruth's Chris operating results, but excludes approximately $55 million of pre-tax transaction and integration-related costs. And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. Your Olive Garden and LongHorn showed impressive performance in 1Q, while fine dining saw headwinds as you previously warned. And I guess I'm curious, what led the decision to keep full year same-store sales guidance despite 1Q strong result. And are you perhaps seeing something in September that gives you pause on the outlook for the balance of the year? I know restaurant investors have been keen that industry data seems to be taking a breather? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Hey, Andrew. Thanks for the question. So let's start with the guidance, right? So as you think about our first quarter performance that was actually from a top line perspective, it was pretty consistent with our plan. We were within 10 basis points of our same restaurant plan we had. So the year from a top line is playing out the way we expected. So as far as -- and so that's really the trust behind how -- why we're not changing the guidance for the year. And now look, we're one quarter in, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. There's three quarters to go, and we had a range to begin with. And while we outperformed our expectations on the bottom line, we feel like it gives us a little bit of a head start, but it still puts \u2013 the point estimate is still within the range we provided at the beginning of the year. Andrew Charles : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Bittner : Thanks and congrats on strong results. I just want to follow-up with Andrew's question a little bit. There is a lot of anxiety, I think, out there regarding how the evolving macro could impact industry sales trends moving forward, specifically for casual dining as the benefits of pricing normalize. Just based on all your insights, do you believe that the current health of the consumer remains strongly intact? And can you help us understand what weapons you do have to keep traffic within your full year guidance range of flat to down 1.5% if the macro does deteriorate relative to your original expectations? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Brian. This is Rick. Overall, we think the consumers continues to be resilient, but there seems to be a little bit more selective. We are seeing a little softness versus last year with household incomes above $125,000 and that primarily affects our fine dining brands, but it does affect all of our brands. Now this could be because the increase in luxury travel, particularly international travel, which you've heard a lot of people talk about. But as I've said before, many times, there is attention to being what people want to pay and what they can afford, and they're going to continue to seek value, not always about low price. They're making trade-offs and food away from home is one of the most difficult things they can give up. So again, what does that mean for our brands? We believe that operators deliver on their brand promise and value will continue to be with consumers. And so we're going to keep doing that. We're going to deliver our promise. We're going to execute our brands and we're going to keep doing that and deliver value to our guests. And I'm confident we're well positioned for whatever we have to deal with. Thanks to the breadth of our portfolio and the outstanding team members in our restaurants who are committed to exceptional guest experiences. Our marketing programs, we told you what we're going to do with marketing in the prepared remarks. It's again at whatever we do is going to elevate brand equity. It's not going to be a deep discount and it's going to be simple to operate. And if it means that our traffic is at the lower end of our guide and then it's at the lower end of our guide. We're not going to do things that are going to impact us in the long-term just for short-term. Brian Bittner : Thanks for that Rick. And Raj, just my follow-up is, on the commodity costs. They were up 1% in the first quarter, which is obviously below your full year guidance of up 2.5%. And you did suggest that some non-beef items have been a bit more favorable. What's driving the reiteration of the 2.5% commodity guide? Is it just conservatism after one quarter? Is there anything offsetting the recent favorability as we move throughout the rest of the year? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Brian. So if you think about our inflation expectation for the first quarter, we were about 1 point better than we thought, mostly driven by, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, other categories. The beef is still a lot of uncertainty around beef and you saw from our coverage that we don't have a lot of coverage beyond, especially, as we get into the holidays and past. So there is some uncertainty around it. Now that favorability in the first quarter helps us a little bit. So what that might mean is that we might be a little bit lower in that guidance range we provided of approximately 2.5%. So maybe it's a little bit south of that. But there's three more quarters to go, and beef is really -- I mean, there's a lot of risk with beef, so... Brian Bittner : Okay. Hey, thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Eric Gonzalez : Thanks and good morning. My question is about the guidance as it relates to Olive Garden. And specifically, I'm curious how you're thinking about the second quarter, which is typically a seasonal low volume period for the industry. Historically, there's been a bit of a step down in revenue in Olive Garden from 1Q to 2Q, but last year was a little bit different with the return of the possible. So perhaps you can help us think about how to model that second quarter relative to your guidance and your own expectations, whether you see that fiscal second quarter revenue increasing or decreasing sequentially? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Look, I think it's -- I don't -- we don't expect a huge quarter-to-quarter sequential change. Obviously, we are relaunching now running possible that does help and that's part of the reason why we do it in the second quarter is with the back-to-school and there's a little bit of a lull and a slowdown in the casual dining and that's really the time frame. And basically, that's within our range. I mean, I think as we look at last year to this year, there's going to be some nuances with respect to pricing being a little bit lower this -- as we get into the second quarter than first quarter. But I don't want to contemplate exactly what it's going to look quarter-to-quarter. Eric Gonzalez : Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Harbour : Yeah. Thank you. Maybe just on the risk synergies, what were some of the additional things that you found? And then when you talk about reinvesting, would that primarily kind of be in staffing or are you also referring to kind of food and menu? Where would we kind of see that impact? Raj Vennam : Yeah. So route synergies, generally, where we're getting them is between both the entire supply chain as well as in the G&A, right? So we initially started with an estimate as we go through the year, we're finding that as we are now in the process, we've been able to identify more, and it's in both places. So from an investment perspective, we have a long history of investing in the guest and team member experience across our brands. And so we're investing some of these additional synergies and cost savings in a similar manner, with investments that the routes guests and team members will notice and appreciate. Brian Harbour : Okay. Thank you. Raj, also just with your prior comments about kind of G&A for the year and kind of the quarterly progression. Is that still kind of valid? It sounds like maybe that piece -- some piece of stock-based comp was one-time in the first quarter, but could you just comment on kind of the G&A outlook? Raj Vennam : Yeah. Sure. Yeah. As we've mentioned a couple of things, right. G&A was higher than we expected for the first quarter. Part of that was driven by our outperformance on the bottom line. I mentioned earlier that while sales were more in line, we did outperform on the bottom line that helped that cost a little bit more incentive comp. And then stock-based comp, that is truly a onetime. I mean that's more of a timing, but it's pulling forward some from future years, right? But as we look at the full year, G&A is likely to be a little bit higher than what we talked about last quarter. So I think last quarter, we talked about closer to $430 million. I would say, at this point, it\u2019s probably closer to $440 million on the year. Brian Harbour : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. I was wondering, Rick, if you could talk about how you're thinking about unit growth for the next several years. And I know at one point, you were trying to push unit growth towards the high end of your annual targets. And I'm wondering, if that's still your desire and perhaps, Raj, if you could give us an update on what you're seeing on returns and build costs, that would be helpful. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Hey, David. Thanks. In regards to development and unit growth, we do want to get to the top end of our long-term framework of 3% unit -- sales growth from new restaurants. As we've said in the past, there's still some permitting delays. We're seeing a little less on the utility connections and those kind of things, but we're still -- it's still taking a little longer to get permits. We also are being a little selective, especially where inflation and costs have made the economics of the deal is a little less attractive. And we generally like to have good margin of error with our projects. And so we've turned down a few projects that just because costs are a little higher than we wanted them to be. And we've done that in the past, and we've been able to get back to those same projects at the costs that are more reasonable for us. So we're willing to wait a little bit to get the cost back more in line. That said, we believe inflation has peaked and we are starting to receive more bids that are in line with our project budgets and some even actually below our project budgets. So that gives us some good feelings for the future. We still believe we have the opportunity to grow close to the high end of our framework and we are actively building that pipeline. Raj Vennam : And David, on the returns, we are -- our returns are still pretty strong. We are -- any project we approve has to be net present value accretive to us. And as Rick mentioned, we generally like to have a little bit of headroom within our margin of error as we approve projects. Maybe that buffer is not as high as it used to be. But when we look at actual performance on average, we exceed our internal hurdles by quite a bit. Rick Cardenas : Yeah. And David, I'm going to add one more thing. If you think about us saying that we'd like to see a little bit of a buffer in our net present value over our cost of capital, that's because we have all the capital we need and so we're going to be selective in projects. And the thing that's going to keep us from growing way faster than our long-term framework unit growth is having people ready to run those restaurants and that's what we focus on as well. We're focusing on developing people and we think we've got a great pipeline of people as well. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a follow-up, this was asked before, but I'm not sure I quite got the answer. Given where food costs and route synergies are coming in, we were surprised that you're not also increasing the low end of your EPS guidance for the year -- fiscal year. What are the potential offsets to what we're seeing in terms of what looks like upside to your plan on the EPS and the EBITDA line? Raj Vennam : Yeah, David. I think it's a fair question. But we're just one quarter in, right? So there's nine months to go. There's been mixed data on the consumer. We're trying to understand what's going to happen. And so we felt like it was too early to really come off of the range we provided. As I said earlier, our point estimate from the beginning of the year to now has moved up a little bit. I mean that's because of our performance in the first quarter, but that doesn't mean we're outside the range. So we didn't feel like we're at a place where we needed to change the guidance range. And there's -- so to your question around uncertainty, there are a few things. Primary biggest risk is obviously on the consumer, what happens with the consumer. Second is on the commodities. We're trying to understand what's going to happen, especially with beef, 22% of our basket is beef. So there's some risk there. Now the pricing in beef has remained pretty high because of the supply being down in the mid-single digits. We're starting to see some additional imports that might help on the beef front, but it's too early. So I guess all things considered at this point, we felt like it was prudent to stay with the guidance we provided. David Palmer : Thank you for that. I know you're not going to give the game plan for the company in terms of marketing in ways that you might pivot. But I'm wondering, just generally speaking, if we're seeing the industry trend worse than the flattish type trend that would be consistent with your guidance given your current [indiscernible]. If your traffic is down more than just modestly or you see it going that way. How -- can -- how would you adjust? I mean, what are the ways and Rick said, you're not going to go deep discount route, but what ways do you think you would adjust with your major brands? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Dave. You're right. We're not going to give you too much information on what we would do. But just understand that we believe that the best long-term health of our business is to keep our strategy of overall pricing below inflation, running better restaurants and not getting into a huge deep discounting to buy guests. We think that brings in the guests that just come in that are a little bit less core to our business and we're going to continue to operate our restaurants to drive one more visit from our core guests. And if that means that others start doing some heavy discounting, we\u2019re going to stick to our strategy. And even if it means that it\u2019s a short term, it impacts us a little bit in the short term because we think we\u2019ll be better off in the long term if we stay with where we\u2019re going. David Palmer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, just on the competition. Rick, I know you were pretty clear that you're not keen to start being more aggressive with discounting, doesn't benefit you long term. But are you seeing any changes in the broader competitive behavior? I think there are some that are concerned of an uptick in promos and discounting to drive traffic, especially with the commodity inflation easing. So contrary to your strategy, just wondering what you're seeing across the broader landscape. And then I had one follow-up. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jeff. One thing, yeah, commodities might be easing, but labor is still pretty high. If not -- it's getting a little bit better. But even if commodities are deflationary, there's still net inflation, at least in our business, and I'm guessing in other business too. That said, we have seen a slight increase in promotional activity, but particularly with one barn grill competitor and in the family dining segment. We're really not seeing a whole lot of competitive increase in competitive activity in kind of the Olive Garden range and above other than, as I said, that one bar and grill competitor that seems to be ramping up a little bit. Well, I said, Olive Garden is usually one of the top brands in share of voice. So no matter what this competitive activity is and television activity. Olive Garden is usually one of the top few brands in share of voice, but our message is about more and more and more. Come in to Olive Garden for more, more food, more value, more refills. And that's what we're talking about. And as I said, we'll stick to our strategy. And I'd tell you, that's reinforced Never Ending Pasta Bowl. So Never Ending Pasta Bowl is about never ending craveable by an Italian food at a great value, and it's right on our plan. We're doing exactly what we planned for at the beginning of this fiscal year with Never Ending Pasta Bowl, nothing new. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got you. And then just a follow-up. I know earlier you mentioned something about seasonality. I know you're referring specifically to fine dining relative to last year. But as you think about broader casual dining historically, I get the feeling right sales slow in September post maybe a stronger summer and battling now back-to-school. But I feel like the past couple of years, there was a lot of pent-up demand post-COVID and therefore, maybe there was no seasonality. People are willing to go out even during this time frame, and therefore, less seasonality. I'm just wondering, should we now expect to return to seasonality that maybe could explain if you were to see a slowdown in coming weeks. I'm just wondering how you kind of think about that if seasonality were to return, how you decipher whether it's traditional seasonality or slow in consumer? Any thoughts there around that would be great. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jeff. We actually do think seasonality is getting back to historic trends. And the data we talked about for fine dining with getting back to kind of 100% of pre-COVID levels. We're seeing the same thing. I'm not saying at the 100%, but the same kind of trends back towards similar trends of pre-COVID levels now, where last year, we do think there was a little bit of pent-up demand. And so we're going to watch it. We're going to see what happens for the rest of this month and the rest of next month. But it appears like, now we\u2019re getting much closer to what the seasonal patterns were. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Joshua Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Joshua Long : Great. Thank you for taking my question. When we think about the trends you reported here in the first quarter, I understand that the strength was largely in line with what you were expecting. Curious, if you could dive into any sort of comments around pacing, geographic performance, daypart, day of week, anything there or perhaps sales channel kind of in the to-go business for Olive Garden? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Josh. I think from a geography perspective, we're seeing more strength in New England, Northeast, we're seeing some softness or at least below company average in California, Texas and Florida when we look at the entire portfolio. Now brand by brand, there's a little bit of variability. But when you look at across our portfolio, that's the areas where we're seeing in terms of regional differences. Most others are kind of in between, and so kind of closer to the company average, if you will. But definitely seeing strength in the Northeast and especially New England area overall. From a daypart perspective, we are seeing some lunch getting better at casual brands. And so that's really it. Outside of that, I don't know that there's any additional color we can provide on the sales detail. Joshua Long : That's helpful. And then one point of clarification, Raj, there. When we think about maybe California, Texas, Florida being a little bit softer on a relative basis, do we think about that just from a kind of base of comparison? It feels like they were probably stronger over the last couple of years. So maybe it's just a kind of point of comparison. And then maybe, Rick, when you think about just that opportunity to drive the marketing and messaging, I would totally agree about the opportunity for the balance of operational execution and value to be a big key component in the second half of the year. It doesn't sound like you need to lean in or change the messaging. Is that correct? I mean you feel good with how you're communicating that it's about going out and executing it. Raj Vennam : Okay. So let me -- yeah, you're right on the year over. It's really driven by a function of last year on the softness I'm talking about in those markets or the strength because last year, they were in a different place. So that's a one year -- truly a one-year thing, and then I'll let Rick comment on the marketing. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Josh. I think now that we're seeing that we think we're getting back to more seasonal patterns. We look at our traffic trends versus pre-COVID. They're fairly consistent across the last four quarters across most of our brand -- actually, in most of our segments. And so we believe what we're doing is getting us to exactly where we were before without a bunch of marketing with at maybe slightly lower traffic levels because of that marketing. And so we're going to stick to what we're doing and see if the patterns dramatically change. And if they do, we have levers to pull that aren't necessarily deep discounts. And one of them that we just pulled with Never Ending Pasta Bowl was to give our eClub members a preview of Never Ending Pasta Bowl, which again was always in our plan. It was in our plan at the beginning of this fiscal year. It's not something we're doing differently we're doing it to learn. If we give our eClub members a little bit more reason to be in the club without giving them a discount to be in the club, then maybe that\u2019s going to drive more. So we\u2019re still learning, and we\u2019re looking at digital marketing and other things that we\u2019ve done and we\u2019ve learned throughout COVID. And if we do anything, we could use those levers but not necessarily deep discounts. Joshua Long : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks, guys. Wondering if you could speak a bit more or a bit to the dining room traffic levels broadly across the portfolio or even an Olive Garden specifically. And sort of how you think about where those dine-in traffic levels are currently, where they can go relative to the to-go business? Have we normalized or is there still an opportunity to see more dine-in recovery gains on the traffic side at this point? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Dennis. Our off-premise has gone quite a bit from where we were before COVID. So from a traffic perspective, yeah, we're probably in that 80% range in terms of traffic relative to pre-COVID at our largest brand in Olive Garden. But from a sales perspective, we're probably closer to where we were before COVID. Now with that said, but part of that is, as we talked about, we made a conscious decision to pull back a lot on promotional activity, couponing and marketing dollars that we spend at Olive Garden. So we're a healthier business. And so we like where we are. From the -- but also -- it also gives us opportunity, right? There is capacity in the dining room, which provides us more opportunity, but we're going to go at it in a way that's durable. That is actually not a one-time get people in the door, but we want to build it over time. That's why we're so focused on core menu, everyday value and executing at the highest levels we can so that we can slowly build back. Dennis Geiger : Helpful, Raj. And then just one quick one, just on the quarter itself. Anything to notable to call out either traffic or on the mix side of things at Olive Garden or LongHorn? Raj Vennam : Well, I would say, our traffic was actually a little bit better than we thought going into the quarter, but our mix was a little bit worse. So what we're seeing is from a check perspective at Olive Garden and LongHorn, a little bit of pullback in alcohol sales and some entree mix -- negative entree mix. But that's really what I can share at this point. Dennis Geiger : Great. Appreciate it, Raj. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. Danilo Gargiulo : Good morning. Can you comment on the level of absolute pricing you're facing versus your local peers? And why is a prudent strategy for Darden to be increasing prices above inflation. I know that you spoke several times about how you might deviate from pricing below inflation in specific period, but why now? Is it a prudent strategy? Raj Vennam : So Danilo, let me start with saying where we are from a pricing standpoint. Our overall pricing in the quarter was about 6%, as we said. We expect the full year to be closer to mid-3%s maybe closer to 3% to 4%, 3.5% to 4%. That said, when you look at where we are related to pre-COVID, our pricing over that time frame is in that 17% to 18%, including this quarter that we just talked about is 18%. Where the peers are, on average are about 600 basis points to 700 basis points higher than us over that time frame, which means that we have created a gap. Now most of our pricing this quarter is a wrap from pricing actions we took last year. In fact, I think the impact from this year -- the actions this year make up less than 10% of our total pricing. So we -- the carryover from last year represents 3%. So overall, from a pricing strategy perspective, we feel like we're in a great place. We feel like we have created the gap to our competitors and that gap is not going to get any narrower. We don't expect that when we end the year that maybe quarter-to-quarter, there may be tens of basis points of delta to our peers. But when we look at it overall, we feel like we're going to be still ahead of competition. Part of that is because our inflation that we experience is better than most of our peers and we try to target our own inflation in terms of how we price. But our inflation because of our scale ends up being generally much less than especially some of the local peers you're talking about. Danilo Gargiulo : Extremely clear. Thank you, Raj. And one more question, if you don't mind. So can you comment on the pace of integration efforts, especially in the light of the new synergies that you have found, do you think there is a potential to accelerate the full integration? And if so, is there any timing upside to the EPS accretion in fiscal '24 and '25? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Danilo. As we mentioned earlier, we are finished the planning process and we're about to embark on the hardest part, but it's only going to take us nine months. So think about integrating 80 owned and operated Ruth's Chris restaurants, thinking about the franchise systems, getting all of our operated restaurants on our point-of-sale system, on our payroll system and all of the other systems. We don't want to go too much faster than nine months just because that's a lot of disruption in the restaurant. So we're going to pace it at the right level. We've already -- as we've said, we've brought our synergy estimate up for this year from $5 million to $10 million, I believe, to $12 million this year about and that includes reinvesting some of the synergies that we found. So that would tell you that we got a little bit faster. But we wanted to make investments just like we do in our other brands. So if we get even faster on some of the synergies we see that the synergies are even higher than we've just analyzed then we may make more investments. And so, we'll do what is right for the long-term health of the business, but we're not going to try to integrate too fast and we're going to stay at our pace. Danilo Gargiulo : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your questions. Jeffrey Farmer : Great. Thank you. Some big picture casual dining questions. So some of the NAP data, some of the other traffic source data, so that casual lining traffic growth slowed in August, has slow it into early September. You guys are obviously taking a lot of market share. But again, bigger picture from your perspective, what sort of consumer or macro factors are contributing most to that softening traffic trend for that casual dining consumer? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jeff. I'm going to start with seasonality, as we've talked a couple of times, this is -- September is typically the low seasonal pattern. Last year, it wasn't, the same thing with August. And so I would start by saying seasonal patterns are getting back -- more back to normal when you compare all of our segments to pre-COVID levels, over the last four quarters, we've been pretty consistent. And so the other thing, as we've already mentioned, is there is -- the consumer is starting to have a little bit less confidence and they're a little bit more selective. And so we're going to continue to work on what we've worked on. But I think that pricing in the industry may have caused a little bit of this, but we've been pricing well below the industry and we feel good about where our pricing position is compared to everybody else and we're just going to execute. Jeffrey Farmer : All right. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on pricing. So pricing 6% in 1Q. You guys are guiding to that 3.5% to 4% for the full year \u201824. But what is that -- how should we be thinking about pricing moving forward, just sort of the cadence. So it's 1% -- or 6% in 1Q. What theoretically would Darden blended pricing look like in 2Q, 3Q, et cetera? Raj Vennam : Yeah. I\u2019d say, we're looking at probably closer to 5% in the second quarter, 3%-ish by the time we get to third quarter and probably closer to 2% or below 2% by the time we get to fourth quarter. Jeffrey Farmer : All right. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jon Tower with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess going a little bit authorization here, but curious to get your thoughts. California is changing or potentially changing the way that it pays its employees in the fast food side, I would argue it's going to have some implications for the broader industry in California and perhaps beyond that. So I'm curious to get your thoughts, one, on how you handle an environment where aggregate labor inflation starts taking off pretty dramatically in one state, perhaps spilling elsewhere? And then two, be curious to get your thinking around how the industry evolves either in that market or more broadly? And do you see this as an opportunity to accelerate share in that market even though costs might be moving a little bit higher? I would think that some independents in that market, in particular, might have to shut down given the cost to operate will be a little bit beyond reasonable levels? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jon. Let me start by saying the fast act you're talking about in California. I know it impacts fast food first and that could lead to higher wages across other segments of the dining experience. Our employment proposition is great. We've got a great employment proposition. As we talk about and I think we've mentioned before, our average wages, including tips are over $22 now across the country. But when you look it in California, it's higher than that. And so I think as labor costs continue to grow, we've had that in other markets where we've seen minimum wages grow or we've seen a reduction in the tip credit, and we've been able to execute and continue to gain share there. So if this does impact restaurants, it's probably going to impact the ones that have a little less capital and a little less the ability to withstand that. Just like we've seen in other markets where wages have grown really fast. We've been able to pick up share because we're still there. So we're going to focus on what we can control, which is providing a great guest experience and trying to continue to price below inflation. And if inflation is higher, others are going to have to price more and we'll be able to gain share by taking a little less price. We're going to stick to our strategy. Jon Tower : Got it. So the idea of taking potentially more price in that market later this year is not off the table given that inflationary pressure. Rick Cardenas : Nothing is ever off the table, if things change dramatically on inflation. What we talked about with the pricing actions that we've already taken, most of our pricing is already built in. But that 2% that Raj said in Q4 could be higher if things change. And it\u2019s highly unlikely, it could be lower, but it could be higher if things change. Jon Tower : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Rick Cardenas : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Sara Senatore : Thank you. A question on margins and then a quick one on marketing. The restaurant level margins better than we had expected. But I guess given pricing, the gap between pricing and commodities, even with labor inflation and I think the mid-high single digits maybe then in that context, the margin expansion wasn't quite as high. I guess given that pricing is going to roll-off and inflation is, I think it could shift higher. Are there any kind of dynamics that I should be thinking about with respect to that margin performance? I think you had said in the past that we should expect it to moderate, but a pretty wide gap between commodity inflation and price this quarter and offset, I think, by mix and some other factors. Is anything -- any different dynamics that we might expect to see through the quarter the quarters to come? And could you talk about whether the fine dining, whether there was an impact from Ruth's in terms of just sort of negative mix versus just with the negative comps that might have delevered. Raj Vennam : Yes, Sara. So let me try to make sure I answer all the aspects of that question. So let's start with the margins. So from a margin perspective, yes, you're right. If you just look at absolute pricing and commodities inflation or overall inflation and you could say, well, you didn't get the full delta between the pricing and inflation. The things we have to think about are a few things. One, there is a negative mix. First of all, let's start with the brand mix. When you have negative comps at our -- some of our high-margin brands that has a negative impact on our overall blended margin. And you saw that LongHorn and Olive Garden had 230 basis points each of segment profit margin, which is really what -- where you're seeing the most strength. The decline in fine dining, part of that is driven by incremental costs they have year-over-year. Their pricing is starting to catch up. But also, there was some negative mix, on a one-year basis, there was a lot of negative mix on alcohol. When we look at what's happening with -- at Fine Dining, there is trading down to lower-priced wines and other alcohols on a one-year basis. However, when we look at it versus where we were pre-COVID, we don't see a big fall-off. So this feels like there was -- clearly goes back to that exuberance that existed a year ago that we're wrapping on. And so part of that margin impact is from that. And then, the last piece I'd say is, some of the restaurant expenses still have high inflation, whether it's repairs and maintenance, we're running mid-single digit inflation on those lines and so that's part of that. Last piece is utilities. We had a record summer -- record heat. So that caused tremendous usage, much -- we've ever seen historically in terms of electric usage and that translated into some incremental cost to. Sara Senatore : That's very helpful to hit all the parts. Thank you. And then just on the marketing, you said your top line was pretty much as expected, maybe traffic a little bit better. I know you took up marketing as a percentage of revenues by 20 basis points, 30 basis points. Could you just talk about kind of the returns you're seeing on that in that context of in line and maybe a bit better traffic, how you're feeling about that ratio versus going back to the lower one or edging it higher? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Sara. Our marketing versus prior year was up 20 basis points, about half of that was just roots mix. So bringing roots into the mix. Our marketing was a little bit higher. And the other 10% was already in our plan. So the planned performance included the tenth in marketing. So we believe we're getting an ROI on that. And we've learned over during the COVID times how to -- we've been able to analyze marketing better because when you completely eliminate it and you start adding back, you can really see the impact of it versus when you have a lot of it and you add a little bit, it's harder to see. So we're able to read the marketing much better in the ROIs and marketing, and we believe there is one. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to come back to the conversation around menu mix. I think you mentioned some declines in alcohol mix as some of the fine dining brands, but you also mentioned something similar at the core brands, some alcoholics and entree mix (ph) that was a little bit less than you expected. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that on what you're seeing? Is this the first time you've seen this pull back in this -- or change in consumer behavior since pre-COVID? Raj Vennam : Yeah, Peter. I would say on the casual brands, we're only seeing it at Olive Garden and LongHorn and it's not alarming. What we're talking about is tens of basis points of negative mix. So it's not at a point where we're like, hey, we're missing check by quite a bit. But it's about -- in an environment where you have a pricing in that 6% range in the -- take an example, the last quarter, to have maybe 50 basis points of negative mix. It doesn't feel like it's a huge impact, but it was a little bit worse than we expected. But we're not reading too much into that, primarily because when we look at what's happening at Cheddar's, we're not seeing a negative mix there. So -- and the other part of it is we have introduced some menu items that are more -- at LongHorn, for an example, we have some items that are better margin, pricing difference there might be causing people to trade down, but it's not hurting our margins. So we're actually okay with that some negative entree mix we're seeing. So it's too early to draw too much into the -- to kind of read too much into this negative mix that we're seeing on the check at the casual brands. From fine dining, yeah, we truly believe it is a function of exuberance last year. We were seeing a huge positive mix last year and that's going away. I mean we've actually had that for four or five quarters until -- I think until we got through to the second quarter of last year. And so now we're starting to things normalize. And this is -- that's why when we wanted to look at it versus pre-COVID and when we look at it through that lens, we did not see any big drop off at the fine dining. Peter Saleh : Thanks for that. And then, Rick, I think you mentioned that labor obviously is still inflationary, but has improved. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the labor side? Is it just more availability of labor are starting wages lightening out or coming down? Any more detail on that front would be helpful. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yeah. We're seeing it much easier to hire than we have in the last few years. We've gotten much more applicants for every job than we've had before. If you think about the employment proposition that we've mentioned, it includes a minimum wage of $12 an hour, including gratuities (ph). And as we're seeing, yes, wage inflation is up, but our starting wage inflation is lower than our overall inflation. So it seems like it's getting a little bit easier to hire people, and we don't have to hire at such a high rate, just to get people in the door. We're fully staffed. Our turnover is getting coming down. And so our starting wage inflation is much lower or our entry-level wage inflation when people come to work for us is lower than our overall inflation, which is a good time. Peter Saleh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Gregory Francfort : Hey, thanks. Rick, I think you made a comment earlier on the call about maybe the -- if you're seeing a little bit of softness, it's more in the over $125,000 income consumer. And I guess that's just surprising because I think a lot of the concern is more on the lower income side of things. And I'm curious what you think might be driving that? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Greg. I think a couple of things. One, if you look over the last few years, wage growth has been higher at the lower income level and at the higher income level and inflation while it impacts the lower income more, their wages had grown faster than inflation over time. And I kind of mentioned it. I think a little bit of it now is the exuberance from last year and actually this summer, there was a lot of international travel. You saw that when airlines talked about adding roots internationally, and that could have been part of the reason maybe our Florida and California markets weren't as strong because maybe people weren't traveling here, they were traveling outside the U.S. because they hadn't been able to do that for a few years. I know anecdotally, I've talked to quite a few folks that have had international travel plans in their sights for two or three years, but they were just not doing it because of COVID, and they did it this summer. So it could be because we've had a lot of that. We're not reading too much into it. That said, we're going to watch and monitor and see, and see if something dramatically changes, but we're not too concerned right now. We just wanted to make sure that you understood that the $125,000 and up is something that we're seeing a little softness in or at least we did in the first quarter. Gregory Francfort : Got it. And maybe just one other. As you look at the mix of Ruth's franchise versus company-owned, do you think that would go higher or lower over time? Do you have a goal of that increasing or decreasing or kind of things more stable? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Greg. I want to start by saying, we're really -- our focus is integrating our current restaurants. We've got 81 company-operated restaurants into Darden. Our Ruth's Chris franchise, these are valued partners to us. If they have growth opportunities and they want to continue to grow and it makes sense, then we'll let them grow with us. But we expect to grow our own Ruth's restaurants as well. So I would anticipate that over time, the mix of Ruth's company-owned or company operated compared to franchise will go down. It doesn't necessarily mean that franchise -- number of franchises will get on, it's because we're going to open more restaurants at Ruth's. And so that's how we're going to stick to it. Gregory Francfort : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. I know in the past, we've talked about some different traffic performance from the under 35 consumer and the over 55 consumer. And it is interesting, especially for some of your older consumers who may be on fixed incomes actually could be benefiting from the increase in interest rates, but conversely, the sub-35 consumer, based on where their incomes are, the student loan repayments might actually affect them the most. Maybe it's a little bit of a real term question, but I wonder if you're beginning to see behavior differences not just from an income cohort, but from an age cohort and how you see that influencing your business? Raj Vennam : Yeah, John. Actually, what we are -- we are continuing to see actually the consumers below 35 be actually continuing to grow as a mix. In fact, when we look at versus last year versus last quarter and as well as versus pre-COVID, consumers below 35 are still trending better. In fact, and then 55 plus, especially 65-plus is still below pre-COVID and actually a slight decline from last quarter to this quarter. So we -- so it feels like from a mix perspective, we're seeing more younger consumer. And we're kind of seeing something along the lines of what Rick mentioned on the income spectrum too, where our lower income makes up a bigger percentage of our guest base today than it did before COVID. But we're not seeing any cracks in that those trends because we've been tracking that for a few quarters now and it seems to be holding up pretty well. Now if is something going to change in the future, we can -- and at this point, we don't have any insight to say whether that's going to change or not. John Ivankoe : And in terms of reattracting that 55 or 65 year old, I mean because -- I mean, if I would have told you about four years ago, we would have said, gosh, that's a big change for your business, especially at Olive Garden. Is there a way to kind of reattract that consumer, I assume it wouldn't be specific to your brands that it would be broadly, but is that an opportunity to maybe re-add that subset of customers? Rick Cardenas : Hey, John. I think about reattracting any consumer. We're trying to add one more visit from our loyal guests and we had a lot of loyal guests above 65. I do believe that they were a little bit more spooked on the COVID side and they should have been. If COVID have impacted them a little bit more. And we're going to continue to focus our efforts. And if we can do some targeted marketing to them, we've got a big e-club. We can use our eClub to talk to them and say, hey, come back to Olive Garden. But I don't think we're going to do some dramatic things because we've actually seen a pretty big increase in our younger consumer. And I think if people would have asked us five years ago to say, hey, we don't have enough younger consumers, they would have thought, wow, I can't believe how many consumers you've had on the younger side. So we actually like that consumer. We think that consumer is going to be a strong consumer for us, but we value all of our customers, including those over 65 and we'd love to see them come back more frequently. John Ivankoe : Understood. Thank you. Sorry. A \u2013 Rick Cardenas : Yeah. Sure. And I want to clarify something that I said to Greg, I said that our operated restaurants will be lower in mix for Ruth\u2019s and not, it\u2019s actually higher. So it should be higher in the future. Sorry about that. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Vaccaro : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just two quick data items, if you could. Could you share what off-premise mix was for Olive Garden and LongHorn in the quarter? And I know it will be in the 10-Q, but maybe also what was traffic for each of those brands in the quarter? Raj Vennam : Hey, Brian. so Olive Garden was about 22%, a little over 22%. So that's about a couple of points lower than where we were a year ago. This is not one of the high quarters. And then from a LongHorn perspective, they were about 13% off-premise. From a traffic perspective, I'd say Olive Garden was low-single digit or slightly positive. It might have been 0.3%, 0.4%. LongHorn was in the 1.5% range for traffic. Brian Vaccaro : Okay. Thank you. And then just following up quickly on the Ruth's acquisition. If you've had a chance to dig further in the customer segmentation, could you just elaborate on the differences you see in Ruth's customer base versus other fine dining brands? And I'm curious on the reinvestments you're making there. What are some of the key areas you see an opportunity to improve the guest experience? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Brian. On the Ruth's customer base, a lot of our customer research is based on data that we get through our POS and we haven't done the integration of POS. So I'm just using some data that we have from the past. It's a slightly different consumer than we see at Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s. And as we've mentioned before, we have very little overlap in the consumer for Ruth's Chris and the consumer for Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s. So that's a good thing. We're reaching a consumer for a different need state than they've had before. Ruth's is a little bit more suburban than the other brands that we've mentioned. And so we're going to continue to learn more about that consumer. In regards to the investments that we've made or that we're going to be making, as Raj said, we have a history of making investments in our team and in our food. And those are the kind of investments we're going to be making with these additional synergies more on the food side, but still some investments on the team side. I don't want to get into the exact investments that we're making now. Brian Vaccaro : Fair enough. Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist. Please proceed with your questions. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm hoping you can give us a little perspective on your expectations for the resumption of student loan payments. I imagine you've done some work on it. What do you think the impact could be on your brands and maybe even just the casual dining space in general? Rick Cardenas : Yeah, Jake. As we've said before, the restaurant industry is impacted really more about discretionary spending. We don't expect consumer repayment of student loans is going to be a material impact to Darden over time. And recall that a lot of these have already started being made. So I think in the month of August or -- month of August, it was about $1 billion a week. And that could be because some people are just deciding to pay off their entire student loan before the interest rate starts back up. And so the expectation was it's going to be about $80 billion or so a year in student loan repayment and we're almost at that run rate now. So -- and I also know I've read and seen, and I think you've all read that a lot of these student loan payments are the folks that are above $125,000. So maybe that's part of it as well. Maybe they've started to pay off their student loan. So we want to see how this progresses over time. But as we've said, we don't think it's going to be a meaningful impact to our business on the margins, it could be an impact, but it's not going to be a meaningful impact to our business. Discretionary spending is a bigger impact. Jake Bartlett : Okay. Great. I'm going to go with kind of an odd question, but I think it's -- I think it's something that investors are focusing more and more on and I'm not sure how valid it is or not. But I'm wondering your perspective on GLP1 drugs and the impact on restaurant demand, maybe Darden\u2019s restaurant demand. I'm not going to ask your average BMI for your customers, but any perspective there, any perspective? I know it's something that's on investors' minds, so I figured I'd ask. Rick Cardenas : Yeah. I didn't mean to laugh. But when you talked about my BMI, I'm not going to get into that. Jake Bartlett : I know yours as well. Rick Cardenas : I don't know about that. Let me start by saying full-service dining occasions are driven by desire to connect with family and friends. Our -- if you think about the frequency of our full servers dining gas is a couple of times 2 times, 3 times a year for a good guess. So over the years, we have spent a lot of time designing our menus to ensure guests have a wide range of choices to suit their individual needs. And we're going to react to whatever happens, but we don't think it's going to be a meaningful impact to us because of the celebratory nature with for people, why people come out to eat. And if it suppresses appetite a little bit, they're still going to eat. So we're going to be there for them when they do. Jake Bartlett : Great. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Parke with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. John Parke : Hey. Good morning. I guess can you guys just talk about the margin recovery at LongHorn kind of in face of deep inflation? And I guess, should we expect that to tail a little bit worse as we kind of move through the year? Raj Vennam : Hey, John. I think we -- what we talked about, if you recall, a year ago, was there was opportunity to get some margin back at LongHorn. Part of that was we had made -- LongHorn's team had made some strategic choices along the way to make investments in food quality and invest well below -- at pricing well below inflation as they were growing traffic. And LongHorn, by the way, does have significant -- actually positive traffic in the dining room relative to pre-COVID. And so we're at a place where we now can pivot a little bit back to getting some of the margin that we wanted to get and so LongHorn team has done a great job getting to some of that margin growth. And we feel like we're in a much better place from an overall business model perspective, especially given the top line momentum they have to be able to see the margins where they are. It's just -- it provides strong returns within our portfolio. John Parke : Great. Best of luck, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Strelzik : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had two quick ones for me. The first is on your commodity baskets. It looks like you have less lock than you did with the last update. Now I'm just wondering if that's typical. Is it intentional or things getting a little bit more difficult there with those conversations with suppliers. So that would be the first question. The second one, on the off-premise numbers that you gave in terms of the mix it sounds like you think that's seasonality or due to the kind of lower volume nature of the quarter. I mean -- we know that delivery also is softening up a little bit across the industry. Do you think that there's more shifting to food at home or any other dynamics that might be play there? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Okay. Let me first start with the coverage. So yeah, you pointed out, we have about 55% coverage for the next six months, which is actually the same as what we had a year ago, but a bit lower than what we would have had before COVID. In terms of the ability to get coverage, I would say at this point, it's still difficult to secure long-term coverage at the prices we like for beef and that's really the primary driver. If you look at our coverage, we don't have as much coverage in beef as we would have liked to at this point in time. And then the other point, as poultry, you see that we have about 65% covered, but normally, we're much more covered in that. Part of that is because we renewed -- we started a contract last year in December that actually just expires this December. So we're in the midst of trying to renegotiate that. And so that's kind of the reason why we're a little bit lower. But yeah, you\u2019re right. I mean, we would like to have a little bit more coverage. But as I mentioned, beef is still not where it is, would like it to be, especially going past the holidays, it\u2019s hard to lock out \u2013 getting into the holiday, December and pass, it\u2019s hard to lock in at prices we like. So from a dining room perspective, both LongHorn and Olive Garden had traffic growth in the quarter, right? So that means that some of the guests this off-premise question you asked, it\u2019s shifting to the dining room. So we\u2019re not concerned because, yeah, off-premise was down a couple of points that Olive Garden gotten year-over-year, but that means the dining room grew by more than 2 points. And that\u2019s -- we\u2019re happy with that. We actually prefer to have guests in the dining room. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak for any closing comments. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you. That concludes our call. And I'd like to remind you that we plan to release second quarter results on Friday, December 15, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you for all for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during the call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in that presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2024 third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 21st, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing second quarter performance is a comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence, casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. During our second fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales decreased 1.3% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 4.8%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter, and Raj will provide details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter, which outperformed the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales and traffic. Total sales were $2.7 billion, an increase of 9.7%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.84. We opened 17 restaurants during the quarter. Fiscal year to date, we have opened 27 restaurants in 16 states, four of which were re-openings. We continue to stick to our strategy, driven by our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and a results-oriented culture. And our brands are relentlessly focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere. This focus on being brilliant with the basics enables our brands to consistently perform at a high level. Our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain strong across all of our brands. In fact, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze reached all-time highs for overall guest satisfaction during the quarter. LongHorn also ranked number one among major casual dining brands in six of the seven key measurement categories within Technomic's industry tracking tool, including food, service, atmosphere and value. LongHorn's continued adherence to their strategy is driving strong execution, which can also be seen in the fact that they established an all-time high stakes grilled correctly score. During the quarter, Olive Garden ran Never Ending Pasta Bowl. It was offered at the same price point as last year, making it an even stronger value. Guest demand was higher this year and our restaurant teams did a great job delivering outstanding guest experiences, achieving the highest refill rate ever. This performance was driven by our focus on ensuring every guest is offered a refill, whether it's a limited time offer like Never Ending Pasta Bowl, or our Never Ending First Course, which is offered every day. This iconic promotion also satisfies all three of our marketing activity filters. It elevates brand equity, it's simple to execute, and it's not at a deep discount. Also, I'm excited to share that during the second quarter, and for the first time in their history, Olive Garden surpassed $5 billion in sales on a trailing 52-week basis. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for all of our restaurant teams, and they embrace the opportunity to perform at their best. On Thanksgiving Day, our teams at Ruth's Chris, The Capital Grille, Eddie V's and Seasons 52 did just that, with each setting a new daily sales record. And while we experienced some softness at our fine dining brands during the quarter, we are encouraged by the strong holiday bookings we are seeing. Now, let me provide a brief update on Ruth's Chris. Even in the midst of the integration, I'm really proud of how the entire team has remained focused on the guest experience. During the quarter, Ruth's Chris achieved the top box -- top overall rating score among all full-service dining brands within Technomic's industry tracking tool. From an integration perspective, things are progressing well, and we are on track to complete the major systems changes by the end of the fiscal year. During the quarter, we closed their former corporate office and the Ruth's Chris support team moved into our restaurant support center. We are excited to have them here. In October, we successfully transitioned 21 restaurants to one of our distribution centers, and we plan to transition the remaining company operated restaurants to our distribution system between January and March. This phased approach allows us to gather learnings and improve the transition for the other restaurants, while capturing supply chain synergies. We are deliberate with the timing of any changes to ensure that we minimize the operational impact as much as possible. We are on track to deploy our people management systems by the end of the calendar year and beginning -- begin rolling out our proprietary point of sale system after Valentine's Day with the goal of completing all systems integration by the end of the fiscal year. As part of the investments we announced on our last call, we have made some strategic decisions at company owned restaurants that will impact total sales in the third quarter. First, we stopped third-party delivery. Second, we eliminated lunch wherever possible, and we will be closing most restaurants on Christmas Day. I can't say enough about the tremendous partnership between the Ruth's Chris team and our integration team. Integration is never easy, but it has been a collaborative process, and I\u2019m happy with the progress we are making. We have reached the halfway point in our fiscal year, and I'm pleased with our performance thus far. All of our brands remain focused on managing the business for the long term and the power of Darden positions us well for the future. We also continue to work in pursuit of our shared purpose, to nourish and delight everyone we serve. One of the ways we do this for our team members and their families is through our Next Course Scholarship program. Applications opened last month for the program, which awards post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to children or dependents of Darden team members. Last year, we awarded nearly 100 scholarships to children of team members at both our restaurants and our support center. The Next Course Scholarship creates a lasting impact on the lives of our team members' families, and I'm excited that we are offering the program for a second year. Finally, as I said earlier, the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams. I am so proud of the focus and commitment that all our teams continue to have every day. On behalf of our senior leadership team and Board of Directors, I want to thank our more than 190,000 team members for everything you do to delight our guests and help create special holiday memories. I wish you and your families a wonderful holiday season. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick. And good morning, everyone. Our teams did a great job managing their businesses again this quarter, resulting in meaningful restaurant level and total margin growth. This margin growth was driven by positive same-restaurant sales growth, strong labor management and lower than anticipated restaurant and commodities' expenses. We generated $2.7 billion of total sales for the second quarter, 9.7% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 78 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steak House restaurants, 45 legacy Darden new restaurants, and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.8%. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 410 basis points and same-restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 370 basis points. Our focus on managing the business and controlling costs resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.84 in the second quarter, an increase of 21% from last year's reported earnings per share. We generated $403 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $340 million of capital to our shareholders through $158 million in dividends and $181 million of share repurchases. Now, looking at our adjusted margin analysis compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 190 basis points better, driven by pricing leverage. Total commodities inflation was flat to prior year for the quarter and slightly better than our expectations, while beef inflation continues to track in line with our expectations, most other categories are seeing some favorability. Restaurant labor was 20 basis points better than last year, driven by productivity improvements at our brands as pricing and inflation were roughly equal at 5%. Restaurant expenses were 30 basis points favorable, primarily due to lower workers' compensation expense and deflation in utilities. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our expectations. All of these factors resulted in restaurant level EBITDA of 18.8%, 230 basis points higher than last year. G&A expenses were $109 million, which was consistent with what we previously communicated. G&A as a percent of sales was unfavorable 40 basis points to last year. This unfavorability is primarily driven by higher incentive compensation expense due to the strong growth in sales and EPS for the quarter and wrapping a low incentive accrual in the second quarter of last year. Impairments were 40 basis points unfavorable to last year as we are wrapping on a $9 million gain from the sale of restaurant assets. Interest expense increased 50 basis points versus last year due to the financing expenses related to Ruth's Chris acquisition and the increase in short term debt as the second quarter is typically our peak funding need period for the year. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 8.1% of sales, 60 basis points better than last year. Looking at our segments, Olive Garden increased total sales by 6.3%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4.1%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 540 basis points. The strength of Never Ending Pasta Bowl contributed to flat same-restaurant guest counts for the quarter, 480 basis points above the industry. This sales growth, along with improved labor productivity and higher pricing related with inflation drove segment profit margin increase of 240 basis points at Olive Garden. At LongHorn, total sales increased 7.1%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4.9%, outperforming the industry by 620 basis points. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 310 basis points above last year. Pricing leverage, favorable menu mix and improved labor productivity drove LongHorn's strong margin growth this quarter. Total sales at Fine Dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants. Same-restaurant sales at both The Capital Grille and Eddie V's were negative as the Fine Dining category as a whole continues to be challenged year-over-year. This resulted in lower segment profit margin than last year. The other business segment sales increased slightly with the addition of Ruth's Chris franchised and managed location revenue. This was mostly offset by combined negative same-restaurant sales of 1.1% for the brands in the other segment. However, this was still 20 basis points above the industry benchmark. Segment profit margin of 12.9% was 130 basis points better than last year, driven by the additional royalty revenues and pricing relative to inflation. Now, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. We've updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the back half of the year. We now expect total sales of approximately $11.5 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 2.5% to 3%, 50 to 55 new restaurants, capital spending of approximately $600 million, total inflation of 3% to 3.5% including commodities inflation of approximately 2%, an annual effective tax rate of 12% to 12.5%, and approximately 121 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. This results in an increased or adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlook of $8.75 to $8.90. It excludes approximately $55 million of pretax transaction and integration related costs. Looking at the third and fourth quarters, we expect the EPS growth rate to be consistent with what we previously shared. We expect third quarter growth rate to be similar to the first quarter and the fourth quarter to have the lowest EPS growth rate for the year. This is primarily a function of the pricing cadence we communicated at the beginning of the year. We anticipate pricing and inflation to be relatively equal in the third quarter, and we expect to price significantly below inflation in the fourth quarter. So, to wrap up, we continue to be very pleased with how our teams are managing their businesses and delivering strong results. We remain disciplined in adhering to our strategy and we're confident in the strength of our business model. And, with that, we'll take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Jon Tower from Citi. Your line is now live. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. I guess, maybe starting off, I'm curious to get your thoughts. It seems as if obviously the consumer backdrop has weakened a little bit as we've moved here through your fiscal second quarter and perhaps into this fiscal third quarter. And I know obviously Never Ending Pasta Bowl seem to work exceptionally well, driving traffic on a relative basis throughout the quarter. So, I'm curious how you're thinking about promotions for the balance of the year? And I know the Never Ending Pasta Bowl has traditionally been once a year type of timing, but given the weakness we're starting to see broadly across the category, does that alter your thinking either with promotions at Olive Garden or any of the other brands for the balance of fiscal 2024? Rick Cardenas : Hey, John. Thanks for the question. Nothing that we have seen is altering our plans for the balance of the year. We're really pleased with the performance of our brands. We're right along where we expected to be. And so, we don't anticipate doing anything different. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Carril from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Chris Carril : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for the question. So, just on the sales outlook, can you maybe comment a little bit more on what drove the change in the comp and revenue outlooks for the year? I know it just changed a little bit, maybe a little narrower toward the lower end of the range, but -- and it's early in the 3Q, but is there anything you're seeing thus far that warrants perhaps a more conservative outlook here? Raj Vennam : All right, Chris. Let's start with the guidance at high level. From a sales guide perspective, if you just go back to the time we provided our original guidance, we mentioned that there is -- obviously the consumer background was a little tough but not too -- not terribly bad for us. And we thought if things slow down a little bit, we should expect inflation environment to improve a little bit. And halfway through our fiscal year, that's really the dynamic we're seeing. We've seen some check softness that's being offset by lower inflation, which is why we went to the lower end of our sales range, while increasing our earnings outlook. In fact, if you're looking at our underlying traffic assumption, it still implies flat to slightly negative traffic for the full year. It's really that check is coming down by about 50 basis points. And so, in the grand scheme of things, we're talking about the midpoint moving by 25 basis points from where we started the year. Now, as you look -- to the questionnaire on quarter-to-date in December, we're really only two full weeks into the quarter, and so holidays are still in front of us. And as I think Rick mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're encouraged by the strong holiday bookings we're seeing at our reservation brands. And so, our guidance contemplates everything we know. Chris Carril : Got it. Thank you. And then, I guess, on pricing, Raj, you did mention some detail in your prepared remarks around pricing, but is there anything else you could add there, maybe perhaps at a brand level, any incremental insight about how you're thinking about pricing here going forward? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Sure, Chris. I'll say -- let's start with our pricing. I think, we mentioned at the beginning of the year, the pricing carryover from actions last year is about 3% on the full year, and our guidance talks about 3.5% to 4%. So, you can imagine there's not a lot of actions this fiscal year. I can tell you that, for example, at Olive Garden, we haven't taken any pricing this fiscal year. And we don't -- at least at this point, don't expect to take any more -- or any additional action in the near term. And so, as you look at that check growth, check growth is likely going to moderate into mid-2s to -- into the third quarter and closer to 2% in the fourth quarter. That's kind of the assumption we have in here. Chris Carril : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning. Rick, I wanted to ask about your updated thoughts on delivery. Recently a QSR competitor of yours that's long been against third-party systems has decided to jump on and you seem to be varying further in the opposite direction given you said this morning that you're taking third-party delivery away from Ruth's, and it seems like at this point you could price third-party delivery in a way that would represent a very incremental, profitable transaction, an incremental customer, particularly at Olive Garden. So, can you just refresh us on why this seems to still be off the table as a sales opportunity and profit opportunity? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Brian. Yes, it's still off the table for us. As we mentioned, we eliminated it at Ruth's Chris. And it's not all about the price and the profit, and it is profitable sales growth we're looking for, but it is also the execution of the restaurant, what it does to our teams, and how we can execute our existing to-go business. And we've made investments over the last few years to make that experience even better for our consumer, and we continue to do that. We have had third-party delivery in a few restaurants for quite a while, and the performance in those restaurants isn't significantly different than the ones that don't have it. So, we still feel really confident about our decision to stay out of the third-party delivery. Even if we had to price more to cover that, our consumer would see that as our price, not necessarily the price for delivery. So, as of now, we're still steadfast in our resolve to stay out of third-party delivery. Brian Bittner : Thanks for that. And, Raj, as my follow up, you said in your prepared remarks that you anticipate price -- to price significantly below inflation in 4Q. That word significantly perked my ears a little bit. I'm just curious if you could give any color on what you do think price versus costs will be in 4Q? Raj Vennam : Yes. Brian, I'd say we're looking at somewhere in the 150 to 200 basis point range in the fourth quarter, because we do expect pretty low price in the fourth quarter, and we expect inflation to be a little bit higher. Just for a function of wrap, I think, really on the inflation, the first half of the year benefited from chicken deflation. Chicken is about 8% of our sales, and we don't have that tailwind going into the back half. Brian Bittner : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Eric Gonzalez : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. My question is on the other business segment, since your sales growth in the segment was negative for the first time in a few years. So, I'm wondering if you can give us a sense about what's happening within that division, which I know includes Cheddar's. So, I'm wondering if this says something about the low-income consumer, if there's anything else worth calling out with regards to that division? Raj Vennam : Yes. Let me start with the other segment and maybe I'll turn it over to Rick to talk about the consumer in general. So, let's start. When we look at our other segment, we're actually pretty happy with the performance overall when you look at the business as a total topline and bottom line, because as much as they had negative same-restaurant sales, they were still above the industry by 20 basis points as a segment. Now, there is -- there -- I don't want to get into exactly the details, but there are some things on a year-over-year dynamics, especially at one of our southeast brands that's primarily weather-bound and patio related, all that stuff, we don't want to get into those. But, by the way, when we look at traffic for the quarter at the other segment, it was actually very strong at north of 100 basis points gap to the industry positive gap. So, we feel really good about that. And then other segment was also more profitable this quarter. Even when you exclude the franchise income from Ruth's, their segment profit was higher than last year. So, I'd say, all-in-all, that's a pretty good outcome. And then, I'll have Rick talk about consumer. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Eric. And I just want to reiterate, we're really pleased with the performance of our other segment and all of our segments. Profitable sales growth is what we shoot for, and they all had profitable sales growth. Some might have been negative comp, but we still grew. But on the consumer overall, the consumer still continues to appear both resilient, but a little bit more selective as we've talked about in our check and we've seen that for a couple of quarters. Our data shows we're gradually moving back to our pre-COVID demographic mix, which -- with a bigger change in Q2 and moving back to pre-COVID demographics gets us to feel like we're getting closer to what normal is. I will say, we had, across all of our segments, household incomes above $200,000 are higher mix than last year, but still below pre-COVID levels. And incomes below $75,000 are under last year, but still above pre-COVID levels. And the biggest drop was those under $50,000. And this shift was most pronounced, interestingly, in our Fine Dining segment. And last thing, for those under 65 years old -- over, I'm sorry, over 65 years old, their frequency has grown from prior quarters and their dining is shifting a little bit more to lunch. So, that gives you a little bit of a check mix there, too. So -- but, again, what does that mean for us? What does that mean for the brands that we have? We believe that operators can deliver on their brand promise, which we've said before, and value will continue to appeal to consumers. I'm confident we're well positioned and prepared for what we have to deal with, thanks to the breadth of our portfolio and our astounding team members and what they do every day to create exceptional experiences for our guests. Eric Gonzalez : That's really helpful. And as a follow up, while we're on the topic of the smaller divisions, can you maybe comment on Fine Dining and talk about whether are we out of the woods when it -- as it relates to the abnormal seasonality and the post-COVID lapse? Should we start to see positive comps in the back half in that part of the business? Raj Vennam : Yeah. So, from a Fine Dining perspective, if you recall, we talked about seasonality trends normalizing and we talked about last year. There was some exuberance in the summer months that kind of continued into the fall a little bit. And so, as we look at where we are this quarter, we actually ended the quarter with positive same-restaurant sales in November. And with -- as Rick mentioned on his -- in his prepared remarks about record Thanksgiving sales, all of our Fine Dining brands and reservation brands had record Thanksgiving sales. So, November was an improvement. If you look at Fine Dining segment in general, is also where we're seeing the most negative check mix year-over-year, and it's really driven by alcohol. Now, I'll tell you that we are -- the preference for alcohol today is actually consistent with where it was pre-COVID, just that last year was a lot higher. And so, we are -- year-over-year, that's a pretty big drag. In fact, I think our Fine Dining mix is almost negative 200 basis points, and that's really one of the things we've noticed. Now, as we get into the holidays and pass, some of that should abate, because we started to see this dynamic in our fiscal Q4 last year. And then last point I'll make is, as Rick mentioned, we are encouraged to see strong bookings in both reservations and private events going into the holidays. Eric Gonzalez : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Your line is now live. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. Rick, does the early access to Never Ending Pasta Bowl for eClub members this quarter leave you encouraged to lean more into the 15 million or so Olive Garden eClub member database in the back half of the year, recognizing this won't be an avenue for discounting, obviously, as you're focused on profitable growth. Or is it that it was an immaterial impact just for that extra week of early access in the quarter? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Andrew. It wasn't a huge impact for early access, but it was something that delighted our eClub users, right. So, they got something that no one else can get. And so, we'll continue to find ways to talk to them, to give them benefits of being part of the eClub without necessarily having to discount. And so, that's what we continue to look at. And that was the -- one of the first tries at it. We were encouraged by the results there, but we'll continue to look for other ways to use that eClub. Andrew Charles : Great. And then, Raj, just curious, with the inflation guidance, how does that break down between COGS and labor as we think about the back half of the year? Raj Vennam : Yes. I'd say on the COGS front, as we said, we're basically looking at 2% for the full year approximately, which means back half is closer to 3%, 2.5% to 3%, Q1 being a little bit lower, Q4 being the highest in terms of food inflation. Again, it's a function of wrap on contracts and all that stuff. Not necessarily saying the absolute prices are going up, it's just the fact that what we're wrapping on year-over-year. From a labor perspective, our annual is around 5%. As you saw, from first quarter to second quarter we saw a slight moderation of about 50 basis points in total labor inflation. We are not projecting significant further moderation, but it's -- to the extent there is some that would be -- we'd welcome that, but at this point we're assuming it's closer to that 5% for the back half for labor. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Brian Harbour : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Raj, just on your comment about maybe a little bit lower check versus what you'd previously expected, is that specific to any brand? Is it more than non-Olive Garden brands or is it something you're seeing in Olive Garden as well? Raj Vennam : Yes. Look, I think, we've talked about it's kind of continuation of what we saw a little bit in the first quarter where we talked about, at our casual brands, we're seeing about 50 basis points of negative mix in general and mostly driven by alcohol. So, when you think about check growth in the mid-single digits, 50 basis points is not a huge -- is not as big as it used to be. It would be -- in a normal environment, when you're talking about a 2% check growth, we would say, oh, 50 is a big deal, but when you're talking about closer to mid-single digit check growth, 50 basis points is not as big, so from that perspective. But, also, as I\u2019ve said earlier, the bigger drag is from Fine Dining, which, as we get into Q4, should abate. But, right now, that's another factor that we didn't necessarily anticipate the level of check mix going into the fiscal year. But traffic is -- again, as I said, we focus more on what's happening with traffic. And to the extent we can say six months into the year that our traffic is similar to the levels we thought at the beginning of the year, that's a great place to be. Brian Harbour : Okay. Yes, it makes sense. And just a question on the food cost side as well. Were there any specific items that have kind of come in more favorable than you expected, or is there also maybe just kind of some scale benefits that you've been able to lean to recently? Raj Vennam : Yes. I think, as I said in my remarks, pretty much all categories except beef came in a little bit better than we thought. We are -- we did further up, just negotiate a contract for chicken that now we're locked in for the rest of the year basically at 90%, and that's going to be low single digit inflation for the back half, which is something we can deal with. And from other items, seafood continues to be deflationary. And then produce was a little bit better than we thought. Going into the year, we thought there was going to be some challenges with produce based on just some of the contracts we had, but our team was able to go back to our partners and negotiate given the environment and the market, and that was favorable to us from what we thought six months ago or three months ago. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now live. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Rick, I think you mentioned to an earlier question that there was no change in your second half promotional plans. Things seem to be going as expected. I'm just wondering if you could talk about the broader competitive behavior across casual dining. I think, there are some that are incrementally concerned of an uptick in promotions and discounting to drive traffic, kind of in conjunction with the industry, maybe seeing some softening sales trends, especially if commodities continue to ease. So, can you just talk about, again, beyond just your plans, what you're seeing across broader casual dining in terms of that outlook? And then I had one follow up. Rick Cardenas : Jeff, we're seeing what you see, an increase in television advertising, sometimes at a discount. But we're, as I said, focused on profitable sales growth. Even with the increase in competitive activity we saw in Q2, we exceeded the industry by 410 basis points and that was -- which was the same as second quarter. We exceeded by 410 in the second quarter, I'm sorry last quarter as well. This is on top of the 370 basis point gap we had last year. So, we feel like what we're doing is working, even with competitive and a little bit of an increase in competitive intensity. By the way, we also improved our segment profit margin by 230 basis points from last year. And so, we're going to stick to our strategy, providing everyday value to our guests, and continue to use our filters, which we've talked about many times, to evaluate any marketing activity. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then, Raj, the fiscal 2024 guidance, the openings halfway through the year were actually tweaked higher, which is somewhat unusual. I feel like the past few years, if there was going to be a change in opening plans, it was to tweak lower. So, I'm wondering if you could talk maybe about what the driver of that is? I think some have heard of improvement in maybe speed of permitting and construction, or maybe you're just seeing lower build costs, so you're kind of accelerating your plans or better real estate availability. Anything to talk about in terms of that uptick in the unit openings as it pertains to the broader industry? I assume that's the reason for the CapEx uptick as well. But any color you can provide on that would be great. Thank you. Raj Vennam : Sure. Jeff. Let me start with the comment around the uptick in the openings for the year. We were able to open some restaurants that we thought would be after the holidays, before the holidays. And, frankly, I think our team was a little burned. We got burned the last two years in terms of having some rosy projections. And so, we probably were a little bit more conservative in terms of how we thought about the timeline. That was built based on the actuals last two years. And so, that timeline is getting a little bit better. So, that's helping us deliver a little bit more, and that's really what's showing up. Look, our focus is continuing to want to grow, but cost effectively. We are going to focus on balancing the two, and so -- and our teams understand that and we're working towards that. And to your point about CapEx, yes, that CapEx is driven by the uptick in the NROs. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Joshua Long from Stephens. Your line is now live. Joshua Long : Great. Thank you so much. I was curious if we could dig into the segment profitability trends. Impressive to see the consistency there and -- particularly on the LongHorn side, but at Olive Garden as well just given a lot of the pushes and pulls. When you think about the second half of this year, are there particular areas? I know the back-to-basics approach really touches on kind of a holistic approach to the business, but any particular areas that you've been impressed with and/or are driving the majority of kind of the strengthened segment profit margin trends that you've been putting up? Raj Vennam : Yes. I'd say, look, the biggest growth in the segment profit this year is really coming from COGS, which was a big unfavorability over the last two years. So, we're starting to -- kind of as commodities moderate, that's really drive -- helping drive food costs get better on a year-over-year basis. So, that's one of the drivers of segment profit growth. We also talked about the difference in pricing versus inflation. We do have a little bit more pricing versus inflation in the first half. That also helped. But, I think, if you look at overall segment profits, as we got to fourth quarter of last year, it was very strong. I think at the Darden level, we were over 20%. And so, we are -- we had some -- we felt like there was probably more opportunity to get a little bit more in the first half than the back half. But, in general, all of our segments, all of our teams are focused on the right things. One of the things we talked about at the beginning of the year with our teams is focusing on controlling what we can control and our teams rally around that and focused on managing our costs better. And that's showing throughout the P&L. And so, there's no one specific thing I would pick on. In general, we're very happy with the progress our teams have made, and we'll continue to be disciplined. Joshua Long : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is now live. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I did just want to come back to the conversation around development and construction costs. Could you just give us an update on where the individual construction costs are coming in? Are they coming in lower than you guys are expected in line? How's that trajectory? And then just more broadly, what are you seeing from independence? Are you seeing more of a willingness to build more units? Are you seeing more restaurant formation out there? Or is it kind of more of the same that you've been seeing over the past several quarters? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Yes. Let me start with the costs. Costs in general on the development are in line with where we thought on average. We obviously have some unique deals, one-offs here and there where the costs are coming in more than we thought. But going into this year, we had embedded some higher costs into the openings based on the experience we have had over the last couple of years. And so, what I would say at this point is, we believe that the inflation has peaked. And we are -- we may have said this last call, too, we are starting to receive more bids that are kind of in line with our projected -- our project budgets. And so, that's a good thing. From an independent standpoint, I think it's hard for us, the data that we're seeing, to say that there's actually lot of excitement from independence on building new restaurants, given the way the interest rate environment is. So, the financing costs have gone up. And, in fact, to some extent that's also impacting some developers from what we hear. So, the macro -- you guys know the macro better than I do. But I would say, overall, we're still happy with our overall development, the number of restaurants we're opening and how we're thinking about it. And as I mentioned in my prior comments earlier today about we're going to cost effectively build our -- build these restaurants. That's the focus. We want to get growth, but we're going to do it cost effectively. Peter Saleh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. David Palmer : Thanks. A question on labor productivity. You guys have done a great job there. It looks like labor cost per unit was up maybe 2%, a little bit over that in the quarter, versus up a little over 5% in the first quarter. I think, you said wage increase was roughly 5% in both quarters. So, if I'm hearing that right, is labor hours down a few percent in fiscal 2Q? And if so, could you clarify maybe what are some of the drivers of that productivity? Rick Cardenas : Hey, David. Yes. We've had a history of discipline and improvement in productivity enhancements. This year is no different. We're getting more of it, because we've had lower turnover than we've had over the last few years. We're still investing in training to get those team members up to speed quicker. We also are spending training dollars on getting our existing team members even more productive. So, our productivity enhancements were the difference between our wage inflation and our labor inflation. I will also say our teams continue to get better with forecasting our business. We've added some AI tools to their tool belt to be able to forecast their restaurant business by -- in 15 minutes increments, even better than they did before, and we're seeing added benefit, as I said, from lower turnover. David Palmer : That's great. Are you thinking that that sort of labor productivity should continue in the second half? And, I guess, related to that, I wonder what you're thinking about California, and with the minimum wages coming in April -- is that -- how does that affect the wage or the total labor outlook for you? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes. David, our total labor outlook isn't that -- necessarily that different than where it's been in the first half of the year. I think, we're still having wage inflations at around the mid-single digits, which is pretty much back to pre-COVID levels. We do anticipate that as turnover continues to tick down, which we expect it should, to get us closer to pre-COVID levels. That will continue to have some productivity enhancements. In regards to the FAST Act in California, we're monitoring that. Everything that we have contemplated is contemplated in our guidance. I will say we have an amazing employment proposition and across all of our states and all of our brands, but in California, an even better employment proposition. Our turnover is lower in California than it is in most places and our wages are higher. So, we feel pretty confident that we're okay in California. But if something changes, we'll react to it. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Sara Senatore : Great. Thank you. One question and then a follow up, please. So, just on the price versus inflation, I guess historically you've priced below inflation and you've seen traffic gains as a result. Is your expectation that as the gap between your pricing and your -- and the inflation kind of reverses over the course of the second half, so inflation ahead of pricing that you might see acceleration in traffic. I know that you're already gapping out positively versus the industry, but I think historically there's been -- either coincidentally or not kind of 500 basis point gap in traffic and also in your pricing. So, I guess, that's the first question around as you're thinking about that trade off kind of margin traffic? And then I have a quick follow up. Raj Vennam : Hey, Sarah. So let me start with just grounding us on where we are with respect to pricing over the last four years. If you think about our price for the last four years, our pricing has basically been around -- at the Darden level has been closer to 17% cumulatively, just under 17%. For the same time frame, if you look at where full-service restaurant CPI is, that's 24%. So, we have basically created a gap of 700 basis points to full-service restaurant CPI over that time, in the four years cumulatively. In fact, if you look at limited service, they're at 29%. So, that's a 1,200 basis point gap to them. So, over the last four years, we've been very prudent, and we've talked about it multiple times about how we're going to price very thoughtfully and deliberately and wanted to make sure we're creating this gap. And, by the way, that overall pricing we have is below the overall CPI over that time frame by 300 basis points. So, from all aspects, we've actually stuck to our strategy of pricing below inflation, which is one of the drivers of our traffic outperformance. But I would say the other big driver is the execution, consistently executing and providing the greatest experience we can to our guests, and that's what our teams are focused on. That combined with the strategy of pricing under inflation is what we believe helps us separate ourselves from the industry, and we'll continue to do that. Sara Senatore : Understood. I guess, to your point, just thinking about sort of cumulatively, it will look a little different in the fourth quarter, I think, than in the first quarter. But it sounds like you're not expecting a big swing in sort of that traffic even as sequentially the relative value versus inflation might change a little bit. And then, I have a question on just trying to piece together everything you said about like the different income cohorts. So, you're not quite back up in terms of the high income as a percentage of your customer base to where you were in COVID, pre-COVID, but you're there, you're getting closer, but at the same time you're seeing check management. So, I guess, can you just put maybe a finer point on it? So, is the check management coming from lower income cohorts or the higher income cohort? And it sounds like some of this is just -- lower income cohorts may have splurged more in the past and now you're kind of getting back to normal patterns, but I'm trying to piece everything together. Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Sarah. The check management in Fine Dining is coming more from the lower income cohorts than it is from the higher income cohorts. I think, they were splurging, as we've talked about before, a little bit of euphoria in the last few years, and we're getting back to a more normal level. And in regards to pricing, your point on the follow up, recall, Raj said we don't really have a whole lot of pricing in the back half. Most of what we have is wrap. So, when you think about how much pricing we have versus inflation, most of our pricing is already embedded. And so, that's really where the delta is. So, the consumer isn't going to see a whole lot more price than they are seeing today. They might see a little bit in a couple of brands. So, we still feel really good about where we are, and we don't think it's going to really make a big change in our traffic patterns. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your line is now live. Patrick Johnson : Thanks. Good morning, guys. This is Patrick on for Chris. But, Raj, I was curious on the traffic at LongHorn, if you could just dig into that a little bit more, whether relative to last quarter or relative to the industry? And then also just check management specifically at LongHorn. And are you guys seeing any different trends there than maybe what you mentioned in some of the other segments? Raj Vennam : Yes, Patrick. When I look at LongHorn, they had a very strong performance for the quarter, right. We talked about significantly outperformed the industry on same-restaurant sales. Their traffic for the quarter was around negative 1%. That's a -- but when you look at their retention to pre-COVID, they've held up pretty well. They are up both in dining room and off premise by -- combined by double digits in the dining room. So, to have the volumes who are running at LongHorn today, we would have said four years ago it would take 10 years to get there, and we got there in four years. So, we're really happy with where LongHorn is in terms of their momentum, and we hope to see that continue. Patrick Johnson : Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Rick, I was just curious, as you step back from the business, and you think about strategically how you continue to exploit the scale advantages that you have. I mean, what are the biggest opportunities over the next 12 months when you think about potentially competing in a softer environment, what you can leverage? Is it supply chain, is it technology? Or just curious to get your overall thoughts on where some of those opportunities might lie to increase the gap between you and your competitors? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Patrick. I will say, over the next 12 months, pretty kind of -- a little bit short term versus the strategic things that we've been doing over the last few years. But we believe that we continue to invest in technology to make it easier for our teams to execute. As I said, we've got better AI tools for scheduling and if we schedule better, we execute better. That drives performance. Our supply chain scale advantage is pretty strong, and so we're able to get better pricing for our food, which we can pass on to our consumers through lower overall check growth versus the industry. So, there's no one nugget. What I would say is, it's our back-to-basics operating philosophy that's going to continue to get us to grow. And that's excellent food, excellent service and an inviting atmosphere, executing better than the restaurant next door. That's not necessarily strategic, that's not a silver bullet, that's hard to do, and we do it really well. And that's what's really -- as Raj mentioned earlier, execution is what's driving a lot of our performance, and we'll continue to execute by using our scale to help our brands get better. Patrick Johnson : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is now live. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks, guys. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more on off premise, what it was in the quarter, and any thoughts on the go-forward there? Raj Vennam : Yes. Dennis, off premise for the quarter at Olive Garden was 23%, so pretty similar to the levels we had before. And then LongHorn is at 14%. And, now, we'll get into -- as we get into the holidays, we should see a little bit more at Olive Garden. Typically, we see that, but we'll see how that goes going forward. But on a year-over-year basis, it's slightly below, I think, across our system. We're probably 100 basis points lower or something like that, it's -- but it's pretty -- it's stabilized in these ranges. Dennis Geiger : That's great. Thanks, Raj. Just one quick one then, just on any regional, and I know you talked a little bit earlier for some of the segments about some regional things to be thinking about, anything broadly across brands, cross portfolio regionally that you've seen? Raj Vennam : Nothing of note to talk about. It's fairly consistent with what we mentioned last quarter, where there's a little bit of softness in Texas and South, but not -- nothing crazy. California, a little bit stronger, but nothing meaningful. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Raj. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Lauren Silberman : Thank you. Congrats. I think, you've talked about before, you generally see changes in check before traffic in a more challenging environment. Do you see this check management as a precursor to traffic step down, or more of a return to normal behaviors? How are you monitoring that? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Lauren, this is Rick. We see the check management a little bit more of a function of year-over-year euphoria difference. Not necessarily that the consumer is feeling a lot more pinched. Now, we -- as we said, we're getting closer. The higher income households mix is going up, the below $50,000 is going down, and that's both on the traffic side and a little bit on the check side. So, we're not hugely concerned or we're not really that concerned about the check management now, because it was really more driven by last year versus kind of a long-term trend. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thank you. And then just a quick one from marketing. The $35 million to $40 million range that you're currently running, is that the right run rate, or should we expect a pickup? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Yes, Lauren. I think we've basically said we're going to be within 10 basis points to 20 basis points as a percent of sales versus last year. So, any quarter, you should be -- if you look at last year, and we should be within 10 bps to 20 bps of that. Lauren Silberman : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Andrew Barish : Hey, guys. Good morning. Just one clarification. On the unit side, you used the term reopens. Were those relocated units? And then, I've got one other follow-up question, please. Rick Cardenas : Yes. Andy, I think it was four. We had a couple of relocations. We had a couple of restaurants that we reopened after being temporary closed due to fires. So, that's really the bulk of those four. Andrew Barish : Okay. And just a quick update. Last quarter, you talked about more synergy realization potential at Ruth's Chris, but some of that going to be reinvested. Has that reinvestment started in earnest, or is it more going to come kind of in the back half of the year as supply chain gets integrated and things like that? Rick Cardenas : Yes. Andy, some of that reinvestments is already starting and some of it happens as the supply chain converts. One of the investments we made was an improvement in [indiscernible]. I don't think that's in every restaurant yet. Another one of the investments that we talked about we will be doing in December, and that is for their team closing on Christmas Day. So, there's still some things that are coming in, but we're consistent, we're on track with our timeline and we still expect accretion to be consistent with what we shared previously. Even with those investments, we're making for our team members and our guests. Andrew Barish : Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. Your line is now live. Gregory Francfort : Hey, thanks for the question. Rick, just one more on marketing. Can you remind us how the composition of that has changed versus pre-COVID, either maybe traditional or digital or other categories? And how you think about the returns across those channels versus a few years ago? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Greg. Yes. Versus pre-COVID, we're a bit more digital, partly because LongHorn really came off of television when we were on -- before COVID LongHorn was on TV. So, we are a bit more digital in overall mix. Olive Garden's mix isn't substantially different than before. They did come off a little bit of television, but they also came off a little bit on the digital side. We have pretty good analytics to tell us the returns on each of those things. And the good news is, during COVID we tested some more digital, and we were able to because we didn't have much media on at one time. When we started turning it on, we were actually able to see what those returns are. And that was one of the benefits of the COVID. We were able to test a little bit more, and we're testing other things on the digital front now to see if there's some things that we'll add in the future. Gregory Francfort : Thanks for your perspective. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Your line is now live. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one just wanted to follow up on some of the value perception, I guess commentary that you made, certainly relative to other restaurants and certainly relative to inflation, makes a lot of sense. But I guess when you broaden the view on that and look at food at home or grocery, and you see some of the larger grocery chains talking about food deflation and more promotions and things like that, does that factor into your calculus at all, or how do you think about the value perception relative to that? If you have any work on that or anything -- any thoughts would be great? Rick Cardenas : A couple of things. As we've mentioned before, dining out is really more than just about the sustenance. It's about getting together with your family and friends to enjoy a meal. And, as Raj mentioned earlier, we still have a very big gap in the pricing that we have taken over the last four years versus what's happening in retail. I mean, I would say, if retail starts to do discounts or other deals, it's probably because they're not moving product. And so, that helps us on the -- on our cost side. So, we don't really look very much at the difference between food at home and food away from home, partly because, as I said, people think about, I want to go out to eat, and then they determine where they want to go out to eat. And so, we haven't really seen correlations in the difference in food at home, food away from home over the long, long term. Andrew Strelzik : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just one other question, on the Ruth's integration, any surprises or learnings as that's progressed? And, I guess, the balance sheet still is in very, very good shape. So, would that integration either preclude you from making another acquisition, or how are you thinking about the balance sheet from here? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Let me start by saying we're really pleased with the integration and the transition that we've had. We're six months from the close of the transaction. We still have a few changes we have to make at the restaurants, and they have to absorb them over this next six months. But that doesn't preclude us from other things. And we'll continue to talk to our Board and determine what the right use of our capital is. As you mentioned, we do have a strong balance sheet, but we're going to continue to work on this until something else comes along. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you so much. At first, I was hoping maybe you could help a little bit with industry comparisons in January and February. Obviously, COVID lapse from the previous year helped, but also an unusually warmer, really lack of winter. I mean, I guess, if you were to kind of normalize those months, I mean, how much do you think you may have actually kind of been helped by kind of a bounce back in the early months of 2023 that we should at least consider on a lapping perspective. I know it's very tactical and it's not my style, but I would love to know your perspective on that. And then secondly, my experience is that casual dining operating companies don't love presidential election years, cost of media breaking through, disruption of consumers what have you. I mean do you share that perspective and is there anything that we should be just kind of considering as we kind of go into calendar 2024, what is obviously going to be another difficult election cycle? Thank you so much. Raj Vennam : All right, John. Let me try to answer in a way that I make sense, because, obviously, when you look at the seasonal situation, third quarter last year was wrapping on Omicron from the year before. It was just a whole different in terms of dynamic. But as you pointed out, the weather -- the winter weather in that quarter for us, third quarter, which is December, January, February in aggregate was favorable to five year -- to the historical averages. And so we do expect winter weather in the third quarter to be essentially a headwind in the Q3 just based on historical averages. If the weather this year is anything like what it would have been historically that it is a headwind for us. I would expect it's the same for the industry, but I can't -- I don't want to speak confidently about the industry, but I can tell you that's how we are looking at it. In fact, we -- that's part of the reason, we didn't get into this earlier, but that's part of the reason our internal estimates have comps, the same restaurant sales for the Q3 being the lowest for the fiscal -- within this year, primarily because of that weather headwind. And now, I'll have -- maybe Rick can talk about the presidential years and how we think about it. Rick Cardenas : Yes, John. Yes, this is an election year. It's probably going to be a pretty contentious election, with a lot of television advertising. The good news is, we're not as reliant on TV as we were in the past. And I think casual dining was much more reliant on television in the past, and chain restaurants were much more reliant on television, but now there's other media out there, more digital, more online video. And so, we aren't as concerned about an election year as maybe in the past. That said, it depends on how contentious this gets and how much media is out there. We feel confident that if we continue to focus on our strategies and execute, when people go out, they're going to come out to our restaurants. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Brian Vaccaro : Hi. Just a quick one from me. Thank you. Following up on your private dining bookings comments, could you help frame the degree to which you're up year-on-year or any perspective on how that might compare looking back to pre-COVID levels? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Yes. Brian, we're not going to talk about how much we're up in this current quarter on private dining year-over-year, so we'll let you know how that happens after the quarter ends. Brian Vaccaro : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Nick Setyan from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now live. Nick Setyan : Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the pricing below inflation in Q4. Historically, you've always priced below inflation. I guess, is there really a big change in terms of the magnitude of the pricing below inflation? And then beyond Q4, is -- are there enough operating initiatives to kind of maintain four wall margins? Or are you willing to give up some margin in the medium term? Raj Vennam : Hey, Nick. I think part of this is really the cadence of when we took pricing actions. So if you recall at the beginning of the year, we were very clear that we're going to have on a year-over-year basis, we're going to see more pricing come through in the first half than the back half, just because that's the function of actions we took last year. There is not a lot of new pricing actions we're taking this year. There are few and that's why instead of the 3% of the 3.5% to 4% that we have in total pricing is carryover from last year. So there are few actions this year. Typically, we tied it to our team, we typically take pricing with our fiscal year. So now things can change, but the way we look at it is, we take a longer term view and we've been very clear on the year that we are getting some margin growth. Our guidance implies margin growth. And I'll then refer you back to our long term framework, which kind of talks about over time we expect to grow margins. Any given quarter do we give up margins? Yes, maybe, if that's the right thing for the year. I mean, at the end of the day we look at over longer periods of time. Nick Setyan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your line is now live. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. Raj, I want to build on the -- last statement that you made on the margin expansion over time. So if we think about kind of the long run, and given the solid results that you already had in the restaurant level margins, can you help us understand the path for the incremental margin expansion? Meaning, why do you see the biggest upside over the long run as you continue to scale? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Danilo, this is Rick. You think about our margin, we've been fairly consistent over the years that we are searching for profitable sales growth and we have -- we had just updated our long term framework, we put that back out, where we'd be at 10 to 30 basis points a year in margin expansion, and any one year it could be above that or below that and we are going to get that through executing our strategy, leveraging our scale to be able to take cost out of the system and still over in a long term price below inflation to provide a better dining experience using our back to basics operating philosophy and our great operators out in the field that execute better than the restaurant next door. If we do those things and we have done those things, we will continue to drive profitable sales growth. There may be years that our margins are little bit less than that because we're gaining even more market share, and we're willing to do that. There may be years on the opposite side where we still gain share, but we have margin expansion opportunities. As Raj mentioned, we don't look at it quarter-to-quarter. We think about it over the long run. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. And then can you comment on the technology road map, and what excites you the most about it? You recently mentioned about kind of the AI implementation to improve the level of staffing in the stores. What do you think is going to be unfolding in the next few years? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Danilo. Over the last few years, we've focused a lot of energy and technology on improving the guest experience, primarily in the off premise segment, making it easier to order, pick up and pay. We're working on our tech plans for the next few years, but I would think that AI would be a little bit more part of that, especially on the back of the house things, maybe not necessarily as consumer facing. Our goal with technology is to eliminate friction, and we've eliminated a lot of friction for the guest on the to go experience on being able to put their name on waitlist. Now we want to eliminate friction in our team, eliminate our management friction to make it easier for them. So they don't have to spend as much time doing what we think are non-value added tasks, ordering, receiving, scheduling, which is value added, but if we can make it easier for them to schedule, they can spend less time doing that and spend a lot more time with their team and with their guests. And so, the technology investments we're making -- we may be making in the future, you might not see a whole lot of impact on that from the consumer. You will see it from the consumer because our teams are going to be better trained and so that's what we are focusing on. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. [indiscernible] Operator : Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you. That concludes our call. Remind you that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday, March 21 before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks again for your participation and have a happy holiday. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

During our fiscal third quarter, industry same-restaurant sales decreased 4.2% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 6.5%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter, and Raj will provide details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our results this quarter. Each one of our segments grew total sales and profit in an operating environment that was tougher than we anticipated. We continued to outperform the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic. Total sales were $3 billion, an increase of 6.8%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $2.62, which was in line with our expectations. We opened 16 restaurants during this quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, we have opened 43 restaurants in 22 states, seven of which were reopenings. The quarter started well with strong holiday performance in December, but unfavorable winter weather negatively impacted January traffic. And while February results improved, we experienced some underlying softness we had not seen in the months leading up to January. The lower income consumer does appear to be pulling back, and the mix of guests based on income is now in line with pre-COVID. I am proud that even as industry traffic trends weakened, we were able to gain share. We continue to focus on controlling what we can control, leveraging and strengthening our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture, and executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service, and atmosphere. Our restaurant teams continue to perform at their best, especially during our busiest times. In December, the Capital Grille set their all-time total monthly sales record. In February, Eddie V\u2019s set their all-time total weekly sales record, and Olive Garden established a new sales record for Valentine's Day. Our internal guest satisfaction metrics reflect our team's focus on being brilliant with the basics. All of our brands remained at or near all-time highs for overall guest satisfaction during the quarter. Additionally, within the casual dining, polished casual and fine dining segments of Technomic's industry tracking tool, the Darden brand was ranked number one for overall experience. The brands were LongHorn Steakhouse, Seasons 52, and Ruth's Chris Steak House. Our team's ability to execute at a high level is driven by strong leadership and team member engagement across our brands. We work hard to ensure our results-oriented culture is a competitive advantage for us, and our industry-leading retention rates confirm it is in an area of strength. During the quarter, we completed our biannual engagement survey, and a result showed that our overall level of engagement is at an all-time high. Also, during the quarter, three of our brands were recognized as industry leaders in Black Box Intelligence, LongHorn, the Capital Grille, and Seasons 52 each received the Employer of Choice Award. Now let me provide a quick update on Ruth Chris. We are in the final stage of integration and remain on track to complete the major changes by the end of the fiscal year. We successfully completed the migration onto our HR platform at the end of December, and all restaurants have now successfully transitioned to our distribution network. Currently, we are halfway through converting the restaurants over to our point of sale system, and we are on track to complete that work by the end of May. This is the most challenging part of integration, and I'm really proud of the focus the Ruth\u2019s Chris team continues to have on delivering exceptional guest experiences. This can be seen in the fact that Ruth's Chris was named America's favorite chain restaurant in Technomic's annual survey that was released during the quarter. The survey measures perceptions of service and hospitality, unit appearance and ambiance, food and beverage, convenience and value. In addition to Ruth's Chris, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, LongHorn and the Capital Grille were all ranked in the top 10. Overall, I am pleased with our performance this quarter. We continue to manage the business for the long-term by executing against our strategy and controlling what we can control. We also continue to work in pursuit of our shared purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. One of the ways we do this is for our team members and their families is through our Next Course Scholarship program. Earlier this month the Darden Foundation awarded more than 100 post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to children of Darden team members. Education is one of the greatest equalizers in our country, and I'm thrilled that we can create a lasting impact on the lives of our team members' families through this program. Finally, I want to thank our 190,000 team members for everything you do to create exceptional experiences for our guests. You are the reason brands continue to be recognized as great places to work and top dining destinations. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, although our sales were softer than we anticipated. We were pleased with December's strong holiday performance as the month's same-restaurant sales were in line with our second quarter results. However, winter weather in January negatively impacted traffic results by approximately 100 basis points for the quarter. As we moved into February, sales trends improved, but were below our expectations, exposing some underlying consumer weakness. Despite the unexpected variability in our sales trends, our teams did a great job managing their businesses. In the third quarter, we generated $3 billion of total sales, 6.8% higher than last year, driven by the acquisition of Ruth's Chris Steak House and 55 net new restaurants, which was partially offset by negative same-restaurant sales of 1%. We outperformed the industry again this quarter with same-restaurant sales that were 320 basis points better than the industry and same-restaurant guest counts that were 270 basis points better. And on a two-year basis, we have outperformed on same-restaurant sales by 770 basis points and by 970 basis points on same-restaurant guest counts. Our focus on managing the business and controlling costs resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.62 in the quarter, an increase of 12% from last year's reported earnings per share. We generated $512 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $190 million of capital to our shareholders through $157 million in dividends and $33 million of share repurchases. Now looking at our adjusted margin analysis, compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 90 basis points better, driven by pricing leverage. Total commodities inflation of approximately 1.5% was below our total pricing of approximately 3.5%. Restaurant labor was 10 basis points unfavorable to last year due to total labor inflation of approximately 4.5%, partially offset by pricing and productivity improvements at our brand. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points higher as sales deal average was partially offset by strong cost management by our teams. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our expectations. All of this resulted in restaurant-level EBITDA of 20.6%, 70 basis points better than last year. G&A as a percent of sales was 40 basis points lower than last year, and total expense was slightly favorable to our previous guidance related to lower incentive compensation and ongoing synergies from the integration of Ruth's Chris. Interest expense increased 50 basis points versus last year, due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings from continuing operations was 10.6% of sales, 30 basis points better than last year. Looking at our segments, Olive Garden increased total sales by 0.7%, driven by new restaurant growth, partially offset by negative same-restaurant sales of 1.8%. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales outperformed the industry benchmark by 240 basis points, and their traffic outperformed the industry by 270 basis points. Despite the negative same-restaurant sales, Olive Garden segment profit margin of 22.5% was flat to last year. At LongHorn, total sales increased 5.1%, driven by new restaurant growth and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.3%. LongHorn same-restaurant sales outperformed the industry by 650 basis points. Segment profit margin of 18.7% was 130 basis points above last year, driven by pricing leverage and improved labor productivity. Total sales at fine dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants. Same-restaurant sales at both Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s were negative as the fine dining category continued to be challenged year-over-year. Fine dining segment profit margin was flat year-over-year at 21.8%. The other business segment sales increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris franchise and managed location revenue, but was partially offset by combined negative same-restaurant sales of 2.6% for the brands in the other segment. However, this was still 160 basis points above the industry benchmark. Segment profit margin of 14.9% was 90 basis points better than last year, driven by the additional royalty revenues and higher overall pricing relative to inflation. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024, we have updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of approximately $11.4 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 1.5% to 2%, 50 to 55 new restaurants, capital spending of approximately $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3%, including commodities inflation of approximately 1.5%, an annual effective tax rate of 12% to 12.5%, and approximately 121 million diluted average share outstanding for the year. This results in an increased or adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlook of $8.80 to $8.90, which excludes approximately $55 million of pre-tax transaction and integration related costs. For the fourth quarter specifically, our annual outlook implies sales of $2.95 billion to $2.99 billion, same-restaurant sales between negative 0.5% and positive 1%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share between $2.58 and $2.68. Now looking forward into fiscal 2025, we plan on opening between 45 and 50 new restaurants and spending between $250 million and $300 million of capital for those new restaurants. Additionally, we anticipate approximately $300 million of capital spending related to ongoing restaurant maintenance, refresh, and technology. And finally, we anticipated effective tax rate of approximately 13% for fiscal 2025. And now I'd like to close by saying that we continue to be very proud of how our teams are managing their businesses to deliver strong results in this dynamic environment. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Eric Gonzalez : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe if you could unpack the comments about the low-income consumer pulling back? And maybe specifically talking about what behaviors you're seeing that lead you to that conclusion? And how the brands are differing from all of Darden Cheddar\u2019s to maybe some of the higher-end brands, how that low-income consumer is changing their usage of those brands? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Eric. We're clearly seeing consumer behavior shifts. Our data shows we're essentially back to our normal pre-COVID mix across all income groups. But specifically your question, for the third quarter, transactions from households with incomes above $150,000 were higher than last year. Transactions from incomes below $75,000 were much lower than last year. And at every brand, transactions fell from incomes below $50,000. Similar to Q2, this shift was most pronounced in our fine dining segment. Eric Gonzalez : Great. And then may be just a follow-up, if you could just talk about from a margin perspective, this year has been pretty strong. I'm wondering if you could maybe tease out how much that margin improvement is related to commodities versus what you've achieved from a productivity perspective? And if you look to next year, do you see that being a year of additional productivity gains or is some of that pulled forward into this year? Raj Vennam : Hey, Eric. This is Raj. So, from a margin perspective, if you look at where -- what we talked about at the beginning of the year, we -- this was one of the years where we had a pricing a little bit above inflation going into the fiscal year. But as the year progressed, inflation came down -- inflation came in better than we expected for both commodities and labor. And then that combined with our team's strong cost management that improved productivity on the labor front. We also improved our waste. We had some favorability on the mix in terms of how the trading happened between the items. So all of these were contributors to our margin improvement versus our plan. Now, as we look at next year, we'll share more details in June, but the way we look at as we're going through the planning process right now, but we\u2019ll always use our long-term framework as a guidepost to inform how we think of our plan. So we'll share more details in June. And -- but we have -- if you look back over the last four years, we were underpriced a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the lowering consumer and your comments about this cohort pulling back because it was a pretty pronounced commentary there. I know you talked to Eric's question about what you're seeing, but I think this is reflected in your 4Q same-store sales outlook? But do you anticipate this dynamic that you're seeing with the low-end consumer to be powerful enough to impact industry sales throughout the rest of the calendar year? And if so, how are you thinking about updating your strategy to deal with this? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Brian. Yes, we can't determine whether it's going to be impacting the rest of the year. What we can say -- what I can say is that impact to the low-end consumer was a year-over-year phenomenon. And now we're back to our pre-COVID mix. And so if you think about where we were before COVID, what percent of our guests were below 50,000, what percent of our below 75%, et cetera, across all of our segments, all of our brands, it's almost exactly the same as it was before COVID. So at least that makes us feel like we know how to operate in this environment. The other thing is if you look at Black Box, according to Black Box, every segment in the industry, from QSR and up was negative in same-restaurant traffic in our third quarter, every one of them. So that's also a year-over-year phenomenon. And so we'll continue to monitor what we see with the guest and what we see on that lower end consumer. But we're pleased that it's back to our normal or normal pre-COVID levels. And in respect to marketing, as we've talked about often, we're focused on profitable sales growth. And our brands, all of our segments improved sales and profits for the quarter year-over-year. And we, even with the increase in competitive activity, we expected -- we exceeded, I'm sorry, industry traffic by 270 basis points on top of the 700 basis point gap we had in Q3 last year, so almost 1,000 points, so 970-point gap in two years. So we're going to stick to our strategy of everyday value to our guests and continue to use our filters to evaluate any marketing activity. If that means that we're going to spend a little bit more in a quarter or a little bit less in a quarter, that's what we'll do. But we're going to focus on our strategy and stick to it as long as we can. Thanks. Brian Bittner : And just as my follow-up, as it relates to the third quarter specifically, your ability to manage the margins was very impressive despite where the comps shook out. Can you just talk a little more specifically about how you nimbly manage that labor and other operating expense line? And just, Raj, as we look to 4Q, I think you had previously said you expect to underprice inflation by about 150 to 200 basis points in the fourth quarter? Is that still kind of the range you want us thinking about pricing versus inflation for 4Q? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Brian, I'll start with how we manage labor and productivity, and then I'll let Raj answer the question on the pricing. So if you think about what we've been doing over the years, we've been improving our technology on guest count forecasting by using machine learning and AI tools to help the brands write better schedules and manage their business better and we're able to react quicker to impacts that we see in our restaurants, but we're also continuing to find ways to improve productivity. And one of the ways and the benefit that we had this quarter is continued improvement in turnover. And so we've had less training expense for new team members. And we've got better retention, team members know how to do their job better. In the turnover ranks, where we are today across Darden, our turnover went down by about 20 basis point -- 20 percentage points versus last year and almost 30 percentage points better than the industry. And now our turnover is much closer to pre-COVID levels, except for Yard House and Cheddar's, which actually we believe are at a level lower than they've ever had in their history. So those things help with labor and food costs and other parts of the P&L. And I'll let Raj answer the other part about inflation. Raj Vennam : Yes, Brian, for Q4, we're still expecting that gap to be in the 100 to 150. So overall inflation is expected to be in the mid-3s for us and the pricing is probably going to be in the 2 to 2.5. So we still expect underprice inflation by -- in that range of 100 to 150 in Q4. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is now live. Dennis Geiger : Great, thanks guys. Wondering if you could speak to what you're seeing from a customer average check standpoint? Anything with respect to alcohol or other mix contributions that you saw in the quarter or that have changed relative to prior quarters? Raj Vennam : Yes. We're actually -- for the check for the third quarter, we actually saw the mix moderate the levels we saw -- in terms of what we saw in Q2. So if you look at our casual brands, the negative mix was around 40 basis points. In Q2, it was closer to 60 basis points. And then from the Fine Dining, we saw a huge improvement. I think Fine Dining in the second quarter was north of 200 basis points negative mix. We're now seeing in the low 100 basis points negative mix. So that's almost half. So we are seeing some improvement in terms of check mix. And part of that could be a wrap, but also the holidays were pretty strong. And so that -- on that front, we're actually seeing a positive momentum, I guess, quarter-to-quarter. Dennis Geiger : That\u2019s great. Thanks, just one other quick one. Just as it relates to off-premise, anything to call out there in the quarter? What you're seeing, how your strategy has been effective despite some of the consumer pressures out there on the off-premise side of things? Thanks, guys. Raj Vennam : Yes. From an off-premise perspective, our sales as a percent of sales was slightly below last year, but not a lot. This is typically a high season for Olive Garden off-premise. So Q3 was closer to 26%. Last year was also in that range. We were probably 40, 50 basis points lower, but not a lot. And LongHorn was around 13%, which was also about 40 or 30 basis points lower. But overall, I think it goes back to the execution. Our focus has been staying on just ensuring that we executed the highest levels for off-premise, and that's helped contribute to maintaining the stability. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jon Tower from Citigroup. Your line is now live. Jon Tower : Great, thanks, I appreciate that. I guess the first one is -- and I understand you, guys, want to stay true to the operating philosophy. But how do you keep your brands top of mind and visible in front of consumers when the industry is getting more aggressive with getting in front of them by spending a lot more dollars than they have in the past several years on marketing? Rick Cardenas : Hey Jon, if you think about the amount we spend, even with the spending that we had this quarter, Olive Garden in most of the weeks were in the top three in share of voice. And so we're still in front of our consumer. We have other ways to get in front of the consumer with our eClub and with other digital spend. But at the end of the day, the best way to get people to come into our restaurants is to have guests recommend us to others. And so that's what we're continuing to focus on. We will continue to use marketing with our filters to talk about our core equities and to continue to drive results in the long-term. And we do have great everyday value. And what -- as we think about what we want to do in the future, I don't want to get into the details, but we have levers to pull. And if we pull them, you'll know after we pull them. Jon Tower : Okay. I appreciate that. And then just on the '25 outlook for the unit growth, I was surprised it was lower than at least this year from a gross opening or a planned opening perspective. Can you speak to why as of right now, you're expecting kind of 45 to 50 versus what we've been seeing in the past several years? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jon, you said it, the new restaurant projection we have for next year, it is within our long-term framework but it's lower than we'd like it to be. We're going to keep working on getting to the high end of that framework over time, but it will take a little bit of time. I would say construction costs were quite a bit higher than pre-COVID levels. And we have walked away from some deals, because of the construction costs and they've come back to us after we walked away. And so we're willing to slow it down a little bit to get a better result in the long-term. And -- but the good news is, at least the construction cost has stabilized. The other thing is it's still taking longer to get construction starts than it was four years ago. It's also taking longer to get to completion than it was in the past. And so if you think of it at that time it will take to build a restaurant, it's longer than it was. A lot of that is driven by developers, utilities, hookups and time for permitting and also time for getting certificates of occupancy. So if you think about the time that we have openings, we've got a lot of our openings next year towards the end, which could slip. And that's what we just wanted to make sure that we get the number -- that we tell you a number that we're going to hit. But we want to get closer to that high end over the long-term. And the other thing is I want everybody to remember we do include M&A as part of those new restaurants. And we didn't talk about that, but Ruth's Chris, we added 77 restaurants this year. So it gave us a little bit of a relief valve to not be so aggressive if we didn't need to be aggressive. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from David Tarantino from Baird. Your line is now live. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. I want to come back to the question of how you would manage the business if the environment were to get worse from here? And in particular, you mentioned you had some levers to pull on. I know you don't want to share details around that, but I was wondering if you could just comment on whether anything would change if things got worse? And then specifically on the pricing question, just wondering your pricing philosophy in the current environment and whether you will continue to be conservative relative to your inflation levels? Rick Cardenas : Yes, David, as we think about the levers we can pull, we have -- as we've talked over the years, we brought our marketing down. We've actually focused more on our core equities. And every year, we might take marketing up a little bit, but we're not going to strategic -- we're not going to change our strategy. We're not going to become a discount kind of heavily promotional brand. We worked really hard through COVID and before to get to what we think is a better, stable, stronger business for us for the long-term. And we would be willing to deal with short-term pressures to not change our strategy to get to the long-term. Now again, we have some tactics that we can do, which would still stick to our strategy, but we're not going to -- we don't plan on getting to be a promotional deep discounting brand. Again, Olive Garden, which had less marketing in Q3 than it did in Q2, while they had less marketing than last year and in the second quarter, our competitors had more, Olive Garden still gained share. And that's what our focus is, is to share gain, sales and profit growth over the time. We're going to continue to focus on execution, our food, our service and our atmosphere to increase frequency with our core guests. And we love our core guests. We think they're great for us, and we'll continue to build over time. We're just not going to fight gravity on what's going on in the environment. We're going to stick to what we want to do. And then on the pricing side, we -- our strategy is to continue to price below inflation over time. And we've taken a lot less pricing than the competitive set. We've taken a lot less pricing than CPI, a lot less pricing than full service, limited service over the last four years. So it gives us some room to continue to price if we need to. But our still -- our plan is still over the long term to price below inflation. David Tarantino : Great. It makes sense. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now live. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great, thank you. My first question, Rick, you mentioned the operating environment tougher than anticipated. Just wondering how would you size up? How much of that is the broader macro versus maybe whether you'd say there were any internal missteps? I mean, I'm assuming your data is showing that the broader industry pullback was not just Darden in February that you're seeing, the broader industry see the very same directional trend in February. Is that fair to say? Any thoughts there would be great. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jeff, I think it's a broader market versus any specific missteps we had. Our gap increased from January to February, our traffic and sales gap increased, both of those increased between January and February. And as I said, every category in the industry from QSR and up had negative traffic in the quarter. And so I think there's a little bit of a bigger challenge, at least a year-over-year challenge for our consumer. And we're going to see how that plays out over the next couple of quarters and see if there's anything we need to change, but it won't be a dramatic change. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just to follow-up the February, it sounds like you said it improved, but below plan. Did that underlying consumer weakness persist into March? I mean I know we're talking about short periods, but February is a short period and now we're pretty far into March. I'm just wondering whether you've seen any change for the better or the worse? And just curious from your perspective because you do have, I believe, up to nine brands now. What do you think drove that change in behavior? Is there anything in particular you're seeing? Because it does seem like January was weather, but then it really was just February and potentially into March. So I'm just wondering what your perspective is in terms of what drove that pullback? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes. I would say, first of all, our guidance contemplates everything we know about March. I don't want to get into March. We have a lot of challenges forecasting three weeks in the month, when you've got spring break shifts and those kind of things happen. And so we're going to continue to watch. I think I've read a little bit on tax returns being a little bit delayed. But we're not going to read too much into that. Our -- we improved our gap between January and February. And so that's what we feel good about. We're not going to talk about March yet. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Jeff Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now live. Jeff Farmer : Great. Thanks. Just following up on Jeff's question there. So again, you had made some reference to the lower income consumer, but in terms of thinking about just maybe a little bit softer trends than you had expected. How much of that would you put at the feet of the lower income consumer as opposed to the balance of potential drivers? Rick Cardenas : Yes, I would say that if you think about our results being a little bit softer than we thought, I would put it more at the feet at the lower end and the higher end. Our higher-end consumer was up versus last year. So that would tell you that it was really more on the lower end consumer. But as I think about what the consumer trends are, I just want to remind everybody that we believe that operators that can deliver on their brand promise with value can continue to appeal consumers despite economic challenges. And that's what we're going to continue to focus on doing. I remain confident that we're well positioned and prepared for whatever we have to deal with. Thanks to the breadth of those nine brands that Jeff talked about, the strategic decision we made to price well below inflation and CPI over the last four years and those outstanding team members we have in our restaurants who are committed to create exceptional guest experiences for our guests. And so yes, the lower end consumer probably drove a little bit more of our miss to what we thought when we talked to you before, but we're going to continue to focus on what we do and take care of every guest that walks in the door at the best that we can to have them to come back. Jeffrey Farmer : And then the second question, you just touched on, you gave me a pretty good segue there. But in terms of your more conservative pricing strategy relative to your peers, from what you've seen, has that driven traffic outperformance, market share outperformance? Is that strategy actually pay dividends to these customers, casual dining customers, appreciate that the Darden brand portfolio is actually a better price value than a lot of other concepts from what you've seen? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jeff. I think if you look at our gap over two years, our gap to the industry, as I said, being almost 1,000 basis points -- I'm sorry, yes, 10% gap over the three years. It's been strong. And that's what we do. We're taking this price below inflation, having a great everyday value. And we think over the long term, that continues to build the value differential we have. We've got value leaders across and that helps build the traffic gap. Jeffrey Farmer : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about industry capacity, particularly given what you're talking about with more challenged kind of traffic backdrop. And I think initially, during COVID, Darden talked about maybe a 10% decline in locations because of closures. And it feels like from a lot of the public companies we hear from, there's a desire to accelerate unit growth or has been. And I'm not exactly sure what's going on, on the independent side. So I guess I'm just curious, if you have a sense where capacity is now versus that 10% reduction? Are you seeing it come back in any of your markets or any specific regions? And maybe if you could touch on the independent side as well? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Andrew, I think we're still in that ballpark of 10%-plus. But if you actually look at the last year or so, there have been more closures than openings from the data we've seen. So net, there's net closings even in the last nine, 12 months data that we're looking at. When you think about the environment today, with all the regulation around where things are, it's very hard for someone to open a new restaurant. The financing costs have gone up. There is less developments happening, that's actually part of the reason we talked about some growth being constrained a little bit in the near term for us on the unit opening. So we would say it's not that different. It has not gotten much better. Maybe let's put it that way. Andrew Strelzik : Okay, great. And then maybe on your unit growth, expectations for next year. Just curious where we should expect a few openings to come from, I guess, does it just match based on the size of the portfolio or any of the brands in particular? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Yes. I would say, assume that two-thirds of the growth is going to be coming from Olive Garden and LongHorn combined, and then the rest is -- one-third is from all the other brands. I don't know that we would say there's a huge difference year-over-year. It's a little bit of a change. But as we look forward, as Rick said, we'll continue to try to get that ramped up further. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. I remember in past periods, there were a number of things that you've done that aren't necessarily operationally difficult, and I don't think overly discounts the brands, things like dinners for two, buy one take one, maybe even highly targeted couponing to certain lower income consumers to bring them back. Those types of things did prove effective to the Darden of the past. I mean, I wonder if ideas like that are on the table? It's the first part of the question. And secondly, a lot of the higher income consumer, obviously, as you're getting more price resistant about some of the restaurants that they visit, is there a way to invite some of the higher income consumer maybe through different types of promotions back in Olive Garden as well that you haven't been doing in the past couple of years? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Hey, John. Yes, that was -- the deep discounting, couponing, a lot of promotions was kind of a Darden pre-COVID. This is the Darden post-COVID, which is when we're talking about marketing, being things that elevate brand equity that are easy to execute and they're not at a deep discount. It doesn't mean that we won't have price points on things over time, but that's kind of more of our everyday low price or around that price. You think about Never Ending Pasta Bowl, we ran that this year at $13.99. It was a great promotion for us. And that was at $13.99. So we can think about doing those things again next year with Never Ending Pasta Bowl. We already have buy one take one on our menu basically, with the $6 take homes. So there's a lot of everyday value already. In terms of kind of talking to the higher-end consumer, as I mentioned, we actually grew at the higher end consumer at all of our segments. The 200,000-plus, 150-plus was up year-over-year. But I think you could see a little -- a few signs of some consumers trading down within our brands. When you think about LongHorn did really well with -- as they grew even at a little bit -- at the high-end consumer at a little bit lower, the 150, 125, and they had actually positive check. And so we're seeing some of that shift in some ways. And so we think as long as we execute great and we have great word of mouth, that will get that higher-end consumer maybe to trade to one of our brands from someone else, even if it trades from one of our current brands to one of our brands, that's fine with us, too. But again, long-term, every day, talk about what our core equities are, execute better than the restaurant next door, and we'll win, and we'll deal with short-term challenges. John Ivankoe : And is the company discussing kind of reintroducing or at least thinking about a more effective way to approach loyalty? I mean, is that something that becomes table stakes in '24 and '25 or are we happy with the current approach? Rick Cardenas : We're happy with the current approach. If you think about loyalty and full-service restaurants, frequency isn't super high. And we've learned that when we did loyalty before. And so it's a little bit less valuable for a consumer, we believe. Now there's other ways to get that data. The value of loyalty is the data that you get, and we have other ways to grab that data. Doesn't mean that we won't think about loyalty in the future. We're just focusing on what we can do right now to continue to execute better to drive results and not to drive something that's just buying sales, because we'll have to keep buying it next year and the year after that. We don't want to go out and buy sales. We want to go out and earn those sales. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Danilo Gargiulo : Great, thank you. So first of all, it appears the LongHorn, whether these challenges of this tough operating environment better than other brands. So I'm wondering what cost and what learnings could be applied to the other brands? Raj Vennam : So Danilo, I think as we talked about in the past, there's a lot of things, right? First of all, let's start with the big picture. We've talked about how, in general, Steak does a little bit better when beef prices are higher just because of the relative gap between the consumer would rather not take risk on cooking something that's expensive. So let's start with that big picture. With that said, within the steak category, not everybody is winning. So if you look at LongHorn, our performance has been driven by our execution. We talk about the simple operations, quality, investments in quality. So our team, Todd and the team have done a great job over the last four years, invest -- continuing to invest in the food and in service. And so if you look at it overall, you get a better value today than you ever did. So if you look at their pricing, it has been a lot lower in the industry versus the industry and especially for the Steak House, their pricing has been much lower than the competition. So the value equation is much better and a great execution. Really, those are the two things. Danilo Gargiulo : Great, thank you, Raj. And I want to follow-up on one of the comments that Rick was just making on, the level of attraction of your customers over the long period of time. And I wonder if you can provide some update on your customer trends with regards to the frequency at which they are spending in your brand? And maybe if you can offer also some insight on the size of your eClub member say versus the past and the total addressable market that you have? So how many customers you're seeing on a monthly basis at any of your brands? Rick Cardenas : Well, let me start by saying, I think we serve about 100 -- about 1 million guests a day. across all of our brands, or more than that actually. And so we get a lot of people coming in. Our frequency hasn't dramatically changed over the last year. And our eClub is roughly between 25 million and 30 million guests, that's active eClub. We have more members, but they're active. And so we have ways to communicate with that and that's across all of our brands. And so we're really confident now that we've got our, as I said earlier, on the income demographic back to where we were pre-COVID, we know how to operate in that environment. We're seeing some shifts at the above 65-years old, and we've talked about that before. They're shifting a little bit more to lunch a little bit earlier to dine, and that's great. But so those are the only real major shifts we've seen. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Sara Senatore : Great. Thank you very much. Just a couple of clarifications, please. The first is in terms of the gap in the industry. I know you mentioned that it widened from January to February. But I was curious if -- it's also been -- have been widening before that from the fiscal 2Q to 3Q? I think historically, the gap has tended to widen when trends, industry gets tougher because of that sort of more selective consumer but I wanted to see if that was the case, kind of stepping back? And then the other question I have is, obviously, gotten a lot of questions about the low income. I wanted to understand how perhaps this normalization will serve as a headwind in the coming quarters? So for example, you're back at the pre-COVID levels now. Does that continue to be a bit of a headwind for the next three quarters until you lap this quarter? And are you thinking about offsets in the form of better mix? So perhaps that normalization continues to show up from a traffic perspective, but by the same token, less of a mix headwind. Thanks. Raj Vennam : Okay. Let's start with the gap itself. So if you look at the gap in January, the gap narrowed a bit, we think primarily because of the geography and the footprint we have that has disproportionately impacted by weather. If you look at the concentration of where the weather was, that was a higher concentration of our restaurants. And we think that's part of the reason the gap was not as strong. Now the other part of this gap narrowing this quarter related to the last quarter was the fact that we're wrapping on huge gap from a year ago. We had a very strong performance a year ago. So that's really how we would kind of frame that. We're not -- look, we've been clear that it's very hard to maintain multiple hundreds of basis points of gap forever. We're going to have that narrow over time. But things we've done with our pricing and our value equation have helped us continue to take share, and we're happy with that. And as Rick said earlier, in an environment when there was intensity -- in promotional intensity, more so than ever, we still outperformed, and we were able to gain share. So that's the piece on the industry. Now as you look at the income mix, yes, we -- so this has been an ongoing shift. So we've talked about in Q2 that we're starting to see a shift a little bit more towards the pre-COVID mix. So we are -- so as we wrap -- as we looked at Q4 now, Q3 that just ended, we were right essentially where we were before COVID. So yes, the next three quarters, there's a little bit of moderation of getting that, but it's not as big as it was this quarter. If you think about -- we don't think. I mean we'll have to see. But based on the data we have, what we are seeing, it should be -- it should moderate. But we would expect the next two to three quarters to kind of back to those levels. From a mix perspective, though, that mix, we actually think mix is going to get better. We expect mix to continue to moderate. I think I mentioned earlier that Q2, Q3, we saw an improvement. As we get into Q4, we should see that get better. And as we get into next year, we expect this to be not a huge headwind. And we'll see how that plays out, but that's our best thinking at this point. Sara Senatore : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live. Gregory Francfort : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. A lot of what I wanted to ask was asked, but I wanted to ask you about the commodity outlook and thoughts into the fourth quarter. Maybe what's implied in risks to the upside or downside on that going forward? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Hey Greg, sorry. As far as -- on the commodity side, if you look at where -- what we expect, we expect third quarter to be around -- the implied guidance would be around 3% for commodities inflation. And part of the reason it's going up relative to where we've been is that everything except for seafood is inflationary as we move into the fourth quarter. Now not huge, but as you look at beef and produce are more in the mid-single to high single-digit inflation. And then most other categories are in low single digits. So a little bit of that is just a comparison to last year, a function of the levels last year. But from a coverage point, we're at 75% covered for Q4 which is consistent with historical average levels. And I think on beef, we're actually 80% covered for Q4. As far as we look into '25, we're, as I said earlier, we're in the middle of planning process for next year. So we'll be able to share more in the June call. But I think at this point, we are working through some contracts for next year. So I would hesitate to share a lot at this point. Gregory Francfort : Thank you for the perspective. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Patrick Johnson from Stifel. Your line is now live. Patrick Johnson : Great, thanks, good morning guys. Rick, I wanted to touch on menu innovation, particularly at Olive Garden and LongHorn. And I'm just curious if there are any opportunities you see to either introduce permanent menu items that still align with the brand strategy or even if there's potential to create limited time platforms like Never Ending Pasta Bowl that aren't necessarily discounted, but could drive incremental interest in visits over time? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Patrick. There's always room for menu innovation. We've got to balance innovation and new items with improving our existing items and making sure our menu stay compact and simpler than they were before COVID. And there's also always room for kind of limited time, not necessarily promotional offers. So currently, LongHorn has lamb on their menu, and it does really well. It's doing a lot better than it did last year. And with brands like Cheddar's, we use opportunity buys to put some items on the menu, but at really great values. And Olive Garden is continuing to look at ways to improve some of their items and maybe introduce an item but take off an item. So yes, we still have a lot of work that we do with innovation. But most of our guests come to us for what we have on our menu today and we're not going to alienate the core guest by completely changing those menus around and we don't plan on getting back to a six or seven-week promotion where an item is great. It does great for six weeks and then the guest comes back in week 10, and it's not there anymore. And so we'll continue to innovate but we'll continue to invade a lot more on improvements, but we'll introduce new items here and there. Patrick Johnson : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Lauren Silberman : Thank you very much. A few follow-ups. Can you just talk about the same-store sales differences that you're seeing across regions? And then from a marketing perspective, you're now running less than 1.5% of sales this year, well below pre-COVID at 3% or even north. So I understand you want to be prudent and protect long-term. Why is this the right level of marketing spend today? How do you assess it even if it's not deep discounting? Raj Vennam : Yes, Lauren, so from a regional perspective, we continue to see softness in Texas and California. I think Texas pretty much throughout the year, we had seen weakness, and that continues to be the case. Florida was a little weaker, but nothing crazy. But you also had the weather impact that probably disproportionately impacted both Texas and California during Q3. Different types of events, but weather there, so that's regional. From a marketing perspective, we've been very clear that, look, we're going to be prudent, we're going to be very deliberate in how we bring back marketing. We've learned a lot in terms of the effectiveness of marketing in different channels, how we deploy it. And we've talked about bringing it back at a level that's more methodical in terms of 10 to 20 basis points increase over time in a way that's margin neutral, all else being equal. So that's kind of really what -- how we're thinking about it. And we have done a lot of work. We continue to do a lot of work on marketing mix analysis and we got our teams of data scientists internally and work with some external partners to ensure that we're getting the appropriate return, and it's actually being effective the way we want it to be, which is to elevate brand equity and build long-term guest loyalty. Lauren Silberman : Thank you. And then if I can just -- on the guide, lower sales maintained or increased the lower end of the guide, inflation more favorable. Any other puts and takes in the guide for the year? And then can you just clarify what you're expecting for the full year on G&A? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Yes. Let me start with the G&A. We expect G&A to be pretty similar to what we said last time, $440 million, I think, is what we said for last -- in the last quarter. So call it roughly $100 million for Q4. Look, I think the big things are we've obviously brought down some sales expectation but inflation is better. And then our teams are doing a better job managing our business. So there is some improvement in productivity, improvement in other waste and other types of inefficiencies. But outside of that, nothing that's not outside of those few items that I've just mentioned. But if you just step back and look at what we -- where we started the year, right? If we look at the beginning of the year, we said earnings guidance was $8.55 to $8.85. And we said, to the extent sales slowdown or we see weakness in sales, we should see inflation come down and our cost management continue to help us get us closer to that. And today, we're talking about earnings guidance of $8.80 to $8.90, now with a lot lower sales, but we got there through other wins. So again, I don't want to say what we said, we told you, but it's just -- that is reality. That's what happened. Lauren Silberman : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is now live. Peter Saleh : Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question. I apologize if I missed this, but I know you guys commented on the traffic softness for the lower-income consumer and maybe by cohort. But can you maybe discuss the behavior of those consumers in terms of their check management? Are you seeing a lot of trade down for the consumers that are coming in within the menu or within brands? Or are they cutting alcohol or appetizers or desserts? Or just anything that suggests that those consumers that are coming in are also managing that check down? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Yes. Interestingly, from a check management perspective, it's not as much driven by income. The gap is more driven by older consumers, especially 65 plus is managing the check a little bit more. It's not -- irrespective of their income is what we're seeing. And they are also, I think Rick mentioned earlier, they're shifting more to lunch. So we're seeing a couple of things. They're getting a little bit less add-ons, but also managing the check. But also, like I said earlier, from Q2 to Q3, it's actually less management of check. Now with a little bit less traffic, but that's -- but what's happening is check management is actually getting better. In terms of negative mix, it's not as big as it was in Q2. Peter Saleh : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Brian Vaccaro : Hi. Thanks and good morning. For my question, and sorry if I missed it, but could you share what traffic in the quarter was for Olive Garden and LongHorn? I know that's usually in the queue, but did you or can you share that? Raj Vennam : Yes, sure. Olive Garden check was 2% in the quarter. So basically, traffic would be negative 3.8%. And then LongHorn traffic was in the mid-negative 2s. Brian Vaccaro : Okay, thank you for that. And I guess you've had this question a couple of times, but I'll ask it this way. In an environment where you're seeing softness on the lower-end consumer and maybe there's just a broader backdrop where value seems increasingly important, I guess it's interesting to see Olive Garden's relative comp outperformance narrow, given the brand's strong everyday value positioning. So I guess, how do you reconcile that? And is there any evidence that you're starting to see some profitable guests to certain brands, not asking for names, but certain brands that are gaining share or have shifted their tactics in the last year? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Brian. If you think about Olive Garden. So as Raj said, Olive Garden exceeded the industry benchmark for same-restaurant traffic by 270 basis points. They spent less in media at a time when many of their competitors ramped up discounts on television. So they exceeded by 270 with less media and when others were ramping up. Their two-year gap is 830 basis points, so that's a big share gain over two years. So I'm really proud of the work that Dan and his team have done to improve the guest experience. They continue to focus on their key equity of never-ending, craveable, abundant Italian food, specifically focusing on ensuring every guest is offered a refill on their never-ending first course. And that's a huge value. I can't tell you if our -- if an Olive Garden guest has shifted over to one of those competitors, but I can tell you that we trade guests all the time. Some of our biggest -- Olive Garden's biggest competitors are the ones that are doing some of the discounting today. And so we're really proud of the 270 basis point gap on top of the gap they had before. And if we're seeding a profitable guest, I don't think it's a seed forever. It's just because people shift and they move around. And so we're going to keep focusing on what we can do to keep our guests coming back for one visit. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. Kevin Kalicak : Thank you. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 20, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thanks again for participating in today's call, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Courtney Aquilla. Thank you. You may begin. Courtney Aquilla : Thank you, Darrell. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden\u2019s President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the investor relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2025 first quarter earnings on Thursday, September 19th before the market opens followed by a conference call. During today's call any reference to pre-COVID when discussing fourth quarter performance is a comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and any reference to annual pre-COVID performance is the trailing 12-months ending February of fiscal year 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence's casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden's casual dining brands. During our fiscal fourth quarter, industry same restaurant sales decreased 0.8% and industry same restaurant guest counts decreased 3.5%. And during our full fiscal year 2024, industry same restaurant sales decreased 1.4% and industry same restaurant guest counts decreased 4.7%. This morning Rick will share some brief remarks recapping the fiscal year. Raj will provide details on the fourth quarter and full-year financial results and share our fiscal 2025 financial outlook. And then Rick will close with some final comments. Now I will turn it over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Courtney. Before I begin, I would like to thank Kevin Kalicak for his leadership of Investor Relations for close to 10-years. As many of you know, Kevin has moved to Lead Finance for Olive Garden. We are excited for his new opportunity and equally excited to have Courtney transition into leading investor relations. I'm confident you will find Courtney a worthy successor. Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our ability to stay disciplined and control what we can control. This continued focus enabled us to have a strong year in what became an increasingly weaker consumer environment, especially for consumers below the median household income. For the full-year, we grew total sales by 8.6% to $11.4 billion, delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $8.88, an increase of 11%, exceeding the high-end of the EPS range we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year, despite the challenging sales environment that emerged in the back half of the year. We opened 53 new restaurants in 24 states, eight of which were reopenings, and acquired and completed the integration of Ruth's Chris Steak House. Throughout the year, we strengthened and defended our four competitive advantages, and our restaurants remained focused on being brilliant with the basics. This has enabled us to successfully navigate whatever comes our way, including the increased discounting and marketing pressure we've seen recently. And when evaluating our performance within the context of our long-term framework of 10% to 15% total shareholder return as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield, we delivered a TSR of 14.2% for fiscal 2024, which is near the high-end of our target. And as I said, our teams are focused on controlling what they can control. One of the ways we do that is by having well-trained, tenured team members. Our manager and team member retention is at or above pre-COVID levels, and our teams are benefiting from this staffing consistency, which helps create great guest experiences. We also provide our teams with training programs that not only enhance their skill sets, but build on the unique culture of our brands. Further strengthening engagement. For example, LongHorn recently completed their seventh steak master series. Over the course of two months, 1,000s of culinary team members competed in this highly engaging grilling competition and training program for the Right to be Crown Champion and received the $15,000 grand prize. Congratulations to this year's champion, Jacob Montgomery from the LongHorn Steak House in Cape Coral, Florida. Beyond providing strong labor and cost management, our operators are ensuring their teams remain focused on being brilliant with the basics, which is driving record guest satisfaction. Several of our brands reach all new time highs for overall guest satisfaction for the full fiscal year, including Olive Garden, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Season\u2019s 52, and Bahama Breeze. Additionally, within the casual dining segment of technomics industry tracking tool, LongHorn ended the fiscal year ranked number one for food, service, atmosphere, and overall perceptions, as well as brand fit and loyalty. Now let me provide a final update on the integration of Ruth's Chris Steak House. During the quarter, we completed the transition of all company-owned restaurants onto both our proprietary point of sale and labor management systems, which were the final major changes for the restaurants. We also acquired a single franchise location in Destin, Florida during the quarter. Thanks to the hard work and collaboration between the Ruth's Chris team and our integration team, we closed on the acquisition and completed the integration during the same fiscal year. This included onboarding 5,000 new team members with no turnover among our nine directors of operations. We also achieved the expected synergies, resulting in EPS accretion of $0.10. Integration is not easy, and I'm particularly proud of the focus the restaurant teams maintained on the guest and team member experience throughout the process. Overall I'm pleased with our performance for the fiscal year. We successfully navigated a challenging environment and our proven strategy combined with the strength of our business ensures we are well positioned regardless of the operating environment. As we begin fiscal 2025, we remain focused on managing our business for the long-term by executing our strategy that drives growth and long-term shareholder value. We have also taken steps to further position Darden and our brands for future growth and success through several leadership changes. We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talent and these changes are designed to allow two of our most seasoned presidents to devote more time to developing our newest brand presidents. After nine years of leading LongHorn Steak House to record performance, Todd Burrowes has transitioned to a new role as President of Business Development. Todd now has responsibility for our new restaurant development and facilities team, our international and franchising business, and Ruth's Chris, our newest brand. Reporting to Todd are Mark Braun, Senior Vice President of Development; Brad Smith, President of International and Franchising; and Rick Jenkins, President of Ruth's Chris, who previously led operations for the brand. Todd is well suited to lead this work. He brings an operator's perspective to new restaurant development and our growing franchise business. Further, Todd was with LongHorn when we acquired Ruth's Hospitality 17-years ago, and he will be a valuable leader and resource for Rick as the Ruth\u2019s Chris team continues to acclimate to Darden. Todd's replacement at LongHorn is Laura Williamson. Laura is well respected across LongHorn, having served as their finance leader for nine years. She will report to me. We also named three new brand Presidents within our specialty restaurant group, who will report directly to John Martin, who continues to serve as President of the Specialty Restaurant Group. Bryan Clements, the Former Head of Operations at Olive Garden, is now President of Yard House. Falon Farrell, who led operations for Eddie V\u2019s, has been named President of the Capital Grill in Eddie V's. And Mark Cooper, who led finance for the Special Restaurant Group, is now President of Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze. I'm excited about these changes and confident we have the right leaders in place to drive future growth. I'm also proud that three of our seven brand presidents began their careers as hourly team members at our restaurants and the average tenure of all of our brand presidents is 27 years. Now I'll turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick. And good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2024 was another strong year for Darden, and I am proud of the results our teams achieved. Despite sales results that were weaker than we anticipated, earnings exceeded our initial expectations for the year. Strong cost management by our teams and easing commodities and labor inflation drove this earnings outperformance. Now looking at the fourth quarter, we generated $3 billion of total sales, 6.8% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 80 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steak House restaurants and 37 net new restaurants from our legacy brands. Our same restaurant sales were flat for the quarter, outpacing the industry by 80 basis points and same restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 130 basis points. Throughout the quarter our casual dining brands maintained their relative share of guest visits. Olive Garden guest count growth was near the top quartile of the industry and Long Horn Stake House was at the top decile of the industry. This is impressive when you consider the increased levels of discounting and promotional activity by some competitors within casual dining. Our same restaurant guest count or performance to the industry exceeded our same restaurant sales out performance due to our lower levels of pricing relative to the industry this quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2.7% to $2.65. We generated $523 million in adjusted EBITDA and returned $254 million to shareholders through $156 million in dividends and $97 million of share repurchases. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L, compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 20 basis points better as commodities inflation was better-than-expected at approximately 2%. Seafood deflation this quarter helped partially offset mid-single-digit beef and produce inflation. Restaurant labor was 10 basis points better, driven by productivity improvements and favorability and other benefits, which more than offset the impact of pricing below labor inflation, which was approximately 4%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points better than last year driven by strong cost management and lower pre-opening expenses. Marketing expense was 1.3% of sales, consistent with our expectations and 20 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in restaurant-level EBITDA improving 20 basis points to 20.9%. Adjusted G&A expenses were 40 basis points lower and the total expense was slightly favorable to our previous guidance. This was driven by ongoing synergies from the integration of Ruth's Chris and favorable mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the way we hedge mark-to-market expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Interest expense increased 40 basis points due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth\u2019s Chris acquisition. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.4%, 40 basis points higher, driven by the mark-to-market hedge impact I referenced earlier. And we generated $318 million in adjusted earnings from continuing operations, which was 10.8% of sales. Looking at our segments for the quarter, Olive Garden increased total sales 0.7%, driven by new restaurant growth partially offset by negative same restaurant sales of 1.5%. While Olive Garden same restaurant sales were below the industry, same restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmark by 60 basis points. This dynamic was due to our decision to minimize pricing. For the quarter, Olive Garden pricing was approximately 1%. Olive Garden segment profit margin of 22.8% continues to be industry leading. At LongHorn, total sales increased 7.2%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 4% and new restaurant growth. LongHorn same restaurant sales outperformed the industry by 480 basis points. Segment profit margin of 19.1% was 50 basis points above last year. Strong cost management, including improved labor productivity drove LongHorn's margin growth this quarter as pricing was below inflation. Total sales at the fine dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth\u2019s Chris company-owned restaurants. And despite negative same restaurant sales at Capital Grille and Eddie V's, the fine dining segment's profit margin expanded in the fourth quarter, driven by improvement in our cost base. The other business segment sales increased with the addition of Ruth\u2019s Chris franchise and managed location revenue. This was partially offset by combined negative same restaurant sales of 1.1% for the brands in the other segment. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 160 basis points better than last year, driven by the sales leverage from the additional royalty revenue. As we look at our annual results for fiscal 2024, we had same restaurant sales growth of 1.6%, outperforming the industry in same restaurant sales and traffic by about 300 basis points. And this is on top of 500 basis points of outperformance in traffic last year. We delivered $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. This is an increase of over 50%, compared to five years ago. Additionally, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders with $628 million in dividends and $454 million in share repurchases. Looking at our fiscal 2024 full-year P&L, we had restaurant-level EBITDA growth of 120 basis points driven by strong cost management by our teams and pricing leverage. This favorability was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense and the impairment expense related to eight permanent closures that occurred during the year. This resulted in operating income margin that was 50 basis points higher than last year. Additional financing expenses primarily related to the Ruth\u2019s Chris acquisition drove adjusted interest expense 40 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 9.4% flat to last year. Looking at our performance since 2019 relative to our long-term framework, we generated annualized EAT growth of 8% and cash returns of 3.7%, culminating in total shareholder returns of 11.7% as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield. This is well within our targeted range despite the issuance of 9 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2020 and other business disruptions from COVID. A strong operating model generates significant and durable cash flows. Since 2019, we have delivered 9% annualized adjusted EBITDA growth. Our balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2024 is well positioned with adjusted debt to EBITDAR at 1.9 times. This is below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, even with the additional debt related to Ruth's Chris acquisition. Now turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2025, we expect total sales of $11.8 billion to $11.9 billion, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 45 to 50 gross new restaurants. Capital spending of $550 million to $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3%, which includes commodities inflation of approximately 2% and labor inflation of approximately 4%. An annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 119 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. All of this results in diluted net earnings per share between $9.40 and $9.60. Finally, our board approved a 7% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share, implying an annual dividend of $5.60. And with that, I'll turn it back to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thanks, Raj. All of us at Darden continue to work together in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve, our guests, team members, and communities. During the year, we had the privilege of serving 420 million guests, more than 1 million per day, providing great food and drinks with attentive service in an engaging atmosphere. We also promoted 1,100 hourly team members into our manager and training program and promoted nearly 300 managers to general manager or managing partner positions. And we continue to invest in our team members with programs like Fast Fluency, which provides the opportunity to learn English for free, and our next course scholarship program that, through the Darden Foundation, has awarded 200 scholarships worth $3,000 each over the past two years to children of our team members. We also remain committed to nourishing and delighting the communities we serve through our ongoing efforts to fight hunger. As part of our Harvest Food Donation Program, our restaurants donated 4.5 million meals to local food banks in fiscal 2024. We also continued our successful partnership with Feeding America with another $2 million donation from the Darden Foundation that helped provide mobile food trucks to 10 more Feeding America food banks, bringing the total to 45 trucks provided over the last four years. To wrap up, I want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout the year. Their disciplined approach in executing our strategy is what enables us to succeed, regardless of the operating environment. Now I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Harbour : Yes, thank you. Good morning, guys. Maybe first just on your sales outlook for the year. Could you comment on how you see kind of the different brands feeding into that? And you obviously have very different kind of comparisons as we think about the start of the year versus the end of the year. Presumably there's kind of some pickup in Olive Garden. How do you think about the drivers of that? Raj Vennam : Hey, Brian, this is Raj. Good morning. So let's just start with the guidance at a high level from a sales outlook, right? Before we get into the brand level. So when we take a look at the upcoming year, we look at the information that's out there and where the macro is expected to be. And as you all know, most economists are expecting weakening GDP growth. So that's taken into consideration. Then we're also taking into consideration what we're cycling through, right? We started to see a little bit more weakness in the back half of this fiscal year, so we're taking that into consideration as we look at next year. So when we look at how we built this estimate and guidance, we are -- we expect underlying traffic trends to gradually improve throughout the year. And so that's really how we built it. I don't want to get into the exact details on the brands, but at a blended level, we're thinking 1% to 2% same restaurant sales growth for the full-year. And as I said, gradual improvement through the year on the underlying trends. And then there's just one callout is Thanksgiving shifts out of Q2 into Q3. So Q2 print might look better than the underlying trends, and Q3 will be the opposite. So that's typically about somewhere around 80 to 100 basis points impact on sales in the quarter. Positive for Q2, negative for Q3. And so all that said, in this current environment, there's more variability around our sales guide, but we have higher levels of confidence in our earnings outlook. And so, that's kind of where we are. Brian Harbour : Okay. Thank you. And maybe could you just comment on your pricing thoughts at this point within that? Is there anything we should keep in mind with respect to timing? Is there perhaps some that you would delay in an effort to keep it more modest at the start of the year? Raj Vennam : Yes, Brian, the good news on pricing is we've actually kept pricing very modest over the last five years, right? So we do expect pricing for this year to be more in line with inflation, so in that 2.5% to 3% range probably. But as we think about how that's going to be spread, we expect it to be more consistent quarter-to-quarter. Now, there may be a 10, 20 basis points movement between quarters. But if you look at over the last five years, we've only priced a lot and that gives us some flexibility and we've talked about that before. So we've underpriced about 20% over the last five years, compared to where the overall CPI is, which I think was close to 23% on the same five-year basis and then full services at 28%. And underpriced grocery as well. So we feel like we've done a lot of work on keeping prices low and we're going to continue to do that. And as you saw that in the fourth quarter too. We talked about Olive Garden closer to 1% pricing in the fourth quarter. Brian Harbour : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thank you. Just first on your approach to marketing. So Olive Garden comp's have been weak over the past couple of quarters. Some share losses quarter understand on a traffic basis. You outperformed. But as you think about your approach to marketing and promos, how does that influence your decision to increase marketing and what are you expecting for fiscal \u201825? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Lauren. In regards to marketing, we've said in the past that we'd probably tick it up a couple of tenths a year and that's probably what we'll do in fiscal \u201825. But we're going to continue to focus in our marketing efforts on our filters, which we've talked about many times. And we're not going to do things to buy sales, even with the increasing discounting our competitors are doing. You know, our best way to drive sales is our focus on a back to basics operating philosophy and our guests telling others what a great value they have when they come to our restaurants. And just remember, we do have levers to pull. We do have more marketing to pull if we want to, but our focus is on profitable sales growth. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on the consumer environment. Is this mostly related to the low-income consumer? Just what are you seeing across the middle income, high income, across the breadth of your brands? Thanks so much. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Lauren. It is mostly at the income -- at the consumer below the median household income, which is about $75,000. Consumers are generally concerned about inflation, and they're becoming more concerned about the job market. And what we're seeing are some behavior shifts that we had already started to see. So for Q4, transactions from households below -- with incomes below the median were lower than last year. So -- and that's more pronounced with consumers below $50,000 in income. And these impacts were even greater in our fine dining brands. So that's why you saw fine dining had a little bit more negative comp than others. But at the same time, our guests aren't managing their check like we've seen in prior quarters. And so, you know, we continue to tell you what this means for our brands. Operators that deliver their brand promise and value will continue to appeal to consumers despite economic challenges, and that's what we're focused on doing. We're focusing on giving the consumers that are coming to our restaurants and spending their hard-earned money a great value and a great experience and have them tell others to come back. Lauren Silberman : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Eric Gonzalez : Hi. Thanks for the question. I think I just heard you say that your guests aren't managing the check the way you've seen in prior quarters. Can you make a comment on why you think that's the case? Raj Vennam : Hey, Eric. So yes, we did. So if you think back to what we said earlier in the fiscal year, we were seeing a big negative mix on the check and we talked about that, especially both at casual brands and fine dining. And last quarter we said we started to see some moderation. And as we look at this year, this quarter, if we look at Olive Garden and LongHorn, basically the mix was flat. So basically there was no negative mix at all, which is a significant improvement. And then when you look at fine dining, you know, we saw some moderation in Q3 and that continues to moderate into Q4. I think we're now down into the 80, 90 basis points range in the negative mix versus the 200 or so that we were seeing a couple quarters ago. So we're just starting to see the ones that come to us are not managing the check as much as they used to. Eric Gonzalez : Okay. And then just maybe on the guidance, you know, there was a fairly wide gap in comp performance between Olive Garden and LongHorn this quarter. You know, you have that 1% to 2% guidance for next year. If you're not willing to break it out by brand in terms of guidance, but maybe you can comment on whether you'd expect that performance gap to widen or stays as wide as it is, or do you think it's going to converge in FY \u201820 cuts? Raj Vennam : Eric, the way we are looking at it is most brands are going to be within the range we provide it. We are providing a 1% to 2%. I'm not going to get into the comments about the range between Olive Garden and LongHorn specifically, but when we look at 1% to 2%, we expect most brands to be in that range. And obviously Olive Garden being over 50% of the portfolio, they'll have -- they weigh the Darden average too. And if you look back at last year, fiscal \u201824, we delivered 1.6% in same restaurant sales for Darden, and Olive Garden was right on top at 1.6%. So we'll see how this plays out, but we don't want to comment on Olive Garden versus LongHorn specifically. Eric Gonzalez : Very good. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Charles with TD Cowan. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Charles : Great, thanks. Rick, the question is on Olive Garden. You called out multiple levers at your disposal to help properly go traffic beyond marketing. Can you expand more on those opportunities? Is it menu innovation? Is it the to-go business, the catering business? Just to welcome more thoughts on how to sustain the traffic gap versus the industry? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Andrew. Yes to all. Now, remember, Raj said we did exceed industry benchmarks. Olive Garden has taken much lower pricing than Darden over the year and the industries over the years. And we're really proud of their team. We're really proud of Dan and the team and what they've done. You know, they're going to continue to focus their marketing on their key equity of never-ending, craveable, abundant Italian food, specifically focusing on ensuring every guest is offered a refill with their first course. That's something that's not provided in other competitors. So that refill is a pretty big part of what we do and a big part of their value equation. But we're also going to continue to innovate over in our menu. What you see right now on television if you haven't is our Create Your Own pasta at $12.99. You know, consumers in more challenging times are looking for more price certainty, and that is an amazing value to create your own pasta at $12.99 with unlimited first course. And we'll continue to focus our marketing efforts there. And we have digital marketing that we can pull as well. So without getting into all the details, we do have levers to pull, but I want to remind everybody we're focused on profitable sales growth, not just buying sales to show a top line number. And we've been very consistent over the years with that. That profitable sales growth is what matters and Raj talked about our EBITDA growth over the last five years, how strong it was. And so we'll continue to focus there. Andrew Charles : Okay, great. And my final question is about the Ruth's acquisition for franchisee. Curious if this leaves you open-minded for more franchise acquisitions in 2025 or if this one was perhaps more one-off? Rick Cardenas : Yes, let me start by saying the franchisees at Ruth's Chris are really valued partners to us. And our focus was on integrating our company on restaurants into Darden. You know, this one restaurant franchise was an opportunistic purchase. So, you know, we're going to continue as is and speak with our franchisees if they want to speak with us, but right now we're going to continue to focus on making sure our team gets acclimated to the systems that we've implemented. And so it's not necessarily a change in strategy. It was an opportunistic purchase for us. Andrew Charles : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. Raj, I just wanted to come back to the guidance for the year. And I think you mentioned that you have assumed that you expect underlying traffic to improve as the year moves on. So I just wanted to ask if you could elaborate on what factors you think will drive that improvement? Is it mostly just comparisons related or are you thinking there's something inside the business that will improve on a sequential basis as the year moves on? Raj Vennam : David, it's primarily driven by the comparables, but the underlying trends have held up pretty well. I mean, even if you look at our fourth quarter that we just came off, month-to-month underlying trends were actually held up pretty steady, and it was an improvement from Q3. And you know, we talked about what we're seeing on the check side, that's also a positive sign. So we think there is, you know, just as we cycle through some of the weakness, that should help us gradually get better through the year. David Tarantino : Got it. And then, Rick, on Olive Garden, I guess a question I would have is on the advertising approach, do you see an opportunity to better highlight the value you're already offering? Not necessarily provide a new discount or something different than what you're adding, but it seems like that brand has a great value proposition. I'm just wondering if you think there's an opportunity to emphasize that a bit more in the advertising? Rick Cardenas : Yes, David and that's exactly what we're doing right now. You know, on TV right now, we've got our Create Your Own Pasta at $12.99 with the price point on the television. And, you know, we do believe that Olive Garden has a great everyday value. And so what we -- the things that we can do to continue to highlight that versus discounting is what we'll continue to do. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Jim Salera : Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Can you just give us some of the puts and takes on the 3% inflation guide for 2025, particularly what you're thinking around the food basket and labor? Raj Vennam : Yes, Jim. So this is Raj. So on the food basket, we're basically assuming commodities to be around 2%. I think the biggest driver within the food basket is beef. We still expect beef to be in the mid-single-digits. And then we actually expect low-single-digit deflation in chicken. And then pretty much all other categories are probably going to be in that low-single-digit inflation. And so that's how we're getting to commodities being around 2%. From a labor perspective, we are actually expecting labor to be more like a 4% overall. So if you think about where we've been and what the hourly wage inflation is expected to be closer to 4% and then total labor to be around 4%. So those are the two big things. And then from all other restaurant expenses are probably going to be more in that 2.5% to 3%. And that's how we're getting to that overall being closer to 3%. Jim Salera : Okay, great. Thanks for the detail on that. And then if I could maybe try to tie that to the consumer. You mentioned earlier one of the concerns or chief concerns for the consumer is just kind of overall inflation. If we see inflation maybe come in at the lower end of your expectations. Is it possible that, that could also provide better-than-expected lift on the comp side, given that consumers maybe feel a little bit better about how far their dollar goes? Just trying to think of kind of the catalyst path for the consumer into 2025, what might make the results from the consumer be better than what you're anticipating? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jim, The consumer is really focused on what price they're paying in everywhere, not just in restaurants. And if you think about the cost that they have on the non-discretionary costs, they've been growing faster than wages for quite a few years, and that eats into discretionary spending. So if inflation in the non-discretionary gets better, that may give them a little bit more discretionary. And if you're considering food at the grocery store or food a non-discretionary, then yes, that should help. But we'd like to see some lower inflation in things like things that people have to buy. Rent, utilities, child care, all of those things would help on the non-discretionary side, help discretionary spend. Jim Salera : That's great. Thanks for the color, guys. I'll hop back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Sara Senatore : Great, thank you. I guess, I wanted one clarification and then a question, please. The clarification is just, you mentioned pricing, like 1% in Olive Garden and pricing below inflation, but your food margins were better than we had expected. So I just wanted to understand like what the dynamic might have been across brands, whether there was any mix. I mean, presumably all of them actually some of the best food margins. So if you could just help me unpack that a little bit. And then I do have a question about the demand environment. Raj Vennam : Yes, Sara. Good morning. So when we look at the fourth quarter, yes, our pricing was across Darden was below inflation. I think our pricing was closer to 2.5, inflation was around 3. So there is a board. I think the delta was almost 70 basis points. But that, again, goes back to the testament of our teams and our ability to manage through different cycles, right, through different environments. We've talked about how in a slow growth environment, we should see costs get better, but also we should see our own -- the controllables be even more -- come in even better. So ultimately, it's just a testament to our teams, how well they manage the business, with the focus on getting to the returns we need to get for the business. Sara Senatore : Okay, and those controllables sit even in the cog line? Raj Vennam : There is some, yes. Sara Senatore : Okay, got it. Thank you. And then the question on demand is, to some of the earlier comments you've made, perhaps the demand environment is softer-than-expected in so far as the issue with your comps is you're still taking share, but I'm interpreting it to mean perhaps versus where we expected, given the low-income consumer primarily, I think. I'm trying to, I guess, ask when you think about where that expectation was when you acquired Ruth and kind of doubled down on fine dining, had you anticipated something more robust or there was always an expectation of normalization and even in that context the acquisition makes sense. Rick Cardenas : Hey, Sara. This is Rick. When we acquired Ruth's, we think about an acquisition over a long, long period of time. We're not as worried about the next quarter or the quarter after the acquisition. Now, would we have liked the consumer at the below-median income to continue to go to fine dining? Absolutely, but any time we make an acquisition, there could be a chance that it's because we're going into a slowdown and maybe there's a little bit of a better opportunity for price discovery there. So, I would never read into when we make an acquisition into a certain category or not. Remember, we have criteria for our M&A and Ruth's met every one of that criteria, and we were able to agree on our price. So that's why it happened at the time it happened. And generally, that's when any of our M&A will happen, as long as we find the brands that meet the criteria and we get price discovery and we agree on a price and we'll do that deal, we're not worried about the environment that we're going into or that we're coming out of because these are long, long-term investments for us. Sara Senatore : That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you. Rick, my first question is just on the weakening conditions you mentioned in the back half, it does seem like within your portfolio, at least, Olive Garden was hit harder, and I guess relative to the industry as well, which I think is contrary to past economic slowdowns when most people look at Olive Garden as the more defensive value brand. So I'm just wondering, as you take a step back, what do you think has changed this go-around? How much of it is maybe internally what you're doing versus maybe what the competition is doing and if you can give any sequential color on the trends through the quarter or into June just to kind of get a sense of how we're starting fiscal \u201825, that would be great. And then I had one follow-up. Rick Cardenas : Sure, Jeff. I'm not going to talk about the trends into fiscal \u201825 where we are. And I think Raj had mentioned that the quarterly -- fourth quarter, we were pretty consistent month-over-month, month to month to month. So -- but I will say for Olive Garden, in prior slowdowns, Olive Garden outperformed. They outperformed at the same restaurant sales and at that time they were taking more pricing than everybody else. We outperformed this quarter in traffic and we've continued to outperform the industry in traffic for the last many years and we only took 1% pricing. What I would tell you is that if we would have taken the pricing that the industry took in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, I'm sorry, Olive Garden would have been positive and would have performed even more. And so this is a long game for us. The other thing that we aren't -- that we're not pulling are things that everybody or not everybody, but people used to pull in slowdowns, couponing, deep discounting and all those other things and we're not doing that even at a time that our competitors have ramped up discounting, deep discounting on television and, you know, Olive Garden still outperformed in traffic, didn't outperform in comp sales, but as I said, we only took 1% pricing. And so we're really, really proud of that and we'll continue to do that. And maybe that's why we didn't outperform on the sales side, but we did continue to outperform on the traffic side. And I just want to say their gap in fiscal Q4 was 60 basis points in traffic, and their two-year gap is 530 basis points in traffic. So we feel pretty good with where they are. Jeffrey Bernstein : Absolutely. And then my follow-up, Raj, as you think about, well, as you're setting up a guidance for fiscal \u201825, you mentioned how in fiscal \u201824, you beat your initial EPS guidance despite seemingly falling short on the initial fiscal \u201824 comp guidance and as you look at \u201825 wondering as we enter the year it seems like maybe if there was a risk that it's the same scenario where I mean just looking at the fourth quarter your comps were below the fiscal \u201825 guide. So what leverage do you have on the margin and earnings side to maybe beat the comps -- if the comps would again fall short as we move through fiscal \u201825? It would seem like you don't have as much opportunity with inflation easing as maybe you had this past year. So how do you think about the outlook for fiscal \u201825 if the comps were to fall short? Thank you. Raj Vennam : Hey, Jeff. So I don't want to get into the exact details, but let me say a high level and talk about how we think about philosophically, right? If the environment is such that the sales continue to be weaker, that also implies the demand is weaker and the inflation should be a little bit better. So let's start with that. And in fact, if you look at last year, that was part of the reason we were able to exceed the earnings guidance even with the sales off. That's not all of it, but that's partial. The other part of it is how we manage through the -- through how our teams manage through the cycle. So as I said earlier, our restaurant teams and our teams at the support center work very hard to kind of, you know, have these targets and we work towards them and we're always trying to get better. And there's just even more push on that when things are a little bit softer on the top line. So that's kind of how I talk about it. I don't want to get into the specifics because, you know, this is a big business. It's very complex. There are a lot of nuances. There's a lot of -- but there's a lot that goes in to get to where we need to get to. And we feel, I think if you just look back, it shows that we have the ability to get there to a different base. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. Thanks, Raj. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. Olive Garden's strategy has been to sort of set itself up as a well-positioned everyday value and a strong consumer service. Do you see the consumer recognizing this? Like are the consumer satisfaction scores at Olive Garden doing as well versus the peer group in Italian as say LongHorn or Texas Roadhouse are doing in stake? Rick Cardenas : Yes, David, I won't comment on how they're doing versus their competition, but I can tell you as Olive Garden, both internally and externally, their value ratings have increased over this last year. And they're pretty close to the top end of the value and overall in the measures we look at. I also mentioned they were kind of at the highest levels of guest satisfaction in this fiscal year. But again, they continue in all of our brands. Most of our brands -- I think all of our brands were at or above their value perceptions externally versus last year? David Palmer : Yes. I guess, I'm wondering why you think the traffic share gains are not stronger. Is it just simply the consumer awareness of the value that's at Olive Garden? Or is it perhaps something about the Italian category, such as the ease of trading down to at-home posts a little easier we're seeing very strong growth in, for instance, Rayo\u2019s Sauces lately. So we're seeing scratch cooking really picking up in at-home, we're not seeing a strong stake demand at-home. So I'm wondering if there's sort of an interaction index with at-home trade down that's stronger in the Italian category. Do you have any thoughts on that? Rick Cardenas : Well, there may be interaction trade down to at-home because of the median income consumer, it's not necessarily the Italian. But I can tell you where we compete in the full service base, Olive Garden was at 75th percentile in their traffic. So -- and again, when you're comparing how they're doing in full service. And then we're putting in this at-home, everybody is dealing with the at-home as well, not just Italian. And then finally, the competitors had ramped up very deep discounting and while we had -- we didn't see that actually impacting Olive Garden or our other brands, because the trends kind of stayed similar. What we did see, interestingly, is a little bit of a shift from QSR to some of those competitors. And so that might be where they're trying to take some share from. But we did see that and that lifted the industry index in some of those -- and maybe one of those competitors, which is a big part of the index. So there's a little bit of a nuance in how the index works, especially when you're taking share from another category -- another part of the index. David Palmer : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks, guys. Just wondering if you could speak to the development environment a bit more. It seems like consistent expectations as it relates to new builds. But anything you're seeing there sort of on timing, thinking about build cost, et cetera? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Dennis. I will -- let me start by saying that the new restaurant projection we have for next year is within our long-term framework. So while it's lower than we like it to be, it's still within our long-term framework. And recall, the new restaurants also include M&A. So we bought about 80 restaurants from Ruth\u2019s Chris that were part of last year. Now that's not impacting this year, but it is part of our framework construction costs are still quite a bit higher than they were before COVID, but the levels are normalizing more and it's still taking a little longer to get construction starts. We're just trying to figure out ways to improve our process to potentially get starts moving a little bit faster. And maybe there is some things that we can do to help municipalities with kind of working on permitting and other things, But we feel pretty good about our pipeline for next year. We'd like to see it higher for the years after, but we're not going to just build restaurants and put a number out there that we don't think that we can hit, and we feel pretty good about where we are. And again, Raj showed you where we were for the last five years in our new unit growth. It was almost 3%. It was 2.9%, which is at the high-end of our framework. So we don't necessarily think year-to-year, we think long-term. Dennis Geiger : Thanks, Rick. And one more, just curious if you could comment a little more on sort of what your expectation is for the industry promotional environment for the year. Is what we're seeing sustainable? Can it increase? I know there's 1 million factors that go into this. But just given your perspective, would love any thoughts on what over the next three quarters or so, what the industry environment on promo discounting, et cetera, looks like in your opinion? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Dennis, I think my perspective is -- we like what we're doing better, right? We don't think that we think that everyday low value and continue to focus on our core equities is more sustainable than deep discounting to try to drive people in. Others can do that, and we'll continue to play this long game. And over time, you have to keep wrapping on that. If you do a deep discount and it stays the same way, you have to do even more the next year, you have to do more television. And we just think we'd rather do more great food, more great service, and let's wrap that. And so again, I can't comment on what other people think is sustainable or not. We just think our business, the way we do it is more sustainable. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Peter Saleh : Great, thanks. Raj, I wanted to ask on the flat mix, which I think you mentioned was a pretty meaningful improvement from what you've seen in the past couple of quarters. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on what's driving this? Is this alcohol mix improving entrees consumers trading up to more expensive entree, the appetizers. And is there any way to dissect this by income cohort? Are you seeing more improvement from the lower income, higher income, anything you can glean there? Raj Vennam : Hey Peter. Yes, just to start, that was specifically at Olive Garden and LongHorn. And so when we look at -- and it's different for both brands. So when you look at LongHorn the mix was driven by some add-ons, increased add-ons. They had a great -- they also had a new Lamb Entree that actually was that did really well. There was parmesan crusting, people wanted to get more of that. So there were things like that were helpful with the mix. What we -- alcohol is kind of fairly stabilized. So it's not necessarily a headwind anymore. And so that's probably helping but when you look at Olive Garden, the same thing where people are not -- we're not seeing as much trade down within the -- whether it's the entree trade down or not getting add-ons. So just in general, more stabilization and so maybe this is -- the guest that's coming in today is not managing the check as much. And so that's different from maybe some of the guests that were coming in earlier in the fiscal year. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your questions. Jeff Farmer : Great. Good morning and thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. With the 1% to 2% FY \u201825 same-store sales guidance, you pointed to the 2.5% to 3% menu pricing. But can you give us a little bit of color as it relates to both traffic and mix assumptions for FY \u201825 guidance? Raj Vennam : Yes, I think it's fair to assume that our check is probably going to be in that range of 2.5% to 3%. So you can back into the implied traffic. So we do expect the mix to be fairly flat. Jeff Farmer : Okay. And then I might have missed it, but G&A dollars in FY \u201825, did you provide that guidance? Raj Vennam : You did not miss it. We haven't talked about it. The G&A for this year, we should be closer to $450 million for fiscal '21, it should be closer to $450 million. And I think that's going to be spread fairly evenly from second to the fourth quarter, with the first quarter to be $20 million higher than those three quarters. It's just typical that we have a little bit more in the first half. Jeff Farmer : All right. Appreciate it. Thank you. Raj Vennam : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jon Tower with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Tower : Great, thanks. I appreciate you taking. Going to the cost side of the equation, it was pretty impressive even with the comp that you put up in the fourth quarter, how you were able to manage labor and the other op expense line very well. And I'm just curious if you could dig into how you expect those lines to play out in fiscal '24 or better said, do you think a lot of the management that you're able to put in across labor as well as the other OpEx can carry forward into fiscal '25 kind of offsetting some of that inflation that you're seeing. Raj Vennam : Hi, John, so if you look at the drivers this year, we talked about improved productivity. That was -- a part of that was also driven by lower turnover. And so there may be a few quarters where we'll still get a little bit of that benefit, but as we look to next year, I would expect -- we would expect COGS to be better because commodities inflation is likely going to be, as I said, closer to that 2% and then pricing being a little bit more, you should get some leverage on that line. We do expect to continue to look at other OpEx, right? That's one of the things non-guest-facing cost is where we spend a lot of time looking at how do we continue to get better. And that's the power of the platform. That's the power of having this big multiple brands and being able to learn from each other. And the last piece is, there is some continuing synergies from Ruth's acquisition that we talked about. We got about half this year. We're going to get the rest next year. So those are all different drivers of how we get that margin growth. Jon Tower : Got it. Thank you. And I know a lot has been talked about today on the marketing side. So I'm just curious, one more, I guess, on the topic. In terms of the way that you're speaking to the consumer, I know you're using traditional television as a primary means to communicate Olive Garden's message. But I'm just curious if you could dig into what you're doing on social and how you might be changing the brand's perception on those platforms or even in traditional media, are you going after different day parts in terms of where you're advertising even platforms where you're advertising through linear media. Maybe just more information there would be great. Rick Cardenas : Yes, John. For several years, we've been building our internal digital media capabilities, and we've done -- Olive Garden is the only one on television. Everybody else does spend marketing and it's in digital. And we've been testing things like connected television. We've been testing other things to help drive our traffic. And because we've been testing this allows us to kind of move them into other brands to see how they work. We do a lot of test and learn -- and so we don't expect our media to grow significantly year-over-year because we think we're more efficient with the tests that we do. And so as we continue to do that, we know what the right times to put messages out there. We know what days and we knew all those things. So we're not necessarily going to think about ramping up a communication of a certain day part unless the brand thinks it's the right thing to do. And so they might -- we might see some brands talk about a certain day part or not. But we are using our digital that we've learned over the years and we have an internal team here that's great at what they do and we'll continue to focus on that. Jon Tower : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Chris O'Cull: Yes thanks. Rick, you mentioned several sales building opportunities earlier. But I was wondering if you think there are any opportunities to improve throughput during high demand peak periods at Olive Garden? I'm assuming the restaurants are still in a way during traditional peak periods like Friday and Saturday nights. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Chris, I think not just at Olive Garden, but all our brands can do more to improve throughput in our peak periods. We can get a little bit quicker in what we do to make sure that the guest doesn't feel rush, but they don't feel like they're waiting for a lot of things. So we do think that there's opportunities and not just at Olive Garden, and if we can do that better, we should get some -- at least some traffic in that day if people were walking away. But in the long run, getting a little bit quicker, maybe better for us any day, not just on the peak periods. Chris O'Cull: Okay. And then, Raj, Olive Garden segment margin contracted, I think, 70 basis points this quarter, while the other segments or the other segments saw some considerable year-over-year expansion. Can you help us understand what drove that pressure? And do you see other -- those factors putting pressure on Olive Garden this going into fiscal '25. Raj Vennam : No, Chris, I think it's actually just kind of normalizing what they should have been, right? Last year, I think we had a little too high margin. I mean, to be 22.8% segment profit margin is industry leading. I mean that's just -- that's just really high. That would be aspirational for a lot of brands in this industry. So to be able to get to those levels. And frankly, it goes back to the -- our decision to not price as much, right? And we had talked about it last year. We didn't think 23.5% segment profit was the right number. That was a little too high. And so it's really giving back a little bit of that. But we don't expect that to be like a -- as we look -- move forward, we don't expect that to be a drag going forward. It's just more of -- there were some things that needed to be normalized. Chris O'Cull: Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. Danilo Gargiulo : Raj, given your focus on more profitable traffic and cost control, cost management in this environment, can you help us understand the flow-through of the marginal dollar today and how it compares with the marginal dollar flow-through back in, say, 2019? Raj Vennam : Hey Danilo, I think the flow-through from the marginal dollar is not that different. It is actually fairly similar. It's just there are other things that are more non-variable costs that we're also looking at. So it's not -- that's how we're getting to that. But from a high level, if you look at across the portfolio, somewhere around 35% to 40% is probably the right flow-through to think about it. And I don't think that's any different from where we were before in 2019. Danilo Gargiulo : Okay, thank you. And Rick, just from a long-term perspective, can you share maybe the rationale and timing behind these recent executive changes? And in particular, what you're expecting from your team in their newly created roles and specifically, if you can comment on kind of post promotion and kind of the role of the Chief Business Development Officer, what are you expecting out of that? Thank you. Rick Cardenas : Yes, Danilo, as I said in the prepared remarks, these changes help set us up for future growth and developing our leaders. So if you think about Todd and John elevating their roles a little bit, Todd leading development, international and franchising and Ruth's Chris. And those all have really good synergies for Todd, right? So development in new restaurants, that's for all brands but international franchising with the percent of restaurants that Ruth's Chris has his franchise, it's actually a pretty good synergy there. Plus, as I said, Todd, came with -- came to us from rare hospitality when we bought them. So he knows what it's like after the systems integration and how to help people assimilate more. And he'll help Rick, who's our new President, become a great President. And then finally, as I mentioned, having an operator\u2019s perspective and new restaurant development, I think, is a pretty good thing to do. We think about how to do the turnovers better how to get -- make sure we are more planful in telling the brands when we think the restaurant is going to open. So there aren't moves and delays, so we can get those a little bit better. So that's really where Todd comes into play. And then on John's side, if you think about the specialty restaurant group with five brands and John leading all five, that was a lot. And so how do we help bring him up and bring the new president underneath John, who are all proven leaders and all have a good future here with us, while John can help them become even better brand presidents. A couple of them -- one of them is a former finance person, but he's got a great operations knowledge, and he actually was a restaurant manager many, many years ago. But John can help Mark become a better general manager and think more about operations. You've got Falon Farrell, who's now going to be leading Capital Grille and Eddie V's. Actually, Falon started at Capital Grille as a team member, and she worked at Capital Grille for many years. And then she led training for Capital Grille, and Eddie V\u2019s. And now she -- then she led Eddie V\u2019s for quite a while in operation. So she can see how do we bring some synergies in the support center for Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s to help leverage those brands better, but while working for John who can continue to develop her for the future. And then I think about Bryan Clements. Bryan, his history, he started a big bar brands years ago. He spent many years at LongHorn to understand how LongHorn and a simple operating model works and he spent time at Olive Garden, leading Olive Garden operations, and that's a big system. And how do you think about a big system when you've got Yard House who's passing 80 restaurants, and we want to continue to grow them, and he can help with more system thinking at Yard House. So we think it's a really great move for all of them. And Laura, I didn't mention Laura is a great leader here at Darden. And she spent nine years at LongHorn. She really knows LongHorn. And she's got a great relationship with Todd. She'll be able to continue to talk to Todd and the team at LongHorn has rallied around her. So our reasoning behind that is to get people ready, while other people are basically retirement eligible. And so we want to make sure that they're here to help them progress. And you know what our retirement programs are not saying that anybody is leaving anytime soon, but this gives them a chance to develop people while they're still around. Danilo Gargiulo : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Andy Barish : Hey guys, two quick ones. Just hearing some commentary on the softer Florida market where you guys kind of over-index, any thoughts there? And then if you could give us the Olive Garden to Go mix for the fiscal year '24 versus '23? And is there -- any trends you're seeing there, any impact on maybe some of the same-store sales components, just not remembering how you guys calculate that fully? Raj Vennam : All right. Andy, let's start with the trends themselves. So if we actually look at the last quarter, and I may have mentioned in the prior quarter, too, but Florida, Texas and California generally were a little bit weaker. We saw that not just Florida, but Texas and California. And did contribute to the top line being where it was. And so that's -- I don't know that we have a strong explanation for why one of the thoughts was maybe some of these markets that opened faster coming out of COVID might be the ones where we're seeing a little bit of softness and maybe a little bit of strength on the ones that opened a little bit later coming out of COVID but that's just a hypothesis. But that's -- the facts are, you're seeing some strength in the New England market and other things and not as much in California, Texas and Florida. As we look at our to-go mix, -- to go mix at Olive Garden was basically at -- I think for the year, 24%, which is fairly similar to last year, not a huge -- not much change. And LongHorn is at 14% think we saw a little bit of an improvement year-over-year like 1 point or so at LongHorn on the quarter, but that's just fairly stabilized there. And I think there was another question about some mix I can't -- what was the -- was there another one, Andy, that I missed? Andy Barish : Yes. No. Just if the to-go trend had or decline if that was impacting any of the components of same-store sales, but it doesn't sound like that. Raj Vennam : No, it's not yes. Andy Barish : Okay, thank you. Raj Vennam : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Vaccaro : Hey, thanks. And good morning. I know we're running off. So just two quick ones for me. Can you provide traffic and check for Olive Garden and LongHorn in the fourth quarter? And then, Raj, did I hear correctly blended price up 2.5% to 3% for the fiscal '25 and that seems stable. So does that suggest you've taken price recently? And could see that range as early as the first quarter? Raj Vennam : Yes, Brian, the blended -- let me start with the later question first. Yes, the blended in the 2.5% to 3%. We have taken some pricing -- we are -- yes, typically, we take some in June, so there's some pricing. So you should start to see some of that in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, our total check growth was 2.2% at Darden level, I think Olive Garden was more like a one-third, and LongHorn was probably in the 3-ish percent, LongHorn has positive traffic. The traffic growth, I think, in the quarter was 0.8%. So in the total SRS is 4%, so the check growth was at on 3.2%. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Jake Bartlett : Great, thanks for taking the question. I want to dig in on that last question and answer a little bit more, and that's pricing at Olive Garden. Pricing decelerated to 1% in the fourth quarter. You talked about comps being similar across the brand in '25 and pretty stable pricing throughout the year. Does that imply that you're going to see a pretty big step-up in menu price at Olive Garden? Or should we expect kind of a similar, much more cautious pricing at Olive Garden throughout the whole year? Raj Vennam : I'm sorry, I was on mute. If you look at Olive Garden's pricing for the year, fiscal year, they were actually close to mid-3s. And so that's pretty consistent, not all the way to where Darden blended was 4. So they're about 50 or 70, 80 basis points below Darden. As we think about next year, they're not going to -- we would expect them to be maybe in the 30, 40 basis points range of where Darden might end up. So I don't expect this to be as big of a gap. But we're still -- we're not talking about huge pricing actions, right? We talked about -- there is always some timing of the quarter-to-quarter. But on the year, if we think 2.5% to 3%, Olive Garden is probably closer to 2.5% Jake Bartlett : Got it. But I think that would imply that in the near-term, you'd be taking up pricing in Olive Garden in this environment, this macro environment. I'm wondering whether you think that creates a little bit of risk to traffic even from where we started. If you can maybe answer that, but then I also just had a follow-up on the Fast Recovery Act in California, and you guys have a decent presence there, and I think we haven't gotten a lot of commentary about the impact. It seems like some pretty seismic impacts in California impact on labor, but also shift in demand maybe from limited service into casual dining. So any comment there on what you've seen over the last few months as the -- as the fast recovery actually implemented? Rick Cardenas : Hey Jake, this is Rick. I'm going to start on the fact act with saying that our employment proposition is great in California. So we've got a great one there. On average, our team members earn well over $20 an hour. And California only represents about 5% of our restaurants. So it's not like it's an over-index for us. We haven't seen a real impact in wages. And since the FAST Act came about, but unfortunately, we have seen many closures of fast food restaurants in that time. And so our California performance for the quarter was still not as strong as the company, as you said. But as Raj said, we did see some softness in California, but I think that was more related to some weather there than anything else. But again, we haven't seen a whole lot of change in our wages. Our employment proposition is great in California. But we have seen some fast food restaurants, unfortunately, have to close because of the act. Jake Bartlett : Thank you. [Technical Difficulty] can you price at Olive Garden now in this environment? Raj Vennam : So Jake, I'll go back to the pricing actions, some of this is timing of when you take actions. Every year, there's a little bit of pricing action, right? And this year, or in fiscal '24, we did not have any pricing action until pretty late into maybe Q4, middle of Q4. So that's just already there. It's not a lot of pricing on top. Some of that is also moving to years, right, some restaurants in different markets as things change with the environment and minimum wage, we make some adjustments. But nothing crazy. If you look at -- I mentioned earlier and in response to a different question, we have taken a lot less pricing at Olive Garden. So we're not worried about where they are. I mean if you look at over the five years, cumulatively, their CAGR is probably more in the 3.5% range when the industry is closer to 5% plus. So we feel like there's a better -- great value proposition at Olive Garden, and we try to keep prices as low as we can, and you've seen that. Jake Bartlett : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Gregory Francfort : Hey, thanks for the question. My question is just -- I think it was asked on unit growth earlier in the call, and you guys were suggesting it makes sense to look at the long-term. I think you're opening up 15 to 20 or so Olive Gardens a year, which is one of the faster paces of growth we've seen in a long time. How many stores do you think Olive Garden could have on a long-term basis? You have a lot of competitors that are up at 1,200, 700 stores with a lot lower AUVs. Just sort of curious how you come up with the long-term target for Olive Garden. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Greg, let me start by saying every time we come up with a target for Olive Garden, we blow past it. So we haven't really talked about a target for Olive Garden for a lot of years. What we have found over the last five or 10 years is that we can open more Olive Gardens in markets that Olive Gardens are already in, where prior to that, we weren't doing that as much. Convenience is important to consumers, and we'd rather be a little closer where they live. And so we do believe there's opportunities to open Olive Gardens for the foreseeable future, and we don't think we're near the top of the Olive Garden limit yet. Greg, did you have any other questions? Gregory Francfort : No, no, that was it. I appreciate the perspective. Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Strelzick with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Strelzick : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had two quick ones for me. There's been a lot of discussion about the low-income consumer. I think last quarter, you said that you saw growth with the higher-end consumer at all of your segments. So I was hoping we could get an update there on how that is trending, if that's still what you're realizing. And then -- my second question is about the balance sheet, and you mentioned leverage being below the target. It's been that way for a bit now. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about what might narrow that gap or how you're thinking about leverage on the balance sheet going forward? Thanks. Raj Vennam : Andrew, let's start with the question around the incomes. We are seeing the higher income being a little bit better, and it varies from brand to brand. And as you can imagine, when you think about a brand that grew traffic for LongHorn, for example, they actually had growth pretty much across all income segments. But from a fine dining perspective, you're seeing growth at the higher end I wouldn't say that's just the median household. It actually has to go up north of 150 to see where we're seeing some growth. And then the pullback is mostly at the lower -- at the below middle median household income. And then the other segments are -- other income groups or cohorts are either stable or growing. And then on the balance sheet, we always work with our Board to figure out what's the best way to kind of really position ourselves. We like the flexibility we have -- and as we've always said, we want to use our balance sheet to get productive assets over time. And so that's still -- the philosophy remains the same. Andrew Strelzick : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Courtney Aquilla for closing remarks. Courtney Aquilla : That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday, September 19, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

Your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Courtney Aquilla. Thank you, Courtney. You may begin. Courtney Aquilla : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2025 second quarter earnings on Thursday, December 19th before the market opens followed by a conference call. During today's call any reference to industry results refer to the Black Box Intelligence\u2019s casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden. During our fiscal first quarter, industry same-restaurant sales decreased 2.5% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 5.4%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and discuss some of the actions our brands are taking in response to the current environment. And Raj will provide details on our first quarter results and an update on the Chuy's acquisition. Now, I will turn the call over to Rick. Rick Cardenas : Thank you, Courtney, and good morning, everyone. We operate in a very dynamic competitive industry, and we have proven we can successfully navigate challenging environments due to our strategy rooted in our four competitive advantages and our back-to-basics operating philosophy. While we fell short of our expectations for the first quarter, I believe in the strength of our business and I am confident that the strategy we developed nearly 10 years ago remains the right one for our company. We have talked a lot about Darden's competitive advantages and how they provide a platform for our brands that enables them to deliver their ultimate potential. However, driving strong operational execution is how we bring our brands to life and we do that through our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in culinary innovation and execution, attentive service and an engaging atmosphere, supported by smart and relevant integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guests. This morning, I want to spend my time focusing on the work our brand teams are doing in each of these areas. Our brand culinary teams have continued to innovate to be ready when needed. But we have a high bar, when it comes to introducing any new item to ensure it drives value for our guests and is simple to execute. While all of our brands are innovating the menu, here are some examples from our four largest revenue brands. The Olive Garden team has been working on new dishes to give their guests another reason to visit in the back half of this fiscal year. This includes the return of two guest favorites, Steak Gorgonzola Alfredo and Stuffed Chicken Marsala, which were removed from the menu during COVID. Both have been recast with higher quality ingredients and easier execution for their restaurant teams. And both fill a gap on Olive Garden's menu for center of the plate protein-forward dishes. This announcement received tremendous applause from their general managers at their GM conference in August. The LongHorn Steakhouse team closed their biggest menu gap with the addition of a healthier chicken dish. Their new lemon garlic chicken has scored extremely well in guest satisfaction ratings. LongHorn also introduced a new dragon fruit margarita during the quarter, made with an exclusive Patron Reposado tequila that was specially blended for LongHorn, and it has already become their top selling margarita. The Yard House team introduced a new pizza platform that has resulted in higher quality pizzas that are cooked in half the time, and they have seen a significant increase in preference and guest satisfaction as a result. This follows the introduction of other successful new menu items, such as their cheesesteak sandwiches and half pound prime burgers. Finally, at Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, you get a lot for not a lot. They create value by leveraging existing product across multiple menu items through purchasing opportunity buys and limited time offers. As an example, for a limited time, they are offering two grilled pork chops topped with caramelized onions and bourbon glaze with two-sides starting at $12.99. Our supply chain team and the Cheddar's culinary team continue to actively search for potential opportunity buys to drive exceptional value for guests and you will see more examples of their efforts in the back half of this fiscal year. Additionally, the Cheddar's team introduced a new lunch specialist platform earlier this calendar year that continues to win on price and build guest loyalty. This was thoroughly tested prior to launch and features eight great lunch items starting at $8.59. During the quarter, they also reintroduced a guest favorite to the menu that was removed during COVID. The team worked extremely hard to simplify the process and succeeded. Onion rings are back and guests are loving them. The Facebook post announcing the return of onion rings was the best engaged and most viewed post in Cheddar's history. From a service perspective, guests who visit our restaurants continue to have great experiences, which we see reflected in our guest satisfaction scores, but we know the full-service category lost focus on pace of meal over the years. In a world that has gotten faster, full-service restaurants haven't kept up. We know we can do a better job of evaluating our guests' time, and that was a central theme of our general manager conferences last month. We believe we have an opportunity to drive incremental sales over time by capturing the quicker meal occasions. The opportunities vary by brand and it is something each brand team will continue to focus on over the long-term. Providing an engaging atmosphere at each one of our restaurants, where guests enjoy themselves and the occasion is fundamental to creating exceptional guest experiences. Our facilities and remodel teams partner with each brand's operations team, to ensure we are delivering on this promise. Each year, we spend on average approximately $200,000 per restaurant for maintenance and remodels to keep our buildings fresh and inviting. But atmosphere is more than just the physical restaurant. It also involves the people who bring our brands to life. For example, at the center of every Yard House is their bar with more than 100 beers on tap, which is the cornerstone for their energized vibe. To strengthen this advantage, the Yard House team held their annual best-on-tap competition during the first quarter. They recertified all 900 bartenders on their bar knowledge and execution, and instilled pride about being a Yard House bartender. Congratulations to this year's winner, Andrew Stafford from The Yard House in Denver, Colorado. The marketing that supports these priorities comes to life in different ways across our brands. Regardless, everything our brand marketing team\u2019s work on, fits our marketing filters. First, it must elevate brand equity. Second, be easy to execute. And third, not be at a deep discount. Perhaps nothing fits our marketing filters better than Never Ending Pasta Bowl at Olive Garden. We know that, in this environment, guests are motivated by compelling offers like Never Ending Pasta Bowl that provide a strong value during a limited time. When the Olive Garden team saw their traffic gap to the industry go negative during our first quarter, after years of outperformance, they reacted by moving this promotion up and having it run for a total of 12 weeks, three weeks longer than they had planned, and four weeks longer than last year. To help keep this offer exciting during a relatively long window, Olive Garden will introduce a new garlic herb sauce during the fifth week of the promotion. Beyond checking all our marketing filters, Never Ending Pasta Bowl offers guests tremendous value. The starting out price point hasn't changed in three years, making it an even more compelling value and Olive Garden is putting additional marketing support behind it. We have said that, we intend to price below our competitors and inflation over time. In fact, when you look at Olive Garden over the last five years, they have priced more than 800 basis points below the full-service industry average and 700 basis points below grocery inflation. The Olive Garden team recognizes the need to do a better job of communicating this value to guests, so their advertising will prominently feature more price points this year, compared to last year, when the advertising message was primarily focused on equity building. Dan and his team are intensely-focused on their business and prepared to react to market conditions as we move through the rest of this fiscal year. While Olive Garden has a national television program, they've also used connected TV to reach their guests, where they are consuming content. Using learnings from Olive Garden, we have successfully tested CTV across a number of brands including LongHorn, Yard House and Cheddar's, and it's an opportunity remain we remain focused on. Connected TV and our other digital tests have allowed us to learn and be more effective with our media investments. Digital marketing has proven to be a targeted efficient way to drive brand equity and incremental sales across all our brands. Before I wrap up, I want to share some details regarding the exciting partnership we announced this morning with Uber that will begin with a pilot at Olive Garden. As you know, Olive Garden already offers an amazing large-party catering experience delivered by their team members. However, their guests have been asking for small order home delivery options and delivery guests in general continue to show they're willing to pay for the convenience. As you also know, we had concerns about the third-party model. It was important for us to find a way to address this guest needs state without disrupting the team member or guest experience and without compromising our competitive advantages, simple operating model and business model. We've had these concerns for some time, but that did not stop us from talking to delivery partners about possible solutions over the years. We began having more serious discussions about Uber Direct in April and our teams began working on the systems integrations in May. It was apparent to us that, the solution addressed our concerns. From a guest perspective, it protects the in restaurant experience, as drivers will pick up orders curbside in the same manner our guests do today. It also enhances the takeout experience by giving guests the option to have someone else pick up their order. This delivery-as-a-service further enhances the takeout experience for our guests, which is why we will have the same everyday value menu price for dine in, pickup or delivery. The added cost for delivery will be transparent to the guest and with Uber's technology platform, guests will be able to track their order all the way to their delivery address. Second, in terms of the team member experience, our proprietary capacity management tool will remain in place, allowing us to manage volume so we don't negatively impact restaurant operations or the in restaurant dining experience, and our ToGo specialists will be able to continue earning tips on these orders. Third, this partnership allows us to strengthen and defend our competitive advantages of significant scale and extensive data and insights. It enables us to use the scale of Uber's driver network to enhance our scale, and since guests will order through our online portal or mobile app, we keep the data. And last, we believe, this partnership will allow us to protect our simple operating model. Our teams executed great curbside ToGo experience today, and we believe, there will be no significant changes to our operators. Overall, we view this as an incremental long-term sales driver. This is a first-party delivery, not third-party delivery marketplace. It will take time for us to build sales. We intend to roll it out initially only at Olive Garden to learn and will pilot at a limited number of Olive Garden restaurant locations in the second quarter. Assuming a successful pilot, we plan to begin a phased rollout to all Olive Garden locations that currently offer curbside ToGo. We expect that to be complete before the end of the fiscal year. To wrap up, I am confident in the actions all our brand teams are taking to address our guest needs in this environment. Each of these actions fit our operating philosophy and marketing filters. More importantly, they do not compromise our long-term health for short-term benefits. I want to thank our 190,000 team members for the focus and commitment they continue to display. I'm extremely proud that our most recent engagement survey conducted by Gallup in July showed our overall team member engagement level reached a new all-time high and is nearly 30 points higher than the Gallup benchmark for U.S. organizations. Thank you for all you do to make our company successful. Now, I'll turn it over to Raj. Raj Vennam : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First quarter earnings results were lower than our expectations, as a result of the sales softness that impacted the industry in July. June same-restaurant sales trends were in line with our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter results, and we were surprised by the significant step down in traffic, beginning with the 4th of July holiday. However, sales trends rebounded in August, resulting in flat same-restaurant sales for the month. The first three weeks of September have further improved, resulting in positive same-restaurant sales quarter-to-date for all of our segments, except fine dining. Despite the sales softness we experienced during the first quarter, we delivered industry-leading margins and generated more adjusted EBITDA than the prior year, highlighting the durability and cash generation of our business model. In the first quarter, we generated $2.8 billion of total sales, 1% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 42 net new restaurants and partially offset by negative same-restaurant sales of 1.1%. We outperformed the industry again this quarter, with same-restaurant sales that were 140 basis points better than the industry and same-restaurant guest counts that exceeded the industry by 160 basis points. Our gap to the industry improved from the prior quarter, driven by the outperformance of LongHorn and the brands in our other business segment. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were slightly below last year at $1.75. We generated $392 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned $338 million to our shareholders this quarter, paying $166 million in dividends and repurchasing $172 million in shares. Now looking at our adjusted margin analysis compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 50 basis points lower, as commodities were only slightly inflationary for the quarter. Restaurant labor was 20 basis points higher as total labor inflation of approximately 4% was above our total pricing of approximately 2.5%. This unfavorability was partially offset by productivity improvements at our brands. Restaurant expenses were 30 basis points higher than last year, driven by sales deleverage. Marketing expenses were 20 basis points higher, consistent with our expectations. All of this resulted in restaurant level EBITDA of 18.8%, 20 basis points lower than last year. Adjusted G&A expenses were 20 basis points favorable due to lower incentive compensation accrual compared to the first quarter last year. This favorability was partially offset by unfavorable mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the way we hedge mark-to-market expense, this unfavorability is largely offset in the tax line. Interest expense increased 30 basis points, due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.6%. The rate favorability to last year is driven by the mark-to-market hedge, I referenced earlier, along with the additional favorable tax planning actions. Our effective tax rate would have been approximately 12% without the impact of mark-to-market. In total, we generated $209 million in adjusted earnings from continuing operations, which was 7.6% of sales. Now looking at our segments for the quarter. Total sales for Olive Garden decreased by 1.5% due to negative same-restaurant sales of 2.9%, underperforming the industry benchmark by 40 basis points. Last year, Olive Garden same-restaurant sales were 6.1% in the first quarter. On a two year basis, Olive Garden has grown same restaurant sales by 3.2%, exceeding the industry by 480 basis points over that period. Olive Garden continues to have strong segment profit margin, delivering 20.6% for the quarter. At LongHorn, total sales increased 6.5%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 3.7%, outperforming the industry by 620 basis points and continuing to gain significant share even in this deep discounting environment. These results build on strong results from Q1 last year, where they had same-restaurant sales of 8.1% and outperformed the industry by 720 basis points. The LongHorn team is doing a great job of staying focused on their strategy and maintaining momentum within their business. Sales growth and favorable beef costs resulted in segment profit margin of 17.9%, 40 basis points above last year. Total sales at Fine Dining segment increased 2%, driven by the addition of eight net new restaurants. Same-restaurant sales at both Capital Grille and ADVs were negative as the fine dining category as a whole continues to be challenged. This resulted in lower segment profit margin than last year. The other business segment sales declined slightly, driven by negative same-restaurant sales of 1.8% for the brands in the segment. However, this segment outperformed the industry benchmark by 70 basis points and is continuing to gain share even in this intensified promotional activity in the industry this quarter. Segment profit margin of 15.1% was flat to last year. This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance, taking into consideration actual performance year-to-date and the initiatives Rick shared to support the remainder of the fiscal year. Now I'd like to provide a brief update on the pending Chuy's acquisition. We're currently on track to close in mid-October assuming approval from Chuy's shareholders. We have secured financing to support the closing. The team that successfully led the Ruth's Chris integration is ready to bring their expertise and lessons learned to this integration. As we mentioned on the announcement call in July, we anticipate the transaction will be neutral to our adjusted earnings per share for this fiscal year, excluding transaction and integration related expenses. Finally, as Rick mentioned, we will not compromise our long-term health for short-term benefits. We're confident in the actions our brand teams are taking to address their guest needs in this environment. We have proven we can navigate challenging environments and believe our strategy remains the right one for our company. Now, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning. As it relates to the Uber partnership, I'm just curious, have you guys conducted an analysis on how impactful this could be for Olive Garden, once fully rolled out and are there plans or options to add more partners or will this be an exclusive partnership for some period of time? Rick Cardenas : Brian, we'll learn quite a bit from the pilot, but we do have some estimates from Uber that are pretty big. We're just not assuming that, but we do expect the incrementality to grow over time. In terms of other partnerships, we have a two year exclusive with Uber, but we have the ability to expand it to other brands if we'd like, if it works for Olive Garden. But right now, we're focusing on Olive Garden, we're focusing on getting the restaurants that are piloting up and running. The technology is almost finished and this is fully integrated into our system. That's one of the reasons that we've spent some time to make this work, but, it's a two year exclusive and then we have options after that. Brian Bittner : Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up just on the sales side, what's driving the improvement in September? And I'm just curious on Olive Garden, you've talked about taking less price in the industry and that you want to showcase more price points in advertising, but you've seen some great success by some of your peers that are striking gold with creative promotions. I'm just curious, how you're thinking about promotions moving forward and the opportunity to use that lever? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Brian. The September, we're seeing increases I think in the industry as well. But, all of our performance is contemplated in our guidance for the month of September and for the rest of the year. In terms of promotion and things that we're looking at for Olive Garden, Olive Garden, and Olive Garden, I'll start by saying I'm really proud of the work that Dan and his team have done over the years. They continue to price below inflation as you know. But, one of the challenges is, in this kind of environment, consumers are looking for a little bit more price certainty and we've seen a little bit of a decline in the first time guests at Olive Garden. They might not realize that, we've taken so much less pricing than everybody. So we've reacted and we're going to add some more price points throughout the year. Yes, you did mention that, others might be showing some benefit with some deep discount, limited-time offers. We're going to showcase our price points throughout the year in different ways. Some of them are limited-time like Never Ending Pasta Bowl, others are just talking about the great value we already have, but being more prominent. That said, all of our marketing filters are intact, and we may have some limited time offers in the back half of the year, but they will still fit our filters of being simple to execute, not at a deep discount and continue to strengthen our competitive advantages. They'll just be things that help to motivate guests to get to the restaurant, while those things are still in the restaurant. Operator : Next question is coming from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Brian Harbour : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just also on Uber. Is there no pilot at other brands contemplated in '25? Do you think that, that would perhaps come in '26 or how would you treat kind of the rest of Garden? Rick Cardenas : Brian, right now we're focusing on Olive Garden. We do have the ability to pilot other brands even in this fiscal year. We just want to make sure that, the systems work, that we have pretty seamless experience for our guests and for the drivers and for our team members, so that we know this works really well. And then, we have the ability to pilot at other brands. And we have already the different pricing options from Uber for every one of our brands. Not that every one of our brands are going to be on this first-party delivery, but we do have the ability to put it in other brands and that's going to be up to those brands to decide that they want to do it. Brian Harbour : Okay, great. Thank you. Rick, can you maybe just talk a little bit more also about kind of the service opportunity or kind of that focus on speed and pace of meals? What specifically do you think could change there? Is that more of a lunch comments or sort of like shoulder period comment, how would we kind of see that over time? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Brian. This isn't just a throughput challenge. This is a guest needs state challenge. The world has gotten faster, people can get on their phones and order something and it will show up on their door in a few hours. They've got other options to dine and the full-service restaurant category hasn't really gotten faster. We believe that, there's opportunities for us to speed up our experience without making the guests feel rushed. We're going to do that. And so, this is going to take a while. Now some of these speed initiatives or these initiatives will help throughput earlier on. But, what we're trying to do is capture that occasion where the guest has a little less time to eat than they did 10 years ago. They don't believe, they can do that at a full-service restaurant. We believe they can. And so, we're going to spend our time to improve our time. If you look at guests in full-service, not just at Darden, but in full-service restaurants, their speed scores are unfavorable. When they talk about going to a full-service restaurant and they talk about speed, it's inherently dissatisfying. We don't really get a whole lot of comments about being too fast. So we want to change that. And we're going to be doing that over the years. We're going to do that job-by-job and make our experience faster than it is today. I'm not saying how much faster, but it's got to be faster than it is today for those guests who want it faster. At the end of the day, we need to value our guests' time and they have some different needs than they did 10 or 15 years ago. Operator : Next question today is coming from Jon Tower from Citi. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just, to hammer more on Uber Eats. I am curious if you could speak to your plans for advertising, the option for delivery and specifically do you plan to advertise on the Uber Eats platform for the brand? And then, I've got a follow-up. Rick Cardenas : We do not plan on advertising on Uber Eats for the brand. But, that said, as we have options to market to consumers and we do actually have marketing funds from Uber to help us do that. And as we reach scale, we can leverage other marketing channels to drive consumers to our websites and our mobile apps. But when a consumer goes to place it ToGo order on our apps or on our mobile website, they will have the option at that time for delivery. They'll see it in that way. We also have a 17 million plus guest at eClub at Olive Garden that we can market to get it started, but we think a lot of this is going to build over time and we do have options to market it. Jon Tower : Got it. Just a quick follow-up on that and then another question. In terms of Uber, is this contemplated in guidance, this relationship for fiscal '25? And then, the question is on the time improvements that you mentioned earlier, do you think this will require greater investment in technology and/or staffing at the stores? Rick Cardenas : On the Uber side, everything that we know this morning is contemplated in guidance. Again, the Uber first-party delivery is going to take a while to build. We're going to pilot it. We're going to see how that works. Then our plan is to have it rolled out at all Olive Garden by the end of this fiscal year. So that'll give you an idea of how much we expect it to be in this fiscal year. Now if it goes really well and it does a lot more than we think, then, yes, we've got a little bit of room there. But, if it doesn't, we think it's going to take a little while. So we'll stick with that. Everything we know is contemplated in our guidance. The second part of your question, I'm sorry. Jon Tower : Just on the tech improvement in time. Rick Cardenas : Yes. On the speed side, yes, we make investments in technology all the time. We're working on our tech roadmap now over three years and one of the things that we're talking about is how do we help the restaurants go get a little faster, but it doesn't necessarily need a lot of technology. Our focus is to work on our operations to improve the speed and then if we need to add technology behind it to do that. On staffing, we don't believe, it actually needs a lot of staffing either. If it does, it's for times where guests are there, but we have false weights and how do we staff a little bit better there. We've got some good technology solutions to help managers understand, when guests were ready to be sat and they didn't get sat, so that when they're writing their schedule, they can schedule it better. While it may add a few hours in the restaurant, it's going to add productive hours and so it shouldn't hurt our margins, it should actually help our margins. Overtime, we believe, being a little faster is going to be beneficial to our guests, beneficial to our team and beneficial to our investors. Operator : Next question today is coming from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Eric Gonzalez : Thanks for the question. You talked a little bit about the price point advertising at Olive Garden. You're still spending well below what you used to spend in the past. I'm just curious what your thoughts are around maybe increasing the level of spend to put a bit more pressure on your competitors? Raj Vennam : Eric, I think we want to be thoughtful about how we do marketing and you saw that when we find that, there is something that we can get a return on, we're willing to make the investment. It's not that there is any constraint on the spend. It's more about, do we think we can get the return on it and we are just being more methodical. We've always said, we are playing a long game. We're not trying to just win in the short-term. We're trying to focus on the long-term health of the business and how do we build it over time. If there are ways where we can say that, we can accomplish that objective by spending more in marketing, we're willing to do that. Eric Gonzalez : Okay. And then, if I could just ask about fine dining, I'm just curious what's driving the downtick in that business and maybe when you expect that business to recover? Raj Vennam : Yes. I think from a fine dining standpoint, it's been a continuing challenge as we got into the summer months. There were a lot of factors in the summer seem like including some international travel and things like that. But, it's just it seems like there were other places, where the luxury consumer was spending dollars on, especially this summer months. We do expect a gradual build back. I don't know that, we have an exact timing of when that's going to happen. But there is a clear difference between suburban markets and urban markets. We are still operating close to that mid-70s in the pre-COVID levels in the urban markets, while suburban markets are in the more of the 90s in terms of retention to pre-COVID. And so, and then when we look at income, people all the way up to $200,000 and below were seeing pullback. And so, that's the other part of the fine dining impact and they did get a lot of people, more aspirational guest maybe. Those were really losing them pretty fast and that's part of the reason why you saw fine dining decline. Operator : Next question today is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Rick, my first question was just following up on the sales trends for both yourself and the industry. I think you talked about the July weakness, an improvement since then. We know that Olive Garden has that catalyst of the earlier launch of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl. But I just wanted to see the trends of the other brands since July, would you assume that, just the broader industry and therefore all your brands have seen improvement? If so, I'm just wondering what do you think was the industry shock of July and maybe your confidence that the worst is behind us. And then I had one follow-up. Rick Cardenas : Yes. If you look at what happened to the industry and to our brands, June and August were pretty similar to each other, both in the industry and our brands, at least to our brands we were similar to Q4 trends in June and August. And then, all of a sudden the industry kind of fell off a little bit in July. We think it's driven by a few things. There was some pretty interesting weather in the month of July with a lot of storms, hurricanes, tornadoes. We had the Olympics in July, which -- we expected the Olympics to be not too dramatic to us, but it was the highest opening day, opening ceremony rating in over a decade. COVID had increased in July. We don't talk about that much, but there was an uptick there. International travel as Raj mentioned, there was a lot more international travel out than in, which last year, there was a lot more international travel in and out. And so, there were a lot of factors in July. There was political volatility. I'm not sure anybody has seen the volatility in the politics that we've seen in the last couple of months. And so, I think people had other things to worry about and think about. But, we picked back up in August and all of our brands are continuing that trend, even the guidance that we have for the rest of this year and everybody's talking a little bit about Olive Garden pickup, because of Never Ending Pasta Bowl, but all our brands are getting better. July was just something that was unexpected and we feel like, we're going to be able to react in the right ways and we got that month behind us. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just following up on the promotional activity. Obviously, the peers have been more aggressive. You've avoided that. The earlier launch of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl seems like it's an indication of your desire or willingness to better compete, but like you said, it's still profitable. But I think you mentioned some LTOs or some more LTOs in the second half of fiscal '25. I'm just wondering specifically, what that might entail whether it's you're talking about Olive Garden or other brands, because again I know you mentioned you're not going to compromise the long-term health for the short-term benefits. But just trying to get a sense for what that could entail in terms of an uptick in LTO activity in the back half of the year? Rick Cardenas : Yes. As we've said, in this environment, we think it's appropriate to highlight the great value. Last year, we were spending most of our marketing dollars in promotional messaging on equity building. We think, because we've priced so much lower than the industry over the years and we want to make sure people understand that price point that, we want to put that a little bit more in front of guests. The Olive Garden is shifting some of their marketing message to highlight the value guests can get at Olive Garden, especially for first time and infrequent users. By bringing back fan favorites, whether at a limited time or on their core menu, that are simple to execute and that are improvement for what they had before. This will give guests a little bit more compelling reasons to visit than talking about our core equities, which are great to build long-term, but in this environment, we want to motivate guests to get back. I want to be clear that, this isn't a return to constant deep discount promotions that add significant upstream cost that Olive Garden began to shift away from before COVID. We don't believe that, that's the right thing to do. What we're talking about in any limited time offer is something that's very simple to execute. It's just limited time to have guests know that, hey, they got to get there. On other brands, I talked a little bit about Cheddar's and using opportunity buys. They've done limited time offers for years. They just don't have the marketing as much behind it, but it's because the buy they can get by leveraging Darden scale and maybe items that some of the Darden brands won't be able to use, or other brands won't be able to use, they can put an item on the menu for a very, very great price like the pork chop, I mentioned. We had a T-bone at Cheddar's a year or two ago, I don't remember exactly what year. That was also at a limited time. We have some other limited time things that are going to go on the menu in the back half of this fiscal year at Cheddar's. Those were buys that we've made a while back. We'll see those. Right now, I think it's this week or Monday, Yard House starts Oktoberfest, which is also a limited time, something we've always done. But what I didn't say is, these are deep discounts because they're not. And so, we're not going to get into that real deep discount game to bring guests in for a really low price and have a lot of our core guest pay a lot of higher price. We've played that before. We don't think, it's the right long-term thing. It might feel really great in the short-term, but as we've said, we're not going to sacrifice the long-term health for short-term gains. So long way to answer your question, yes, we are on television. That said, we had already planned on doing that all year. We had planned on that at the beginning of this fiscal year. The way we're doing it may change a little bit, but we always plan to have quite a few price points on television this year. Operator : Next question is coming from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning and congrats on this delivery test and getting this done with the parameters you wanted, which included the menu prices being the same as your everyday menu. I wonder, what will that delivery fee be upon checkout that you're seeing as a consumer, given that your menu prices will be the same? Will that fee get you back to a margin equivalent to a takeout order? I have a quick follow-up. Rick Cardenas : Yes, David. I just want to be clear on the delivery fee. That's going to be paid by the guest. So while they see the menu price is the exact same menu price they see everywhere else. They will also see what will it cost them to have someone else pick up the food and bring it to them versus them coming to get it themselves. It's really kind of a convenience. That said, it's a pretty -- it's a fairly low fee. And so, we've got two parts of it. One is just kind of a delivery fee, which is around $5 for every order and then a 5% of the entire order. On a typical Olive Garden order, it'll probably be somewhere around $7 to have their food delivered to them versus picking it up themselves, and then not including the tip. By the way, that tip as we said, will be shared with our team members. We believe that, it's a win-win for everybody. If a consumer wants the convenience of delivery, we believe they should pay for that convenience in a transparent way. Today on third-party marketplace, lot of the consumers are paying for it in a very untransparent way. They see a menu price that they may not realize is much higher than the menu price in the restaurant. We were clear that, we didn't want that. And so, that's how it works. No incremental cost to Darden, so that means, it's not a margin difference to our pickup. We believe that was important. If you think about what we said years ago and even today, Olive Garden does about $1 billion in sales in ToGo. And so, if we were to transfer quite a bit of that to a third-party marketplace without that charge being borne by someone other than Olive Garden, it would have been a big, big margin disruptor unless it was hugely incremental. We've had third-party delivery in quite a few Olive Garden's, I mean, 13 to 14 of them for years. The incrementality isn't that much to offset, unless we wanted to charge less to our restaurant. Again, very low cost we believe to the consumer to get a delivery on an average order and as the order size gets bigger the percentage gets smaller. The amount, the percent that they pay in total gets smaller because there's that $5 fixed fee. Raj Vennam : I just want to clarify on the margin percentage might be a little different, just because of the geography of the P&L because the delivery fee might go -- might be recorded as revenue, and so and that will come out of the restaurant expenses. But, it has to be really meaningful to have impact on the percentage, that's just a nuance with the various accounted for. David Palmer : I just have a follow-up. I just wanted to get your latest thinking and latest diagnosis about Olive Garden relative to the industry, which of course is a contrast to LongHorn, which is still actually an accelerated basis outperforming. Is there anything that is clear to you in the customer satisfaction scores that you're seeing that is telling about an opportunity with Olive Garden? What are your insights telling you? Maybe, it's something having to do with the category that you're in and the trade off to at home versus what we see in steak, for example, but any thoughts there that might inform your strategy? Thanks. Rick Cardenas : Yes, David. I think what we're seeing at LongHorn, they've got -- they're in the steak category and I will start steak brands with strong operations that deliver on quality or winning. These are heightened times when steak is expensive in the grocery store. And so, many people don't want to risk buying steak in the grocery store and preparing it and not doing it well, they might as well go to a restaurant and have them, have the risk of the preparation. And I also say LongHorn has made significant investments over the years in quality and that continues to pay off. Our data supports that people are trading down from fine dining into steaks. And so, that's parts of the reason that LongHorn is doing well, but you got to execute. It's not every stake player in the country isn't doing great. You got to execute and LongHorn is doing that. On the Olive Garden front, we have seen a little bit less influx of first time-ish users or very infrequent users, where during other times, we may have seen more and maybe that's because there's some promotional activities at a pretty deep discount from others. But what I would say is, Olive Garden is not losing guests to some of these brands that are doing some pretty deep discounts. Our data says that, those brands are growing at the expense of other brands not the expense of ours, because when we look at Olive Garden consumers, their share of visits hasn't changed. It's just the total number of visits they have has changed. That's one little insight that we have is this that, we're not really losing and neither is Cheddar's, neither are other brands. They're not losing their guests to these discounts. These companies that are doing discounts might be taking share from other companies that are doing discounts. What are we doing? We are out there talking more about the great price that you can get at Olive Garden all the time, but motivating them a little bit more by saying, yeah, you get these prices all the time with unlimited first course, but some of these items if you want them you have to come in a little quicker. Operator : Next question is coming from David Tarantino from Baird. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. Rick, I had a question about the Uber Eats or I guess Uber Direct relationship. My question is on the decision to make this primary or solely a first party relationship and not offer Olive Garden on their marketplace. I guess, I think, most brands source most of their delivery orders from the marketplace and not first party. Just wondering why that decision and would you ever be open to a deal that puts your brands on their marketplace? Rick Cardenas : Yes. I would start by, where I mentioned earlier. The incrementality has to be really big to offset the $1 billion that we're doing and ToGo sales at Olive Garden today, without any fees. We believe that, a lot of guests come to our website directly and they want delivery. And so, we're going to start with that. We also know that, if we can tell more people about this that they'll come to our website. Now with the acquisition of Chuy's and them coming in, we'll learn a little bit more about it, about third-party and we'll see, if there's an option down the road to do marketplace, but it doesn't solve the challenges that we've had. And so, as we've always said, there are things that we don't like about third-party marketplace. One of them is, a market. I mean, if you think about marketplace and reason maybe a lot of these folks are sourcing their delivery through that is, it's really a marketing channel. We're really strong marketers. We've got money we can spend in marketing that maybe others can't. It's also a technology channel and we've got a great technology team. Some of these brands that are sourcing, maybe sourcing, because that's the way they can and we have other ways to do it. Let's see how this works and we'll look at, just like we've been looking at this for years and seeing if there's a way to get in, this is our way in. If things change, David, and we think there's another option for us to be on the marketplace, then we have the ability to do that. Operator : Next question is coming from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Raj, Olive Garden segment margin looked slightly below, I think, 2019 levels and maybe it was down obviously year-over-year. Can you talk about what drove that result? Raj Vennam : Yes. Chris, I think it really starts with the sales. When you think about the way their same-restaurant sales were when you have a negative 3%, there's a lot of deleverage. In fact, I would say, the unexpected step down in July really made it harder for us to react and adjust our costs. Our teams do a great job of forecasting the business and managing costs really well. However, July was surprising to us and to our models. I think none of our models would have predicted the type of step down we had in July. That just made it a little more challenging. And then, there are some timing stuff between the quarters that might have some nuances compared to pre-COVID. Frankly, I haven't looked at pre-COVID to be able to give you a full view on exactly what's the delta. But year-over-year, I mean, again at a 20.6% segment profit, this is really strong margins, right. I mean, no one else in the industry comes close. They are hundreds of basis points ahead of anybody else. We feel like they're in a great place from that business model perspective. Chris O'Cull: That makes sense. And then I know you're still targeting earnings growth, I guess call it 6% to 8% for the year, but is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of earnings cadence over the balance of the year? Raj Vennam : Yes, Chris. I think for us, when we look at it, it's probably in that mid to high single digits for the next three quarters. There may be a little bit of movement from quarter-to-quarter. One of the things we mentioned earlier, when we provided guidance was that, second quarter will have a little bit of a benefit because of Thanksgiving shifting out of the Q2 into Q3 on sales and you would expect some of that to flow through. But, with all that said, I think the way we have, we think about it, it's probably in that mid to high single digit growth over the next few quarters. It's not like a huge difference quarter-to-quarter. There may be a couple of points from quarter-to-quarter. Operator : Next question is coming from Jim Salera from Stephens. Jim Salera : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to ask on, if you had a sense for what percentage of your Olive Garden guests already have the app downloaded? Because it sounds like the opportunity for incrementality from the delivery offering is really going to come from kind of existing Olive Garden guests. Do you have a sense for what the penetration of the app is already? And do you have any plans for kind of in restaurant activation, whether it's the waiters or waitresses or somebody encouraging people to download the app at the restaurant? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Jim. I just want to be clear that, there's other ways to order ToGo at Olive Garden and about over 60% of our ToGo orders are already digital, whether it's through our online platform or our mobile app. There's a pretty good percentage of our guests. We're not going to get into what percent have the app. If there's things that we want to do to market that app a little bit more, we will. It's a pretty -- it's a great app for a core consumer. You can get your name on the wait list. You can order to go. You can do a lot of other things. And so, without giving you the percent of guests that are on that app, it's not a huge percent, but it's a good percentage. But again, you can order on the website. Actually when we start the pilot, the first way you can be able to order is website, the app won't be ready for -- it'll be ready during the pilot, but it won't be ready the first week we launched the pilot. Jim Salera : Okay. And then, I don't know, if I missed this, I apologize. But, can you guys just give us the traffic check and mix components for Olive Garden and LongHorn for the quarter? Raj Vennam : At Olive Garden, our pricing was just south of 2%. I think they were like 1.9% for the quarter. They had a little bit of a positive mix. They're in the mid-5% for traffic, negative mid-5%. And then LongHorn had positive traffic of 0.7%. Their check growth was 3%. I think their pricing was really close to that maybe in the high 2%. Operator : Next question is coming from Jake Bartlett from Truist Securities. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Rick, since all the changes since COVID, I think the question for investors has been, what stays around? What are the big changes you made? What remains? And what caught my attention was, some of the add backs on the menu. You mentioned kind of adding couple of items back at Olive Garden. The question is, is the menu simplification kind of reversing here a little bit? Are you going to be making efforts to take items off as you add old ones back? What's the message here with kind of the menu and your commitment to the simplification? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Jake. We're very committed to keeping the menu simple. All of our brands have really high bars to add items. The items that we have added, for example, at LongHorn, the lemon garlic chicken filled a hole in the menu on something that we took off that was a more healthy chicken option. They didn't want to add just anything. And so, it took them a while to find something that was really guest satisfying. The great thing is, it really doesn't add a whole lot of SKU. I don't know if it adds any SKUs in our restaurant. We already have the chicken, we already have the seasoning, we already have everything else. It's just adding another a different kind of topping on that chicken. It's really simple to execute. At Yard House, the pizzas were placed pizzas. We already had pizzas, we just replaced them with better quality dough, better quality toppings and actually in some ways a more appealing pizza for more people. I'll give you an example. We had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. We just took the mushrooms off and we're selling more. We also improved the cook time on those pizzas. It wasn't like we added new items, we just changed them. Same with the Cheesesteak. We had a different kind of Cheesesteak on the menu. We fixed this one. We had burgers on the menu. We've got different burgers on the menu. We didn't really add to the menu at Yard House by doing that and their menu is significantly lower than it was before. Yes, we are clear that, the menu simplification we did was the right thing for us, but we do know that, we have to continue to innovate on the menu and when we add items, we take items off. Jake Bartlett : Another question or follow-up is on pricing and on some of the inflation that you're seeing. In the last call you mentioned 2.5% to 3% pricing for '25. I think the first quarter here was at 2.5%. So is that the right way to think about pricing for the rest of the year, that it remains at the lower end of that range? And then the other part of the question is on the operating cost inflation. You reiterated your guidance for inflation, but when I look at the commodities outlook, things look to be a little bit better. Beef is now low single-digits inflation, produce is flat. The items that change got a little bit better for you. Is it fair to say that, your cost environment, inflation environment is a little bit better than you previously expected, but you're going to be on the more conservative side for pricing, how should we look at those factors? Raj Vennam : Yes, Jake. I think, yes, we're probably going to be in that range of 2.5% to 3% any given quarter. I don't think we have any quarter where it's going to be higher than 3%, but 2.7% to 2.8% in some quarters is likely. Now we're going to -- not everything is locked in from a pricing perspective. We're going to kind of watch where the costs come in. And then on the commodity side, you're right, we are seeing better-than-expected inflation. In fact, first quarter, we were only, as I said in my prepared remarks, slightly inflationary, but we do have some headwind in the back half with chicken. Our chicken contract runs out at the beginning of new calendar year and that implies there, given where chicken is trending, there is some risk there. And so we incorporated that. Now with all that said, for the full year, we're probably likely going to be south of that but it's with the guide says approximately 2%. So you can think of it as maybe when we started might have been little bit north of 2% and maybe now we're looking at a little bit south of 2%. Operator : Next question today is coming from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Katherine Griffin : Hi, thank you. This is Katherine Griffin on for Sara. The first question is on the state category. Rick, I think you spoke to your all of the businesses accelerating, but I'm curious about that performance in the context of the broader stay category, because it seems that, that's slowed in recent weeks. Is that a fair assessment? Raj Vennam : Katherine, if you're talking about specifically LongHorn, we haven't seen any slowdown. That's not what we're experiencing. In fact nothing right. Katherine Griffin : Okay. Raj Vennam : Yes. As Rick said, I think September quarter-to-date, we're actually trending at or above August levels at pretty much all of our brands, across all our brands. Katherine Griffin : Right. I guess the other question was more relative to the broader category, but it sounds like it hasn't slowed. Thank you for clarifying. And then the second question is just on the curbside mix. I think you said that, there's a phased rollout across locations that have the curbside ToGo. Have you quantified how much -- how many of your stores have to go and like what would cause that maybe to change? Rick Cardenas : Katherine, pretty much every Olive Garden has ToGo. Every Olive Garden has ToGo. Almost all of them have curbside. There's just a couple restaurants here or there that might not have curbside, whether it's like -- let's just use Times Square in New York City, probably not a curbside. Actually they already have third-party delivery in Times Square. What we wanted to be clear is that, this is a curbside experience no matter what. If a guest orders to go and they want it delivered, the only difference is somebody else is picking it up for them curbside, just like today. Operator : Next question is coming from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of clarifications on the Uber Eats partnership. Are you allowing for the entire menu at Olive Garden or including LTOs for delivery, or is there any limitations on the menu going forward? Rick Cardenas : Right now anything on the menu can be ordered ToGo. You can't -- it's kind of hard to do Never Ending Pasta Bowl ToGo. But the only thing is, yes, alcohol is not available for delivery, but food items, everything is available. I will clarify that though. Remember, we do large party catering that we deliver for big groups. Some of those items may be available for delivery, but they wouldn't get the same kind of experience you get when you do the Olive Garden catering. It would just be somebody bringing a pan of lasagna to your house versus if you do a large party catering, we go in and we set it up and we bring the trays and everything else. That's the only difference. But you can order pretty much anything that you can order today on Olive Garden's menu for ToGo or for delivery. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks for that. And then just on the overall, when you think about this Uber Eats partnership, was there a cohort of consumers that you were trying to target here, something that you're not getting, or are you thinking this will help maybe more for lunch versus dinner? Any details around kind of how you came to this conclusion of moving forward on the delivery process? Rick Cardenas : I'll start by saying, delivery is a lot stickier than we thought it would be. We thought that over time consumers would see how expensive it is, and kind of pull back on that, but it's been fairly sticky. There are consumers that want the convenience of having something brought to them versus coming to get it. This is not a lunch or dinner, this is a need state for convenience. It's a different occasion. We do know that, in some of our restaurants that do the delivery today. We've got again handfuls of restaurants. Those guests don't come to eat in the restaurant. And so, this is a new occasion for them. We believe we'll be able to pick up some new occasions going forward. But it's not a lunch or dinner thing. It's just an occasion of getting something -- getting the convenience of not having to get in your car and go pick it up. Operator : Next question is coming from Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim Securities. Gregory Francfort : Thanks for the question. My question is, can you just remind us maybe when the pricing, I think you said 1.9% in the quarter when that rolls off? I'm just curious, how you're thinking about pricing going forward. Your menu actually does not have massive differences in price points across regions. I'm curious, how you balance maybe spreading that out a little bit with kind of advertising some of these national price points more aggressively to the customer? Raj Vennam : Greg, there was some pricing action in the middle of the quarter. There is some timing of when that, so the 19 was for the full quarter. We don't anticipate any additional actions until specifically at Olive Garden, if any until new sometime in the new calendar year. I don't want to get into boxing ourselves in a certain date or in a time on the amount of pricing, because, like I said, this is one of those things where we're very thoughtful about how much pricing we take. Even in times when people were taking a lot, we were being we're holding back. And so, that philosophy hasn't changed. So we want to not again, I don't want to give out a number because then it becomes something we have to do. Now with that said, from a geography perspective, we do have tiering and we do have the price difference. Even when we have promotions, there's way to kind of price in some -- there is a small percentage of markets. For example, if you're living in California, you're probably paying more for now earning possible than the rest of the country, or if you're in New York City. So there is some differences and we do have multiple tiers. The pricing takes into consideration a lot of factors to kind of account for that. Rick Cardenas : Greg, I'll just add one thing. We do we're very clear in our advertising and our messaging. If you think about what I said in the prepared remarks about Cheddar's Pork Chop starting at $12.99 It's not -- a lot of times when people say starting at is because you have different items on that promotion and one of them is, at this price and there's another one and another one there. The reason, I didn't say $12.99 is, it's not $12.99 everywhere. So we do tier across all of our brands, across all of our geographies. We have tiers. In some markets, we have a different price in different restaurants for the same brand. We're very, very focused on pricing. We have a data analytics team that works that and gives us the best places to take price and not take price that help us in the long run. We are very surgical in our pricing, which means that, it's harder for us to advertise a one price everywhere, other than doing starting at. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jeff Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Jeff Farmer : Thanks. I appreciate that it's late in the call, so I'll try to be quick here. Can you guys just shed some light on that Olive Garden customer income cohort that's historically responded, or I would say, I guess who's historically or currently responding to never ending possible. Just the bigger picture question there is, if that's giving you any relief with that lower income consumer cohort. Raj Vennam : Jeff, interestingly, when we actually do Never Ending Pasta Bowl, we actually get income a lift from consumers across income spectrums all the way up to 150,000. Yes. It's not necessarily a bigger lift for lower income versus the middle income. It seems like middle income is just as sensitive to some of these price points. Historically, this has shown that it actually helps us with some new guests and some infrequent. That's really where we get the benefit. It's more about those guests, where Rick addressed earlier that, that's where we might be missing some and Never Ending Pasta Bowl really gets them back. And then you see that the menu prices are actually pretty low compared to other places. Jeff Farmer : Thank you for that. Just as a quick follow-up, in terms of thinking about Olive Garden's diminished market share over the last couple of quarters, do you think that, not fully capturing that individual or small party delivery opportunity has contributed to that diminished market share dynamic? Rick Cardenas : Hey, Jeff. I just want to be clear, whenever we hear diminish market share, it sounds like, we're losing share. The only quarter Olive Garden has had lower traffic than the industry and I think the last five years is the quarter we just ended. It wasn't that much different. Yes, this quarter we lost a little bit of traffic share, but we're still at the 50th percentile. There were some others that did really well, to drive some traffic that moved the average a little bit. Now, could it be that, some of these delivery customers that didn't have a chance to get Olive Garden are part of that reason? Perhaps. But the saying that, we've lost share, I think is not really what we believe. We did lose it in one quarter over the last few years. Jeff Farmer : Just quickly, 100% fair, I should have worded that diminished market share outperformance is, what I should have said. So fair? Rick Cardenas : No problem. Operator : Next question is coming from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. You were mentioning that the greater political uncertainty may have affected the consumer sentiment, specifically in July. Can you make comments on how you think this tighter migration controls that we're hearing from both parties actually might be affecting labor costs for your brand? Would you expect the labor cost to be in '25? Raj Vennam : Danilo, labor costs are actually holding up pretty well. I think when we look at the current quarter, our overall labor inflation was around 4%, hourly labor wages were 3.9%, which has come off of really high numbers a couple of years ago. I think from an applicant flow, we're seeing a lot higher applicants. And so, we actually feel really good about the labor situation and the availability of labor. When we look at overall for the full year, we're still expecting our labor to be more in that 4% range, which is not that different from pre-COVID. And so, we don't see that as an issue at least in the near-term or for the rest of the fiscal year. Danilo Gargiulo : Great. And can you make also some comments on the actions you're taking to maybe address some of the challenges that you're seeing in the fine dining segment? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Danilo. You think about fine dining, sometimes you've got an economy at -- when you've got lower kind of consumers that were more aspirational going into fine dining that are not in there now. It's not something that we really want to go after very hard. We believe that, the fine dining consumer is a very discerning consumer. And I will say that, when you look at across all of our brands, but even in especially in fine dining, the consumer that is a frequent consumer to us is not stopping coming. The people that know what you get when you go to fine dining are still coming to fine dining. It's some of those that may have come during times that they wanted to be aspirational. That said, we brought Wagyu and Wine back at Capital Grille. It's back right now. It's the first time I think in five years we've run Wagyu and Wine. That's a great choice of one of three great Wagyu burgers, and some great glasses of wine for a good price point. That might get some of those consumers to come in and see, but sometimes you don't want to market to people to really change your brand, when you've got these great discerning consumers that come to our restaurants and they're still coming. Operator : Next question today is coming from Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Lauren Silberman : Hey, guys. Appreciate the time. There's obviously increased demand for value across the industry. With Never Ending Pasta Bowl, are you seeing a higher mix or take rate than you've seen historically on the promo just given that demand for value? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Lauren, we are seeing a little bit more -- a little bit more preference, not dramatically more preference, but we are seeing an increase in preference in the buy-up, so the add-on for Never Ending Pasta Bowl. Now there are some parts of the country that we're seeing a lot of preference because it's a better value. Even though the price point is tiered, it's still a great value. And so yes, there is a little bit of more people coming because of the value. But it's performing at our expectations. Lauren Silberman : Great. And then just one follow-up on the delivery side. So Olive Garden off-premise already in the mid-20% range without delivery. Any additional color on how you're thinking about the potential incrementality to off-premise delivery and how much this can add to the long-term off-prem run rate? Rick Cardenas : Yes, Lauren, what I would say is we're going to learn a lot from the pilot. We're going to learn a lot while it builds. I will say we believe this will be incremental in some way. It's not -- not every delivery order will be incremental, but there are consumers that have wanted Olive Garden delivered for small order for years. So we know that there will be some incremental sales out of this. We will learn from the pilot. We will learn from the first 100 or so restaurants that roll out after the pilot, and keep going from there. But we believe that over time this will continue to build and will be highly incremental. Lauren Silberman : Great. Does the pilot include 100 restaurants, is that what you're saying? Rick Cardenas : The pilot, we plan on having about -- probably about 100 restaurants in the pilot in the second quarter, and then we're going to leave it there through the holidays. And then if all the systems and everything works, then that's when the rollout will start. Now getting to 100 restaurants means that the technology is working. So we're going to start very slowly, in maybe 5 or 6 restaurants, in 1 market, to test the technology and then build from there, but build pretty quickly to the 100 and then kind of stop the pilot -- not stop the pilot, but stop expanding in the pilot, until after the holidays. Operator : Next question today is coming from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Andy Barish : Yes, I just wanted to maybe finish up on Never Ending Pasta Bowl. Just kind of moving it up, how do you see the life cycle kind of that promotion as it starts to lap the year-ago launch? And I guess, with the new sauce, do you expect things to continue? And then also just some color on the comparisons from a year ago. Does October and November get a little bit tougher than September? Rick Cardenas : So Andy, I'll talk about the length of Olive Garden's Never Ending Pasta Bowl. So yes, we added 4 weeks to last year. It was 3 weeks more than our plan because we always planned to add a few more weeks over time to Never Ending Pasta Bowl. Now it is a 12-week promotion, so we're doing some things to kind of juice it up during the time. One of them is adding this new sauce, and we're adding the media to introduce the new sauce, which will coincide with last year's launch of Never Ending Pasta Bowl. That said, it probably will wear off a little bit towards the end when the last year's Never Ending Pasta Bowl is still going stronger. But we believe that Never Ending Pasta Bowl is better than not having Never Ending Pasta Bowl during that time right before the -- right before Thanksgiving. So we don't anticipate having every week that we run Never Ending Pasta Bowl this year being positive last year because probably towards the tail end of this year's Never Ending Pasta Bowl is going to still be running on a little bit of strength of last year's NEPB. And I'll let Raj talk about kind of the forward kind of compares. Raj Vennam : Yes. I think on the -- when you think about where we were last year, we started to see some softness as we got into the fall of last year, especially as we get into mid-to-late October, across all our brands. And in fact, last year, Never Ending Pasta Bowl preference went up significantly from the year before, and that probably helped that Never Ending Pasta Bowl hold up well. But outside of Olive Garden, we started to see other brands did see some softness as we get into October and then into November. So there is -- the compares actually get a little bit better, not significantly, though, but there was some softness last year. Operator : Our next question is coming from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : When you look at Olive Garden performance over the last couple of quarters, what really distinguishes in your mind kind of the better markets from the slower markets? Maybe even within those markets, what kind of distinguishes a better store than a store that's not as performing as well? I mean can we -- is it income driven? Is it demographics driven? Or are there may be certain areas of the country where you have a lot more incremental competition? Is there a way for us to kind of look below the averages and say, hey, here's kind of a class of underperforming stores? And more interestingly, do you have anything yourselves, any tools that you can do to pull some of the underperforming stores closer to average or above average? Rick Cardenas : Yes, John. I'll use Olive Garden as an example since it's a big part of our system. But let's just -- in geography, there are parts of the country that actually were softer than other parts of the country. So Florida, for example, saw Texas a little soft in the quarter. Florida, if you think about the travel component I mentioned, and if you listen to the theme parks and you listen to Disney and what happened in the summer, it was a slower summer. Texas, as I said, we had a lot of storms, got the hurricane hit in Houston. We have over 60 restaurants in Houston across all of Darden. That said, when you really look at performance across geography, the difference is the quality and commitment of the management team. And are they executing our standards the way we're supposed to execute our standards? I'll give you one, Olive Garden has been focusing on offering our guests a refill. We know that if you're offered to refill, whether or not you accept the refill, your value, your intent to return, everything else goes way up. If you're not, it doesn't. So that we know is one of the big drivers of Olive Garden performance. At LongHorn, if your steak is cooked correctly, and by the way, they do a great job in cooking the stakes correctly, if it's cooked correctly, your intent to return is huge. If it's not, it's a lot lower. So I will tell you that if the management team is trained and ready to go and the general manager or the managing partner is leading that team to our standards, they do really well. If they don't, then they don't. And so that we've got our directors of operations in those restaurants to help those managers. But we offer the same menu across all of our restaurants. We hire the same people across all of our restaurants. It's that management team that makes the difference. And we believe we have the best management teams in the industry and the best general managers in the business. So we're really confident that we continue to execute, we win. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jim Sanderson from North Coast Research. Jim Sanderson : I wanted to go back to the discussion on pricing. I think that you had taken down your create-your-own pasta promotion price point by about 4% over the summer. Just wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about how that worked out in the quarter and whether you expect to feature more discounted promotions going forward similar to what we saw over the summer. Rick Cardenas : Jim, if you think about create-your-own pasta, we had priced it up kind of late in the last fiscal year to, I think, a little bit over $13. And we thought, you know what, maybe we should have kept it at $12.99. So it's actually at $12.99 on our menu today. So it wasn't -- I don't think it was a 4% reduction. Maybe it was. But it went down maybe $0.40, $0.50, so probably so. But we still took our pricing across. And so we decided that Never Ending Pasta Bowl, which is a great value offer every day, probably it makes more sense at $12.99 than at $13.49. So we were able to move that price to other places. So when you think about what we're doing in the future with it, we believe it's going to stay around that price point. But we'll continue to refresh that offer and continue to provide reasons for guests to come and get -- create your own pasta at $12.99, which is not limited time, it's every day. But we'll also continue to talk about some of the great value we have on the rest of the menu and maybe some limited time offers to get people in, so they can see the great value on the rest of the menu. If there's any other things on pricing, Raj, did I miss anything on the price? Raj Vennam : I think you got it. Yes. Jim Sanderson : Just a quick follow-up. When you did normalize that price point back to $12.99, did you notice any consumer reaction good or bad? Rick Cardenas : Yes, we did. It performed better than it was doing at 13%-plus. Preference went up a little bit. And our performance in June was, I think, a little bit better than it was in May, at Olive Garden. Yes. Jim Sanderson : Understood. Last quick question. Can you give us an estimate of the dollar budget for G&A for the year given you had some exceptional expenses last year, for comparison purposes? Raj Vennam : Yes. I think we -- I think we said this in the initial guidance, it hasn't changed since then. We're probably looking at somewhere close to $450 million. With the first quarter being $125 million, you can expect the rest to be more in that $105 million to $110 million in any given quarter. Operator : Next question is coming from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Brian Vaccaro : Just 2 quick ones for me. On your existing off-premise business at Olive Garden, can you remind us what percent of that is small order takeout versus larger group or catering type orders? Rick Cardenas : Yes. It's about 80% small order and about 20% kind of catering set. Brian Vaccaro : Okay. Great. And just to clarify on your comments on Never Ending Pasta Bowl, Rick, did you say that the overall sales mix on NEP was up? Or was that trade-up adding on proteins that was up? I'm just curious, what percentage of your customers end up trading up and adding proteins versus staying at that starting price point? Rick Cardenas : Yes. I would say 2 things. One, the overall preference is up slightly for Never Ending Pasta Bowl. In some markets of the country, it's up a lot. But it's up slightly. But the trade-up is up more than our overall preference is up. And the trade-up is about 65% -- 60% to 65% of the people order the protein on top of the pasta, which is up versus last year. Operator : We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Courtney for any further or closing comments. Courtney Aquilla : That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we plan to release the second quarter results on Thursday, December 19, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
