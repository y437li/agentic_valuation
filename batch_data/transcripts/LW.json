Tom will then wrap up with our capital allocation priorities and our updated outlook for the year before opening it up for questions. Let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thanks, Dexter, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re excited to be here for first Lamb Weston earnings call as a standalone company. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m going to take a few minutes to provide some context on where we are and our expectations going forward. We\u2019ve made a tremendous amount progress in a short period of time to prepare for awhile as a standalone public company. As I stated at our Investor Day, Lamb Weston is well positioned in a category that is growing worldwide. We\u2019re in the process of adding capacity that will come online in the back half of calendar 2017, which is well ahead of recently announced capacity expansions in North America by our competitors. We expect this to provide us with the ability to gain share and support our customers' growth plans in the near term. Over the long-term, we believe we are well positioned to grow through our strong customer relationships with our domestic and international customers, our innovation capabilities and our global footprint. I am confident in our future and while we are in the early stages of our journey as an independent public company, we are on track on building new capabilities and our business is off to a great start to the first half of fiscal 2017. As you all know on November 9th, we are spun off from ConAgra Foods. Since then, we rounded out our senior management team with the addition Rob McNutt, as our Chief Financial Officer. I am looking forward to working with Rob. He has a tremendous background of executive leadership and I\u2019m confident, it will be a great addition to the Lamb Weston leadership team. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll be impressed with Rob, as you get to meet him over the coming months. I also want to thank John Gehring for serving as our Interim Chief Financial Officer. As you know, John postponed his retirement to guide us through a critical time of standalone activities. I thank John for his leadership over the past several months and his counsel throughout the spin of Lamb Weston. I wish him all the best in his retirement. Now, let\u2019s turn to our results by first putting them into context. As we discussed at our Investor Day in October, we\u2019ve been investing in our business over the past several years and those investments are driving growth. We are executing well across our business in this favorable operating environment. Our factories are running at a high level of capacity utilization. We continue to see strong demand in our North America business due to our customer mix and growth in our international business, and we expect our material costs to remain at or slightly below year ago levels for the balance of the year. Our focus on execution is also an important factor of driving our strong performance. We continue to execute against our product and customer mix initiatives to improve margins across the portfolio. We remain laser focused on driving supply chain efficiencies specifically in our manufacturing footprint to maximize our throughput and drive operating leverage. And where appropriate, we\u2019ve implemented pricing actions across our segments. Lamb Weston\u2019s employees in the Lamb Weston customer service is an important contributor to our success as we manage through this tight industry capacity environment. I want to thank our entire Lamb Weston organization for their tireless efforts and providing continued customer service excellence during the time of tight supply. This is a hallmark of our company and a true differentiator. We are committed to meet our customer\u2019s needs and deliver great products on time, every time. So let\u2019s take a look at the details for the quarter. Net sales were up 7% to over $790 million. Volume grew four points, which was better than expected. We expect our top line growth rate to moderate in the back half due to our capacity constraint and as we lap a strong performance in back half of last year. Our Global, Foodservice and Retail segments all posted mid-single digit volume gains. We continue to see strong demand in North America across our segment, and our international business continues to post volume improvements across many markets. Price and mix added three points reflecting the current favorable industry dynamics and execution focus that I described earlier. With our balanced sales growth profile and favorable cost environment, we delivered strong earnings growth. Adjusted EBITDA including the proportionate EBITDA from our unconsolidated joint ventures Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe and Lamb Weston/RDO in the U.S. increased 19% to nearly $170 million. Most of the benefits are positive price mix and volume growth flow to the bottom line as total manufacturing costs on a rate basis declined modestly, largely due to supply chain efficiencies and operating leverage. SG&A increased as we began to incur incremental cost associated with being a standalone company. A portion of the increase was also from higher incentive compensation accruals due to the overall business performance. Equity earnings declined due to our European joint venture, which is experiencing a significant increase in potato costs as a result of poor crop quality and reduce yields, which has driven overall raw cost higher. While the JV is taking actions to offset these higher costs, they're not fully expected to offset them in the near term. We expect the European joint ventures performance to be under pressure for the remainder of the fiscal year with the year-over-year impact more pronounced in the back half. Fortunately, as we demonstrated in the first half, we expect to more than offset this impact with strong performances in other parts of our business. So, now, let\u2019s take a look at the results for each of our business segments. First, our Global segment which comprises a little more than half of our total sales and includes our top 100 North American-based restaurant chain customers as well as our international business. Net sales for the segment were up 6% in the quarter largely due to volume growth. This is a reflection of our faster growing domestic chain customer mix as well as export growth. Improved price mix also contributed to sales growth and the segment benefited from supply chain operating leverage. All these factors contributed to a 17% increase in product contribution margin. And for clarity, product contribution margin is gross profit lift advertising and promotional expense. Our next segment is Foodservice, which comprises about a third of our total sales and serves North America Foodservice distributors and restaurants chains outside our top 100 restaurant customers. Net sales for Foodservice were up 11% with the balance contribution from price mix and volume. Price mix was up six points reflecting our products and customer mix initiatives as well as pricing actions across the segment. Volume was up five points with growth driven by small-and medium-sized chain as well as independent Foodservice distributors. Product contribution margin increased 39% reflecting favorable price mix, supply chain operating leverage and volume growth. Next is our Retail segment which represents about 12% of our sales and includes sales of Alexia license brand products as well as private label to grocery, mass merchant and club customers in North America. Net sales were up 5%. This was largely driven by volume growth of our license brands and private label. Price mix was also favorable. Product contribution margin increased 36% reflecting price mix, supply chain operating leverage, the timing of advertising expense and volume growth. So, as you can see, we delivered a strong quarter, and the management team is executing against our key strategies, we have committed significant capital investments that will position our business over the long-term. Our supply chain footprint, innovation capabilities and relentless focus on customer service give me great confidence in our ability to deliver long-term growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, let me turn it over to John for some additional details on the quarter. A - John Gehring : Thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. Over the next few minutes, I\u2019ll address the number of topics including the impact of the spin on our financial statements, a brief recap of our second quarter and year-to-date results including a review of the key drivers of our performance and our current debt profile and cash flow. Let\u2019s start with the spin, as Tom mentioned our spin-off from ConAgra was effective on November 9th, which is towards the end of our quarter. Accordingly, fiscal second quarter financial statements reflect results on a curved out basis prior to the completion of the spin, and on the standalone basis for the balance of the quarter. Since we do not apply purchasing accounting for the spin transaction, the changes to our financial results pre-and post-spin relate primarily to interest expense and selling, general and administrative expenses including the ramp up of cost to operate as a standalone company and certain transaction related cost. We have treated the transaction related cost as items impacting comparability. And on a pre-tax basis, we incurred about $9 million of these costs in the second quarter and $19 million in the first half. In addition, our balance sheet reflects the various debt and shareholders equity transactions necessary to affect the spin and to establish our new capital structure. We\u2019ve also recognized certain other assets and liabilities on our balance sheet in connection with the spin transaction. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our second quarter and first half results. As Tom described, we\u2019re pleased with our performance so far this year. We delivered strong net sales growth driven by both volume and price mix gains, and through the first half sales were up more than 5% with volume up three points and price mix up two. Gross profit was up 23% for the quarter and 25% in the first half. Raw material cost including potatoes were essentially flat allowing the benefits of favorable price mix, volume growth, supply chain productivity and operating leverage to flow through to gross profit. Adjusted operating income was up 23% for the quarter and 39% in the first half driven primarily by the increase in gross profit. Reported SG&A expense increased in the second fiscal quarter. While we have begun to incur some additional standalone costs, the increase this quarter is driven principally by cost related to the spin which we treat as comparability items and higher incentives based on the strong performance. As Tom mentioned earlier, equity method investment earnings were down largely related to significantly higher potato cost in our European joint venture. So putting it altogether, total adjusted EBITDA including the proportional EBITDA from our two unconsolidated joint ventures increased 19% in the quarter and 29% in the first half. Adjusted EPS growth was also strong, up 26% for the quarter and 32% in the first half driven by adjusted operating income growth. Interest expense was up reflecting the additional $2.4 billion of debt that we incurred as part of the spin. As the spin happened near the end of the quarter, the increase only reflects about three weeks of interest expense on this new debt. Income tax expense increased in the first half as a result of our higher earnings. For the first half, our effective tax rate was approximately 33% and for the second quarter, our effective tax rate was about 27% due to the impact of some favorable changes and estimates. Switching now to our balance sheet and cash flow, as I just mentioned in conjunction with the spin, we took on an additional $2.4 billion of debt which includes a $675 million five year floating rate term loan, $833 million of eight year senior notes with a 4.625% coupon, $833 million of 10 year senior notes with a 4.875% coupon. In addition, we entered into a $500 million floating rate revolving credit facility of which $80 million was outstanding and drawn at as of November 27th. All in our weighted average interest rate is currently a bit over 4%. From a leverage standpoint, we\u2019re comfortable with our current leverage and are making good progress towards our target range of 3.5 to 4 times adjusted EBITDA. With respect to cash flow, in the first half we\u2019ve generated about $162 million of cash from operations. A few items to note, first second quarter raw material inventory levels are typically at their peak for the year given the timing of the potato harvest in September and October. Second, we\u2019ve increased finished goods inventory levels due to some anticipated downtime related to several capital projects. Also, there were several year-over-year timing issues related to payables and compensation accruals. Overall, we\u2019re confident that our operating cash flows will remain strong especially in the back half as inventory levels come down. In addition, at about $300 million, our capital expenditures this fiscal year are high as we\u2019re investing in additional capacity at our Boardman, Oregon; and Richmond, Washington facilities. Together, these will add about \u00a3350 million of capacity by late calendar 2017. So, overall, we\u2019re off to a strong start is fiscal 2017, and we\u2019re well positioned to support future growth and value creation. With that, let me turn it now back over to Tom for some comments on our capital allocation priorities and our updated outlook. Tom? Tom Werner : Thanks, John. We believe our balance sheet and cash flow will support our balanced capital allocation policy based on returns and executed with discipline. As we outline in our Investor Day, our priorities are first, investment growth both organic and through M&A. Our current capacity expansion projects attached to our commitment to invest in and support growth. Second, we will return capital shareholders. Last month, we declared our first quarterly dividend of $18.75 per share or $0.75 on an annualized basis. And third, we will reduce debt to achieve our long-term leverage target of 3.5 to 4 times adjusted EBITDA given our high CapEx this year. We don\u2019t expect to pay down debt beyond what is required in the near-term. Now, with respect to our outlook, our performance in the quarter and year-to-date were better than expected due to all the operating factors mentioned. As a result, we are raising our outlook for the year while we delivered well above our centerline of profitability in the first half. We do expect our earnings growth to normalize in the back half of the year. And we\u2019ve taken a prudent view in our revised guidance. We now expect to net sales to grow in the mid-single digits, up from our initial estimate of low-single-digits. In addition, our full year basis, we expect sales growth to be relatively balance between price mix and volume, as we continue to stretch existing capacity to meet demand. For adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, we now expected to grow at a rate in the mid-teens, up from our previous estimate of high-single-digits. This reflects strong adjusted operating income growth driven by sales growth and supply chain operating leverage while our raw materials for the balance of the year will be essentially flat to a year ago levels. We do expect SG&A for the second half and full year to be higher as a result of higher incentive compensation costs and approximately 10 million to 15 million of incremental standalone costs. These are consistent with the estimates provided during our Investor Day. The increase in adjusted operating income is expected to be partially offset, but significantly lower contribution from our unconsolidated joint ventures. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of 220 to 228. This includes total interest expense of about $60 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 34%. So to wrap it up, we are off to a great start and we have tremendous momentum in the business. We are on track in our transition activities and the organization is doing a terrific job executing against our initiatives. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston. And, we are now happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Two questions for you, if I could. I guess first with sweet expectations, I think clearly where you\u2019re looking for some upside to full year EBITDA estimates. Just I\u2019m curious how fiscal 2Q came in really well for your internal expectations? And really what primarily drill that delta, just one thing stood out more than some of the operating factors that you mentioned? And then, I've got a follow-up. Tom Werner : Sure, Andrew. This is Tom Werner. I would say, internally, the biggest drivers on Q2, is our volume performance across all of our segments came in better than expected. So that was obviously a big contributor. I would say another contributor as we had strong price mix, which was also better than we expected, specifically across our Foodservice segment. So, those two things coupled with, our plants are running well, really well right now, as we start processing the new crops. So, essentially, we had three areas that were better than expected and that really what drove the over performance in Q2. Andrew Lazar : Thanks for that. And then to good lead into the question on Foodservice. If we think about the year-over-year improvement in gross margin, we try and parse out a couple other key factors. I guess how much of a factor was the faster growth that you saw in the Foodservice segment, which clearly has much higher margins versus maybe some of the other drivers such as supply chain and things of that nature? Tom Werner : I would say, Andrew, we have couple of initiatives in the organization. We are laser focused on our product mix, and some of our lower end products getting them out of a system at this point. So, we\u2019ve been really focused on the product mix. Obviously, there is some customer mix that plays into that well, and we are also driving our Lamb Weston brand in that space too. So, that\u2019s certainly has driven to some of the performance in that segment in the quarter. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Grow : I had two questions for you as well. A bit of a follow-up on the previous -- on Andrew\u2019s previous question, as you\u2019re looking at the mix improvement, I guess I\u2019m curious in how you\u2019re achieving that as it opposed to just new product innovation? And then as a possible thing on how much mix benefitted the sales overall, then particularly I am looking at the Global division? And how mix may have helped there in that division? Tom Werner : Yes, I think, again, within that segment, we continued to be focused on both our customer product mix. There is some innovation that we're driving, but it's largely our pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken along with our customer product mix initiatives that we\u2019ve been driving in that segment. Chris Grow : Can you say how much mix benefitted the sales overall in divisions of -- and I should say that -- so the overall company is it possible to peace that out? John Gehring : This is John, Chris. We really don\u2019t peace that out, and we don\u2019t -- into the extent, we have any details on that we are just -- we are not positioned to share them. Chris Grow : Okay. And then I have just another question on the Global division. If you were to look at the just the breakdown of revenue growth between North American and international, I'm just trying to understanding of how much of that growth has been driven by international and how much is coming from North America and [Indiscernible]? Tom Werner : It\u2019s really pretty balanced across both segments. So, there is not one -- one market area that\u2019s out lane another, I would its balanced then both are doing well. So, as you -- as we look at -- as we look at North America and the international segment, things are balanced right now. Chris Grow : Okay. That was seeing contrary to some of the QSR sales has been a little softer overall. I guess you\u2019re seeing better growth there that means you\u2019re likely taking market share that would look at that or? Tom Werner : No, I would point you towards as we look at it. We have a great customer mix in our portfolio. So, we work at that extremely hard to be positioned with the growing customers to the marketplace. We\u2019ve done a great job over that, over the past years. So, it\u2019s really attributed to our customer mix in North America. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : I wanted to ask about the tight industry capacity that you\u2019ve talked about. So, in relation to that, what we\u2019re hearing in the market place that there is double digit price increases that are being realized by your competitors. So, how do I put that into context with sort of the price mix that you\u2019re reporting which is high-single digit? And then, I was really surprise and it\u2019s a positive surprise that you\u2019re able to produce 4% more volume, it\u2019s from what I understand your plans and the industry\u2019s plans in general already operating at a 100% capacity. So, can you just help me that those two issues? Tom Werner : Sure, Akshay. I would say first of all we are squarely focused on our pricing and mix initiatives as I stated earlier. So, we\u2019re happy with the progress we are making within our own portfolio. So that\u2019s number one. I would say number two, I would go back to the comment our factories are running really efficient right now. So, we are gaining a lot of throughput everything is hitting on all positive stones and the factories. That said, they are running at levels that are not sustainable, and we expect that we\u2019re going adjust that in the back half, we\u2019ve got some capital things that are coming out that we plan for. So, it\u2019s really a function of throughput efficiency right now and the plans and how they\u2019re operating and the supply chain organization is doing a fantastic job getting that throughput to meet demand that we\u2019re continued to see in our business. Akshay Jagdale : Okay, and then on the raw potato costs. First, I\u2019m under the impression that none of the new crop potatoes really sloped to you cost this quarter. But, from what we understand the cost of production for potatoes this crop season is down double digits. So, when you say you\u2019re raw material costs are going to be flattish for the year. Can you help me square that with the industry data points which are pointing to significant decreases year-over-year in the new crop potatoes? Tom Werner : Sure, Akshay. I\u2019m not -- sure what data sources you\u2019re looking at for starters, but I will say that as I\u2019ve stated through our Investor Day, we contract a lot of our supply needs prior to our fiscal year. So, we have a high level of contracted potatoes which translate into contracted cost base for us. There is variability in our portfolio from a raw standpoint as it relates to overall crop yield and quality as we go through the growing season in the harvest. But, as we take a look at the back half of the year, we\u2019re seeing a pretty known cost, and we think things are going to be relatively flat to the prior year. So, we feel comfortable with where our cost basis is. Akshay Jagdale : And just one last one, this is more of a longer term question. But some of your competitors have recently announced some capacity expansion plans. Obviously, you are talking about capacity being tight right now. Can you give us your perspective, I mean, the expansion plans that have been announced are two years down the road, but they seemed to be pretty unprecedented in terms of the absolute role that\u2019s being announced. So, can you give us your general perspective and so what these expansion plans might do to supply demand balance, couple of years down the road? Tom Werner : Sure, Akshay. I think first of all as we have anticipated this Global expansion in added capacity several years ago and as everybody knows, we\u2019re in the process right now of adding additional capacity that will be online in the back half of 2017. Second, I believe the category growth projection. We talk about at investor day have not changed, and there is going to be a need to add capacity in addition to our capacity. Our competitors have announced that. We believe that demand is still going to outpace supply over the long-term. There may be some mismatches at times because of timing of the capacity add and the demand. But we\u2019re confident in our overall view of the category going forward, and we feel we\u2019re positioned right now in the near-term in the next couple of years, as you stated that as our capacity comes online ahead of our competitors and will make in these investments to meet our customer needs. And we\u2019ve been highly committed to that over the last couple of years, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. But we think long-term the demand is going to continue to outpace supply, we feel good about how we\u2019re positioned going forward. Operator : Our final question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger : Just two from me and I apologize, but I am going to go back to price mix again just given the positive surprise there year-to-date. You\u2019ve talked in the past about the Company\u2019s ability to price through inflation when necessary in your conference there, but in historical context when you look back to the data that\u2019s available, your ability to realize pricing in a flat cost environment seems like a newer driver of the Company\u2019s earnings growth. So, I guess just to elaborate on that, is the industry just capacity constrained enough at the risk of pricing concessions coming back into play is really limited for the time being? And if that\u2019s the case, what\u2019s the risk of pricing normalizing of it when we look out a year or two as that capacity does come online? Tom Werner : Yes, Matt, you're saying there is certainly the operating environment we\u2019re in with the capacity is driving us to evaluate our customer mix and our product mix, and certainly we\u2019ve taken pricing actions across the portfolio. It is a dynamic, and I would say we\u2019re confident that we have the ability to carry that, those actions forward. I would say, as capacity comes online specifically ours in the next year from now, we\u2019re going to have opportunities to gain additional volume. It may be as some different margin levels, but will evaluate that as we go forward. Matthew Grainger : Okay, thanks Tom. And then just on the full year outlook, you see very strong start to the year 30% EBITDA growth and you're looking from \u201918 for the full year. As we think about, I guess one as we think about the sustainability of the progress you\u2019ve been this year and your ability to continue growing EBITDA high-single digits of higher based. Are there any other factors that we should be thinking about looking ahead to fiscal 2018 beyond the incremental corporate costs, that you would going back to your Q1 commentary characterizes maybe being non-recurring in terms of the benefits that they\u2019ve provided to EBITDA this year? And the second piece just on the tax rate. What\u2019s driving the step-up in the second half? Tom Werner : Yes, I would say in terms of FY18, we\u2019ll provide that guidance as we close out \u201917 in Q4. So, I\u2019m not going to get into any outlook there. And as far as the tax rate, I\u2019ll go with the John. John Gehring : Yes. On the tax rate, I would emphasize the first half tax rate was around 33%. That\u2019s pretty close to the range we called for the year of 34%. So, we\u2019ve seen maybe a little bit of pressure above 34% in the back half, but it's we expect to be in the range. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thank you for joining us for our second quarter call. If you\u2019ve any follow-up questions, I can be reached via email or via phone at any time over the next few days. And we look forward to your continued interest in the Company. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s third quarter 2017 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release which is available on our website lambweston.com. Please note, that during our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. In addition, some of today\u2019s prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the operating environment and our overall performance, and then hand it over to Rob to provide the details on our third quarter and year-to-date results as well as on our debt and cash flow. Tom will then highlight our capital allocation priorities and provide some comments on our fiscal 2017 outlook before opening up the call for questions. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Werner : Thanks, Dexter, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining Lamb Weston\u2019s Q3 earnings call today. Let me start by saying that we are pleased with our third quarter results and we remain on track to deliver on our full-year targets. The operating environment in the quarter was largely a continuation of what we\u2019ve been experiencing over the recent past with overall solid demand for our frozen potato products across our customer base in both domestic and export markets, high levels of capacity utilization across the industry and modest cost inflation in our manufacturing base in North America. In this environment, we've continued to execute well across our organization with very close coordination between our supply chain and our commercial teams to ensure we provided our customers the products they need on time. In the third quarter, as we have over the past year, we continue to operate our manufacturing plants at a very high utilization rate and our overall capacity across the industry has remained tight. In the quarter, we also overcame the impact of some difficult winter weather in the Pacific Northwest where our factories and some of our finished good warehouses are located. While we did experience some challenges, I want to thank our supply chain team for minimizing the impact on our customers. This tight capacity environment has influenced our approach to the marketplace. Our commercial teams have done a great job taking actions to improve both product, and customer mix, as well as continued execution of the pricing actions we have taken earlier this year. This along with modest volume gains drove our topline and profit growth in the quarter. Specifically while volumes grew just under 1% in the quarter, net sales were up 5% due to a higher price mix while gross profit was up 14%. As you know, we've been running at full capacity this year and accordingly we will have little incremental capacity to drive volume growth as we begin to lap some strong volume growth quarters in the near-term. I am pleased to report that all of our capacity expansion programs remain on track. As we strategically continue to invest in our business to meet the growing demand of our customers. First, our 50 million pound chopped and formed production line in Boardman, Oregon recently began operational startup. Second, we are on target to have our 300 million pound French fry line in Richland, Washington operational by late calendar 2017. As an aside after recently visiting the new fry line facility, I can say that we are making great progress and there is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm at the factory and across the organization with both expansions and our continued investment for growth in Lamb Weston. Third, in Europe our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture new fry line in Bergen op Zoom in the Netherlands became operational in November. And finally, the joint ventures investment in a new factory in Russia remains on schedule to open in early 2018. In addition to the contributions of our supply chain and commercial teams, our corporate and functional teams are making good progress against our post-spin Transition Services Agreements and we are on track to be off these agreements as initially scheduled. The Lamb Weston team is in place and I'm confident in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead in this category that's growing globally to operate with excellence and to create value for all our stakeholders. With this solid foundation built across our supply chain commercial and support teams, we are well positioned to continue to grow by building on our strong relationships with our customers, our capacity investments, our innovation capabilities and our global footprint. Now let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our results. Robert McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me first say how excited I am about this opportunity to be a member in Lamb Weston team. In my short time here, I've been impressed with my colleagues' depth of knowledge of the industry and their passion for the Company. I'm excited about building our future together. As Tom noted, we're pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. Net sales were $769 million for the quarter up 5% and in line with our single-digit growth target for the year. Price mix drove most of the growth contributing four of the five points and reflecting the current favorable industry environment. This is in line with our expectation that price mix would accelerate a bit from the 2% growth we posted in the first half as we continue to realize the impact of pricing actions taken earlier this year, along with continued improvement in customer and product mix. Volume grew 1%, again this is consistent with our expectation that volume growth would moderate from the 3% that we saw on the first half as we took some production line to down for routine maintenance. Through the first nine months sales increased 5%, which was a good balance of price mix up 3% and volume up 2%. With respect to earnings, as Tom mentioned, gross profit was up 14% for the quarter and gross margin expanded by 200 basis points to nearly 27%. Similar to what we saw in the first half, the benefits of positive price mix flow through to the bottom line. While potato costs on a per pound basis were essentially flat, other manufacturing costs on a per pound basis increased in the low single-digits. This was largely due to higher edible oil and transportation costs. We anticipate this inflation trend to continue and expand a bit in the fourth quarter as costs continue to gradually climb. Year-to-date gross profit was up 21% from the prior year and gross margin was about 25%, up more than 300 basis points. This improvement was largely driven by favorable price mix, volume growth and supply chain productivity. Given the limited availability of our historical quarterly data on a standalone basis, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the seasonality of our raw product cost and its impact on gross margin. Our third quarter is typically our highest gross margin for the year. We typically harvest potatoes in the Pacific Northwest in August through October, which is primarily in our second quarter. During this period, we\u2019re able to take just harvested potatoes directly from the field to be processed immediately in our manufacturing facilities. As a result, costs incurred are generally lower for two reasons. First, direct from field potatoes generally processed better through our production lines as they are the best quality they'll be all year. Said another way, our recovery and production rates are typically higher with direct from the field potatoes than those that have been held in storage for a while. The second reason is that since potatoes processed right out of the field are not transported and then held in inventory, they are not subject to storage or secondary transport costs. We typically hold about 60 days of finished goods inventory and cost on a first in, first out basis for the relatively favorable costs incurred from the Q2 harvest going directly into the operations really flow to the income statement in Q3. So Q3 tends to have the lowest cost of goods sold seasonally and therefore the highest gross margins. From there all other things being equal cost of goods sold begins to increase as we add storage and transportation costs into the raw inventory valuation and as the aging of the crop in storage results in lower recovery rates over the storage period. So based on these factors, we expect our fourth quarter margin to be down sequentially from Q3, although we do anticipate it to expand on a year-over-year basis based on the higher price mix. So just to finish off the seasonality discussion, our first quarter gross margin is typically the lowest of the year, while our second quarter margin is typically between our first and fourth quarter levels. Going further down the P&L, operating income was up 17% for the quarter and 30% year-to-date. This was driven by the increase in gross profit. As expected, reported SG&A expense increased in the third quarter as we continued to build capabilities to operate as a standalone public company. SG&A also included about $5 million of cost related to the spin as well as higher incentive compensation costs resulting from our strong year-to-date operating performance. For the fourth quarter, we see SG&A excluding the spin related cost growing sequentially as we continued to build our standalone company infrastructure. We still look to end up with an additional $10 million to $15 million of standalone costs for all of fiscal 2017. Also as expected, equity earnings declined $23 million. This was largely related to an $18 million non-cash gain related to the settlement of a Lamb Weston/Meijer pension plan in Q3 of 2016 as well as impact of higher potato costs in Europe this year. As we noted last quarter while the JV is taking actions to offset the higher potato costs, we continue to anticipate its results to be pressured in our fourth quarter. So putting it all together, total adjusted EBITDA including the proportional EBITDA from our two unconsolidated joint ventures increased 11% in the quarter to $191 million, year-to-date it's up 22% to $531 million. Turning to earnings per share, adjusted diluted EPS declined 5% to $0.59 in the quarter. This was primarily a result of the incremental $25 million of interest expense from debt incurred in connection with the spin-off from ConAgra. We will continue to have this year-over-year headwind in the fourth quarter and through the first half of fiscal 2018. Adjusted EPS was up 17% year-to-date driven by adjusted operating income growth. Income tax expense increased in the first nine months as a result of our higher earnings. Our effective tax rate for both third quarter and the first nine months was about 33%. Let's take a quick look at the results for our business segments. Net sales for our Global segment were up 3% in the quarter. It was fairly balanced between price mix and volume growth. Price mix was up 2% reflecting improvement in our customer and product mix as well as price increases. Volume increased 1% driven by growth in both domestic and international markets. Product contribution margin which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense increased 9% largely due to the flow through of price mix to the bottom line. Our Foodservice segments net sales increased 10% reflecting pricing actions as well as improvement in customer and product mix. Volume increased modestly. Product contribution margin increased 30%, again reflecting the flow through of favorable price mix. Our Retail segments net sales were up 1% driven by volume growth of our licensed brands and private label products. Price mix was essentially flat. Product contribution margin was also flat with higher gross profit offset by increased advertising spending. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, total debt at the end of the third quarter was a little more than $2.5 billion. From a leverage standpoint at about 3.9 times the latest 12 months of adjusted EBITDA, we are within our target range of 3.5 to 4 times. With respect to cash flow, year-to-date we've generated more than $250 million of cash from operations. You can see on our balance sheet, our operating working capital defined as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable was about 17% of sales at the end of the quarter, primarily due to seasonality as we carry a high amount of raw potato inventory. In addition, our finished goods inventories were higher than this time last year to support the increased sales volumes, as well as to provide a buffer around planned maintenance downtimes for some production lines. Our finished goods level should normalize as we progress through the year. With respect to capital expenditures, we've invested more than $200 million year-to-date. This is an elevated level in support of the capacity expansion efforts that Tom described earlier. We continue to target about $300 million for this fiscal year. The balance of the cash went to debt service and to pay a dividend to our shareholders. Now let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas Werner : Thanks Rob. I wanted to touch briefly on our capital priorities and then our outlook for the balance of the year. As we've stated previously, we believe our balance sheet and cash flow will support a balanced capital allocation policy based on returns and executed with discipline. Our priorities remain, first, to invest in growth both organic and through M&A and as you can see our current capacity expansion projects attest to our commitment to invest in and support growth. Second, we\u2019ll continue to support our dividend, we currently pay a $0.75 dividend on an annualized basis. And third, given that we are making good progress towards the low end of our leverage target through EBITDA growth as well as our elevated CapEx need this year, we don't anticipate paying down debt beyond what is required in the near-term. We will evaluate alternative uses of excess cash as we continue to grow and return to more normalized CapEx level and will provide more thoughts on this down the road. Finally, turning to your outlook, with our solid third quarter results, we are on track to deliver the targets that we provided on our last earnings call. We continue to expect net sales to grow mid single-digits with a good balance between price mix and volume for the year. We also continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures to increase at a mid-teens rate. This reflects strong adjusted operating income growth partially offset by a lower contribution from our unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we continue to see total interest expense of about $60 million including a significant year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter. For adjusted diluted EPS, we continue to expect it to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.28 per share. As so you can see we delivered a strong third quarter and year-to-date results. The Lamb Weston team is executing with excellence in a favorable operating environment and we remain on track to deliver on our full-year commitments. We are taking the appropriate actions to drive sales growth, improve mix and expand margins in the near-term, while continuing to invest and strengthen our capabilities to support our growth and our advantage cost position over the long-term. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston and now we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Thomas Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi, two questions from me, if I could. I guess, first, the full-year guidance based on what you've delivered in EBITDA thus far I guess would suggest lower EBITDA year-over-year in the fiscal fourth quarter. I know you touched on maybe a few of the reasons that you would expect that, but maybe you can get into some of those \u2013 if nothing else, help us bridge sort of that year-over-year fourth-quarter EBITDA a little bit because it seems perhaps still a little bit conservative based on how things have been coming in and then I've just got a follow-up. Thomas Werner : Sure. Andrew, this is Tom. In Q4, we're expecting to see year-over-year gross profit growth and gross margin expansion and solid year-over-year sales growth. I would say we are seeing a bit of inflation in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll have increased SG&A. We\u2019re going to have a full quarter of interest expense that\u2019s certainly impacting the quarter, I would say the business fundamentals remain strong. As they have we expect a continuation of some good pricing in the quarter, but we do \u2013 so our year-over-year will be \u2013 in the quarter we\u2019ll see growth both top and bottom line. Andrew Lazar : Okay. And then as you talked about, you've got some new capacity coming online in the next few quarters. And obviously, this is not filled, if you will, day one, but trying to get a sense of how we should think about the ramp and maybe when volume can start to accelerate a bit due to that capacity, and when volume does ramp, how does that typically play out in terms of pricing and when that could potentially decelerate a bit, although maybe still positive just given the overall tight industry supply/demand dynamic? Thomas Werner : Sure, Andrew, I just to reset our expansion on the big fry line is set to come online towards the end of this calendar year. Obviously there's always a startup curve when you're turning on a new production line and so our anticipation is as we ramp up and become operational, we'll have volume opportunities slanted towards the back half of our fiscal 2018. And certainly Andrew as we think about selling out the line, I fully expect the incremental volume depending upon what segment we sell that production line to be at current gross margins and/or better and we're certainly going to look at opportunities to improve our customer mix and our product mix as we start running that line here at the end of the calendar year. Andrew Lazar : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Good morning and congrats on a solid quarter. I have two questions. The first one is, obviously a lot of your business is contracted and I know you don't want to get into specifics of any of that. So at a very high level, it would be great if you can help us understand what percent roughly of your total volumes have already renewed to reflect the pricing actions that you took in 2016? So I believe there were some pricing actions in May and then in November that we are aware of that happened in 2016. So what percent roughly of your volumes are actually reflecting that and do you expect additional pricing actions in calendar 2017? So that's my first question. I just have a follow-up. Thomas Werner : Sure. Akshay, this is Tom. I would say I'm not going to get into the specifics on our volume and percent. I will tell you the pricing actions we've executed this past year, we're seeing flow through the P&L obviously and the other thing is like I previously stated, we contract with our customers every year. There's a lot of variability in terms of timing. And so I will tell you that the teams are doing a great job, managing all the dynamics within our customer and what's going on in the industry. So that typically as we do every year, we work through the process and the timing of that and we've got a great plan to execute against our pricing actions. Akshay Jagdale : So just is a \u2013 not a 100% of your volumes have reflected the price increase? Is that a fair assumption? Thomas Werner : Yes, Akshay that\u2019s a fair assumption. Akshay Jagdale : Okay. And then just regarding margins, obviously 3Q is typically seasonally your best margin. So there might be a fear that this might be peak margin. So my second question is really about long-term sort of margins peaking from where they are in this quarter? So you've talked about incremental gross margins being higher for the new capacity that comes online, et cetera. We heard recently that the Cavendish plant, your competitor has now been delayed by a year. Is it your expectation that this favorable environment as it relates to tight capacity, is going to continue and for how long? And then these conversion costs, non-potato conversion costs, that have gone up pretty significantly recently, how long do you expect that to last? Thank you. Thomas Werner : Sure, Akshay I\u2019ll try and answer all your questions there. Yes, I do expect this environment to continue; certainly we've anticipated the tightness in the industry and have invested in our business ahead of our competition. I would say in terms of continued margin expansion, we are working extremely hard on evaluating our product mix and our customer mix and looking for opportunities to execute in those two areas to continue to drive our margin expansion. Like I said earlier, we expect continued year-over-year margin expansion for the balance of this year and we're always going to look at opportunities to drive more profitable growth in the business. In terms of our competitions announcement of capacity, we certainly have an eye and an ear on what's happening with our competition. We can't control what they're doing and the team, the management team we\u2019re focused on executing our business priorities and as we have opportunities in the marketplace we're going to pursue them. Akshay Jagdale : Thank you. Thomas Werner : The non-potato stuff. Robert McNutt : Akshay, this is Rob. The other question you asked was inflation on non-potato conversion cost. What we\u2019ve seen is kind of low single-digit in bits and pieces there and as you see the economy generally starting to tighten up, you see it in things like freight up a bit; packaging, if you look at the forecast there are up a bit. And so, again, we're looking at low single-digit kind of inflation where things have been flat in more recent quarters. Akshay Jagdale : Thanks. Operator : Moving on we'll hear next from Matt Grainger from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions. I have two as well. The first is just on the global business, I'm just curious if you could give us a sense for what you are seeing in terms of demand on the international portion of the business? I know you said you were seeing growth both domestic and international, but just how that is skewing geographically, whether you are seeing any volatility in places like China or the Middle East that in any way would change your expectations for international growth over the next few years. Thomas Werner : Sure. Matt, I will tell you, as we have seen in our \u2013 I\u2019ll just characterize it, Asia markets; we've seen pretty solid growth throughout the whole year and even in the quarter. So I feel really comfortable about the opportunities in Asia markets, they've been growing at a pretty good rate over the past four years or five years as I communicated I think on Investor Day. So we\u2019ve a continuation of that growth and I expect that to continue going forward. Matthew Grainger : Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then the other question I had is just on the foodservice segment. In the quarter here, this is not necessarily different from what we've seen over the past few quarters, but you had 10% price mix, 30% growth in divisional operating income, very strong. Could you comment more broadly I guess on how that level of growth compares to the profitability across the value chain during the past several quarters, whether you are the kind of the principal beneficiary of this capacity-constrained environment, or is there evidence that that's also flowing through in a way that's benefiting your major foodservice customers and distributors as well? Thomas Werner : Well Matt, I think we're seeing a full effect in that segment of all the actions we've taken over the past 10 months now I'd say. So I think it is a condition of the industry and what's happening right now, but we certainly are benefiting from it, there's no question about it. And we're being prudent and some of that we are focusing on mix and customer mix as well. So pricing is a big element of it, but the industry in general is benefiting from it as well. Matthew Grainger : Okay. And just a quick follow-up. So it is probably fair to assume that when we are trying to wrap our heads around that 10% price mix that the mix contribution you are seeing in the foodservice business is going to be more pronounced than anywhere else in the business at the moment? Robert McNutt : No, I wouldn't necessarily come to that conclusion. Matthew Grainger : Okay. You don't have to elaborate too much further if you don't want to do; that's fine. Just curious. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel. Christopher Growe : Hi, good morning. Thomas Werner : Good morning. Christopher Growe : Hi. I just had two questions for you as well. I wanted to ask first of all, I think in last quarter and this quarter as well, you talked about finished goods inventory building. It sounds like that starts to come down in the fourth quarter. Does that implicitly just create more capacity for you if you look at it that way? And maybe related to that, you talked also about building inventory around some manufacturing downtime. Did that occur already or is that still to occur and is that a factor that we should include or incorporate around your volume growth in the fourth quarter? Robert McNutt : Okay. Thanks Chris, this is Rob. In terms of building inventory, we are going to take some normal maintenance downtime as we do really every year later in our crop year and so some of that\u2019s to come and so some of that will be replacing that kind of inventory or that downtime and so not necessarily incremental sales growth off of that as much. The other piece is we\u2019re building some inventory related to some capital downtime that will have later in the year. Christopher Growe : Okay. Robert McNutt : You'll see that in the finished goods inventory number in the queue, when you see the detail of it. Christopher Growe : Okay. Got you and then I just had a question in relation to SG&A, which was up less than I expected in the quarter. I know you've got the public company costs you've got incentive comp up. What are the other factors that are offsetting that I guess you talk about some efficiencies for example. Can you quantify any of that or maybe the degree to which those other costs were up in the quarter in SG&A? Robert McNutt : Yes, just in terms of SG&A, Q2 to Q3, I think you're looking at sequentially and recognizing Q2. We took a bit of a catch up adjustment on incentive comp. So it really included Q1 and Q2 catch up on the incentive comp as we had better insight and how the year was going to turnout and so not as much of the incentive comp flowing through in Q3. That's one component of it. The other significant component that\u2019s down a little bit sequentially is A&P down a couple of million dollars it's really more just timing issues than anything else we still see that blown out for the year. Key point is that year-over-year standalone costs increase is still in that $10 million to $15 million range and we're still have line of sight consistent with what the company communicated Investor Day in terms of SG&A. Christopher Growe : Are you at the full run rate of those public company costs yet, or is that still to happen? Robert McNutt : We're not quite there yet, but we're getting a lot closer and really we anticipate by year-end will be pretty much there although probably not fully reflected in Q4. Christopher Growe : Okay, thanks for your time. Robert McNutt : Thanks, Chris. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take a question next from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thomas Werner : Good morning, Adam. Robert McNutt : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Maybe a question on potato costs. We've seen some reports that potato contracting for the 2017 crop is actually down slightly year-on-year. That's probably a base pricing number and there's adjustments that come with that, not to mention kind of changes in potential crop quality or size? Can you talk about expectations on potato costs as you look later into calendar 2017 and into 2018 and if that outlook has gotten more or less constructive in year-end? And maybe a corollary to that is how should we think about the flow through of what has been fairly healthy price realizations on the processing end back upstream to the farm level and how you can get commodity cost deflation on potatoes in an environment where you are actually realizing very healthy net pricing? Thomas Werner : Sure, Adam. I\u2019ll tell you we are right smack in the middle of our potato contracting negotiations and I'm not going to get into where all that is played out because we have not completed it across our growing networks. So as we do every year once we have all of our grower contracts negotiating and pricing across our growing areas locked down, we step back and assess the impact of that from a cost perspective and that is one component of it and it's a big component of our overall cost structure. But as Rob alluded to, we have a number of different other inputs that we're seeing inflation year-over-year and as we put all the pieces together over the balance of the next coming months, I will step back, take a look and take the appropriate action that we need to do to that continue to drive our business. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe on the foodservice component, thinking about the new capacity that comes on late in calendar 2017, can you elaborate a little bit on how the ramp of that capacity comes on-stream, if you think - how long you think it will take to actually run that plant full and fill it up and along with that, the mix today of your business in foodservice that you would call the branded Lamb Weston product versus private label and if that mix has shifted in a meaningful way in the last 12 months? Thomas Werner : Sure. Again our capacity be online at the end of the calendar year, there is a certain startup timeframe and it does take some time to fill that capacity up. So it will ramp up over the balance of the back half of next fiscal year. And as I stated earlier, we are going to look at the best opportunities in terms of meeting our customer demands. We've got some international growth coming that we still see happening. So it really depends on the opportunities to fill that line up, but it is a process and it does take some time to ramp that capacity up. The other thing, your other question in terms of\u2026 Robert McNutt : Branded versus private label. Thomas Werner : Yes. We haven't seen a significant change in food service in terms of our Lamb Weston brands versus private label from a percentage standpoint has been pretty flattish. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's very helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : And next we'll hear from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning everyone. Robert McNutt : Good morning. Thomas Werner : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Just two questions from me. First one, I guess appreciate the comments you made about capital allocation earlier. Can you give us a sense, once this production capacity comes online, maybe just update us on your thinking about either adding more capacity or making acquisitions to take on capacity? Has anything changed in the industry since you went public, which might affect the way you're thinking about that portion of capital allocation over the next couple years? And underneath that, really just trying to understand when we get to the point where we can start to see maybe some increase in free cash flow. Thomas Werner : Sure. Bryan, I would tell you generally how I'm thinking about the industry and capital, it has not changed in my mind. There's certainly been some competitive announcements that we're keeping a close eye on, but as we get to a what I'll call a more normalized capital expenditure level, we will continue \u2013 we will evaluate our cash and determine what's in the best interest to return that to the shareholders going forward, but that will be happening over the coming months as we work through some of our strategic initiatives. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thank you. And then just one last one from me, with the industry capacity being as tight as it is, I guess it implies for your customers, right, so for the end markets, is there anything they are doing differently? Are they raising prices on their menus or on French fries in general? Just anything they are doing differently given the supply constraints? Thomas Werner : Sure. Bryan, I'll tell you in generally if you look at the foods, the restaurant industry, there is an increase in menu costs. So there's no question about it based on the data that we analyze. I don't know specifically from customer-to-customer what their actions are, but overall you can see it in the industry data that there is inflation in the restaurant industry. Bryan Spillane : So I guess it kind of goes back to I think it was Matt Granger's question earlier, is you're kind of seeing \u2013 the inflation is kind of going through the system if you will? Thomas Werner : Yes, you certainly can see it in the data that we look at. Bryan Spillane : Okay, great. All right, thanks, guys. Operator : And we have time for one more question that will come from Carla Camellia from JPMorgan. Carla Casella : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On CapEx, can you give us any sense for next year front-end versus back-end-loaded and where is maintenance CapEx when you finish your projects; where could it come back down to and when could we see that? Robert McNutt : Yes. Carla, this is Rob. We will have some carryover from the Richland project in the next year and it's going to be fairly front-end loaded. I think at Investor Day, the Company talked about $150 million to $200 million range for next year and we're still within that range maybe in the middle of that range frankly as we refine it. In terms of maintenance levels of CapEx kind of the steady state CapEx for the investor base that we've got today is in the $100 million, $110 million range. Carla Casella : Great, thank you. That\u2019s all I had. End of Q& A Operator : And that concludes our Q&A session today. Gentlemen, I'll turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the call today. I am happy to take any questions pop me in the email within schedule or some time if you have any follow-up otherwise for \u2013 see many of you in New York and Boston next week. Thanks again. Operator : And that does conclude our conference today. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Tom will then highlight our capital allocation priorities before opening up the call for questions. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Fiscal 2017 was a transformational year for Lamb Weston. As everyone knows, a little over eight months ago we became a standalone public company. The separation required an incredible amount of work and effort of our employees across our great company.  We have built a talented executive team and have added many talented employees that have been instrumental in getting Lamb Weston to this point in our journey. I want to acknowledge and thank all the team members for their dedication and tireless effort to set Lamb Weston up with a solid foundation for a tremendous future as an independent company.  We have a lot of work to do to complete the separation but we are well on track. I am proud that our organization has been laser focused on executing with our customers and supporting their growth agendas. And that we have remained focused while supporting the countless activities surrounding a spin transaction.  Our ability to execute our business at the level we have during a time of significant transition reflects the dedication and commitment of the entire Lamb Weston organization to all of our stakeholders. Now let me comment on fiscal 2017. We executed our business with excellence during the course of fiscal 2017 by focusing on delivering the right product at the right time, every time. The business environment and our operating fundamentals were favorable throughout the entire year. Our efforts to improve product and customer mix, as well as pricing execution across all our segments increased the profitability of our company.  We are entering fiscal 2018 with momentum. But let me first give you some specific highlights on 2017. Sales increased 6% with a good balance of price mix and volume growth. Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures increased 19% to $707 million. We generated about $450 million of cash flow from operations.  We reinvested nearly $290 million of that cash flow into capital expenditures to support future growth. We made good progress in reducing our leverage to about 3.7 times adjusted EBITDA well within our target range of 3.5 to 4 times. And in the eight months, since the spin in November, we returned a little over $54 million to our shareholders and just last week declared another regular quarterly dividend of $0.1875 per share.  Our commercial and supply chain teams have done a great job remaining focused on supporting our customers. This dedication to serving our customers and their priorities is truly what differentiates Lamb Weston in this competitive marketplace. For Lamb Weston, serving our customers also means partnering closely with them to understand and support their longer-term growth ambitions both in North America and internationally. Our investments to expand capacity are one way we back that commitment. In fiscal 2017, we completed two state-of-the-art production lines which added more than 300 million pounds of capacity. In November, our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture started up its more than 250 million pound French fry line at Bergen I Zoom in the Netherlands to support increasing demand in Europe, as well as fast-growing International markets like the Middle East.  In March, we started up our 50 million pound chopped and formed production line in Boardman, Oregon to help support our customers\u2019 growth in the breakfast occasion in North America. And for the coming year, our expansion and integration projects are on track. We continue to target our 300 million pound French fry line in Richland, Washington to be operational in late calendar 2017.  This line incorporates the latest manufacturing technology and will support customer initiatives in North America, as well as in our export markets. Lamb-Weston/Meijer\u2019s investment in a joint venture to build an approximately 180 million pound French fry factory in Russia remains on schedule to open in early calendar 2018 and will support increasing demand in that market.  Lamb-Weston/Meijer is also just getting underway with integrating and upgrading the 185 million pound capacity facility in the Netherlands that it recently acquired from Oerlemans Foods\u2019. We are also supporting our customers\u2019 growth through innovation by working with them to expand menu options, increase consumer traffic and drive profitability. For example, in North America, we are partnering with a national chain as they test a coated French fry product, the first fry product on their menu. In addition, we are teaming up with other national chains on a range of limited time offerings.  Outside North America, we continued to support global and regional chains with limited time offerings including new products or new uses of core potato products. For instance in Latin America, we recently launched our Waffle-Waffle Fry, a sweet potato, criss cut fry covered in a crispy waffle batter that\u2019s being featured as an advertiser side dish and even a dessert.  In food service, we are meeting the increasing consumer demand for clean label offerings by expanding our simple recipe product platform including recently adding a range of Lamb Weston branded offerings that include just for ingredients, potatoes, oil and sea salt. In addition, we are partnering with a regional, fast casual chain with a clean label alternative to their higher cost house cut French fry. And in retail, we recently launched a mainstream brand grown in Idaho to complement our licensed brand products, as well as our Alexia premium products.  Our growth and performance this year in the marketplace is especially noteworthy given the potential for distractions associated with the spin-off. Just as with our commercial and supply chain teams, we have executed well across the organization to build a solid foundation to operate as a publicly traded standalone company.  As I mentioned, our fiscal 2017 results reflect the favorable environment in which we\u2019ve been operating including solid demand growth for frozen potato products in both domestic and export markets, high levels of capacity utilization in our factories as well as across the industry and modest cost inflation in our manufacturing base in North America. Fundamentally, we anticipate that this favorable environment will largely continue in fiscal 2018 and as a result, we are targeting another year of solid sales and earnings growth. Overall, we expect the demand growth for frozen potato products in both North America and International markets will continue at levels similar to this past year barring any unforeseen economic event that would significantly impact consumer sentiments.  We also believe the industry\u2019s production capacity will continue to be tight around the world through this fiscal year. By working closely with our customers, we\u2019ve been able to anticipate this increasing demand and the need for additional capacity allowing us to be well positioned to meet this growing demand.  For example, in North America, we are in a good position to capture volume growth in the back half of fiscal 2018 when our new French fry capacity in Richland becomes available. And in Europe, Lamb Weston/Meijer is well positioned to capture volume growth as its new capacity has been up and running for over six months.  Although we expect demand and capacity environment to be similar to fiscal 2017, we do anticipate the cost environment in North America to be different this year. As we discussed previously through much of fiscal 2017, we saw little to no inflation in supply chain costs. Raw potato cost per pound were essentially flat and other manufacturing and transportation costs only begin to increase in late Q3.  Since it\u2019s only July, it\u2019s too early in the growing season to determine this year\u2019s crop processing quality and yield and how they will perform in our plants. We will have much better insight as we enter the September and October harvesting period.  As Rob will discuss later, we do expect our other manufacturing and supply chain cost to increase modestly, continuing the trend that we began to see in late 2017.  In Europe, it\u2019s a similar story. On a preliminary basis, we are anticipating an average potato crop and expect other manufacturing and supply chain cost to increase. With solid demand growth and tight capacity throughout the industry, we believe the environment to improve; both price and mix will remain relatively favorable in the near term and will be at least sufficient to offset modest supply chain cost inflation. However, it\u2019s important to note that we will continue to take a balanced approach to improving price and mix, an approach that is designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships, so that we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term.  So as you can see, this is the category that has been growing and we anticipate that demand will continue to increase. We are strengthening our relationships with our customers, growers and suppliers, while strategically investing in capacity and innovation capabilities around the world.  I am confident that we will continue to operate with excellence across our commercial, supply chain and support functions to support our customers\u2019 growth initiatives, deliver solid sales, earnings and cash flow growth both this year and over the long-term and create value for all of our stakeholders.  Now, let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our results and our outlook for the coming year. Robert McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we\u2019re pleased with our performance. The Lamb Weston team that runs the business day-to-day has continued to deliver the highest level of service that our customers expect, operate our assets at high levels of productivity, and manage cost effectively to delivery strong financial results.  At the same time, the team continues to invest to ensure we can continue to support our customers\u2019 growth and continue to grow value for Lamb Weston\u2019s owners. Specifically, Lamb Weston delivered solid sales growth both in the quarter and for the year.  Net sales in the quarter were up 7% over Q4 of 2016, to $833 million. Volume grew 4% with increases across each of our business segments, we were able to meet this demand growth by continuing to run our assets at peak levels and pulling from finished goods inventory. Price mix was up 3% as we continue to benefit from the impact of pricing actions taken earlier in fiscal 2017 along with continued improvement in customer and product mix.  I note that we will begin to cycle some of those price increases and mix improvement efforts in the first fiscal quarter of 2018. For the year, sales grew 6% with price mix up 4% and volume up 2%. With respect to earnings, gross profit was up 10% for the quarter and gross margin expanded by 50 basis points versus the prior year to 24%.  As expected, our fourth quarter gross margin contracted versus Q3 reflecting the normal seasonality that I discussed on our last earnings call. Also as we anticipated, and as discussed in our last call, in fourth quarter we began to realize low single-digit inflation for a number of our cost including packaging, labor, edible oil, transportation and warehousing.  In addition, there were some unusual costs related to higher than normal maintenance levels and associated expenditures in the period as well as a few minor inventory-related adjustments that also affected profitability in the quarter. Together, these unusual costs tampered our fourth quarter gross margins by about 50 to 60 basis points.  While these were not identified as one-time costs in our financials, we do not anticipate that these unusual costs have much effect on our future results. For the year, gross profit was up 18% and gross margin was nearly 25%, up 250 basis points. This improvement was largely driven by favorable price mix, volume growth and supply chain productivity.  In the quarter, SG&A expense excluding items impacting comparability increased versus the prior year as we continue to build capabilities to operate as a standalone public company. SG&A also increased due to higher incentive compensation costs based on our actual performance for all of fiscal 2017.  As a result, adjusted operating income was up 5% to $122 million, this was driven largely by increase in gross profit. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 24% to $542 million, again due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SG&A.  Equity earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures in the quarter increased $24 million from $15 million in the prior year. This result was driven by strong price mix realization and effective cost containment efforts at Lamb Weston Meijer, which more than offset the impact of higher potato costs in Europe. For the year, equity earnings excluding items impacting comparability were down modestly to $53 million from $54 million.  So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA including the proportional EBITDA from our two unconsolidated joint ventures increased 12% in the quarter to $176 million. For the year, it was $707 million, up 19%.  Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted diluted EPS declined 11% to $0.51 in the quarter. This was a result of an incremental $25 million of interest expense from debt incurred in connection with spin-off. For the year, adjusted EPS was up 10% to $2.32. This was driven by adjusted operating income growth, partially offset by higher interest expense.  Now let\u2019s take a quick look at the results for each of our business segments. First is our Global segment, which is comprise of the top 100 North American based restaurant chain customers, as well as our International business and accounts for a little more than half of our total sales. Net sales were up 6% in the quarter. Volume was up 4% driven by growth in both Domestic and International markets.  Price mix increased 2% reflecting price increases, as well as improvement in customer and product mix. For the year, net sales increased 5% with volume up 4% and price mix up 1%. Product contribution margin which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense increased 10% in the quarter, primarily driven by favorable volume and price mix. For the year, it was up 16%. Next is our Food Service segment, which services our North American Food Service distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 restaurant customers. It accounts for about a third of our total sales. Net sales increased 9% in the quarter and for the full year. For each period, price mix added eight points of growth reflecting pricing actions, as well as improvement in customer and product mix while volume was up a point. Product contribution margin in the quarter increased 24%, again reflecting favorable price mix and for the year, the product contribution margin increased 31%.  Finally, there is our Retail segment, which includes sales of Alexia branded, license branded and private-label products to grocery, mass merchant and club customers in North America. It accounts for about 12% of our total sales.  Net sales grew 5%, volume was up 7% primarily driven by growth of private-label products. Price mix declines 2% largely due to higher trade spending in support of the launch of our Grown In Idaho branded products in late Q4. In addition, price mix fell as growth in private-label led to unfavorable mix. For the year, net sales increased 3% with price mix up 2% and volume up 1%. Retail\u2019s product contribution margin in the quarter was down 17% largely due to higher trade spending and product mix issues as I mentioned earlier. For the year, it increased 13%. Switching to balance sheet and cash flow, our total debt at the end of the year was a little more than $2.4 billion. This puts our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3.7 times, which is inside our target range at 3.5 to 4 times.  With respect to cash flow for the year, we generated nearly $450 million of cash from operations, up from about $380 million in 2016. For capital expenditures, we invested about $290 million. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, this is an elevated level of CapEx due to capacity expansion efforts that Tom described earlier. The remainder of the cash we generated went to pay dividends to our shareholders, as well as service debt. Now let me turn to our fiscal 2018 outlook. As Tom noted, we anticipate the overall operating environment to remain generally favorable with continued growth in demand for frozen potato products in North America and across most of our International markets that we serve.  At this point, our forecast anticipates average potato crop. We will have more insight on this as the harvest takes place later in the year. Consistent with past practice, we are taking a prudent approach to our fiscal 2018 outlook. Specifically, we are targeting net sales to grow at low to mid-single-digit rate for the year although we anticipate growth in the first half to be relatively modest. With respect to volume, we will continue to be capacity constrained until the latter part of the second half when our new French fry capacity becomes available for the customers\u2019 growth initiatives. With respect to price mix, we expect it will improve in the back half as well, as new pricing structures for an increasing number of contract renewals become effective. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures to be in the range of $740 million to $760 million using the midpoint of this range as an 8% increase versus the pro forma 2017 amount of $692 million.  The pro forma amount for 2017 assumes an additional $15 million of SG&A expense to reflect the full year impact of incremental cost associated with being a standalone public company. We expect the increase in adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated JVs to be driven by sales growth and gross margin expansion.  Although we are targeting gross margins to expand, it will be at a much more modest pace than the 250 basis points that we delivered in 2017, especially in the first half of the year. This is largely the result of a few factors.  First, higher inflation for packaging edible oils, labor, transportation and warehousing costs. In aggregate, we expect these costs to increase at low single-digit rate similar to what we experienced in late fiscal 2017. Second, we will be lapping the pricing actions that we took in fiscal 2017. And third, we will book about $15 million of higher depreciation associated with our new production lines.  With respect to SG&A, we expect it to increase versus the pro forma 2017 baseline of $260 million due to higher advertising and promotional expense in support of the rollout of our Grown in Idaho products in retail as well as inflation.  We anticipate total interest expense in the range of $105 million to $110 million, which is an increase of about $50 million from fiscal 2017 due to the full year impact of our post spin-off capital structure. This increase will be a year-over-year headwind to our earnings per share in the first half. We anticipate an effective tax rate of 33% to 34%.  Finally, we expect total cash used for capital expenditures of about $225 million. The majority will be spent in the first half of the year as we complete the construction of our French fry capacity line at our Richland, Washington facility.  In summary, we delivered a strong 2017, with growth in sales and EBITDA over the long-term targets that we provided in October Investor Day Meeting and we expect to follow that with a solid 2018.  Let me now turn the call back over to Tom to discuss capital allocation. Thomas Werner : Thanks Rob. In summary, our priorities have not changed and reflect a balanced capital allocation policy based on returns and executed with discipline. Our priorities continue to be, first, investing to support growth. We believe that demand for frozen potato products will continue to grow at an attractive rate over the long-term, both in North America and in the International markets.  As a result, we believe that there are a number of opportunities to generate solid returns by investing strategically through both capacity expansions and M&A to support our customers as they look to grow around the world. Second, given that we are continuing to make good progress towards the low-end of our leverage target through EBITDA growth, we do not anticipate paying down debt beyond what is required in the near term.  And finally, we will continue to support our dividend which is currently $0.75 per share on an annualized basis. We will evaluate alternative uses of cash down the road as we continue to grow and return to a more normalized CapEx level.  As you may have already seen in yesterday\u2019s press release, our Executive Chairman, Tim McLevish has decided not to seek re-election to our Board of Directors in September. We were fortunate to have someone with Tim\u2019s valuable experience on ConAgra\u2019s Board at the time of our spin and we were even more fortunate that he was willing to step in as Executive Chairman to help with the spin, provide seasoned leadership and help build the foundation for independent Lamb Weston. In a short amount of time, we have established standalone capabilities, we\u2019ve recruited a great senior leadership team. We have also recruited two new independent directors bringing the total to seven. For all these reasons, Tim decided it was the right time for him to transition out of his role with the company. I want to thank Tim for his partnership and guidance over the past year and wish him all the best.  Finally, let me just say that my Lamb Weston team and I are proud of what we have accomplished in our first year as an independent company. We are executing well across the organization and confident that we will continue to operate with excellence to deliver another year of solid top and bottom-line growth in fiscal 2018.  We will do this by remaining focused on serving our customers and investing in and strengthening our capabilities. We are well positioned to create value for all our stakeholders over the long-term. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston and now we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hi, good morning everyone. Thomas Werner : Good morning. Bryan Spillane : I\u2019ve got two questions. One, just related to - the first one just related to gross margins. I guess, as we\u2019re looking out into 2018 and sort of listening to some of the variables you laid out, it seems like you\u2019ve got a pretty good fix in terms of what your pricing will be given the view you have with your contracts and also the visibility into sort of the non-agricultural related input costs. So, as we are kind of thinking about gross margins and what could drive upside or downside in 2018. Is the biggest sort of variable just going to be the potato crop or is there something else that we should be focusing on in terms of what could drive sort of some variability in gross margins for 2018? And then I have a follow-up. Thomas Werner : Thank you, Bryan, it\u2019s Tom. Certainly, at this time of the year, as we stated, the crop is an unknown until it matures further down the cycle. So that will be a variability and like we said, as the crop matures, we get into harvest in the September, October timeframe. We certainly will have a better view on what the impact of the overall cost structure of our raw potato crop is going to be. So that does drive the variability. And like Rob stated, we will give some insight into that down the road. But that\u2019s one of the major factors that impacts our business at this time a year. Bryan Spillane : Okay, and then, second question, just in terms of the equity income line this quarter, I think it was certainly much better than what we were modeling and I think a lot better than where the consensus was. So, I guess, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of the step-up sequentially from I to I why the profitability and then just as we are thinking about that the JV I guess, going into 2018, I know that we were thinking about it was - it would look more like I and I in the first half and then sort of get back to normal levels of profitability in the second half. Is that still the way should we should think about it or, is there something else that\u2019s changed there? Robert McNutt : Yes, Bryan, this is Rob. In terms of Lamb Weston/Meijer in Q4 performance, the team there has really driven a lot of improvement in price and customer mix that has picked up a lot of the slack that we saw in terms of higher potato cost. At the same time, they\u2019ve done a good job controlling controllable costs that have really helped make that up. We did get a little bit of tailwind in currency as well. Now as we look forward, I don\u2019t want to independently forecast individual operations and so forth and so, again, at this point, in Europe, we don\u2019t have anything that says we are going to have an abnormal potato crop going forward. So we are forecasting based around an average potato crop. Bryan Spillane : And that average potato crop would be applied for the full year or would it be more back half loaded, getting back to normal level of the profitability? Thomas Werner : Yes, Bryan, this is Tom. So, in terms of, we are working through the old crop, new crop transition right now at this particular point just like we do every year. So the new crop will come online starting really in Q2 and going forward. So, it\u2019s pretty similar cycle to what happens here in North America. Bryan Spillane : Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you, guys. Thomas Werner : Thanks, Bryan. Operator : We will take our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Hey everybody. Thomas Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi, there is two questions for you. The first one will be just following up on Bryan\u2019s. I guess, at the midpoint of the EBITDA range for 2018, it seems like you do anticipate still some additional EBITDA margin expansion off of what obviously is already higher margin than we have seen for the past few years.  And that also incorporates a still unknown in terms of crop quality as you just talked about. So, clearly, you\u2019ve still got some visibility to additional margin even off of a high base already. So is it primarily just, I guess, you are far enough through some of your negotiations with customers to give you a sense of that and obviously including what you hear or what you are seeing from the volume demand piece of this as well. Trying to get a sense of where the visibility to the improved margin comes from even in light of the unknown on the crop side? Thomas Werner : Sure, Andrew, thank you for the question. Right now, we are working through negotiations across all of our segments and well, I am not going to get into the specifics on those negotiations. I will tell you that we feel good about where we are at and our plan how we plan those.  So I think, as this unfolds further down the cycle, we will continue to work through our opportunities not only in our negotiations, but also with our product mix that we\u2019ve been executing against over the past 12 to 18 months. So there is a couple things happening. It\u2019s certainly the negotiations with the customers and the contracts and then obviously we\u2019ve been laser focused on our mix across the product portfolio. Robert McNutt : Andrew, Rob, if I can add to that, just in terms of supply demand balance or capacity demand balance, as we continue to see growth in the category with no new capacity or significant new capacity coming online until we start up Richland late in the year. We\u2019ve been communicating that to our customers and they realize that. And so, as we\u2019ve been going through the negotiations on contracts, the outcome thus far has been consistent with what is in our forecast for 2018. Andrew Lazar : Thanks for that. And then, just a quick follow-up would be, Rob, as you talked about, obviously, sales growth will be much more modest in the first half versus the fiscal second half, but you still expected growth in the first half on the top-line. And I am just trying to get a sense of, would you expect that to be balanced between a little bit of price mix and little bit of volume? Or based on what you are lapping in the year ago and the fact that you\u2019ve been running at sort of beyond, just sort of full capacity if you will. Do you think there could be even a step back on a year-over-year basis in one of those metrics in the first half? Thomas Werner : Well, I think price mix again contracts are open through the year, comes through the year in different timings. Some of that, you are right, we are lapping, but we will continue to get some price mix improvement is what we are anticipating in the first half of the year. Again, volume because we are constrained on capacity it\u2019s really tough for us to get a lot more volume. So we are not anticipating much volume improvement until we get in the back half of the year. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks very much. Robert McNutt : Thanks, Andrew. Thomas Werner : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : We will take our next question from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. Robert McNutt : Thanks, Akshay. Thomas Werner : Good morning, Akshay. Akshay Jagdale : So, just, first question relates to price mix, but before I get into that, I just want make sure I understand your guidance correctly. So, the EBITDA guidance adjusted for the SG&A cost implies like a 100 basis point margin expansion at the midpoint and I think what you are saying is most of that will come from gross margins. So, number one, am I understanding that correctly? And you are saying it will be more back half weighted. Is that the right way to think about sort of margin expansion in general? Thomas Werner : Yes. Akshay Jagdale : Okay. And then, as it relates to price mix, there is obviously - I am guessing you are not going to comment on what pricing actions are in the market right now, but in terms of the timing, can you help understand the contract timings? Because from what we understand a lot of the contracts renew August and September, so I know you are saying that some amount of volume that\u2019s renewing I guess, in the back half of the fiscal year.  So, can you give us some color around contract timing? And how that plays through in any given year? Because that\u2019s a bit confusing from what we understand most of the contracts renew August, September. Thomas Werner : Yes, Akshay, this is Tom. Thanks for the question. We are again right in the middle of all these negotiations and the timing is spread out over really Q1, Q2, Q3 when the new contracts get into place. So, it\u2019s not as specific as August, September, it\u2019s going to flow over the course of Q2, Q3 and the back half of next year and that\u2019s just the typical protocol how the contract start within their new agreement going forward. Akshay Jagdale : Okay. And just one on cash flow, the CapEx number for this year is pretty significantly higher than what we had expected. I know it looks like $10 million or so this year\u2019s spend is going into next year, maybe that\u2019s timing-related, but what\u2019s - can you remind us, what you consider a normal CapEx level versus what you call elevated?  Obviously, you have a very good balance sheet and cash flow situation, but can you give us, it looks like there is a good $100 million above normal that you are spending again this year. So I\u2019d really love to know where that spending is targeted towards. Thank you. Robert McNutt : Yes. Thanks, Akshay, Rob. Our normal level of CapEx to really maintain the assets and some modest improvement in productivity is in that $110 million range is the way we think about it. And you are right, our CapEx for 2018 is elevated over what we previously anticipated early in 2017. And driven by a couple of things, as you properly point out, there is some carryover related to CapEx, really related primarily to that Richland number five project.  And so some of that\u2019s carryover. In addition, as we continue to see opportunities for high return investments and we continue to cash flow the business well, we will take advantage of those opportunities. So that the engineers and the operators they identify a stream of opportunities to make improvements and as we can support those opportunities, we will pull some things forward and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Akshay Jagdale : Great. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : We will take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Thomas Werner : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Maybe first, on the revenue outlook that you provided the low to mid single-digits and maybe just trying to help think about what drives you the upper or lower end of that? I mean, the capacity constraints in the first half of the year are well taken, but at the same time your volume growth in this most recent quarter was actually quite healthy.  So is it timing of the Richland expansion? Is it uncertainty on potato availability before you get to the new crop? Just help me think about the band on the top-line as you look at the fiscal 2018 guidance. Thomas Werner : Adam, this is Tom. There is a couple things. We\u2019ve got the capacity situation which our opportunities will come online in the back half to drive volume growth. So that\u2019s a big component of it certainly. The other thing to think about is, about a year ago this time, we started running our capacity wide open in the business. And we are selling up a high level of it. So we are going to have be lapping some high comparables until we get that capacity online and also some price mix things that we action in the last year well ahead of the first half. So those are really the two components as you are thinking about the top-line that are impactful. Adam Samuelson : Okay. It\u2019s very helpful. And then, within the global business, and again this is a bit more of a revenue question that the 4% volume growth in the quarter, any way to characterize the Domestic versus the Export performance there. Obviously, one of your bigger customers there point some pretty healthy U.S. same-store sales earlier this morning, but maybe help us think about just mix of the volume gains that you\u2019ve experienced recently? Robert McNutt : Sure, Adam. I am not going to dissect International to Domestic at this point, but I will give you some color around the trends that we are seeing some of our really strategic customers. Right now, I am not going to get into specific customers, but that we are seeing some good positive trends in a lot of their markets and that\u2019s healthy obviously for our business but the entire industry. Adam Samuelson : Okay. It\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : We will take our next question from Andrew Carter with Stifel. Andrew Carter : Hi, good morning guys. Can you hear me? Dexter Congbalay : Yes. Robert McNutt : Good morning, Andrew, yes. Andrew Carter : Okay, yes, so, just kind of getting back to his point, kind of being surprised at the volume growth kind of outstripping what we were modeling and of course, what you will kind of telegraphed last quarter about the capacity kind of running too hot and happened to take some online.  So, one, we are just kind of wondering where did it come from, you mentioned inventory draw down of course and then productivity and then of course, you kind of called out some unique expenses a bit around that on impeded gross margins. Just some of that continues if volumes outside your expectations? Thanks. Robert McNutt : In terms - you are right, we - the teams that operate our assets have continued to run the assets at a very high level of productivity and so we are getting more production out of those assets than what we had previously anticipated really to meet customer demand. So as the demand growth that Tom talks about and we pull from the strategic customers, we are running the assets hard.  We are also, as you noted, pulling a bit out of inventory as well. Recall that we had built some inventory ahead of some of our capital projects, specifically the Boardman rebuild that\u2019s going on right now to take us through that. So we pulled some of that inventory to service customer demand. In terms of the maintenance - increased maintenance cost, it had a minor impact on overall production across the system. Andrew Carter : Okay, thanks. And then, last question, I\u2019ll pass it on. Balance sheet position has obviously improved dramatically by your estimates you are easily be down to three times by the end of this fiscal year. When should we start thinking of about a share repurchase or is just given how volumes have done, is it likely free cash flow going to more capacity? Robert McNutt : Well, first, as I\u2019ve stated, we are going to continue first of all to invest in our business in the growth, that\u2019s good returns and secondly, I would say, we are going to evaluate our free cash flow position down the road and as we develop our capital allocation policies, we will communicate some of that down the road. Andrew Carter : Thanks. Robert McNutt : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : We will take our next question from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger : Hi, good morning everyone. Robert McNutt : Good morning, Matthew. Matthew Grainger : Thanks. So just wanted to ask first about the Grown in Idaho launch and could you talk a bit more about the rationale for launching and supporting that product now when you are in a period of constrained capacity and given the trade spend that you incurred during the quarter, the fact that you have somewhat below average EBITDA margins in the Retail segment.  How do you think about the longer term trade-offs between investing today to expand your presence in the Retail segment as opposed potentially just pursuing higher margin business on the food service side, while competitors are still, for lack of a better word, just have their hands tied on capacity there? Thomas Werner : Thanks, Matthew, this is Tom. We have hadn\u2019t saw an opportunity in the marketplace to round out our strategy in the Retail segment. So, we have participated in our private brands. We have a private brands offering. We have a premium offering in Alexia and we certainly have license brands. The Grown in Idaho was an opportunity for us to compete at the mid-tier Retail positioning and we feel good about how that has been positioned to sell in. It\u2019s going pretty well and it\u2019s off to a pretty good start.  I would say, in terms of capacity and the part of your question, that particular product runs on a very different part of our asset base and while we talk about we are running all the plants wide open. That\u2019s an area where in the Retail with the packaging in the line - how the line flow goes, we did have some opportunity.  So it\u2019s not compressing the system so to speak in terms of taking away from any other part of our business. It\u2019s just an opportunity for us to expand and we believe based on certainly the category in Retail has been tough. We\u2019ve been growing and we\u2019ve been doing some things for our customers and they\u2019ve been - they have welcomed it that we are bringing some news to the category. Matthew Grainger : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks, Tom. And, just one follow-up there, with respect to the trade spending you had in the fourth quarter and what\u2019s your aspirations are for distribution for the product line overall? Can you give us a sense of where you are in that process?  Are we going to continue to see some trade spend way on the EBITDA margins of the Retail segment during the next quarter or two? And just roughly where you are on ACV relative to where you hope to be over the next year? Thomas Werner : Yes, Matthew, it\u2019s really, really early in the process. So, I think, we will give you some updates as we move down the path. We certainly have a program in place that\u2019s measured and I don\u2019t anticipate a significant amount of impact with trade going forward. We have lots, we had slotting and all the things that you pay coming out of the gate, but it\u2019s really, really early in the process. Matthew Grainger : Okay, thanks. And then, just one last one, I wanted to follow-up on Bryan\u2019s question about the JV results, which were pretty strong here in the quarter. And you talked about some of the improvements in price and mix, but my sense, just more generally around the operating environment in Europe has been that, you have some near-term capacity constraints across the industry right now, supply and demand is relatively balanced. But there is quite a bit of capacity coming on across the industry by mid 2018.  And I know you are not really giving guidance for that segment, but what are your expectations for the broader pricing environment as we move through the year? And is there the potential for some of that pricing and mix improvement to potentially be pressured as we get towards the back half? Thomas Werner : I would say, the way to think about it is, right now, the team over there is going through a similar process. What we do here in North America in terms of contracting with customers. Certainly there is, as you pointed out, capacity coming online in 2018, I feel really, really confident with the team over there and how they\u2019ve got this fiscal year position.  As the capacity comes online, certainly, I believe that\u2019s going to be some, we are going to keep our eye on and it will be potentially more impactful in 2019. But 2018 is well positioned right now in my mind. Matthew Grainger : Okay. Great, thanks again, Tom. Thomas Werner : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Adam Mizrahi with Berenberg Capital Markets. Adam Mizrahi : Good morning guys. Just going back to\u2026 Thomas Werner : Good morning. Adam Mizrahi : European JV, could you comment on whether you believe there is still room for further operational improvements in the European JV? And then, just another one, it sounds like you\u2019ve continued to run the assets quite hard in Q4. Will you still able to take lines down for the routine maintenance as expected or do you think there may be a need to potentially cool off and how hard you run the assets in the first half of next year? Thank you. Thomas Werner : Thank you, Adam. In terms of the joint venture question, the team three four months, four five months ago, six months ago now, with the crop situation they took actions ahead of it to get ahead of it, there is always a lag in terms of the actions they\u2019ve taken to help offset some of the impact of the crop. So, again, they have well positioned the joint venture. We will work through the crop. We\u2019ve taken actions to improve profitability back to normalized level. As the new crop comes on, we are anticipating an average crop just like we do every year and the actions the joint venture has taken will help augment their performance next year.  The second part of your question is, as Rob noted, we took actions to build inventory in Q3 and part of Q4 ahead of some of our planned maintenance that we are executing on right now this summer. So, we have not put any of our key maintenance things off to run the plants. We plan around it. The operations and supply chain team do a great job in scheduling those things and working the inventory levels ahead of any big planned maintenance down time. But we are very disciplined to manage against those programs. Adam Mizrahi : Great. Thanks very much. Thomas Werner : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Gallo with C.L. King. Michael Gallo : Hi, good morning. Thomas Werner : Good morning, Michael. Michael Gallo : Just a quick question. You mentioned and you referenced in your prepared remarks a test of a coated product at a chain customer. I was wondering how we should think about the potential for coated products, your capacity and ability to shift towards them and the potential margin impact both for you and your customers assuming that that\u2019s a successful and ultimately what that means in terms of your ability to drive improved mix within the Global segment? Thanks. Thomas Werner : Thanks, Michael. Certainly, our capabilities across our network, we have multiple factories that have coated product capabilities and certainly there is some advantages to the product, I think, I am not going to comment specifically on the customer, but we have a number of customers that utilize that product and it\u2019s - has a whole time and a lot of great attributes. But it is not a - it is not capacity constraints by any means because of the fact that we have capabilities across lot of our factories to produce multiple products in our portfolio. Michael Gallo : Just the potential margin implications of being able to shift more of the mix to coated products? Thomas Werner : Well, I am not going to get into specific product margin, but when we step back, this is about partnering with the customer and meeting the needs that they are trying to drive to meet their consumers\u2019 interest. So, it varies from customer-to-customer based on their consumers and what they are trying to accomplish with them. So it just really all depends on our customers and how they are thinking about their business going forward. Michael Gallo : Okay, thank you. Thomas Werner : You bet. Operator : That does concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Hi, it\u2019s Dexter Congbalay. Thanks for joining in the call today. If anybody has some pop up questions like to schedule call, please email me as the best way to reach me today. And I look forward to talking to you later. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead. Vice President of Investor Relations. Dexter Congbalay : Thank you and good morning [indiscernible]. Thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning, we issued our press release which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. In addition, some of today\u2019s prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Tom will provide an overview of our overall performance and operating environment, Rob will then provide the details on our first quarter results, our debt and cash flow and our fiscal 2018 outlook. Tom will wrap up with some closing remarks and then open up the call for questions. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me start by saying that we\u2019re pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our strong start to the year. We executed well across the organization as we continue to focus on delivering the right product at the right time, every time to support our customer\u2019s growth and innovation initiatives. Similar to what we\u2019ve experienced over the past year, the operating environment in the quarter was favorable. Demand for frozen potato products continued to grow at an attractive rate, while available manufacturing capacity remain tight. This provided us with the ability to continue to deliver solid sales and earnings growth. Specifically, sales increased 5%, driven by a good balance of volume growth and price/mix. Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures increased 11% to $191 million. As we \u2013 and we generated nearly $145 million of cash flow from operations. These results reflect how well our commercial and supply chain teams continue to execute on our strategic and operational objectives and serve our customers. For example, our global team have made good progress in renewing customer contract, winning business with new customers and leading innovation by supporting customers, limited time offers and promotional plans in North America and internationally. Our Foodservice team continues to strengthen product mix. The team has continued to be price disciplined when competing for distributor label volume, which is the private label business in Foodservice. This allows us to focus scarce capacity on higher margin Lamb Weston branded products. Our retail team continues to broaden distribution of our Grown in Idaho branded products and has achieved more than 40% ACV in supermarkets, since introducing the brand in May. In addition, the team has delivered distribution gains for our Alexia branded family packs. Our supply chain team recently began the process of starting up our new 300 million pound French fry line in Richland, Washington on time and on budget. While production has been limited today, we expect to ramp up the line in the coming months, providing additional capacity to support continuing growth for our customers. And finally, our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture in Europe performed well in the quarter. The cost pressures resulting from last year\u2019s potato crop are now largely behind them as they begin to process the new crop. Of course, our performance in the quarter also reflects today\u2019s favorable operating environment, solid demand growth and tight manufacturing capacity. We believe the environment will remain generally positive for the remainder of fiscal 2018, providing us with the opportunity to continue to improve price/mix and capture good volume growth with our capacity additions in North America and Europe. But with only one quarter behind us, we are taking a prudent approach by reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2018. While it\u2019s still too early to fully assess the impact of ongoing customer contract renewals and the potato crop, let me give you an update on where we currently stand with each of these. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we have a number of customer contracts up for renewal this year, especially in our Global segment. We\u2019ve already renewed a number of these contracts and have been able to agree on terms, which are in aggregate in line with our expectations. The new pricing structure for these contracts will become effective as the year progresses. So we continue to expect price/mix accelerating in the back-half of the year. A number of key contracts need to be negotiated and we anticipate finalizing them in the coming month. For these remaining contracts, we\u2019ll continue to take a balanced approach to improve price and mix in order to help offset inflationary pressures and importantly to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships. With respect to the potato crop, we\u2019re in the middle of the fall harvest period right now. So it\u2019s still too early to have a definitive view on the crops yield and quality. However, based on what we\u2019ve harvested today, we can provide a preliminary view. We believe that the crop to be harvested in all of our growing areas are consistent with overall historical averages. While production yields are slightly down versus last year, we do not currently see any risk in our ability to secure sufficient potato supply as price is consistent with our expectation. Overall, quality appears to be generally in line with historical averages. To be clear, we do not expect any significant issues with this year\u2019s crop based on what we\u2019ve seen today. However, we do need to see how the potatoes perform in our production facilities in the coming weeks and get a sense for how the potatoes are going to take the storage before we can make a final assessment on the crop\u2019s overall quality as well as the financial impact versus our expectation. So with our first quarter performance shows we\u2019ve executed well in a favorable environment. We delivered solid top line growth with a good balance of volume gains and price/mix improvement, expanded gross margin and made good progress developing our infrastructure to operate as a standalone company. In addition, we\u2019ve continued to grow our business by supporting our customers through well-timed investment in new capacity, driving product innovation and strengthening partnerships with our growers and suppliers. Now let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our results and our outlook. Robert McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we\u2019re pleased with our financial performance. Our underlying results in the first quarter were in line with our expectations and reflected good balance of sales growth, supply chain productivity and cost discipline to drive earnings and cash flow growth. Specifically, Lamb Weston delivered solid top line growth in the quarter with net sales up 5% to $817 million. Price/mix was up 3% as we continued to benefit from the impact of pricing and mix improvement actions taken in fiscal 2017, as well as pricing actions implemented this quarter. Volume grew 2% with increases across each of our business segment. Gross profit was up $16 million or 9% versus a prior year. Higher price/mix, volume growth and productivity drove the improvement more than offsetting the impact of commodity, manufacturing, transportation and warehouse cost inflation. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to just over 24%. While we continue to target gross margin expanding for the full-year, gross margin in the second quarter maybe pressured by startup costs related to the new fry production line in Richland. We anticipate total startup cost will be about $5 million with the vast majority of that affecting the second quarter. SG&A expense in the quarter, excluding items impacting comparability was $57 million, that\u2019s up $11 million or 24% versus a prior year. Essentially, all of that increase was related to incremental cost associated with building capabilities to operate as a standalone public company. We\u2019ve made good progress building these capabilities and are continuing to fill certain support functions. As a result, going forward on a run rate basis, we expect to incur modestly higher SG&A cost than we did in the first quarter. Just a reminder and it\u2019s important to note that in the first-half of fiscal 2017, we were still part of ConAgra and did not incur any standalone public company costs. When we provided our EBITDA guidance outlook earlier this year, we highlighted a pro forma adjustment that increased fiscal 2017 SG&A by $15 million in order to provide a more appropriate base line for 2018 results. Nearly, all of the $15 million adjustment should be applied to the first-half of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was up $5 million or 4% to $140 million, with the benefits of strong sales growth and gross margin expansion more than offsetting the increase in SG&A. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures increased to $20 million from about $11 million in the prior-year period. This increase included an unrealized gain of about $3.5 million related to mark-to-market adjustment associated with foreign currency hedging contracts. ,: Going forward, early indications are that both yield and quality of this year\u2019s potato crop in Europe will be well above last years. This is likely to result in significantly lower raw potato prices relative to last year\u2019s crop. So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA, including the proportional EBITDA from our two unconsolidated joint ventures increased about $20 million, or 11% to $191 million. About half of that increase was due to performance by our base business with the other half from our joint ventures. With respect to earnings per share, adjusted diluted EPS declined a $0.01 to $0.57. Interest expense increased by about $24 million as a result of the additional debt incurred in connection with our spinoff from ConAgra, resulting in a headwind of about $0.11 in the quarter. This essentially offset the strong increase in our operating earnings and equity income. Now let\u2019s take a look at the results for each of our business segment. First is our Global segment, which accounts for a little more than half of our total sales. Net sales for the segment were up 4% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 3%, reflecting price increases as well as improvement in customer and product mix. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we\u2019re heavy this year in global contracting renegotiations, but the impact of the bulk of those won\u2019t take place until the back-half of the year. Volume was up 1%, as growth in North America more than offset the effect of our decision to exit lower-margin volumes in some international markets. Product contribution margin, which is gross profit, less advertising and promotional expense increased 1% in the quarter, as favorable price and volume gains were largely offset by commodity, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation. While improved price/mix offset our higher manufacturing cost on a dollar basis, it was insufficient to hold our product contribution percentage. As a result, global product contribution margin percentage declined about 40 basis points versus the prior year. We expect global product contribution margin percentage will expand in the second-half as we begin to implement new pricing structures associated with contract renewals. Next is our Foodservice segment, which accounts for about a third of our total sales. Net sales increase 7% in the quarter, price/mix increased 6%, reflecting the carryover impact of pricing actions taking in \u2013 taken in the latter half of fiscal 2017, as well as some pricing actions taken in the quarter. We also continue to improve customer and product mix. Volume was up a point, driven by broad-based growth across segments customer base. Product contribution margin in the quarter increased 14% largely due to favorable price/mix. As a result, product contribution margin percentage expanded by 200 basis points. Net sales for our Retail segment, which accounts for about a 11% of our total sales grew 3%. Volume was up 9%, primarily driven by the introduction of Grown in Idaho branded products and increased sales of private label products. Price/mix declined 6% due to higher trade spending in support of expanding distribution for Grown in Idaho. Retail\u2019s product contribution margin in the quarter was down 16% as a result of the higher trade spending, as well as transportation and warehousing cost inflation. Product contribution margin percentage declined 400 basis points. We expect retail\u2019s product contribution margin to be pressured for the remainder of the year due to continued elevated trade spending for Grown in Idaho. Finally, net sales for our other segment, which includes our non-core businesses accounts for about 4% of our total sales increased 18%. The increase was due to improved sales volume and mix in our vegetable business. Product contribution margin increased $8 million to about a third of the increase relates to year-over-year increase in mark-to-market adjustments associated with commodity contracts in our overall Lamb Weston business. A significant portion of the increase also reflects expenses incurred in the prior year associated with the recall of some vegetable products, which were produced by a third-party. Switching to our balance sheet and cash flow, our total debt at the end of the quarter was a little more than $2.4 billion, which is about the same as it was at the end of fiscal 2017. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remain 3.7 times, which is inside our target range of 3.5 to 4 times. With respect to cash flow, we generated nearly $145 million in cash from operations, up from about $115 million in the prior-year period. It\u2019s important to note that, we do have some seasonality for our operating cash flow. It tends to be lowest in the second quarter when we build raw potato and finished goods inventory during the fall harvest period and when we pay our growers. We finance a portion of our seasonal working capital with our revolving credit line. Operating cash flow improves in the third and fourth quarters as we work down potato inventories. With respect to capital expenditures, we invested nearly $105 million with much of this spent on our new French fry production line in Richland, Washington. As Tom mentioned, we\u2019re in the process of starting that \u2013 up that line right now and remain on track to ramp up production in the back-half of the year. Remainder of the cash we generated went to pay dividends to our shareholders as well as service our debt. Now let me turn to our fiscal 2018 outlook. As Tom mentioned, despite our first quarter results and overall favorable environment, it\u2019s still early in the year. So we\u2019re taking a prudent approach by reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2018. In addition, we\u2019ve not adjusted our outlook for any impact of the hurricanes that hit Texas, Florida and the Caribbean. Clearly, there are some puts and takes and we\u2019re still working through the underlying net impact, if any. However, we expect any effect would be short-term and modest relative to our full-year results. We may have a more pronounced impact on our second quarter. So for our full-year fiscal 2018 outlook, we continue to target adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures to be in the range of $740 million to $760 million. Using the midpoint of this range that\u2019s an 8% increase versus the pro forma 2017 amount of $692 million. We expect this increase will be driven by sales growth and gross margin expansion in the second-half of the year. We continue to target net sales to grow at low, mid \u2013 low to mid single-digit rate with our volume growth capacity constrained until the latter part of the second-half of the year as we ramp up the new production line. We anticipate price/mix to improve in the back-half of the year as new pricing structures for recently renewed contracts become effective. Our outlook also assumes an average potato crop. As Tom mentioned, while we\u2019ve not seen any significant issues with this crop \u2013 this year\u2019s crop to-date, it\u2019s too early to know how the fall potato crop will perform in our plants or store in our warehouses over the full processing season. As we indicated a couple of months ago, we see cost of goods inflation trending a bit higher than in recent years with non-potato costs up low single-digit. Nonetheless, we anticipate that our improvements in price/mix, volume growth and productivity will more than offset cost inflation, resulting in gross margin expansion. We expect this expansion will be partially offset by higher SG&A costs versus the pro forma 2017 baseline of $260 million. This increase in SG&A is due to higher advertising and promotional expense in support of the roll out of our Grown in Idaho products in retail, as well as inflation. We continue to see interest expense in the range of $105 million to $110 million, that\u2019s up about $50 million from fiscal 2017, due to the full-year impact of our post spinoff capital structure. As you saw in our first quarter results, higher interest expense was a significant headwind for our earnings per share and will pose a similar headwind in the second quarter. We anticipate an effective tax rate of 33% to 34%. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was a little over 33%. And finally, we expect cash use for capital expenditures of about $225 million with the majority spent in the first-half of the year on the completion of our Richland production line. In the first quarter, our CapEx was about $105 million. Let me turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Rob. In summary, we\u2019re pleased with our operating performance and our strong results in the first quarter. We\u2019re executing well across the organization and remain on track to deliver our outlook for the year. We continue to implement our growth strategy to support our customer success with well-timed investments and new capacity and creating product innovation. While remain focused on growing with and serving our customers, while investing in and strengthening our capabilities, we\u2019re well positioned to grow value for all of our stakeholders over the long-term. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston, and we\u2019re now happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Tom Werner : Andrew, are you there? Andrew Lazar : I\u2019m here, can you hear? Tom Werner : Hi, good morning, Andrew. Robert McNutt : Yep. Tom Werner : Yep. Andrew Lazar : Good, thank you. Two quick questions from me if I could. I guess, the first one would be perhaps you can help maybe characterize a little bit for us of the volume in your Global segment that is sort of up for renewal maybe directionally. About what percent of that volume is, let\u2019s say, has been renewed and maybe what percent still is left to go? And what I\u2019m really trying to do is just get a sense of your level of visibility on that piece of things? Tom Werner : Thanks, Andrew, this is Tom. I would say right now we have line of sight about 75% of our volume renewed in that \u2013 in the Global business unit. And as I\u2019ve stated in my prepared remarks, over the coming months, we expect to work through the remaining 25% of the contract renewals. Andrew Lazar : Yes, thanks for that. And then I think at one point over the course of the last fiscal year with volume growth being as strong as it has been. I know that the plants are running at pretty high levels of utilization. And I thought at one point maybe you\u2019d mentioned that you\u2019d need to back that down a little bit just a normal maintenance and things of that nature. I was curious if that \u2013 if you\u2019ve been able to sort of do that in the context of volume still being pretty solid or some of that needs to happen as we go through this fiscal year, how you go through that? Robert McNutt : Yes, Andrew, I would say over the course of the past couple of quarters, we have been able to address some of our maintenance needs in the factories. And we\u2019ve done a great job supply chain team managing around that as we continue to service our customers. So we look for opportunities. At times, you take some downtime maintenance and address our \u2013 some of our maintenance issues. Andrew Lazar : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And moving on, we have a question from Matt Grainger from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger : Hi, good morning, everyone. Just had two questions as well. Tom Werner : Congratulations. Matthew Grainger : Well, hi, thanks. So I wanted to ask the obvious question on the sales guidance, if you\u2019re still calling for low to mid single-digit growth second-half weighted. we had 5% growth in the first quarter. And I know it\u2019s still early in the year and \u2013 but apart from some of the recent weather-related disruptions that might factor into Q2. It really seems like most of the uncertainty in the outlook at this point is around crop quality and processing. So as we\u2019re thinking about top line for the balance of the year, what are the key swing factors that could result in that being a bit higher, a bit higher in the range. So what still gives you a pause in terms of raising the guidance? Tom Werner : Yes, Matthew, the way I think about it is that Q2 last year we had an extremely strong quarter. And I would characterize it in terms of \u2013 that\u2019s when we were really running the factories full out across the board. So we\u2019ve got a pretty strong comp coming at us this quarter. And the good news is, as we\u2019ve stated, we\u2019ve got our production capacity. We\u2019re in the front-end of the startup and we\u2019ll work through our vertical startup process over the coming months and we\u2019ll have available capacity in the back-half of the year as we\u2019ve stated the last couple of calls. That\u2019s the \u2013 that is the big key for me for the balance of this fiscal year on top line. Matthew Grainger : Okay. Tom Werner : And as far as your question around the crop, as I\u2019ve said, we feel pretty comfortable where it is right now. We certainly have to process the crop in the factories and understand, how that quality is going to process into our product base. And again, it\u2019s \u2013 thinking about and monitoring the store ability of our crop going forward. But right now, as it sits, feel comfortable across historical averages. Matthew Grainger : Okay. All right. Thank you, Tom. Robert McNutt : Matt, I\u2019m sorry, this is Rob. Just to add to Tom\u2019s point on the volume ramp up also recognize we had some price increases that took place in Q2 and through the back-half of the year, especially in our Foodservice business. So the year-over-year comp is going to be a little tougher there as well, for both on volume and on price. Matthew Grainger : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. And then can I just follow-up on the contribution margin in the Global segment, Rob? You had a quite a bit of favorable price/mix, but you still saw margins contract a bit year-on-year, and I know you spoke to this. But could you just elaborate a bit more on some of the factors that played into the lack of operating leverage there? I don\u2019t know if that was kind of the residual flow-through of some of the leftover higher cost inventory from last year\u2019s crop, or maybe lumpy inflation that came into the segment this quarter? And then just to confirm, you expect margins to expand in Q2 off of a prior year basis sequentially much higher than it was in Q1? Robert McNutt : Yes, and thanks for the question. The \u2013 in terms of what we saw in the Global segment relative to the other segments, Global did not have as much of a year-over-year price improvement. And in fact, it\u2019s much mix, I mean, when you think about price and mix, mix was \u2013 customer and product mix was a significant part of that improvement in the top line in Global. In terms of the cost inflation, yes, we are seeing some of that cost inflation showing up now. And where in the Foodservices business, we\u2019ve got some price improvement over first quarter of prior year. We didn\u2019t have as much of that in the Global segment. And so it just wasn\u2019t enough to offset that inflation on a percentage basis. Matthew Grainger : Okay. Great. Thanks, again. Robert McNutt : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Good morning. Congratulations on a solid quarter. I have two questions. The first question is related to the outlook for COGS inflation and the impact it has on the magnitude of your pricing action. So I believe today was the first time you actually disclosed that you have taken incremental pricing actions in foodservice this quarter. So, it\u2019s our view and I don\u2019t know if you agree with this, but the cost of raising potatoes over the next three years likely is going to move up slightly. And then you\u2019ve already talked about non-potato COGS inflation. So it looks like, there\u2019s going to be some modest inflation more so than you\u2019ve seen in your COGS. So I\u2019m just wondering how that is playing through and how you\u2019re thinking about pricing this year and just maybe over the medium-term, if I may, not just this year, but if you\u2019re thinking through the next couple of years. Can you just help me understand how you\u2019re thinking about that? Tom Werner : Yes, Akshay, it\u2019s Tom. As we\u2019ve gone through our pricing actions this year relative to what the inflation that we \u2013 our point of view is on 2018, we certainly consider that and that influences our pricing decisions. In terms of the outlook and forward inflation thought that we have, I\u2019m not going to get into expectations on how we\u2019re thinking about doing it at this point. But as we have in the past and will continue to do. When we take pricing actions into the market, we take that all into consideration as we\u2019re thinking about the forward curve of our business cycle. Akshay Jagdale : So is it fair to assume that the magnitude of the actions this year are greater than last year, or that\u2019s not better? Tom Werner : I think, Akshay, it\u2019s hard to compartmentalize this year versus last year. We\u2019d have to go back and take a look at the overall percentage increases. We have a lot of moving pieces when it comes to pricing in terms of customers negotiations and we have different channels that we evaluate based on our overall cost complex and the market. And so it\u2019s kind of comparing apples to oranges from year-to-year based on how I think about it. Akshay Jagdale : Okay. And then just on the crop quality issue, what the \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to assess the potential downside in dollar terms relative to, let\u2019s say, what you have budgeted. And if you can while answering that, maybe you can compare and contrast what happened in that 2013/2014 crop when you were part of ConAgra and there were certain callout in terms of crop quality, because from the outside looking in, there isn\u2019t really any data that points to a major quality issue even in 2014. So can you just help us think through what is the magnitude downside at this point knowing what you know about the crop and maybe just give us a sense of what happened back in 2014? Thanks. Tom Werner : Sure, Akshay, the order of magnitude right now as I\u2019ve stated, we think right now the crops going to be at historical average, so it\u2019s right. What that means financially is, we believe it\u2019s going to be right at our planned levels, but we still have the next 30, 60 days to evaluate overall performance in our factories and store ability, as I\u2019ve said. And in terms of what happened a couple of years ago that was an extreme situation and the order magnitude, if I remember right, was in the neighborhood of $15 million to $25 million of downside. Akshay Jagdale : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Growe from Stifel. Andrew Carter : Hi, good morning. This is Andrew Carter on for Chris Growe. Can you hear me? Robert McNutt : Yep. Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew. Andrew Carter : Morning. So what we\u2019re trying to \u2013 what we\u2019re struggling with a little bit and this is still kind of on Matt\u2019s question. Your guidance implies 2%, 6% EBITDA growth in the final nine months of the year, significant deceleration from a 11% growth. But it goes against kind of an expectation you\u2019ve outlined for stronger pricing benefit, the volume coming online, much stronger contribution from international is likely and kind of the headwind from SG&A is going to kind of fall down as well, and do you feel comfortable with the crop. So just trying to get really kind of a better understand of what the puts and takes are here? Tom Werner : Yes, I will address it in terms of, we\u2019re a quarter in the year and we\u2019re taking a prudent approach. Certainly, everything you stated is positive at this point, but we have a \u2013 we have to get through the remaining contract negotiations with our customers. I want to feel completely comfortable with how the crops performing. And we will always, as we have in the past, take a prudent approach as we think through the outlook for our business going forward. Andrew Carter : Fair enough. And I\u2019ll ask one follow-up if can. So given kind of the tight capacity and a little bit on what Andrew was asking, how were you, I guess, we\u2019re still kind of confuse how were you able to get the 2% volume growth against the prior year? And were there any costs associated with the kind of this volume growth, which you\u2019re obviously capacity constrained similar to 4Q 2017? Robert McNutt : Yes, Andrew, this is Rob, I\u2019ll take that. In terms of capacity, if you look at what we did last year and we talked about it a little bit on prior calls, we did have some inventory build ahead of some planned downtime related to major capital projects in Boardman. And so we had built that inventory, and so that sucked up some of that production capacity and now we\u2019ve been releasing that inventory as we\u2019ve got through that Boardman product \u2013 project. And so, that\u2019s really coming out of inventory and a lot of that, plus again the supply chain folks, the guys running the plants are \u2013 they have just done a super job and continue to maintain strong operating rate across the business. Andrew Carter : Well, thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Tom Werner : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs is our next question. Adam Samuelson : Great. Thanks very much. So I guess, the first question has been a lot of ground covered already. I\u2019d be interested to understand the other segment this quarter, which had a 35% contribution margin, there wasn\u2019t any real color on that? I know it\u2019s a smaller business, but what was an outsized contributor? I\u2019d be interested on any color there, expectations on how you think about that business going forward? Robert McNutt : Yes, this is Rob. In terms of the other segment, again, it\u2019s non-core, but the key issue there was in the vegetable business, where prior year comp, we had a cost related to recall that hurt us in the prior year. And so the comp there is a real difference. The other piece is, as I\u2019d mentioned, some mark-to-market on unrealized commodity contract gains. Tom Werner : And that just doesn\u2019t relate to the vegetable business, that\u2019s for the entire [Multiple Speakers] Robert McNutt : Yes, thank you. Yes, that\u2019s caused\u2026. Tom Werner : We just slug that into the other segment. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just holistically, following on the spirit of some of the earlier questions trying to reconcile the performance in the fiscal first quarter, the desire for prudence on the guidance versus kind of understanding the moving pieces of the outlook. In the first quarter itself, do the results meaningfully exceed your own internal expectations whether that\u2019s international in parts of the base business? Just trying to calibrate where you guys are running versus your plan, if everyone\u2019s quarterly kind of calibration was often, just understand some of the moving pieces relative to the full-year outlook? Tom Werner : Yes, the \u2013 in terms of Q1, we were really in line with our expectations. I mean, things like mark-to-market adjustments in currency and things like that, frankly, we don\u2019t forecast and fall outside of that. But really within the base business operationally really pretty well on plan modestly above and then in our joint ventures again modestly above the plan in terms of how the business is operated. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. That\u2019s all. Operator : Our next caller is Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hi, good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : I just had one question and it\u2019s kind of related to the overall demand outlook. I guess, as you\u2019ve gone through the process of working through contract with your customers, can you give us a sense of in their planning and specifically thinking about like volume and demand, do you get a sense that there\u2019s an expectation that maybe demand is accelerating or the sales outlook is improving. And maybe more specifically, what we\u2019ve heard across a lot of other companies early in this earning season has been a little bit more optimism on developing in emerging markets and also really in Europe as well. So you could just kind of give us a sense for how you feel your customers are thinking about kind of the demand outlook going forward from here? And then also specifically about some of the international markets? Tom Werner : Thanks, Bryan. I feel pretty confident as we sit today and how the demand is going to continue pacing at levels we\u2019ve experienced in the past. Again, as I\u2019ve stated, the North America demand has picked up based on our customer mix and how we positioned our portfolio with our customers. So we\u2019re aligned with customers that are winning in the marketplace domestically and as well as in Europe. I would say, in terms of the international markets, I\u2019m extremely bullish on a number of different markets in which I met with customers recently and they have pretty aggressive expansion plans over the near-term. So as we sit today and I think about the category globally going forward, I\u2019m confident that the demand is going to continue and as it has in the past on recent trends. Bryan Spillane : All right. Thank you. Tom Werner : All right. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Mizrahi from Berenberg Capital Markets. Adam Mizrahi : Good morning, guys. In your Foodservice position, can you talk about the balance of the 6% price/mix growth. How much of this is coming from what you call carryover pricing versus current pricing? And could you also comment on the contribution of product mix in the quarter in the Foodservice position? Robert McNutt : In terms of price/mix and price is a significant component, because again, as I mentioned, that we had some price increases in the later part of prior year in fiscal 2017. And so that\u2019s a significant component of that price/mix, but we also continue to and the team does a super job of, in these capacity constrained environment really, really getting the best bang for the buck in terms of capacity available. And so there are also some efforts around both customer and product mix improvement. Adam Mizrahi : Okay. Thank you. And just more generally on Europe, can you talk about the ability \u2013 your ability to put the price increases there and how that compares to the U.S? Thank you. Tom Werner : Yes, this is Tom. It\u2019s pretty similar to the U.S. and the team in our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture has done a terrific job managing the balance of customer mix, product mix and pricing through the marketplace. We\u2019ve had pressure in a couple of different markets, but overall and in general, it\u2019s pretty consistent with how we operate our pricing plans in the U.S. Adam Mizrahi : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Gallo from C.L. King. Michael Gallo : Hi, good morning. One question and one follow-up. First, when we look at your CapEx obviously, you spent almost half of what you\u2019re going to spend for the fiscal in Q1. And so free cash flow really is going to accelerate from here fairly significantly, particularly as you get to the back-half of the fiscal. So I was wondering how we should think about the uses of that cash what kind of things you might be looking at? And then also if you can provide us with an update of the coated fry test, and I think you alluded to on the last conference call with a global customer. Thanks. Robert McNutt : Yes, in terms of use of cash, I think as we\u2019ve said consistently, this is a growth business and a growing business. We\u2019ll continue to invest in the business, well within the band of our debt service or our leverage target, but still have some room there and we\u2019ll continue to make the required debt pay down. And then, as always, we consider what the appropriate use of the remainder in terms of rewarding shareholders. And so those are conversations we continue to have with the board and don\u2019t have anything specifically to speak to today. But we continue to consider that, but really first target is continue to invest in an attractive and growing business. Tom Werner : And in terms of the coated product that\u2019s progressing well and we expect that to be in market. So in calendar 2018, so that continues to move along. We\u2019re excited about it. It\u2019s a big opportunity for us. And I think, we believe it\u2019s going to do well in the marketplace. Michael Gallo : Great. Thanks a lot. Tom Werner : Okay. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Congbalay, I\u2019ll turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thank you for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please e-mail me, and then we can set up a call or if it\u2019s a quick question, obviously, I\u2019ll get back to you via e-mail as well. Have a good day, everyone. Thank you. Tom Werner : Thanks, everybody. Operator : And that does conclude our conference today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

King & Associates Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Lamb Weston Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded and at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, Vice President Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Also on our website is a brief presentation that we will use on today\u2019s call. Please note that during our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. In addition, some of today\u2019s prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Tom will provide an overview of our overall performance, as well as a summary of our strategic and capital allocation priorities. Rob will then provide the details on our second quarter results, our debt and cash flow and our updated fiscal 2018 outlook. Tom will wrap up with some closing remarks before opening up the call for questions. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to say that we delivered another solid quarter of sales and earnings growth, specifically, sales increased 4% driven by price/mix improvements, while volume declined slightly versus a tough prior year comparable, as well as decisions we made to exit some lower margin business. Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures increased 12% to about a $190 million. Our performance in the quarter reflect strong execution across the organization and our continued focus on delivering the right product at the right time, every time for our customers. For example, our global teams completed customer contract negotiations and agreed on terms which are in aggregate in line with our expectations. The food service team grew volume across its customer base, while continuing to improve pricing and mix. The retail team expanded distribution of Grown in Idaho branded products delivering nearly 60% ACV in supermarkets in just six months and in Europe, our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture delivered another solid quarter behind disciplined pricing. The supply chain team started up our new 300 million pound French fry line in Richland, Washington, on time and on budget. We are now ramping up production on the state-of-the-art line and expect to have it operating their full capacity by the end of this fiscal year. The supply chain team has also had the opportunity to more fully assess this year\u2019s potato crop. We consider the overall quality and storability to be in line with our planned expectations. So with our solid first half performance, the commercial and supply chain teams executing against our priorities, customer contract negotiations now behind us, the start-up of our new French fry line on track, the potato crop quality and yield in line with our expectations and continued favorable operating conditions, we have clarity on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are raising our outlook for full fiscal year 2018. We now expect sales to grow at a mid-single-digit rate and adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures to be $780 million to $790 million. Rob will provide more details on our updated outlook later on in the call. This strong execution by our commercial and supply chain teams is a continuation of the performance these teams have been delivering for a number of years and has built a solid foundation for driving our strategic plan as an independent company. Las month, we reviewed our strategic plan with our Board of Directors and we are fully aligned with the planned strategic priorities. I\u2019d like to walk you through some of the plan\u2019s highlights beginning on Slide 5. Let me start with our vision and mission for the company, which has not changed since Investor Day. We aim to be the number one global potato company by creating solutions that inspire and serve our customers and consumers with the food they love and trust. Today, we are number one in North America and a strong number two globally. But being number one means more than just focusing on market share, it also means being preferred with our customers, preferred with our growers, preferred partners in innovation, and perhaps most importantly, preferred with our employees. As you can see on the next slide, we believe we can become the global leader by executing on three strategic priorities; accelerating category and customer growth; differentiating our global supply chain to drive growth; and investing for growth. These three strategies are what we have been executing over the past year. They are an evolution of what we presented a year ago at our Investor Day after having completed an extensive market and customer segmentation analysis, we\u2019ve chosen to increasingly focus on these strategies that will drive our capital and organizational investments going forward. Let me give you a quick overview of each. First, we are looking to accelerate growth of the frozen potato category by investing in and supporting specific customers, restaurant segments and markets, as well as expanding our range of product offerings through innovation. In our global unit, that means continuing to focus on our traditional restaurant segments and customers, like quick service and fast casual burger and chicken chains, while penetrating non-traditional frozen potato product outlets such as convenient stores and coffee houses. It also means continued focus on fast-growing markets like China and Southeast Asia and continued support of our growing customers across North America and internationally. In our food service segment, our strategy is to line resources to focus on the smaller quick service and fast casual chains in North America as they continue to add units and expand geographically, while continuing to support our distributor partners and independent restaurants. We\u2019ll also look to strengthen ties with other types of fast-growing outlets such as entertainment venues and restaurants within grocery stores. In our Retail segment, we\u2019ll look to expand distribution and gain share by continuing to leverage our three tier strategy offering premium Alexia branded products, mainstream products through Grown in Idaho, and license brands and private-label products. Our second strategic priority is to differentiate our global supply chain to support growth and strengthen our competitive advantage as a low-cost producer. We\u2019ll continue to drive productivity and cost savings by leveraging our Lamb Weston operating culture of continuous improvement. You\u2019ve already seen the benefits of this culture with our supply chain team\u2019s track record of stretching existing capacity to support volume growth, improve raw recovery rates and manage manufacturing costs to expand gross margins. In addition, we\u2019ll continue to build a true integrated end-to-end global supply chain, grounded and unified information systems and processes. This will further enhance production efficiencies and cost savings across North America and with our joint venture partners. And as we continue to invest in manufacturing assets outside North America, we will look to create a raw potato sourcing model in emerging growing regions that is similar to the one we built in the Pacific Northwest. This will enable us to have an ongoing supply of cost advantage raw products that would meet the needs of our customers over the long-term. Our third strategic priority is to continue to invest for growth. We believe that demand will continue to grow at an attractive rate for the foreseeable future and industry capacity will continue to be challenged to keep up with that growth over the long-term. Lamb Weston has consistently committed capital to increase capacity. In the past five years, and including a recent announcement to expand our Hermiston facility, we will have invested more than $800 million to expand capacity. In addition, we remain committed to our [base] [ph] capital program to reduce cost, stretch capacity, and keep our factories well maintained, so that we can operate them at high utilization rates while maintaining our high standards for safety and quality. With these investments, we\u2019ve been able to support our customers\u2019 growth and gain shares. We\u2019ll continue to invest in new capacity as long as we see opportunities to grow and generate strong returns. We will also complement these investments by seeking acquisitions in regions where we may have an ability to accelerate our growth. These would generally be bolt-on transactions, which we can readily afford within our capital structure and will be in potato-related categories. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at a specific example of our strategy of investor growth on Slide 7. A couple of weeks ago, we announced plans to invest $250 million to add 300 million pounds of French fry capacity at our Hermiston Oregon facility by the end of fiscal 2019. The reasons we are doing this now are pretty straightforward. For the last couple of years, demand growth has been strong, while industry capacity in North America has been operating at unsustainably high levels of utilization. As a result, volume growth has been constrained and service levels have been challenged. These are some of the reasons why our competitors plan to expand capacity over the next few years. But as you can see on the chart on Slide 7, even with these additions, we anticipate that utilization levels will remain high through fiscal 2022. We anticipate that our capacity expansion in Hermiston will enable industry utilization levels to approach the mid-90\u2019s historical range in fiscal 2020. However, even with this additional capacity, we believe that demand growth would continue to keep utilization levels above the historical range tampering any industry pricing pressures due to supply/demand dynamics. For Lamb Weston specifically, the Hermiston expansion enables us to continue to support our customers\u2019 growth plans. It allows us to support increasing demand in North America, as well as exports to Asia where demand growth has been and is expected to remain strong. It will increase our investment in the community by adding 170 full-time positions and generate an attractive rate of return for our shareholders. I was at the Hermiston plant during the quarter reviewing plans with the team and I am very confident that we\u2019ll execute this important project as well as we did with our expansion in Richland. This decision to invest in new capacity reflects our broader balanced capital allocation policy based on returns and executed with discipline. As you can see on Slide 8, our first priority has been and will continue to be investing to support growth of our customers in the frozen potato category. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we believe that the demand for frozen potato products will continue to grow at an attractive rate over the long-term, both in North America and in international markets. As a result, we believe that there are number of opportunities to generate solid returns by investing strategically through both capacity expansion and acquisitions. After funding higher return investments to support growth, we\u2019ll look to other opportunities to deploy cash. With respect to our balance sheet, we will continue to target a leverage range of 3.5 to 4 times adjusted EBITDA. In the near-term, we expect to be at or below the low-end of that range, which will provide flexibility to pursue acquisitions. We expect to reduce our leverage through EBITDA growth rather than by significantly paying down debt. We will also return capital to shareholders. We recently increased our dividend to 76.5 cents on an annualized basis or about 35% of our latest 12 months adjusted earnings per share. We expect to continue to pay a competitive dividend and we\u2019ll target a payout ratio of 25% to 35% of adjusted EPS. While we currently do not have a share buyback program, we would consider one if we don\u2019t see sufficient high return capacity expansion or acquisition opportunities. So as our second quarter and first half results show, we are performing well in a favorable operating environment. We have good visibility into how we see the rest of the year unfolding and we have raised our annual outlook for sales growth and EBITDA accordingly. We also believe that we are well-positioned to create shareholder value over the long-term. We are a leader in a growing global category. We have advantage, scale and capabilities. We are focused on executing on a clear set of strategic priorities and we take a balanced returns-based approach to capital allocation. Now let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our second quarter results and our updated outlook for the year. Robert McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered another strong quarter behind solid execution by our commercial and supply chain teams, specifically, net sales grew 4% to $825 million. Price/mix was up 5% as we continue to benefit from pricing and mix improvement actions taken in fiscal 2017, as well as actions implemented in the first half of fiscal 2018. Volumes declined 1% against a 4% increase in the prior year quarter, as constrained capacity led us to balance incremental business opportunities with maintaining high levels of service by exiting some lower margin business. Clearly, our new Richland line will mitigate this issue considerably. For the first half, volume was up 1%. Gross profit increased $10 million or up 5% versus the prior year. Higher price/mix, volume and productivity drove that improvement. This more than offset the impact of commodity, manufacturing, transportation and warehouse cost inflation, as well as about $3 million of additional costs related to the start-up of our new production line in Richland. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points to 25.4%, despite a nearly 40 basis point headwind from the Richland start-up costs. SG&A expense in the second quarter, excluding items impacting comparability was $65 million, that\u2019s up about $1 million versus last year. Essentially, all of that increase was related to incremental cost associated with building capabilities to operate as a standalone public company. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was up $9 million or 7% to $144 million. Solid sales and gross profit growth drove the increase. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures were $12 million, up from about $6 million last year. These amounts included an unrealized loss of $2.7 million in the current quarter related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with foreign currency hedging contracts and a $0.7 million gain in the prior year quarter. Excluding these mark-to-market adjustments equity earnings increased about $9 million due to significantly lower potato cost and modest improvements in price/mix in Europe. In addition, our Minnesota-based Lamb-Weston/RDO joint venture continued to benefit from the favorable U.S. operating environment. So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA, including the proportional EBITDA from our two unconsolidated joint ventures increased about $21 million, or 12% to $190 million. Higher earnings in our base business drove more than two-thirds of the increase. Moving on to earnings per share, adjusted diluted EPS declined $0.09 to $0.54. Operating gains essentially offset the impact of a higher effective tax rate. EPS decline is due to a $0.09 headwind from higher interest expense resulting from the additional debt we took on in connection with our spinoff from ConAgra. Now let\u2019s take a quick look at the results for each of our business segments. Net sales for our Global segment were up 1% in the quarter. Price/mix rose 3% reflecting price increases, as well as improvement in customer and product mix. Volume was down 2%, as the global team walked away from some less profitable volume in order to support service levels. This decision was a direct result of our capacity constraints. The decline also reflects the tough compare of plus 5% in the prior year. Another part of the decline relates to lower shipments to some export markets. This includes Korea where consumer traffic has been down due to unproven claims of food safety issues none of which are related to our products. Importantly, we continue to have solid demand growth in North America driven primarily by our strategic chain restaurant customers. Global\u2019s product contribution margin which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense declined $4 million or about 4% in the quarter. The decline was essentially a result of higher depreciation expense and start-up costs related to the new Richland line. Similar to the first quarter, we anticipate that while improved price/mix would offset our higher manufacturing cost on a dollar basis, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to hold our product contribution margin percentage. As a result, along with the Richland start-up cost, Global\u2019s product contribution margin percentage declined about a 120 basis points versus the prior year. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect Global\u2019s product contribution margin percentage will expand in the back half of fiscal 2018, as we implement new pricing structures associated with recently renewed contracts. Net sales for our Food Service segment increased 9% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 8% reflecting the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in the latter half of fiscal 2017, as well as some pricing actions taken in the first half of this fiscal year. We also continue to improve customer and product mix and volume was up a point driven by broad based growth across the segment\u2019s customer base. Food Service\u2019s product contribution margin increased 15% as favorable price/mix more than offset inflation and the Richland depreciation start-up costs. As a result, product contribution margin percentage expanded by a 180 basis points. Net sales for our Retail segment grew by 6%. Price/mix increased 4% due to higher prices across our branded and private-label portfolio. This was partially offset by increased trade spending in support of expanding distribution for Grown in Idaho. Volume was up 2%, primarily driven by the introduction of Grown in Idaho, and growth of Alexia and other branded products. Despite the sales increase, Retail\u2019s product contribution margin declined about $1.5 million in the quarter and product contribution margin percentage declined 260 basis points. This was mainly due to higher trade and advertising support for Grown in Idaho. Finally, net sales in our Other segment increased 6% due to improved price/mix in our Vegetable business. Product contribution margin was about $4 million versus a modest loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The loss last year included about $2 million of expense related to the recall of some vegetable products that were produced by a third-party. Switching to our balance sheet and cash flow, our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.5 billion, up about $50 million from the end of the first quarter. That\u2019s due to the seasonality of our working capital, which was financed with our revolving credit lines. Our revolver balance tends to be highest in the second quarter when we build raw potato and finished goods inventories during the fall harvest period and when we pay our growers. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio remain at 3.6 times, which is inside our target range of 3.5 to 4. With respect to cash flow, we generated more than $180 million in cash from operations in the first half of the year, up $20 million versus the prior year period. It\u2019s important to note that operating cash flow improves in the back half of the year, as we work down raw potato and finished goods inventories. For capital expenditures, we invested about $155 million in the first half with much of this spent on our newly operational production line in Richland. Let me now turn to our updated fiscal 2018 outlook. As Tom mentioned, we\u2019ve raised our outlook for the year based on our solid first half performance and getting past some key operating milestones including finishing customer contract negotiations, fully assessing the fall potato harvest and starting up our Richland production line We feel good about how the year is progressing and believe that we have good visibility on the operating environment and customer and consumer dynamics affecting the North American and global frozen potato category. This gives us confidence that we can deliver our higher sales and earnings targets for fiscal 2018. Specifically, for net sales, we are targeting a growth rate at a mid-single-digit level, up from our previous target of low to mid-single-digits. We continue to anticipate price/mix improving in the back half of the year as new pricing structures for recently renewed contracts become effective, especially in our global segment. In addition, our new Richland line should begin to ease our capacity constraints. On a per pound basis, we expect overall cost of potatoes to be in line with our previous guidance. However, we now expect non-potato costs on a per pound basis may increase a bit more than our initial low-single-digit estimate. This is primarily due to higher transportation and warehousing costs. Nonetheless, we anticipate that our improvements in price/mix, volume, growth and productivity will more than offset cost inflation resulting in gross margin expansion. Our view on SG&A is essentially unchanged. For the year, we expect SG&A to increase versus the pro forma 2017 baseline of $260 million due to higher advertising and promotional expense in support of the rollout of Grown in Idaho products in retail, as well as inflation. Putting this all together, we\u2019ve increased our adjusted EBITDA including joint ventures target to a range of $780 million to $790 million from the $740 million to $760 million target we provided at the beginning of the year. The midpoint of this higher range is a 13% increase versus the pro forma 2017 amount of $692 million. We continue to see interest expense in the range of $105 million to $110 million. That\u2019s up about $50 million from fiscal 2017 due to the full year impact of our post-spinoff capital structure. As you saw in our first half results, higher interest expense was a significant headwind to our earnings per share, but that headwind should ease beginning in the third quarter. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first half was about 33.5%. We are still evaluating the impacts of the new tax legislation as it was only recently signed into law. For now I can say the following : first, we\u2019ll benefit from the U.S. federal corporate tax being reduced from 35% to 21%. However, we haven\u2019t completed our estimated of the law\u2019s impact on our vested tax rate for the second half or the blended effective tax rate for the full year. Second, based on our preliminary analysis of the new law, we estimate our long-term effective tax rate including foreign and state taxes will be in the mid-20s. As a primarily U.S.-based exporter this helps level the playing field and improves our competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis other historically low jurisdiction competitor \u2013 low tax jurisdiction competitors. And third, we will recognize one-time discrete tax impacts when we report our third quarter earnings. These include a non-cash benefit from remeasuring our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities on our balance sheet at a lower tax rate. This will be partially offset by taxes on historical unremitted foreign earnings with the cash tax \u2013 cash impact spread over the next eight years. We\u2019ll provide a more definitive view of the impact of the new tax law after we examine it in its entirety. And finally, we\u2019ve raised our estimate for capital expenditures for the year to $250 million from the $225 million. The $25 million increase in our CapEx target reflects early spending on our new production line at our Hermiston Oregon facility. We\u2019ll spend the remaining $225 million associated with this investment in fiscal 2019. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Rob. As you can see, we are executing well across the organization. We delivered solid first half results, started up our new production line and have good visibility into how the rest of the year will play out. As a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver the higher sales and EBITDA targets in our updated outlook. We will continue to execute on our three strategic priorities focusing on specific customers, restaurant segments, and geographies, as well as expanding our range of product offerings through innovation, differentiating our global supply chain to strengthen our competitive advantage as a low cost producer and investing in additional capacity and acquisition opportunities to support growth. We are well-positioned to serve and grow with our customers, generate solid returns, and create value for all our stakeholders over the long-term. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston and we are now happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Good morning everybody and Happy New Year. Tom Werner : Good morning, Bryan. Robert McNutt : Good morning, Bryan. Happy New Year. Bryan Spillane : So, I had a question just back to slide 7 and I think on that slide, in the footnote you talk about off of a 12.7 billion pound base that you expect that the growth rate for North American exports to be between 2% and 2.3% between, I guess, 2017 and 2022. Can you remind us how that forecast range compares to, I guess, what you were thinking or what you were communicating back at the Investor Day last year. I guess, if I remember it right, at least the North American growth rate was about a 0.5%. So, to give us some context in terms of just how that\u2019s changed versus which our original expectations were when you first talked to the street. Tom Werner : Right, Bryan, this is Tom. We\u2019ve increased our outlook on what we think the overall category is going to grow based on, really the last 12 to 18 months in North America specifically. Our estimates are, the category has been growing between 1.5% to 2.5% and we expect that to continue. As you think through the big driver of that is the QSR space and as that continues to improve in traffic, we expect the growth in North America to be in the 2% range and globally, we are forecasting around 2% to 2.5% over the next four, five years. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then, I guess, if we are looking at a \u2013 if that forecast being revised higher and then connected back to the long-term growth rate of mid to high-single-digit EBITDA growth and high-single-digit EPS growth, can you just talk to \u2013 with, I guess, the sales outlook higher for the industry, how that might impact you versus your long-term algorithm, I guess, at least in the medium-term? Robert McNutt : Yes, I think, Bryan, this is Rob. The \u2013 again, as you would expect, as we move the top-line growth up, obviously, that\u2019s going to impact, one, investment opportunities for us, but then, also going to impact the bottom-line. We are still in that same range in terms of EBITDA growth is what we are forecasting at this point. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And just one last one related to that, just, I guess, with capacity, with the industry over a 100% capacity utilization, is that sort of having a negative effect on leverage? Are you at a point now where you actually need a little bit of buffer in capacity in order to get more optimal in terms of operating leverage? I\u2019ll leave it there. Tom Werner : Yes, Bryan, I would say, certainly in terms of operating leverage as you run at the high utilization rates that we have, you get a benefit and I think, over the long-term, as we bring our capacity online, it\u2019s going to be more balanced in terms of utilization rates that are more sustainable within our factories. Bryan Spillane : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Mizrahi with Berenberg Capital Markets. Adam Mizrahi : Good morning guys. I have a question on the Richland capacity. How much of the 300 million pounds added do you expect to be incremental versus taking some of the heat of the existing facilities? And then, following up from this, how significant do you think Taco Bell going national with its nacho prices in terms of filling up this Richland capacity? Thank you. Tom Werner : Well, I think, in terms of the Richland capacity, there will be a bit of balancing upfront, Adam. But we expect, based on our outlook that we\u2019ll fill that line up within the next 18 months and that\u2019s the reason that we made the decision to invest in our Hermiston plant. So the second question you had in terms of that specific customer, we don\u2019t publicly talk about individual customers. So, I\u2019ll leave it at that. Adam Mizrahi : Okay, great. And then, if I can follow-up on the equity earnings, can you talk about how much of the growth in the quarter is driven by Europe versus the U.S.? And I think on the last call, you mentioned that you are starting to see some pricing pressure in the European export market as new European capacity comes online? Are you starting to now see some of that impact flowing into the domestic European market as well? Robert McNutt : Yes, Adam, this is Rob. The vast majority of that improvement in the equity earnings is out of Europe and again as you know or recall that last year, we had relatively high potato prices in Europe which impacted our cost structure. The guys in Europe were \u2013 the team in Europe was able to pass that through and as potato cost have come off this year, they\u2019ve maintained it within Europe the pricing levels at those higher levels. So therefore expanded margins and so that\u2019s the bulk of it. Where we\u2019ve seen some pressure is and continue to see pressure is really in Middle Eastern export markets out of Europe and that continues to be a bit of a dogfight. But within Europe, itself, prices continue to remain relatively stable. Now, having said that, looking forward, based on historical practice, we are expecting some price pressure in Europe back half of this year and into early, maybe next fiscal year. Adam Mizrahi : Great, thanks very much. Robert McNutt : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Andrew Carter : Good morning guys. This is Andrew Carter on for Chris. Can you hear me? Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew good morning. Robert McNutt : Good morning. Andrew Carter : Good morning. Okay, so just, given kind of looking at Slide 7, just the industry be above a historic capacity utilization for the near-term, I mean with Hermiston coming online. I guess, what we are scratching our head with, it would seem that it need another facility expansion side-by-side the Hermiston in the next [12-18] [ph] months. I mean, is that\u2019s something I mean, am I thinking the right thing there? Tom Werner : Andrew, this is Tom. I think, as we have in the past, we\u2019ve been very disciplined over the last four, five years as we continue to analyze the category and think through category growth going forward. And as we get down the path in the next couple of years, and we continue to see the category grow at the rates we believe it will. Certainly, our intent is, as I\u2019ve stated earlier, we continue to invest in this business and capacity investment in Lamb Weston has really good returns. We are focused on the category and that\u2019s what we are going to continue to do over the long-term. So, to answer your question, yes, that\u2019s going to be a continuation and the timing of that in the out years is going to be really dependent upon what\u2019s happening in the category. Andrew Carter : Sure. Okay. Kind of second question just to get back to FY 2018 here. You increased your guidance range for the year, but the back half guidance still kind of implies the deceleration in terms of EBITDA growth. That\u2019s with all the kind of \u2013 some of the tailwinds you got coming online, you got additional capacity, additional pricing. What\u2019s limiting that? Is it just your outlook for higher inflation and also, I don\u2019t know if you gave it, did you give a total input cost inflation number for the year? Robert McNutt : We did not give a - this is Rob. We did not give a total input cost inflation for the year. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we do see higher inflation in the transportation and warehousing. In addition, in terms of the EPS impact, and earnings impact, we\u2019ve got the extra depreciation load coming in. Now, having said all that, take the caveat, not around EBITDA but around EPS, we are still working out the impacts of the tax law changes. Andrew Carter : Sure. Okay. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks guys. Robert McNutt : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Hi, good morning and congratulations on another very solid quarter. Tom Werner : Good morning, Akshay. Robert McNutt : Good morning. Akshay Jagdale : So, thanks again for all the extra color, especially on the capacity. So my first question is on the utilization rate chart. How should we think about what you presented and the relationship of that with pricing right? Fractionally for the industry, how would you envision pricing trends given what you are projecting for utilization rates? Tom Werner : Yes, Akshay, this is Tom. I think, our competitors are putting on capacity over the next couple of years. Certainly, with our announcement, we are adding more capacity. Our belief is, as we look at the category in total and the growth rates that have been happening in the last several years, we expect those to continue. The new capacity coming online, it will balance itself out just based on demand growth and the North America\u2019s growth is better than we expected and the continued growth in some of the emerging markets. So, Akshay, I think, there may be pockets of imbalance over the next couple of years, but I don\u2019t expect that to materially impact our pricing going forward. Akshay Jagdale : That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just to follow-up on that, really what I am trying to get your high level perspective on \u2013 and again, this is more of an industry question. Given, we have, on our side have limited history of what the industry looks like, right, I am just trying to get a sense of, has there been a period of time since you\u2019ve been in the industry where pricing has meaningful step-down. I mean, our research tells us that, it has not and what you are projecting for utilization rates, I mean, it doesn\u2019t seem to me that we will see that any time soon. So, can you give us some perspective, I mean, directionally, in the sense on this, expecting sort of the price/mix gains for the industry to stabilize as utilization rates come in a little bit or could or to where pricing could come down? Tom Werner : Akshay, let me give you a perspective. I\u2019ve been around this business off and on for the past eight, nine years both directly and indirectly. And the only period where there was pressure in terms of the price side of it was after the 2008 financial downturn and that was just a function of \u2013 it seems, what was going on economically, but I would say, over the last three, four years, five years, has been very consistent in terms of volume growth and pricing discipline in the marketplace. Akshay Jagdale : Okay, and just one last one, which is more on the long-term strategy. So, you guys have proven that you are the cost by a wide margin and the growth in the numbers have been phenomenal right. So, help us put into context the three initiatives that you talked about the strategic priorities like, if we look through the next five years, where would you see the most impact in terms of change, right, because you are a standalone company. We think you\u2019d be more nimble, et cetera, but this is really the first time you see that it\u2019s going to change things, right. So, where do you think in the P&L if you are \u2013 we should see the most impact from these strategic priorities? Thank you. Tom Werner : Yes, Akshay. I would say, if you \u2013 as I think through the three strategies, it\u2019s really a continuation of what we\u2019ve been executing over the last 12 to 24 months. In terms of your question on where I see the most change, I am not going to get into all the specific details underneath these three strategies, but, we certainly have initiatives in place within each one of them that, that will deliver the business and the financials going forward. So, it\u2019s not going to be a lot of dramatic change, I\u2019ll tell you that. But it\u2019s going to be very focused, disciplined, executing the business. We\u2019ve got \u2013 really, the big thing is focusing on resources and setting the organization up to be successful going forward and just being very methodical and disciplined about executing against our initiatives underneath these strategies. Akshay Jagdale : Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Robert McNutt : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : First, just a question on the volume in the quarter, the content \u2013 and some of the small gains in food service and the capacity constraints that you had on, but there is clearly is a real kind of company level margin mix benefit from those kinds of actions. Can you talk about how sustainable do you think that mix shift could be or with the new capacity at Richland just comes out at this point was the temporary move because you were just that volume range, it would seem to me that with broad based trends in food service and through distribution that that you should be prioritizing that mix and so some of the global customers where you could? Robert McNutt : Yes, this is Rob. In terms of that impact, I mean, clearly, as we\u2019ve talked about the last couple of quarters that that we\u2019ve really been running the assets hard and so we have capacity constraints. We pulled some out of inventory. But we\u2019ve continued to look not only within each of the segments, but across the segments of where is the most profitable business, where our strategic customers in terms of the long-term growth customers, long-term profitable, most profitable customers. And so, that\u2019s where you make those hard decisions to take out some of the more transactional business as lower margin when you get into these capacity constraints like this. Now that we have that relief, clearly we\u2019ll continue to grow with our very profitable food service business and support those strategic customers in that businesses as we go forward. But I think it also allows us to open up some more capacity into more of the global segment. So we should get some of the growth back in the global segment as we look forward as Richland comes up, and as the Hermiston line comes up. And so, just as you look at balancing among the segments, clearly, we got some margin push overall here in the near-term. But as we bring this more capacity online, clearly that\u2019s going to impact margins, still very profitable customers, but maybe not quite as profitable on those incremental customers, those incremental pounds as we\u2019ve been able to get here recently. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, prepared remarks, there was a bit more discussion, kind of potential acquisitions, then there had been in recent calls, and I was hoping you could maybe kind of frame with some of the key characteristics and hurdles that you look at on M&A. I presume that\u2019s high international focus, optimal size, just return hurdles accretion benchmarks that you could share if M&A, maybe bubbling up on the capital allocation agenda a little bit? Robert McNutt : Sure, Adam, it\u2019s part of our playbook and it\u2019s been \u2013 if you go back to Investor Day, we\u2019ve specifically called that out in terms of capital allocation and it\u2019s always going to be opportunistic. We are going to look at opportunities within the categories and as everybody knows, those things are hard to predict if and when they are going to happen. But the point is, when we have those opportunities, we are going to get involved in M&A and it\u2019s part of our investor growth strategic pillar. In terms of the filters we go through, I am not going to get into all of that, right now. But, it\u2019s more about \u2013 it\u2019s part of our strategic pillar and we are going to have our ear to the ground within the category and if we have an opportunity, we are going to execute against that. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on. Robert McNutt : Thanks. Tom Werner : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our final question from Michael Gallo with C.L. King. Michael Gallo : Hi, good morning and congratulations, again on a solid quarter. My question is on, the capacity \u2013 the new capacity at Richland and the capacity expansion. It was notable that you are modeling the line at Hermiston on the line at \u2013 off the line, you just put up at Richland. I was wondering, what you are seeing on that line in terms of how it\u2019s performing versus your legacy capacity? And whether we should think about this capacity, that newer capacity as it comes online as perhaps more efficient and higher margin than your legacy capacity? Thanks. Tom Werner : Michael, this is Tom. The last two or three investments we\u2019ve made in terms of adding new capacity, we continued to upgrade technology. We make improvements. So, four years ago, five years ago, we put in Boardman line. We took learnings from that and applied it to our Richland line and we have a lot of capabilities in terms of freight cuts, sizings on these lines. So it gives us flexibility. And we also, as we started up the Richland line, and have learned even more. We apply that to our next line in terms of the Hermiston blueprints and they are more efficient. They are more cost-effective. They are lower cost from just in terms of the technology that we invest in these new lines. So, to answer to your question, yes, they are more efficient lines and it gives us the ability as we look across our network and all the production facilities and lines. We have to really balance it out and help improve our profitability just based on the business mix we can move around in the factories. Michael Gallo : Okay, great to hear. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Hi, this is Dexter. Thank you for joining us today. Available for any follow-up calls today and tomorrow and into early next week. For those of you on the East Coast stay safe and we\u2019ll talk to you later. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

King Operator : Good day and welcome to the Lamb Weston Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. In addition, some of today\u2019s prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Tom will provide an overview of our performance as well as some highlights and key operational updates. Rob will then provide details on our third quarter results, our debt and cash flow and our updated fiscal 2018 outlook. Tom will wrap up with some closing remarks before opening up the call for questions. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our strong quarter of sales, earnings and cash flow growth reflects the benefits of our capital expansion investments, our laser focus on delivering industry leading customer service and new product innovation in the market, and our commitment to operational excellence. Sales grew 12% driven by good balance of higher price mix and volume growth. Adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, increased 25% to about $240 million. And through the first 9 months of the year, we generated about $310 million of cash flow from operations, up about $55 million versus the prior year period. Because of this strong performance, we are raising our outlook for fiscal 2018. We now expect our sales growth rate to be at the upper end of our targeted mid single-digit range and adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures to be $805 million to $810 million. Rob will provide more details on our updated outlook later on the call. Our results this quarter reflect how well our commercial and supply chain teams continued to execute on our strategic and financial objectives. But before I run through some of the highlights and key operational updates, I want to take a moment and thank all the Lamb Weston team members for the completion of our post-spin transition services with our former parent. There was a tremendous amount of heavy lifting all across our company to complete the transition on time and we did it seamlessly while continuing to drive our business results. I cannot emphasize enough how proud I am of the team. Now, moving to our key highlights for the quarter. First, our new 300 million pound French fry line in Richland, Washington is up and running providing us with much needed additional flexibility across our manufacturing network to support customer growth, innovation and service levels. Having the new line startup and run at planned levels was key to driving our strong volume growth in the quarter. I want to thank the team that brought this project to realization on time, on budget and with remarkable safety performance. Second, we have broken ground for our 300 million pound French fry line in Hermiston, Oregon. Favorable weather conditions have allowed us to accelerate the construction and we have increased CapEx spending in the near-term to reflect that. We continue to expect the new line to be operational towards the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. And finally, our new 180 million pound facility in Russia became operational this quarter. The team there is in the process of securing customer qualification of the line and will begin ramping up production to support increasing demand in that market. As you may recall, our interest in this plant is through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture in Europe, which is a minority owner of this facility. In addition to progress on the capacity front, we have also finalized price agreements in each growing reason for the 2018 potato crop. Just like we do every year, our next step in the annual process is to enter into contracts with individual growers and we expect to complete this process relatively soon. For competitive reasons, we don\u2019t provide many details regarding contracted potato prices and acreage requirements. Our approach to contracting raw potato supply has been and will continue to be to work with growers so that they make a fair return over and above their costs. We want to ensure that they can reinvest in their businesses and we look at these partnerships over the long-term horizon. Like many other agricultural sectors input costs whether its for seed, fertilizer, labor or capital have been rising, so it\u2019s fair to assume that raw potato prices would increase as well. As a result, we expect our weighted average contracted per pound raw potato price to increase in the low to mid single-digit range. However, it\u2019s really important to remember that contracted prices are only one element of understanding our total potato cost. Potato yield, quality and how they hold up in stores are all keys to determining how the potatoes perform in our production facilities and our actual costs. Much of that is not known until our fiscal second quarter. We will provide a view on total manufacturing costs when we provide our fiscal 2019 outlook in late July with appropriate updates as the year progresses. Switching to our top line performance, limited time offers or LTOs innovation and retail sales execution help to accelerate growth, drive category news and share gains in the quarter. Opportunities to supply customers with limited time offers are a core part of our long-term growth story and in the third quarter they were meaningful contributors. Most of this was centered in our global segment. A few LTOs accounted for about half of that segment\u2019s volume growth. Going forward, our new fry capacity gives us more flexibility to partner with customers to develop additional innovative limited time offerings and help them drive traffic and business growth [ph]. On the innovation front we recently announced an exciting new platform called Crispy on Delivery. It\u2019s a comprehensive solution that enables fries to stay hot and crispy for the fast growing home delivery channel. It\u2019s a new coated fry that stays crispy for up to 30 minutes when put in a unique proprietary packaging system that allows moisture to escape while keeping the fries warm. This fry and packaging combination is the first of its kind in the market. It is a promising solution to help customers expand delivery of fry which are typically the highest margin food product on their menus while meeting a clear consumer opportunity. While we are on the front end of showing this product solution to our customers and while it\u2019s still early, I am very excited about the possibilities surrounding this offering and we are looking forward to partnering with our customers. In our Retail segment Grown in Idaho branded products continued to gain distribution with shipments beginning late in the quarter to a few large new customers. This should provide a tailwind for Grown in Idaho in the fourth quarter and as we exit the year. Over the next few months we will step up marketing investments to support this growth and that of our other brands. Our regional strategy is clearly working together Grown in Idaho Alexia branded, license branded and private label products have captured nearly 5 points of market share over the past year. And before turning the call over to Rob, I am pleased to announce that Mike Smith will lead our foodservice and retail business units. Mike has been with Lamb Weston for more than 10 years, most recently partnering with me in leading the development of our overall business strategy and the redesign of our innovation process. Mike is an excellent example of the depth of talent in our organization and a great fit for this role. He will take over our foodservice team that has driven strong sales and earnings growth over the past few years and retail team that has continued to expand distribution of our branded portfolio. Mike will be taking over from Rod Hepponstall who is leaving the company to become the CEO of a publicly traded food company outside potato category. I would like to thank Rod for his leadership and contribution to Lamb Weston and I wish Rod and his family well as they embark on this new adventure. So as our strong third quarter and year-to-date results show, our commercial and supply chain teams are executing well and the operating environment continues to be favorable. As a result, we have raised our annual outlook for sales growth and adjusted EBITDA. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to create shareholder value over the long-term by focusing on our strategic and operational objectives. Now let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our third quarter results and our updated outlook for the year. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter. We executed well across the organization and delivered strong top and bottom line growth and generated strong cash flow. Specifically, as compared to third quarter of 2017, sales grew 12% to $863 million. Price mix increased 7%, up from the 4% that we delivered in the first half. This was primarily due to implementation of new pricing structures associated with recently renewed contracts in our Global segment and to a lesser degree in our retail segment. In addition in foodservice, we continued to benefit from pricing and mix improvement actions taken in fiscal 2017 as well as actions taken in the first half of fiscal 2018. Volume increased 5% led by growth in our global and retail segments. Gross profit increased $37 million or up 18% versus prior year. Higher price mix and volume growth drove the increase more than offsetting the impacts of higher transportation and warehousing cost, input cost inflation and higher depreciation expense primarily associated with our new production line in Richland. Our gross margin percentage expanded 130 basis points to more than 28%. SG&A expense, excluding items impacting comparability, increased $16 million to $73 million. Three factors primarily drove the increase. First, incremental labor benefits and infrastructure cost related to operating as a standalone public company; second, higher incentive compensation costs based on our year-to-date operating performance, including the true-up for the higher incentive accrual rate for the first half of the year; and third, increased investments in advertising and promotional support in our retail segment as we continue to expand distribution of Grown in Idaho branded products. As a result, adjusted income from operations in the quarter was up $21 million or 14% to $171 million. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe and Lamb Weston/RDO in Minnesota, were $26 million, up from about $13 million last year. These amounts include an unrealized gain of $2.5 million in the current quarter related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with commodity and foreign currency hedging contracts. This compares to a $1.4 million loss in the prior year quarter. In addition, equity earnings include a $4 million gain on sale related to divestiture of a non-core business in Europe as well as a $2 million currency translation benefit. Excluding these items, equity earnings increased a bit under $4 million. Lower potato costs in Europe as well as volume growth by both joint ventures primarily drove that increase. So, putting it altogether, adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, increased about $47 million or 25% to $238 million. Higher earnings in our base business drove about two-thirds of the increase. Let me take a couple of minutes to talk about the impact of tax reform enacted in December 2017. Compared with third quarter of fiscal 2017, tax reform decreased income tax expense and increased net income approximately $47 million or $0.31 per diluted share. The increase is made up of two items. First, we recorded a provisional $24 million net one-time discrete benefit, about $39 million relates to the benefit for re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities using the new statutory tax rate partially offset by a $15 million transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. The cash impact of this transition tax will take place over the next 8 years, but the expense was recognized in Q3. We have excluded this $24 million net benefit from adjusted earnings as a comparability item. Second, accounting rules require that we record the effect of changes in rates resulting from newly enacted tax laws in the period the change is effective. Accordingly, we have recorded a $23 million or $0.15 per diluted share benefit from the lower U.S. corporate tax rate in the third quarter. Because our fiscal year is not a calendar year a blended rate applies for fiscal 2018 resulting in a federal tax rate of approximately 29% for fiscal year 2018 and a 21% federal rate for fiscal years thereafter. About $14 million or $0.09 per share of the rate benefit is related to earnings reported in the first half of our fiscal year with about $9 million or $0.06 related to fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings. As a result, our overall effective tax rate in the third quarter, excluding comparability items for tax reform, was about 19%. For both the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018, we expect to have a blended overall effective tax rate excluding comparability items for tax reform of about 28%. Regarding earnings per share, adjusted diluted EPS was up $0.32 to $0.91. Operating gains and higher equity method investment earnings drove just over half of the increase, while about $0.15 of the increase was due to applying the lower tax rate as a result of recently enacted tax reform. Now, let\u2019s review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S. based chains as well as all other sales outside of North America, were up 15% in the quarter. Price mix rose 9% as we implemented new pricing structures associated with recently renewed contracts and continued to improve customer and product mix. We expect these new pricing structures will continue to deliver solid price mix growth in the fourth quarter. Volume grew 6%. As Tom mentioned, about half of this increase was driven by limited time product offerings. The other half of the increase was primarily driven by sales of base products to strategic customers in the U.S. We expect Global\u2019s volume growth to be solid for the remainder of the year as we continue to benefit from the sales of limited time product offerings and growth with our strategic customers. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to note that we will be lapping a more difficult prior year comparison with Global\u2019s volume up 4% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Global\u2019s product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense, increased $22 million or about 23% in the quarter. The increase was driven by favorable price mix and volume. This was partially offset by higher input costs, manufacturing transportation and warehouse cost inflation and higher depreciation expense associated with the new Richland line. In the third quarter, Global\u2019s margin percentage expanded by about 180 basis points. Year-to-date, it\u2019s up about 20 basis points. Sales for our foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, increased 5% in the quarter. Price mix increased 5% as compared to a 10% increase in the prior year period. The increase this quarter reflected pricing actions and continued improvement in customer and product mix. Volume grew nominally behind increased shipments of higher margin Lamb Weston branded and operator labeled products. However, this was mostly offset by the loss of some lower margin distributor labeled volume as we continue to be priced discipline when competing for these types of contracts. While we are confident about the long-term volume transfer of foodservice segment, we are being cautious about growth in the near-term that\u2019s because of loss of some distributor labeled volume will likely continue to be a headwind through the first half of fiscal 2019. And although demand by regional QSRs continues to be solid, we are beginning to see evidence of traffic slowing somewhat at independent restaurants. Nonetheless, we believe these factors are temporary. We expect industry capacity to remain tight allowing for a generally attractive pricing environment, including for distributor labeled volume. In addition, the U.S. economy remains strong, which should eventually lead to upward wage pressure and increased disposable income and higher food spending away from home. We are confident that we will be able to continue to drive earnings growth in the third quarter foodservices product contribution margin increased 7% as favorable price mix more than offset higher input costs and the Richland appreciation. Our product contribution margin percentage expanded by 80 basis points. In our retail segment, sales grew 31%. Volume was very strong up 22%. This was primarily driven by distribution gains of Grown in Idaho and other branded products as well as the timing of shipments of some private label products from the second quarter into the third. We don\u2019t expect to repeat this level of retail volume growth in the fourth quarter as we are unlikely to see similar timing impact of private label shipments. In addition, we will be facing a more difficult year-over-year comparison. Recall that volume growth was 1% in Q3 2017, but was plus 7% in Q4. Nonetheless, we do expect solid growth of Grown in Idaho to continue in the fourth quarter as we have only recently gained distribution in a few large new customers. We also expect solid volume growth for our other branded products. Retail sales growth was growth was also driven by a 9% increase in price mix. This was a result of higher prices across our branded and private label portfolio as well as improved mix. Increased trade spending in support of expanding distribution of Grown in Idaho partially offset this increase. Retail\u2019s product contribution margin increased 32% as higher volume and price mix more than offset cost inflation as well as stepped up advertising and promotional investments behind Grown in Idaho. Product contribution margin percentage expanded by 20 basis points. Switching to our balance sheet and cash flow, our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.4 billion, down about $65 million from the end of second quarter. Most of that decrease is a reduction in the balance of our revolving credit line, which we use primarily to finance working capital. As you may recall, our revolver balance tends to be highest in the second quarter and early into the third quarter. That\u2019s when we built raw potato and finished goods inventory during the fall harvest and when we pay many of our growers. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.4 times, slightly below our target of 3.5 to 4. We are comfortable being below our target range for a period of time as it provides additional balance sheet flexibility. With respect to cash flow, we have generated $310 million in cash from operations in the first nine months of the year, up $55 million versus the prior year period. A portion of this increase relates to lower cash taxes as a result of tax reform. Capital expenditures for the first 9 months are just over $200 million, which is about the same versus prior year period. Let me now turn to our updated fiscal 2018 outlook. As Tom mentioned, we have raised our outlook based on our solid year-to-date performance. For sales, we are targeting a growth rate at the upper end of the mid single-digit range we have previously provided. On a year-to-date basis, our sales are up about 7% driven by solid price mix and volume growth. Sales growth in the fourth quarter will likely be driven largely by price mix with many of the factors driving the increase in the third quarter also benefiting growth in the fourth quarter. Our volume growth in the fourth quarter may slow sequentially from the 5% that we delivered this quarter for a number of reasons. First, with our new Richland fry line fully operational, we have flexibility to take additional production lines down for scheduled maintenance without sacrificing customer service levels. Second, foodservice and retail volumes faced some headwinds that I described earlier. And third, we will be lapping a more difficult comparison versus the prior year. For adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, we have increased our target to be in the range of $805 million to $810 million, up from our previous target of $780 million to $790 million. The midpoint of this higher range is approximately a 17% increase versus a pro forma 2017 amount of $692 million. With respect to supply chain costs on a per pound basis, we continue to expect our overall cost of potatoes to be in line with our previous guidance. Non-potato costs will increase at a low to mid single-digit rate on a full year basis. In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect non-potato costs to increase at mid single-digit rate largely driven by transportation, warehousing and commodity inflation. Our annual SG&A costs will be a bit higher than we expected a few months ago. This is largely due to higher incentive compensation costs as a result of our strong operating performance as well as higher advertising and promotional investments behind Grown in Idaho as we continue to build distribution scale. In addition with interest rates increasing, we expect total interest expense of about $110 million, which is on the high-end of our previous target range of $105 million to $110 million. With respect to taxes as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate a full year overall effective tax rate, excluding comparability items related to tax reform and spin-off costs of approximately 28%. While we are still evaluating the longer term impact of the new tax law, we continue to estimate that our long-term effective tax rate, including foreign and state taxes, will be in the mid-20s. And finally, we have raised our capital expenditure target for the year to $270 million to $280 million, up from $250 million. This increase reflects accelerated spending on our new production line at our Hermiston, Oregon facility. We continue to expect the total cost of the new line to be about $250 million, with about $50 million spent in fiscal 2018 and remain on target to start the line up towards the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Let me now turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Rob. We are pleased with our third quarter financial results, our progress against operational goals and our ability to once again raise our sales and EBITDA targets for the year. We build good momentum behind strong execution and targeted investments in capacity and capabilities. As a result, we remained well positioned to serve and grown with our customers, generate solid returns and create value for all our stakeholders over the long-term. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston. And we are now happy to take your questions. Operator : Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We first go to Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Just two items if I could. I guess the first one is over the past few years, Lamb Weston certainly come in well ahead of its long-term EBITDA growth algorithm as you mentioned in your prepared remarks in a combination of pricing and the Global demand environment. I guess, as we think forward a bit, are there any items that you would call out even broadly that could dampen this sort of momentum. And I guess what I am getting at is what could be the unlock I guess in allowing Lamb to sort of update the EBITDA growth sort of algorithm given that you have fairly recently updated the long-term top line algorithm a bit? And then I have got a follow-up. Tom Werner : Sure. Andrew, it\u2019s Tom. As I think forward, just Global said everybody we have had several years of no inflation and the capacity demand, supply demand situation in the industry certainly has allowed us some great tailwinds. But going forward, we are going to have some inflation that we haven\u2019t experienced in several years that we are going to have to manage through. We have a great team and we will manage through that. But the last several years, we have been over the centerline of our long-term outlook and to expect that to continue is going to be hard-pressed. So, we have got some things coming at us, the next year, the team is working on it and we will give guidance in the Q4 late July on that front. Andrew Lazar : Okay, thanks for that. And then you mentioned that you lost some distributor labeled volume in the food spur space which I know is lower margin to begin with, but I am just curious where does that volume go just given how tight the capacity situation is in the industry? I didn\u2019t \u2013 I guess I thought that there just weren\u2019t that many options for folks to sort of leave various suppliers and go elsewhere? Tom Werner : Well, think of it this way, Andrew, as we continue to work on our overall portfolio and we are evaluating our customer mix and our SKUs in terms of overall margin profile, we are making choices and we have been making choices for the last 12 to 18 months in terms of volume that we just want to walk away from to pursue other opportunities in the marketplace. It\u2019s really some of the street business, the independence that as we clean up our SKU portfolio, we are making choices to walk away from that low margin business and point debt capacity elsewhere, so that\u2019s the big component of what\u2019s going on in foodservice segment right now. Andrew Lazar : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess first question just on some of the revenue trends in the quarter, some of the qualitative comments that you gave in the prepared remarks, I think you alluded to bit of a slowdown in some of the more independent foodservice business, if you could just expand on that a little bit? I know, there has been some weather issues in the Northeast this winter that might have impacted the comps, but wondering if you could give any additional color there? And then I have a follow-up. Tom Werner : Yes, there has been some weather impact, but we have seen in the foodservice channel the independence they are slowing down and the benefit of that is or the other side of that coin is in our QSR Global business unit, we are seeing a lot of good traction with our customers mix and how we are aligned with those customers. So, it\u2019s a put to take, but right now, overall, we are seeing a little slowdown in the foodservice segment. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess second question from me is related on the cost trends and I know you talked about an expectation for cost to tick higher, to stay more elevated on the potato side moving forward, but in the quarter itself on the Global side, it looks like unit cost did pickup pretty meaningfully, was there a mix impact there that the processing costs were higher. Just wondering anymore color on cost trends between potato and non-potato kind of what has changed relative to where you were 3, 6 months ago would be helpful? Rob McNutt : Yes, Adam. This is Rob. In terms of cost, couple of elements driving the increase there as we have talked about, we are seeing inflation in transportation and warehousing that I think others have seen we have been talking about that for the last several quarters, but it does seem to be accelerating a bit. The other side is we are seeing some other input cost inflation and then recognized and part of this is mix related, the depreciation of that new line in Richland is a little bit heavier weighted into that global business. So, you see a little bit more of that there. Adam Samuelson : Okay. But just to be clear on the cost side relative to where you would have been in January on earnings, it\u2019s the non-potato inflation, it\u2019s same, worse, just how is that tracked versus the expectation? Tom Werner : It\u2019s really where we expected it to be. Transportation, warehousing is the only thing that really is a little bit faster, but again for us that\u2019s not as big a deal as it might be for others. Adam Samuelson : Okay, great. That\u2019s all very helpful. I will pass it on. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Good morning and congratulations on outstanding quarter. Tom Werner : Thanks, Akshay. Akshay Jagdale : Yes. So, I wanted to \u2013 Tom, I wanted to ask you a little bit about Global, just this is the first quarter post the contracting right and I mean to say the results were exceptional would be an understatement there, especially on price mix. So my question really is you did this contracting several months ago and since then I would argue that demand has strengthened right especially in the U.S. with the LTO with one of your large customers going as well as it is. So, can you just put into perspective, where you see sort of capacity utilization rates over the next 12 months and maybe the next 24 months? I mean, just it looks like not much is going to change from an industry perspective on utilization rates, because even though some incremental capacity is coming online from you guys, seems like demand is more than making up for it. So, that\u2019s my first question just to get some color commentary from you guys on your expectations for utilization rates over the next 12 months and 24 months? Tom Werner : Akshay, a perspective I will give you is you step back and the industry has been running at high capacity utilization for the past several years. Based on how we are forecasting demand as I stated in my Q2 call between 1.5% and 2.5%, we expect that to continue. And if you think about what\u2019s happening in the market right now, what I just said previously in the QSR space, it\u2019s performing really well, so you are seeing that reflected in the Global business unit. And also we have some limited time offerings in Q3 that really accelerated that growth. So, you put all those things together, we made the announcement on Hermiston, our competitive set, they are going to add some capacity over the next 12 to 18 months, but we expect like I say it in Q2 we are going to run our assets the low end 95% and we got flexibility to support our customer needs going forward plus we have got to have the additional flexibility capacity as Rob noted on his comments to make sure that we are maintaining our assets and we are committed to doing that, but we expect the utilization rates to remain fairly consistent to where they have in the past based on the capacity coming on. Akshay Jagdale : And just to clarify so when you say in over the next 12 to 24 months, right, the next couple of years, you expect them to remain where they have been over the last couple of years, right, I mean, because the historical rates for the industry as you have alluded to our like 95%, but we have been operating over 100% and your price mix tells us that even that might be a bit conservative. So, over the next couple of years, is there any reason to believe that utilization rates aren\u2019t going to remain pretty tight for the industry? Rob McNutt : Yes. Akshay, this is Rob. A couple of things. We recognized there has been some capacities come on in Europe and so as that comes on that can be competitive in some of those export markets. And so that allows us to be able to maintain growth in service levels domestically. And as Tom spoke to it and recall prior to the Richland 5 startup, we said we were operating at very high level capacity and so we were limited in our \u2013 in the ability to help customers with LTOs. And so now that we have got Richland 5 running and then looking forward to the new Hermiston line coming on, we will be able to maintain \u2013 one, maintain the operating assets at the right level from a maintenance perspective, but also really support our customers with those limited time offerings which tend to be pretty good business for them to drive traffic and therefore us. So we anticipate things are going to continue to be relatively tight, but we will manage through that with the balance of export and domestic demand servicing those limited time offerings. And so that\u2019s a calculus that the teams go through on an ongoing basis to get the best margins we can out of the capacity we have got. But we do anticipate overall industry capacity will continue to be relatively tight over the next 12 months to 24 months. Akshay Jagdale : Got it. And just one on the LTOs and more in general about your innovation pipeline, what you have mentioned about the fries for the two gold segments, it seems pretty exciting too, but how do you manage \u2013 how are you managing sort of this LTO demand, right or just your innovation pipeline, so now you have some flex capacity so you can actually go out and sell some of this stuff, but given the inherent set of \u2013 inherent nature of these products to be on and off menus, I imagine it\u2019s harder to manage, so can you give us some sense of how we should be thinking about that as a contributor to your top line going forward because I mean you are having tremendous success right now with one of your customers and I am assuming we can expect that to continue for every product you launch, right, so can you just give us a high level perspective on contribution from sort of LTOs and new products given that you have some flex capacity now? Thanks. Tom Werner : Akshay we are partnering with our customers and we \u2013 in terms of our customer relationships and working with them as a plan their outlook and their monthly calendar and their menu, we are close to it. So these things, the LTOs they are variable obviously, but we have a point of view on when those are going to hit. And we are working with our customers and we have a very rigorous system whereas we have insights for having outlook on what they are thinking in terms of menu and doing different products. We are trying different \u2013 some different products that we have on the menu to do LTOs. We are putting all that in our schedule and our outlook and our thinking. But that said, sometimes it just takes some time to get these on the menu, but we have a good outlook based on our system and how we work with our customers on when these LTOs are going to hit. Akshay Jagdale : Thanks a lot. Operator : Next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Thanks. Rob, I guess the first question on the freight side, obviously you have given us updated sense of your inflation outlook for the full year and so I think we have a sense of where you stand there, but just from a more qualitative standpoint just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on your supply chain how you have adapted to the increase in freight costs and anything about the structure of your supply chain, maybe it\u2019s the concentration or your use of rail something that would just to help us better understand how you are differentiated from everyone else is feeling this pressure? Rob McNutt : Yes. If you think about our business, retail tends to be priced on a delivered basis and that\u2019s a smaller portion of our business maybe than some others might be not necessarily in the private and the food category in general. And then the foodservice and the global business those we tend to be contracted where we can more easily share the trade increases with our with our customer base, also recognize that because the predominant of our production is in Pacific Northwest, we do have forward distribution in in the Midwest and in the East. And a lot of that is done by rail. And so we will ship a lot of that by rail and to forward distribution and then it tends to be a lot of customer pickup in that short haul forward. And so that customer pickup, the customer that obviously is dealing with the freight issues. Our teams constantly are looking at rail versus truck rates to optimize that and so that\u2019s just an ongoing part of the model. But again, we don\u2019t tend to be necessarily as tied to truck maybe as some others and then how we balance the freight cost between ourselves and our customers maybe a little different for waiting with some others in the food business. Matthew Grainger : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And I guess one other follow-up just on Akshay\u2019s line of questioning in the LTO\u2019s, Tom I think you spoke to the volatility or the unpredictability in the LTOs and that clearly seems to have been maybe one of the factors along with your own optionality in terms of driving positive mix during the quarter, but is there I guess we are thinking about the forward price mix outlook and the strength that you exhibited during the quarter here, I know my question is getting a little long winded here, but I know you see avenues for positive mix going forward, in the short-term was there anything inflated about the mix favorability in Q3 that we should expect to see moderate more significantly over the next three months to six months just shorter term timeframe? Tom Werner : Yes. I think as we kind of commented on earlier, we certainly from a volume perspective our Grown in Idaho but you look at our retail segment, Grown in Idaho and our private label accelerated this quarter. We have got some new customers with Grown in Idaho big customers, so that\u2019s certainly probably \u2013 not probably it\u2019s over indexed on where that\u2019s going to grow going forward. And I would say our global business unit in particular as we stated the LTO that\u2019s going on right now was drove sustainable [ph] amount of growth. And that\u2019s \u2013 again that\u2019s not continue going forward, but underneath that and the goal of business unit if you look at our customers in that segment again the QSR traffic, the customers in that space continue to grow and are full confident that that will continue in the near-term. Matthew Grainger : Okay. Thanks. And is it \u2013 just one follow-up, is it fair to assume that LTOs are almost always going to be higher margin than normal course business even more premium styles? Tom Werner : Yes. Matt, I am not going to get into the specifics in terms of financial, what happens financially with LTOs, so I will just leave with that. Matthew Grainger : Okay. Thanks Tom. I appreciate it. Operator : Next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Just one question and I guess it\u2019s \u2013 it kind of ties back to I think maybe Akshay was asking about utilization rate, but just now that you have got the incremental capacity up and running as we are kind of thinking just out over the next four quarters, how much of that volume is at a net basis is available to actually grow volumes year-over-year or how much of that should we think is being sort of netted out as you were kind of running above 100% capacity utilization and maybe you are going to slowdown a little bit production in some of the existing facilities to do the regular maintenance that type of things, so I guess what I am really trying to drive at is, so we are thinking about over the next four quarters, is it more of a price mix driving revenues versus volume and then really just how much actual volume growth is available to you just given your capacity situation? Tom Werner : Well, a couple of things, Bryan. Certainly, we have got to catch up on a few maintenance things coming up and we \u2013 the additional capacity with Richland gives us flexibility to continue to service our customers at the volume levels that we expect. We are going to continue to run our assets within the 95% to 100% range. And the critical thing to remember as we talked about earlier is the category over the last several years and I have stated it before continues to grow at a pretty good rate between 1.5% and 2.5%. And our view is that\u2019s going to continue and which is why we brought the Hermiston line forward. So we have to do something to manage our assets, but we have \u2013 we see opportunities in the marketplace in the category that we will continue to run our assets at current levels and that the additional capacity gives us flexibility to flex with our customers as their \u2013 we talked about LTOs a lot on the call today, but as we are thinking about new things to drive traffic. So I don\u2019t anticipate us doing anything different than what we have been doing from a capacity utilization standpoint. And I think the industry in general will continue to run at tight levels. Bryan Spillane : So \u2013 and can you remind Richland adds 6% to North American volume just the amount of capacity that it enables you to ex-incremental volume it allows you to generate? Rob McNutt : About 300 million pounds of natural base of 5.5 billion, yes. Bryan Spillane : Okay, alright. Thank you. Tom Werner : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Andrew Carter with Stifel. Andrew Carter : Thanks. Good morning guys. I just have one here for you, you said that really the only impediment to revisiting kind of your long-term EBITDA growth is kind of starting to see some more input cost inflation you have seen 5% so on non-potato here in the fourth quarter and some on the potato, just wanted to talk kind of circle back to you kind of degree you prep of pricing power you have both to offset this both in terms of the contracts you have in place that you setup last summer, the number of contracts that are coming due to the summer and then some of your smaller customers where you have the ability there to take some pricing? Tom Werner : Andrew, there is a lot of variables in our contracting. So within each segment you have contracts that you have faster mechanism, some are fixed price. In our Foodservice segment, we have list pricing that we can go into the market. So there is a lot of variables. In our Retail segment you have contracted prices that are fixed some are \u2013 have faster mechanism, so it\u2019s really a mix bag. What I will tell you is in July when we wrap up our year and give our full year guidance, we will have a clear view of the inflation impact next year and how that adds up in terms of long-term outlook and we will also as we do every year at this time as we are going through contracting and thinking about our pricing architecture for the coming year we will have that point of view for you then as well. Andrew Carter : Thanks guys. Tom Werner : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Adam Mizrahi with Berenberg Capital Market. Adam Mizrahi : Hi, guys. One question for me, the international export business seems to be called out less and less in your results as we go through this year, can you talk about how that part of your business is performing relative to your expectations at the start of the year and why international seemingly playing less as a whole in overall volume growth versus this time 12 months to 18 months ago? Thank you. Dexter Congbalay : Hey Adam, it\u2019s Dexter, one of the things we called out actually last quarter was we delve [ph] back on some of our international business from mix perspective, some of that was lower margin. We were able to redeploy some of that volume that we were exporting before back into North America which obviously carries a little bit higher margin in that way. So growth in international this quarter actually we were slightly down as a result of walk away for some of those contracts. And one of the other things as in terms of China particularly we are continuing to scale our production in China itself, so that means that we are exporting a little bit less until we get plant fully ramped up. Adam Mizrahi : Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Michael Gallo with C.L. King. Michael Gallo : Hi, good morning and congratulations on the strong results. Tom Werner : Good morning. Michael Gallo : My question is just a bigger picture question obviously and a little bit of nontraditional customer for your product obviously they had an enormously successful launch. I was wondering if you start to see signs, if that\u2019s driving some other perhaps nontraditional large QSR players to start thinking about whether some of your products would be opportunities for their menu? Thanks. Tom Werner : Michael, I will comment it from this standpoint. There is opportunity this is my belief in the nontraditional customers. What\u2019s going on in the market and the success that we are happening right now is a testament to that. We have got some things we are working on in our innovation pipeline and obviously I can\u2019t share for competitive reasons, but that\u2019s an area that I think its huge opportunity. It\u2019s a long runway to get some of those nontraditional customers to entertain potato offerings fry or non-fry, but that\u2019s an area that\u2019s top of mind for me and my team. And we are focused on it. We have got some work going around it, but again, that\u2019s a long runway. But the great news is we have got resources against it and when we can crack that code and get in one of those nontraditional fried channels, it could payoff really big. So, we are working on it. We have got some great ideas and hopefully sooner than later we will crack the code. Michael Gallo : Thanks very much. And then just a follow-up just on the retail business for the fourth quarter, I know you have a few moving pieces there between the distribution gains and then also you had that significant private label business yet in Q3. I guess to sort of dimensionalize, obviously it\u2019s not going to be 30% kind of growth that you saw in Q3, but should we expect that to be kind of midway between what you saw kind of Q2 and Q3 or I guess trying to dimensionalize the different pieces? Thanks. Rob McNutt : Yes, this is Rob and again recognized the relative comp Q4 last year was stronger. But as I mentioned, we have got a couple of new customers for the Grown in Idaho that starts shipping in Q4. And so we will see the impact of that, but also recognize as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had some shift in timing between Q2 and Q3, which was meaningful enough to call out. So, I think you are going to end up somewhere in between there as you mentioned. So, I think that\u2019s a fair way to think about it, but it recognized it\u2019s a wide range right. Michael Gallo : Thanks very much. Tom Werner : Thanks Michael. Operator : That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I will turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Hi, it\u2019s Dexter. If anybody has some follow-up questions, please probably best to e-mail me and then we can set some time to speak. Other than that, have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

King Brett Hundley - Vertical Group Operator : Good day and welcome to the Lamb Weston Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release which is available on our website, lambweston.com.

On our website you can find a schedule that provide amount of reclassified by quarter for fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018. With me today on our call are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our overall performance and the operating environment. Rob will then provide the details on our fourth quarter and full year results and fiscal 2019 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. We\u2019re pleased with our strong performance for the quarter and for the full year, our financial results reflects our commitment to our customers, our unwavering focus on our operating with excellence and a continuation of the favorable environment that we\u2019ve enjoyed over the last couple of years. We\u2019re proud of the operating momentum that we\u2019ve been building since becoming an independent company less than two years ago. Fiscal 2018 was a continuation of the entire Lamb Weston organization executing at the high level against our strategic and financial objectives, creating value for all our stakeholders. Our strong fiscal 2018 performance provides us with a solid foundation for future growth. Let me take you through some of the highlights. Sales increased to $3.4 billion, which is up 8% and above our target growth rate of the upper end of the mid single-digit range. The increase was driven by price mix and volume growth in each of our core segments. Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures increased 16% to $820 million, which is above our target of $805 million to $810 million. We generated more than $480 million of cash flow from operations. We reinvested nearly a $310 million of net cash flow in the capital expenditures, which much of towards expanding capacity to support future growth. We reduced our leverage to 3.2 times adjusted EBITDA from 3.7 times. We increased our dividend and paid out a $110 million to our shareholders. And finally, we established the New Lamb Weston Charitable Foundation focused on fighting hunger and food and security. Our strong financial performance in fiscal 2018 is a direct result of the entire Lamb Weston team's sense of pride and ownership, our focus on our customers and the accomplishments of our supply chain and commercial teams. First of all, our supply chain team continued to improve our safety performance with OSHA Recordable Incident Rate of below 1.5 for the first time in our history of the Company, a major milestone. During the year, our supply chain team supported demand growth and service levels by continuing to operate our manufacturing asset at a very high utilization level. At the same time, the team invested in capacity expansions and productivity programs that will help offset inflationary pressures in the coming fiscal year. In the second quarter, we started up our 300 million pound french-fry line in Richland, Washington, on-time and on-budget. In fact, we were able to ramp up production on the line in record time, which gave us added flexibility to take down other lines for extended maintenance in the back half of the year. Early in the third quarter, we announced another capacity expansion with the addition of a 300 million pound french-fry line in Hermiston, Oregon, at a total cost of about $250 million and construction is on schedule with a target operational date of May 2019, this line will serve both domestic and international demand. Also in the third quarter, our new 180 million pound facility in Russia became operational and is in the process of ramping up. As you may recall, our interest in this plant is through our Lamb Weston/ Meijer joint venture in Europe which is a minority owner in this facility. And finally, our 115 million pound French-fry plant in China continues to ramp up production levels to serve strategic customers in that fast growing market. In addition, our raw potato procurement team completed negotiations and entered into agreements with our grower network for the current crop year with price increases in line with expectations. On the commercial side, our teams were able to continue to drive profitable growth and capture market share. In our global segment, we continue to focus on our traditional customer base of chain restaurants to drive domestic growth. We successfully renewed contracts for our large portion of our North American volume base including implementing new price structures and partnering with customers to drive growth through limited time offerings and innovation. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to support customer growth across North America and in fast growing international markets like China and Southeast Asia, while expanding our innovation focus to increasingly include non-traditional outlets such as convenient stores, sandwich and bakery concepts. In our foodservice segment, we've taken steps to align resources to build and strengthen relationships across our foodservice customer base including our distributor partners, small and regional restaurant chains, and independent restaurants. Most notably, over the past few months, we've expanded our direct sales force and eliminated our remaining broker relationships. We've completed hiring a new sales and support team that hit the ground array as we transition to a direct sales model in June. The initial response in the market has been positive. Over the long term, we expect this change will lead to deeper customer relationships and broader customer coverage leading to faster growth and improved mix. In retail, we drove category growth and gain market share by leveraging our three tier strategy of offering premium Alexia-branded, mainstream branded and private label products. At the beginning of our fiscal year, we launched our new mainstream brand Grown in Idaho. Today, Grown in Idaho has an ACV of nearly 85% in the grocery channel and total market share of about 4%. In additional, Alexia branded and licensed brand products have increased share over the past year. With respect to new products and innovation, we teamed with existing and new chain restaurant customers on limited time offers, helping them expand menus and drive consumer traffic. In addition, we announced Crispy on Delivery, a first of its kind comprehensive proprietary fries and packaging solution that enables fries to stay hot and crispy for the fast-growing home delivery channel. We are in the process of working with some larger chain restaurant customers about adding it to their menus and will begin rolling it out to foodservice customers later this year. In summary, fiscal '18 was a terrific year our. Performance reflected our entire team's laser focus on execution against our priority as well as each team members' passion and commitment to each other, our customers and all our stakeholders. Now turning to fiscal 2019. We are targeting another year of solid sales and earnings growth. We anticipate demand growth for frozen potato products in North America to be in line with recent trends, barring any unforeseen economic event that would significantly impact consumer sentiment. We continue to expect that industry capacity in North America will be tied to fiscal 2019 given current utilization levels of around 100%. This is consistent with the view that we presented in January, which already included the impact of new capacity additions later this calendar year. With solid demand growth and tight industry capacity, we believe the environment to improve both price and mix will remain relatively favorable in the near term. However, as we demonstrated, we'll continue to take balanced approach to improve price and mix so that we can maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships and deliver sustainable profitable growth over the long term. In addition, consistent with our growth strategy, we've given notice to our partner and our Lamb Weston/BSW joint venture to exercise our call option to purchase our interest. We'll move to close that transaction as soon as practicable. Despite the continued favorable environment, we do see some potential risk and headwinds in the coming year. First, inflation is accelerating for many of our production costs and more significantly for transportation costs. As Rob will describe later in our outlook, we anticipate being able to offset these costs through improved price mix and productivity, but the higher inflation will likely temper opportunities for significant gross margin percentage expansion. Second, we expect increased market volatility outside the United States. The imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers raises landing cost for products made in the U.S. and opens the door for more competition from non-U.S. sources in key international markets. At the very least, the threat of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products may encourage customers to seek alternative suppliers. In addition, significant new capacity in Europe becoming operational within the next 12 months may lead to some near-term supply demand dislocation. The third potential risk is one we face each year, potato crop quality and yield. As usual, we tend to be cautious about the potato crop given that we're very early in the growing season. We'll have much better insight as we enter the September and October harvesting period. And finally, as Rob will describe later, we're strategically investing in our infrastructure resulting in higher selling, general and administrative costs. While significant step up versus fiscal 2018, these investments will help us support future growth and drive operating efficiencies over the long-term. So as you can see, we've delivered strong results by supporting our customers and executing well across the organization. We expect the operating environment to remain favorable through fiscal 2019. And we're strategically investing in our capacity, infrastructure, and capabilities to support growth over the long-term. I'm confident that we'll deliver solid top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2019 and create value for all our stakeholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on results and our outlook for the coming year. Rob. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning everyone. As Tom noted, we're pleased with our strong results in the fourth quarter and the full year, as we grow sales and EBITDA growth above our long-term targets. Specifically, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 10% to $918 million. Price mix was up 8% as we benefited from new pricing structures and recently renewed contracts in our global segment and we improve mix in our retail segment. In addition, in foodservice, we continue to benefit from pricing and mix improvement actions taken in fiscal 2017 as well as action taken the in the first half of fiscal 2018. Volume increased 2%, led by growth in our global and retail segments. For the year, sales grew 8% to $3.4 billion with price mix up 6% and volume up 2%. Gross profit in the quarter increased 18% to $233 million. Higher price mix, volume growth and supply chain efficiency savings drove the increase more than offsetting the impact of higher transportation and warehousing costs, input costs inflation, higher fixed manufacturing cost per unit as we took some downtime for maintenance, higher depreciation expense primarily associated with our new production line in Richland, and higher incentive compensation expense. Our gross margin percentage in the quarter expanded 160 basis points to more than 25%. For the year, gross profit grew 13% and gross margin expanded 110 basis points to 25.7%. The improvement was largely driven by favorable price mix, volume growth, and supply chain productivity more than offsetting higher inflation, depreciation, and incentive compensation cost. In the quarter, SG&A expense excluding items impacting comparability increased $23 million to $98 million. Three factors primarily drove the increase. First, incremental labor benefits and infrastructure cost related to operating as a standalone public company. Second, a $7 million increase in advertising and promotional sport in our retail segment, which was driven by our first on-air campaign for Grown in Idaho branded products, as it achieved some key distribution milestones. And third, higher incentive compensation in cost based on our actual performance for all the fiscal 2018. The increase in SG&A also includes two additional expenses that we do not expect to recur. The first is approximately $5 million of seed funding to establish our new charitable foundation. The second is roughly $3 million of cost in the fourth quarter and $4 million in the year associated with transitioning our foodservice segment go-to-market strategy to a direct sales model. This included the cost of hiring and training sales representatives as well as the cost related to terminating our broker relationship. Adjusted operating income was 10% to $134 million in the quarter, driven by the increase in gross profit. For the year, adjusted operating was up 9% to $589 million. Again, this was due to higher gross profit partially offset by higher SG&A. In the fourth quarter, equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe and Lamb Weston/RDO in Minnesota, were $25 million. Excluding the year-over-year impact of unrealized gains and losses related to mark-to-market of commodity and foreign currency hedging contracts, equity earnings increased about $8 million in the quarter. Lowering potato cost in Europe as well as volume growth by both joint ventures primarily drove the increase. In addition, about $2 million in the increase is due to favorable currency translation benefit. For the year, equity earnings were $84 million. Excluding the mark-to-market impact, equity earnings increased about $34 million driven by solid operating result of $5 million of currency translation benefit and a $4 million gain related to a divestiture of a non-core business. So putting it all together, in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA including the proportional EBITDA from our two unconsolidated joint ventures increased 15% to $203 million. For the year, it was up 16% to $820 million. Moving down the income statement. Interest expense was about $28 million for the quarter and $109 for the year. Our effective tax rate excluding the impact of comparability items and provisional impacts from tax reform was 25% in the quarter and 27% for the year. This is below the 28% that we anticipated due to benefit of timing and discrete items. Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted diluted EPS increased $0.14 to $0.65 in the quarter and includes a $0.10 benefit from applying a lower tax rate as a result of recently enacted tax reform. The remaining increase was driven by operating gains and higher equity earnings. For the year, adjusted EPS was up $0.34 to $2.66. Operating gains and higher equity earnings drove the increase. The benefit of a lower tax rate was offset by higher interest expense related to debt incurred in connection with the spin off. Now let's review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our global segments, which includes the top-100 U.S. based chains as well as all other sales outside of North America, were up 10% in the quarter. Price mix rose 8% as we continue to benefit from new pricing structures associated with the recently renewed contracts that continue to improve both customer and product mix. We expect these new pricing structures will continue to look to deliver solid price mix growth through the first half of fiscal 2019. Volume grew 2% primarily driven by sales to strategic customers in the U.S. For the year, net sales increased 7% with price mix up 5 and volume up 2. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense increased $17 million or about 21% in the quarter. The increase was driven by favorable price mix and volume. This was partially offset by higher transportation, warehousing, commodity input and manufacturing cost inflation, higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the new Richmond line and higher incentive compensation costs. Global's contribution margin percentage expanded by about 190 basis points in the quarter and about 70 basis points for the year. Sales for our foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top-100 North American restaurant customers, increased 6% in the quarter. Price mix increased 6% compared to an 8% increase in the prior year period, reflecting pricing actions and continued improvement in customer and product mix. In fiscal 2019, we continue to expect favorable pricing and foodservice as pricing actions taken in November 2017 continue to be implemented. Because of the timing of contract renewals, broad pricing actions such as these takes 6 to 9 months to be fully reflected in marketplace. Foodservice volume grew nominally behind increased shipments of higher margin Lamb Weston branded and operator label products. However, this was mostly offset by the continued effect of losing some lower margin distributor label volume earlier in the year. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, we anticipate the loss of this volume will continue to be a headwind through the first half of fiscal 2019. For the year, foodservice sales grew 7% with price mix up 6 and volume up 1. In the quarter, foodservices product contribution margin increased 6% as favorable price mix more than offset higher transportation warehousing input and manufacturing costs, the Richmond depreciation and higher incentive compensation costs. As a result, foodservices contribution margin percentage was essentially flat. For the year, it was up about 120 basis points driven by favorable price mix. Sales in our retail segment grew 26%. Volume was a 14 driven by distribution gains have Grown in Idaho and other branded products as well as growth of private label products. Price mix increased 12% with higher prices across our branded and private label portfolio as well as improved mix. For the year, sales grew 17% with volume up 12% and price mix up 5%. Retail's product contribution margin in the quarter increased 47%, as higher volume and price mix more than offset costs inflation and significantly stepped up advertising and promotional investments behind Grown an Idaho. Product contribution margin percentage expanded by 230 basis points. For the year, retails product contribution margin increase 13% while margin percentage decline 17 basis points due to higher trade spending earlier in the year and advertising and promotional support behind grown an Idaho. Switching to our balance sheet and cash flow, our total debt at the end of the year was about $2.4 billion. This puts our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3.2 times, slightly below our target range of 3.5 to 4. As we've previously noted, we're comfortable being below our target range for a period of time as it provides additional balance sheet flexibility. With respect to cash flow, we generated more than $480 million of cash from operations. We invested $309 million in capital expenditures, which included the completion of our new production line in Richland, Washington, and about $50 million to begin construction of a new production line in Hermiston, Oregon. We use the remainder of the cash we generated paid dividends to our shareholders, as well as debt service. Let me now turn to our fiscal 2019 outlook. As Tom noted, we anticipate overall favorable operating environment with continued growth in global demand for frozen potato products and high capacity utilization in North America. Higher inflation rates for our production costs and increased volatility in international markets, post some macro risks and headwinds. Consistent with our overall guidance philosophy, we're taking a prudent approach to our fiscal 2019 outlook. Specifically, we're targeting sales to grow in the mid single-digit rate for the year, with stronger growth in the first half as a result of the carryover benefit of pricing actions in our global and retail segments. The benefit of incremental volume availability from our new Richland Washington capacity, which became fully operational in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and more difficult year-over-year comparisons as the year progresses. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures to be in the range of $860 million to $870 million. We expect sales and growth profit growth to drive the increase in adjusted EBITDA. We\u2019re targeting gross profit to grow at least in line with sales with favorable price mix and productivity more than offsetting higher input, manufacturing transportation warehousing inflation as well as well higher depreciation expense. We anticipate our total production cost per pound to increase in the mid single-digit range. Cost per pound will be a little higher in the first quarter as the effective planned added down time in maintenance cost that we incurred in our fourth quarter continue to be realized as we sell that inventory produced during that period. As we previously stated, we expect our weighted average contracted raw potato price to increase in the low to mid single-digit range on a per pound basis. Contracted prices as you may recall are only one element to understanding our total potato cost, potato yield, quality and how they hold up in storage are all key to determining how the potatoes perform in our production facilities and our actual costs. Our outlook anticipates an average potato crop, allowed more insight on yield and quality of potato crop as the harvest takes place later in the year. We\u2019re projecting that the increase in gross profit will be partially offset by significantly higher SG&A. The majority of the increase in SG&A relates to information systems including investments to modernize our overall IT infrastructure, as we continue to fully standalone capabilities after transitioning off ConAgra Systems a few months ago. In addition, it includes some cost related to beginning the process of replacing our mid 1980s vintage enterprise resource planning system. In addition to inflation, the remainder of the increase in SG&A includes investment in sales, marketing, innovation operations and other functional capabilities to execute our growth strategy and drive operating efficiencies over the long-term. We anticipate that we\u2019ll incur an elevated level of investment behind our IT and the ERP infrastructure over the next couple of years, after which we expect our SG&A cost to normalize. With respect to equity method earnings, we anticipate that it will increase modestly reflecting solid underlying operating growth in our joint ventures in Europe and the U.S. as well as lapping a $4 million gain on sale in fiscal 2018. Altogether, operating gains in our base business as well as the modest increase in equity earnings will drive a majority of our adjusted EBITDA growth. We\u2019re targeting the rest to be from acquiring the 50% of our consolidated joint venture Lamb Weston BSW that we currently don\u2019t own. As Tom mentioned in June, we exercised our call option for that stake. We\u2019ll finalize transaction as soon as practicable. We anticipate the total cost will be about $65 million and we\u2019ll finance the transaction using cash on hand and our existing credit line as needed. For more details on Lamb Weston BSW, please to refer to our SEC filings. In addition, we anticipate total interest expense of around $110 million which is about the same as fiscal 2018 due to higher interest rates on our variable rate credit agreement. We\u2019re targeting of effective tax rate of about 24% in line with our previous expectation of mid-20s. We expect capital expenditures of about $360 million, approximately $200 million of that is related to completing the construction of our new french-fry production line in Hermiston, Oregon which we anticipate will be operational in May 2019. And finally, total depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately $150 million, up from nearly 140 this past year. In summary, we're pleased with our performance and the operating momentum that we built. We expect to deliver another year of solid results in fiscal 2019 driven by sales and gross profit growth while strategically investing in our capacity, infrastructure and capabilities to support future growth and operating efficiencies. Let me now turn the call back to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks Rob. As you can see, we feel good about how we're executing across the organization and the investments we're making to serve our customers, generate attractive returns and creating value for all our stakeholders over the long term. We're well positioned to deliver our fiscal 2019 and long-term strategic and financial objectives, as we continue on our journey to become the number one global potato company. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston. And now we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar, Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Two questions for you. First one would be. I think on your fiscal 2Q call you had a slide that going to put your expectation for industry capacity utilization to still be above 100% in fiscal '19 even with some of the new industry capacity coming online. It sounds like that's broadly still very much to your expectations. The reason I ask this because you talked about the carryover benefit right from pricing taken last year. So, I'm trying to get a sense of maybe what percentage of your North American volume sort of have you finished your pricing negotiations with for that coming fiscal year? And given your expectation for continued industry tight capacity and some inflation cropping up, how should we think about what incremental pricing might be in store as we even lap through the first half of carryover price? Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. This is Tom. First, the first part of your question in terms of capacity, obviously, there is some capacity coming on this fall. Our outlook as we've stated 6 months ago is that even with that additional capacity coming on, the industry is going to be still at high utilization levels. And there is some normalization within our capacity in terms of as we brought Richland on. We're running mid-90s. We had to take some downtime on some other facilities just for catch up maintenance. So, we feel good about where the capacity is as an industry even with capacity coming online because there is going to be a normalization of fact across the industry network in terms of utilization levels. The second part of your question is we had a pretty big contracting season last year in our global business unit. In terms of percentages, I would say we roughly contracted about over around 75% of our North America business. So, in Global -- excuse me. So, that's largely in place. The timing of those contracts vary in terms of the length of them. But, as Rob noted in his remarks, we will have a carryover effect of that pricing particularly in the first half on those contracts. And then the second part of that in our foodservice segment, we do have a portion of that business that list pricing and like we do every year. We continue to evaluate the market demand, what's going on with our inflationary costs. So, we have the ability to react a lot faster in that portion of our business in terms of just taking less pricing. Andrew Lazar : A quick follow-up would just be, you noted that in Europe where some more capacities coming online. There's always the chance closer, really more closer range just for some near-term supply demand disruptions as folks try and fill some of that capacity. And I wonder, is that something that we should be concerned about at all, as some of these capacities come online in North America? Or is it just that the utilization rates are still so high and tight here that's just less of a concern for you? Tom Werner : It is absolutely a concern and the where we're at today as an industry, we've experienced a lot of capacity coming online that quite frankly hasn't happened in the past. So, it's imperative for us to continue to execute our business and our plans. We obviously keep a close eye on what's going on in the marketplace. I will tell you right now, we haven't had a material impact with the capacity coming on and I think that's a function of two things. One is what I was saying earlier where people are normalizing production and maintaining their plans. And the second thing is the demand continues to grow based on our outlook that we gave six months ago. So, we're watching it, it's a different environment than we've had in the past in the industry, and we'll continue to react the way we need to drive our value creation model. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Carter, Stifel. Andrew Carter : So couple for me real quick -- real quick. So could you discuss in your FY '19 guidance kind of the degree of incremental spending you are expecting? And could you quantifying that and then letting us know how much will be recurring and when will these fully level off? Rob McNutt : Thanks Andrew. It's Rob. In terms of quantifying -- I don't want to get into specific numbers in the income statement and guidance, but I think you can work backwards into it from the growth and sales guidance that we've given and the EBITDA guidance and the margin guidance. I think you put that together to come pretty close. Again, the bulk of that spending is related towards IT and specifically ERP. Those are typically from start to finish in that. It will be over the course of this come of 2019 and 2020 that we expect to put that in place and thereafter we expect SG&A levels to normalize. Andrew Carter : Second one kind of returning to the top line. You mentioned some difficult comparisons that consider from FY '18 here, but overall what\u2019s your volume growth outlook assuming robust operating environment. Should we expect 2% volume in line with kind of your long-term guidance or something south of that? Rob McNutt : Well, the guidance that we've given was the low to mid single-digits in terms of revenue. Tom Werner : Yes, yes. Well. Andrew, you\u2019re looking for volume or total? Andrew Carter : Volume, yes, that\u2019s correct. Rob McNutt : Yes, volume is in that that low single-digits and again we\u2019ll get carryover benefit from those prices as mentioned. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane, Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : So, a couple of questions. First, I guess as we were looking at some of the spending that you had in the fourth quarter, some of the more discretionary spending. Had you pull forward anything that you had originally planned to do in fiscal '19 into the fourth quarter of '18? Tom Werner : No. Bryan Spillane : And then second question just on the Grown in Idaho distribution gains. I would assume some of that has come from some of the supply disruption that has been experienced with Ore-Ida. So, just kind of curious as to maybe how sticky some of that distribution is? Is there is a chance that you might give some back as Ore-Ida comes back in full production? Tom Werner : Yes, Bryan, this is Tom. I\u2019d like to think of it as it is going to stick and we\u2019ve had great recession from our customers with Grown in Idaho. We have certainly invested behind the brand in Q4 and right now we\u2019re continuing to invest into brand. It\u2019s a terrific product. We get great response, great trial, great repeat, once we get the trial. So, there is no doubt our competitors had some issues in the marketplace and I feel good about we\u2019re Grown in Idaho\u2019s position and we\u2019re gaining velocities and we're going to continue to divest behind it. And we have -- the other thing we\u2019ve done is serviced our customers, so they understand that and we\u2019ve supported their category needs. And it\u2019s a great place to be, so I feel good about we\u2019re Grown in Idaho is. We\u2019re going to continue invest in it. I will acknowledge there was some gain based on the disruption, but I think we\u2019re passed all that and we continue to see good velocities. Bryan Spillane : And then just last one for me, I guess the industry outlook is really important, right. I mean it sort of will really dictate whether or not enough too much capacity has or hasn\u2019t been added in the market and obviously has an effect on the ability to price. And so, I guess could you remind us there was an acceleration in your -- in the industry growth in North America since the spin? Think a lot of that has been driven by just how well the foodservice like specially QSRs have marketed. But, could you just sort of remind us of the factors that have driven this elevated growth in kind of what drives your confidence that, that will continue? Tom Werner : Yes. So, as I\u2019ve stated before, the accelerator was North America and Europe probably now 2.5 years ago, started growing at the 2-ish range and 2% on those two marketplaces that as a lot of french-fries. So that really accelerated the overall category. In addition to that time, we continue to see a lot of our -- a lot of the international markets continue to grow at levels that were consistent to their past. So that was really the changer. I think as I've stated, we think the category is going to grow at 1.5% to 2.5%, I feel good about that continuing. And as that happens, that's going to drive capacity utilization even with the oncoming capacity. So I feel good about how we're positioned. The category, everything we're looking at continues to be positive. So, I think we're set up to have another really solid year. Operator : Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale, Jefferies. AkshayJagdale: I wanted to -- so my question is for Rob. I wanted you to help us with the JV issue, right. So I'm trying to parse out what your guidance is excluding the JV, the buying of the stake of the RDO JV. So, can you help us quantify the impact there? I mean obviously it's fully consolidated. So the only impact is going to be on the EBIT line, not on the sales line. And then I'm assuming some of that is coming up [technical difficulty] on the income would be? Rob McNutt : Yes, exactly. If you go down the income statement and that you can see where we basically take out the non-controlling interest there. And if you go back over the course of last year, that 50% is in the $17 million range. And if you look at it from an EBITDA perspective, it's in the $20 million range last year. So I think that there is some guidance. And I think if you dig into those filings in the income statement you can pull that out. AkshayJagdale: Got it okay perfect. And secondly just on volume growth. So obviously you're assuming again low-single digit volume growth as you mentioned before. With the capacity from the new line that's come on, what are the puts and takes as to sort of why wouldn't it be the higher, right? Demand is pretty strong. You're at 95% utilization rates. You have the ability to flex that up significantly. So, can you help us understand sort of the puts and takes, as to why you're at low single digit and not let's say mid-single digit on volume? Rob McNutt : Yes, the issue is as you look, I mean the $300 million of incremental capacity we added again was partway through last year. So, we had the benefit of that partway through the year. And again that's on our $5.5 billion base. And so, you run that math and then you look at where we have been running at really effectively over 100% where we've been running the assets very, very hard and now we get more normalized capacity utilization, so that we can get some of the preventive maintenance done that we need to don't need to do during the year. Now, some of that as I mentioned, took place in Q3, Q4, especially Q4, and we'll see some of the costs results of that in to Q1. But specifically on the volume issue, it will be more balanced in terms of capacity utilization and utilization of some of that maintenance downtime. The other piece is that with the extra capacity we want to leave some of that available for LTOs, which helps support our customers' traffic and growth and their profitability, and those are -- that's attractive business for us as well. Akshay Jagdale : And just one last one on the change on the foodservice go-to-market model, I mean, I'm actually pretty thrilled to hear that. But can you give us some perspective on how you arrived to that decision? From my perspective I mean the foodservice business has been doing really, really well. So, it seems like an offensive move. Just trying to get a sense of what kind of positive impact this could have and why you actually took the step? Tom Werner : Akshay, it was clear to me and our team, as we went through our strategic planning process that this move is the next evolution in our foodservice organization and/or where we want to take that business. And I'm a big proponent of having control of our product. So our sales people now -- we're going to have great coverage across the marketplace. They'll all be focused on selling french-fries, and when you have a broker, they've got a lot of different things in their bag. So I'm excited about it. The team is excited about it. We are great people that came on into the organization. And it's early innings right now, but I'm excited about the opportunities and that these folks are going to fine. And it's just the next evolution in our foodservice strategy. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson, Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : I guess first question is on Europe, I'm just making sure. I want understand a little bit what's in the outlook for the Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture. Obviously, there's more capacity in the industry and that's having I mean there is competitive back there. Potato futures in Europe have been up pretty significantly of late given what seems to be a long time for weather in Northwest Europe and also currency. Just make -- help me understand the moving pieces of the outlook for the European business and what's actually embedded in the guidance there? Tom Werner : Sure Adam. And our European business much like our North American business has really been operating at pretty strong capacity levels there. They've been operating the assets pretty hard. And so from our perspective that last year, as you recall raw prices dropped significantly and we were able to hold on to prices. And so that helped us expand margins in that business there. I think it's important to understand that all capacity is not equal and some of the capacity being added is it tends to be more what we were refer to as line flow capacity as opposed to some of the QSR capable capacity that is really the sweet spot of the market that we participated in Europe. And so, the demand capacity in our markets where we service, we feel pretty good about in Europe. Again, the additional capacity we anticipate will have some impact, but feel good about our position and where we\u2019re position in the market. Your point on raw cost in Europe and in the futures market, again Europe has been seeing some drought conditions here recently and some hot weather. Again, one hot day doesn\u2019t make a summer, but -- and so we\u2019re monitoring that closely. The early crop appears to be okay in the hot fall region. The later crop again we are watching that closely and looking and how that\u2019s going to impact. But as you know historically product prices tend to be moved more in Europe with those raw prices. And so, we\u2019re watching that closely, watching our ability to move market price et cetera in Europe. The other point I\u2019d make is that our plant in Austria as well as in the UK give us a little bit different climate from what we\u2019re seeing in the hot falls. So, overall in Europe and again we don\u2019t forecast the currency into our outlook per say any different and it\u2019s going than it is today. And so, overall as mentioned, we\u2019ll be up modestly in Europe again with some of the increase sales gains there. But again, recognized that we are lapping, we\u2019ve got that $4 million gain on the sale of the non-core business in Austria that we saw. And really early in 2019, FX is a bit of a drag. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That color is helpful. And then maybe just a question back in the North American business. Some color about going after some kind of new market opportunities in different channels and convenient bakery, and then also on the delivery side. I think we have to quantify any impact from those or how -- what kind of opportunities you think those could be over 2, 3, 4 year period? Tom Werner : Yes, Adam, it\u2019s really early to quantify that right now, but I will tell you we\u2019ve reorganized our innovation organization 6 to 9 months ago. And it\u2019s a focus area as I mentioned before. We have some really interesting new products that obviously I can\u2019t get into on the call, but I\u2019m excited about where we\u2019re at right now, it\u2019s really early in the process as we explore those channels. We have terrific Crispy on Delivery product and innovation and packaging that we\u2019ve launched. That\u2019s early innings to, I will -- those start to develop and opportunity start to present themselves and we started executing in the marketplace. I\u2019ll keep you updated on those developments. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Gallo, C.L. King. Michael Gallo : Just a couple of questions. First, in terms of the transition the go-to-market strategy from the broker led sales model to the direct sales model. Can you talk about where -- how long you think it will take to kind of ramp things up or start to see the benefit? And just more specifically what -- where you think you\u2019ll get the biggest benefits from that change? Tom Werner : Sure Michael. We\u2019ve been very prudent in our planning and our ramp up time. Obviously, we've got a lot of new talented folks. We've brought onboard. There is a training element with that as you can imagine. And I expect to start seeing some impact modestly in the second half of this year. So, we're in startup mode. It's early innings like I said. And we'll start seeing opportunities in H2. And the other thing is it's really about coverage directly with the lot of the independence that I believe is continues to grow. And it's an area that we're going to be laser focused on going forward, that's really where the big benefit is going to be. Michael Gallo : And then just a follow-up question. Where we think about LTOs and we think about the overall rate of industry growth. It would seem that the industry growth rate perhaps kind of even higher over the last year. Have you had -- had the industry had capacity to pursue more LTOs? So I was wondering as we think about some of this new capacity coming online in the back half whether that might actually lead to a higher industry growth rate than we've seen because there just the more capacity to do some of the perhaps some of the less non-traditional LTOs? Rob McNutt : Yes, Michael. I think the way to think about it is LTOs with customers that's part of their playbook and their plan. And at time those take a long time to go to market. And when the customer decided to do an LTO, it's really got to fit with their strategy and their consumer. There is a lot of product development that goes into it. So just the addition of capacity doesn't not translate into more LTO offerings, but certainly as we interact with our customers, we're always bringing them creative ideas based on products and opportunities and thing that we see in other markets. So it's a process, like I said, open capacity is not again translate in the more LTOs, but there is other opportunities with customers and new customers that we're pursuing with capacity that we brought online. Operator : We have time for one final question. Next question comes from Brett Hundley of Vertical Group. Brett Hundley : I just have two for you. Rob, the first is, I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear on what you said at the end of your prepared remarks about SG&A remaining elevated across the next couple of years. When we think about the guidance that you gave for fiscal '19, and I just think about my model beyond that. Should I be thinking about that SG&A expense ratio continuing to grow beyond fiscal '19? Or should I just think about that step up in absolute terms from fiscal '19 maybe continuing into end of fiscal '20 before it potentially falls up? I hope that question make sense. And then Tom, just my second question is for you. You've referenced contracting and how you have the majority of that done into parts of fiscal '19 and it sounds like you're being very open and honest about where the industry fits today, that the industry remains favorable and in a good place today. And then, it sounds like you're being very open and honest about potential risks on the horizon down the road. And the one thing I wanted to revisit with you is just, maybe if you could go deeper into the nature of contract talks with customers because one thing that I found really odd was there were some recent media reports that McCain was looking at property in Idaho for a potential processing facility. And they actually came out publicly and said, oh, we're just evaluating, that doesn't mean that we're going to build. It just seemed like a very odd action from them. And so, I'm just wondering if you could maybe further describe in nature of contract talks with customers? And if customers are really starting to bring up forward capacity additions and just what that price discussion looks like? I really appreciate it. Thank you. Rob McNutt : Yes. Let me take the SG&A first, and then let Tom follow-up on the capacity issue. On the SG&A, again recognize that we spent some money getting off of ConAgra and building our IT capabilities internally, as we came off of that in the back half of the prior year '18. And so, as we go through building the IT infrastructure and the new ERP, we'll have -- that will elevate our dollars here for the next couple of years as I said, '19 and '20 I anticipate. So I think about SG&A as a percentage of sales and where we've been running in the kind of 80% range will elevate that as a percentage of sales for a couple of years and then revert back to normal once we get the IT infrastructure in place. Again, while we're elevating from where we have been historically, I think it's important to note that, if you look at our comps and again there is no straight potato comp as we are, but if you look at other CPGs and adjust for things like advertising and promotion, we're still at the low end of the range and in discipline in terms of SG&A spending. I think that's important to keep in mind. Tom Werner : Yes, Brett. And as in terms of your second question, I do not specifically talk about our customer and our contracting process and the nuances around that. As I said, we've contracted large proportion of our global business unit, North America chain business this past year. And this is our more process. And I will tell you the other part of this is, our competitors, we keep a close eye on what's going on in the industry with capacity. We have a really good feel for what's happening or not happening or what's announced and what it really means. And we'll continue to do that in terms of how they're adding capacity and where and when. That's something that that we've got a good handle on, but that's their decision. My focus, my team's focus is on continuing to execute against our operational activities and make sure all that lines up with our strategic plan going forward. So that's what we're focused on. We keep a pulse on what's going on in the market. And again, in terms of as you can respect, in terms of talking specific customer contracting, I will never get into that. Dexter Congbalay : This is Dexter. Just one quick clarification there. Somebody asked a question or we misspoke on one thing, we exercise the option on our joint venture with on Lamb Weston BSW either a question or we misspoke somebody might have heard Lamb Weston RDO, it is -- we exercise the option Lamb Weston BSW. Our relationship in our joint venture with RDO remains the same and there are no plans to have a change associated with that. With that, this could be the end of our call. Happy to have any questions, follow up down the -- later on today or next week or so. Please shoot me an email, if you have -- would like to schedule some time, and we'll go from there. Thank you very much. Tom Werner : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

King Carla Casella - J.P. Morgan Operator : Welcome to the Lamb Weston First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, Vice President of Investor Relations for Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s first quarter earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we\u2019ll make some forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today\u2019s remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our overall performance and the operating environments in North America and Europe. Rob will then provide the details on our first quarter results and our fiscal 2019 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered a strong start to the year reflecting our continued focus on execution, as well as our commitment to invest in supporting our customers and our growth over the long-term. Our performance in the quarter also provides us with the solid foundation to deliver on our full year commitments.  Let me take you through some of the highlights. Sales increased 12% with strong growth in each of our core segments. Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures increased 11% to $213 million driven by sales and gross profit growth, and we generated nearly $230 million of cash flow from operations driven by strong earnings growth and working capital management.  These results reflect how well our commercial and supply chain teams continue to execute on our strategic and operational objectives. For example, in our Global segment, we drove strong volume growth by capitalizing on some limited time offering opportunities in both the U.S. and internationally. The team also continued to drive growth by supporting our chain restaurant customers in North America and increasing exports. In our Foodservice segment, customer response to our shift to a direct sales model has been positive. We will continue to strengthen these relationships and we believe we are well-positioned to begin to drive incremental volume. In Retail, our Grown in Idaho, Alexia, and licensed brand products performed well as we continued to build distribution and gain share.  And finally, our supply chain team again drove cost savings and operated our assets effectively while maintaining customer service rates. In addition, the team continued to make great progress on the construction of our new 300 million pound french fry line in Hermiston Oregon. That line remains on track to be operational in May of 2019.  Our results also reflect continued overall favorable operating environment in North America, including solid demand growth for frozen potato products and tight manufacturing capacity. We anticipate that these operating conditions will remain generally favorable through fiscal 2019. Our expectations for the cost environment also remain the same with steady inflation in each of our major cost categories including potatoes.  With respect to the potato harvest on a preliminary basis, we believe the potato crops in our growing areas in North America are consistent with historical averages both in terms of yield and quality. As a result, we do not expect any significant issues with this year\u2019s potato crop based on what we\u2019ve seen today.  However, we need to see how the potatoes perform in our production facilities in the coming weeks and get a sense for how the potatoes are going to take to storage before we can make a final assessment on the crop\u2019s overall quality, as well as the financial impact versus our expectations.  In contrast to North America, the operating environment in Europe will be more volatile through fiscal 2019 as a result of poor potato crop in the region. Unlike the crop in the Columbia Basin, less than half of the European potato crop is irrigated and therefore it\u2019s dependent on rainfall. In July and August, extreme heat and drought conditions in Europe had a significantly negative impact on crop yield and quality resulting in potato price futures more than doubling versus year earlier in the year. As a result, we expect raw prices for Lamb Weston/Meijer and for the industry to sharply increase in the second half of our fiscal 2019. This will also impact the first half of fiscal 2020 as Lamb Weston/Meijer finishes our processing this year\u2019s short crop.  It\u2019s important to remember that crop issues tend to be one-year advance, and it\u2019s not the first time that our Lamb Weston/Meijer team has faced such challenges. Most recently, Europe had a relatively poor crop that pressured Lamb Weston/Meijer\u2019s fiscal 2017 results. However, the team mitigated the impact that year with pricing and cost reduction actions which continued to benefit their performance through fiscal 2018. I am confident that our highly experienced team in Europe will work through the challenges with the plans that they\u2019ve developed including, raising prices which we\u2019ll be phasing in over the next couple of quarters, working closely with customers to adjust production schedules and product specification requirements, and driving productivity and other cost-saving initiatives across the organization.  In addition, we are leveraging Lamb Weston\u2019s global manufacturing footprint by stretching our U.S. production capacity to support Lamb Weston/Meijer\u2019s customers as needed. We will also leverage our U.S. assets to serve other potential customers as opportunities arise in export markets, especially in Asia and the Middle East. Our teams in Europe and the U.S. have already begun to take actions to mitigate the crop impact and we are continuing to work through some additional operational details as more information about the yield and quality of the crop becomes available. The bottom line is that while Lamb Weston/Meijer\u2019s earnings will be pressured in fiscal 2019 because of the actions we are taking in Europe and North America, we remain on track to deliver on our earnings commitments for the full year.  Severally, while the imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers remains a risk, we believe the current tariff structures as well as the recent increase by China are manageable and we\u2019ve incorporated their estimated effect into our outlook.  So, as you can see, we\u2019ve had a strong start to the year, we are strategically investing to support growth and drive efficiencies over the long-term, and we are leveraging the capabilities of our global business to remain on track to deliver our financial targets. Now, let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our results and our outlook. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. As Tom noted, we are pleased with our first quarter results and remain confident in our full year outlook. Specifically in the quarter, net sales increased 12% to $915 million. Price mix was up 8% as we continue to benefit from pricing structures in our Global segment contracts renewed last year, as well as from carryover pricing and mix improvement actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments. Volume increased 4% led by growth in our Global and Retail segments. Gross profit increased 17% to $231 million. Higher price mix, volume growth, and supply chain efficiency savings drove the increase more than offsetting the impact of higher transportation and warehousing costs, input and manufacturing cost inflation, and higher depreciation expense, primarily associated with our new production line in Richland, which started up in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.  In addition, gross profit includes about $6 million loss related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts in the current quarter as opposed to a $3 million gain related to the contracts in the prior-year period. Our gross margin percentage expanded 120 basis points to more than 25%. SG&A expense excluding items impacting comparability increased $22 million to $78 million. About $15 million of that increase was driven by a few items. First, about $7 million was due to unfavorable foreign exchange while some of that was transaction related, most was translation related to normal revaluation of intercompany balances.  Second, about $5 million was due to higher incentive compensation cost, the majority of this relates to share-based compensation expense reflecting the increase in our stock price, as well as the absolute number of share-based awards outstanding related to post-spin equity grants.  And third, while we increased advertising and promotional support by about $3 million, most of that was in our Retail segment behind Grown in Idaho branded products. We continue to expect total A&P spending for all of fiscal 2019 to be essentially the same as last year, but we are spending more evenly distributed over the year. In fiscal 2018, much of the spending was in the fourth quarter as Grown in Idaho achieved some key distribution milestones. The remainder of the increase in SG&A was largely due to inflation and incremental labor benefits and infrastructure cost related to operating and standalone public company.  This includes higher expenses for information technology services and infrastructure, as well as investments in our sales, marketing, and operating capabilities. Adjusted operating income was up 9% to $153 million in the quarter driven by the increase in sales and gross profit. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe and Lamb Weston/RDO in Minnesota were $20 million. That\u2019s essentially the same as last year.  However these amounts include a $700,000 unrealized gain related to mark-to-market adjustment associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in the current quarter and a nearly $4 million gain in the prior year quarter. Excluding these adjustments, equity earnings increased $3 million. This was driven by solid operating results in Europe reflecting volume growth and lower production costs, partially offset by lower price mix. So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA, including the proportional EBITDA from our two unconsolidated joint ventures increased 11% to $213 million, essentially all of the increase was driven by earnings growth in our base business.  Moving down the income statement, interest expense was about $27 million and our effective tax rate, excluding the impact of comparability items was about 23.5%.  Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 up $0.16 or about 28%. About $0.10 of that increase was a benefit from applying a lower tax rate as a result of recently enacted tax reform. The remaining increase was driven by operating gains in our base business.  Now let's review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the Top-100 U.S. based chains, as well as all other sales outside of North America were up 13%. Price mix rose 8% as we continue to benefit from contract pricing structures put in place in the middle of last year. We also continued to improve customer and product mix.  Volume grew 5%, more than half of that was driven by the benefit of limited time product offerings in both the U.S. and internationally. The remainder was driven by growth in sales to strategic customers in the U.S. and international markets. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit, less advertising and promotional expense increased $20 million or 27%. Its product contribution margin percentage expanded by 220 basis points. The increases were driven by favorable price mix and volume and were partially offset by higher transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense, primarily associated with the new Richland line.  Sales for our Foodservice segment which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top-100 North American restaurant customers increased 7%. Price mix increased 7% reflecting the carryover impact of pricing actions taken last year and continued improvement in the customer and product mix. Volume declined nominally as increased shipments of higher margin Lamb Weston branded and operator label products largely offset the continued effect of exiting some lower margin distributor labeled volume in the middle of fiscal 2018. The loss of this volume will continue to be a headwind through the early part of the third quarter.  Foodservice\u2019s product contribution margin increased $11 million or 12% and its contribution margin percentage expanded by 180 basis points. The increases were driven by favorable price mix, which more than offset higher transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing costs and the Richland depreciation.  Sales in our Retail segment grew 26%. Price mix increased 13% driven by higher prices across our branded and private-label portfolio and improved mix. Trade expense was also lower as we began to lapse some of the higher spending associated with the launch of Grown in Idaho in early fiscal 2018. Volume was up 13% driven by distribution gains in Grown in Idaho and other branded products.  Retail\u2019s product contribution margins increased $6 million or 38% due to higher price mix and volume. This more than offset increased investments in advertising and promotional support behind Grown in Idaho as well as transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing cost inflation. Product contribution margin percentage expanded by 160 basis points.  Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow, our total debt at the end of the year was about $2.4 billion, while cash on hand increased to about $150 million. This puts our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3 times, which is below our target range of 3.5 to 4. We expect our net debt will rise as we increase working capital consistent with our typical seasonal needs and as we complete the acquisition of our partner\u2019s of the BSW joint venture.  We continue to expect the BSW purchase to be about $65 million subject to negotiation of final terms, as well as the closing date. With respect to cash flow, we generated nearly $230 million of cash from operations driven by strong earnings growth and normal seasonal working capital release.  We invested about $90 million in capital expenditures, which included the ongoing construction of our new production line in Hermiston, Oregon. We also paid $28 million in dividends to our shareholders.  Turning to our fiscal 2019 outlook, as Tom mentioned, despite our European joint venture\u2019s earnings being pressured, we remain on track to deliver on our earnings commitments for the year, because of actions we are taking both in Europe and North America.  We continue to expect sales to grow in the mid-single-digit range with stronger growth in the first half as a result of the carryover benefit of pricing actions in each of our core segments benefit of incremental volume availability from our new Richland capacity and more difficult year-over-year comparisons as the year progresses, especially in our Global and Retail segments. In addition, as Tom noted, while the imposition of new tariffs remains a risk, we\u2019ve accounted for all known changes in our outlook. We continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures to be in the range of $860 million to $870 million with sales and gross profit growth driving the increase.  We are still targeting gross profit growing at least in line with sales with favorable price mix and productivity more than offsetting higher transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense.  We continue to expect our total production cost per pound including potatoes to increase in the mid-single-digit range. We\u2019ll provide our updated view of North America\u2019s crop quality and how we expect the crop will hold up in storage when we report our second quarter results in early January. Regarding SG&A, as we mentioned in prior calls, and as you saw in our first quarter results, we\u2019re targeting SG&A to increase significantly as we make investments in our IT systems, and other capabilities to support growth and drive operating efficiencies over the long-term. As we\u2019ve discussed today, we expect equity method earnings will likely decline because of the European crop issues. We initially had targeted to be essentially flat versus last year.  So altogether, we anticipate that operating gains in our base business will offset weakness in equity earnings and that will drive the majority of our growth in adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures. The remainder of our EBITDA growth will be from acquiring the 50% of our consolidated joint venture Lamb Weston BSW that we currently don\u2019t own. The other financial targets remain the same including total interest expense of around $110 million, an effective tax rate of about 24%, capital expenditures of about $360 million and total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $150 million.  Let me now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Rob. Let me quickly sum up by saying that, we are pleased with our strong financial results in the quarter. We are committed to strategically investing in our capacity, infrastructure and capabilities to support our customers, as well as our future growth and operating efficiencies and despite some near-term volatility in Europe, we\u2019ve remained well positioned to deliver our fiscal 2019 targets as we continue to execute on our strategic and financial objectives and create value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston and now we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning. Rob McNutt : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Couple questions, I guess first, just in terms of sort of the situation in Europe, can you give us a sense of kind of, where you stand versus, maybe some of your larger competitors in terms of being able to cope with this? I guess, what I was trying to drive that was, do you have less fewer potatoes in storage versus some of your competitors or some other sort of mitigating factor that might either enable you to gain share or lose share in this situation? Tom Werner : Thanks, Bryan. It\u2019s Tom. I think, as we continue to evaluate the situation in Europe, the way we are handling it is, as I stated earlier, we are working across our network to make sure, first and foremost that we are servicing our customers and in terms of how the industry is going to be impacted, it\u2019s going to be very different within our competitive set.  The good news is, for us, with our global networks, we have more flexibility to service our customers. The team in Europe is doing a terrific job making sure that as we look at the crop and understand how the quality and the yield is going to play out, we\u2019ve taken actions to make sure that we have potatoes available to service our customers, and again where we can we are shipping some of that production to the U.S. to make sure that we are servicing our customers.  So, we are running our playbook. The other folks, the other competitors, they are taking actions too. So, it\u2019s really just a wait and see and make sure we understand how this is going to play out. Bryan Spillane : All right. Thank you. And then, just, one other one, related to the market in North America, if you kind of look at the Global segment and then in Foodservice, the independent restaurants, I think one of the things that \u2013 one of the questions we have fielded quite a bit over the course of this quarter was this concern in general that maybe things were slowing, especially among some of the big QSRs.  So, could you just give us a sense of, if you kind of think about that collective universe, just kind of what\u2019s happening from a demand perspective and any color maybe that you might have, maybe QSR versus casual dining versus independents would be helpful. Thank you. Tom Werner : Yes, Bryan, I would tell you, based on the data we look at, June, July, August was one of the best industry traffic quarters that we\u2019ve seen in long time across the entire restaurant industry. So, it was a good quarter and in terms of people going out to eat across most all the segments and that\u2019s certainly reflective in our results for this quarter. Bryan Spillane : Okay, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good morning everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Tom, you referenced some of the issues in fiscal 2017, I think in discussing the lag between higher costs and pricing actions. I guess, with that mind, I think in 2017, you mentioned the equity method earnings were flat year-over-year and then in 2018, this line item obviously increased dramatically, I think up over like 50% to $82 million or so.  So, I guess, just based on your experience, then and what you know now and some of the remedial actions that you are obviously aggressively taking to deal with things in Europe, I guess, are there any key reasons that are maybe very different structurally that would prevent Lamb from seeing, not exactly that type of recovery, but a sizable recovery in magnitude in fiscal 2020 like we saw in 2018 versus 2017 in the equity income method line. Tom Werner : Andrew, I would say, it\u2019s going to be pretty similar and the key thing here again is, we still have to get the potatoes out of the ground, see what the quality of the yield is, but the lag and how this all is going to play out is, we are taking actions that are going to remediate some of the difficulties we are having with the potato crop and the timing of our pricing actions versus the cost, there is always a little bit of a lag, but typically, it should be very similar to how 2017, 2018 played out in terms of cost and then recovery. Andrew Lazar : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, just as we think about the industry maybe doing its best to shift to source some of the supply to Europe from North America to help service those customers. If that does become the case, I assume that always well for even tighter supply with respect to the incremental capacity coming online and therefore, maybe continuing to sort of support, I guess, this supply \u2013 this tight sort of supply/demand environment. Would that \u2013 do you think that\u2019s an accurate way to think about it? Tom Werner : Andrew, I think it is. But this is the beauty of this business, when you have a situation like this, you work through it this year and you start over. So, it\u2019s going to be a bit of a one year situation we are dealing with and there will be some movement like I said earlier, with some production we are going to move within North America that help supplement the European situation. But, once we get through this crop, we start all over. So, all bets are off so to speak as we start the 2019 crop year. Andrew Lazar : Yes, understood. Thanks very much, Tom. Tom Werner : Yes. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Tom Werner : Yes, good morning, Adam. Rob McNutt : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Maybe just kind of following up on Andrew\u2019s question in kind of a different light, just clear that the pressure in Europe this year, the base business in North America is offsetting as well as some of the actions you are taking in Europe to mitigate the cost pressures.  But is there anyway just to dimensionalize kind of what incremental pressure you\u2019ve kind of absorbed in Europe in the guidance that you gave you, you said flat now down. Just want to make sure we are thinking about the magnitude properly because as you kind of alluded to as we move past this crop into the next crop, next year assuming more normal conditions the business is in a better position, just want to make sure we understand kind of that magnitude. Tom Werner : Yes, Adam, we don\u2019t \u2013 a couple of pieces. One, as Tom mentioned, the crop is still coming out of the ground in Europe, so we have to fully assess that. Secondly, the actions that we are taking, especially related to pricing are in flight today and so we will see how that plays out over time. And frankly, I don\u2019t want to get into detailed forecasting throughout the income statement. I don\u2019t think that that makes sense for us. So, again, the overall focus is that, continue to deliver that 860 to 870 guidance. Adam Samuelson : Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful and then, maybe just going back to the base business in the Global segment. You alluded to limited time offers kind of \u2013 half of the volume growth in the quarter and also a contributor to the price mix. Can you talk what the visibility that you have looking into the balance of the year on LTO activity with some of your major partners there both domestically and overseas and I mean, from a margin perspective, that seems like it\u2019s been a nice tailwind and kind of visibility that could continue? Tom Werner : Yes, certainly, Adam, we are working hand-in-hand with our customers. I am not going to get into specifics. But we do have line of sight to what their plans are for the balance of the year and we\u2019ve reflected that into our outlook. Adam Samuelson : Is the activity level that you saw in the fiscal first quarter kind of, is that, abnormally higher that \u2013 kind of thinking about that kind of runrate prospectively reasonable? Dexter Congbalay : Hey, it\u2019s Dexter. We don\u2019t want to get into specifics on basically how much we do on LTOs every single quarter. We do have LTOs almost every single quarter when we report. So I just don\u2019t want to get into that type of detail.  Just a little bit on the back half of this year as you know that, we did talk about this a little bit in our prepared remarks, but starting Q3, we had a very strong quarter both in our Global segment and in our Retail segment, in our Global in particular had some strong activity in LTOs. So, just keep that in mind in terms from a modeling standpoint. Adam Samuelson : Understood. I appreciate. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask about the top-line guidance, right. So, you are to get to 5% mid-single-digits, the rest of the year, would that could be like 2.6%. I know you \u2013 there is a lot of moving parts right now and it\u2019s still early. But, how are we going to get there? Because the next quarter seems to be one where you should have similar price mix of this quarter just because of the way you are going to be lapping timing-wise some of the initiatives in Global. So can you help me understand your guidance and how much of this is conservatism given its early stages so? Rob McNutt : Yes, Akshay, Rob. In terms of the outlook, again, as Dexter just mentioned, we had some tailwinds in the back half of the year on both top-line and bottom-line last year. So, the comps are little tougher. And again, as you say, it\u2019s \u2013 this is Q1 and so we think it\u2019s best at this point in the year to be prudent in terms of our outlook and guidance and so, that\u2019s why we elected to keep it as we had initially indicated. Akshay Jagdale : Sounds good. And then, just, I know you don\u2019t want to be specific for a number of reasons on various items, but just high level if you could give some qualitative commentary? It seems to me that your guidance today obviously accounts for some negative impacts from the European JV.  But I am not sure if it takes into account any positive impacts related to that as it relates to your export business or incremental pricing as a result of what\u2019s happening in Europe. Is that fair? I mean, are you accounting for any gains in your guidance related to Europe in North America right now? Tom Werner : Akshay, it\u2019s Tom. I would say, we certainly have a point of view on all the moving pieces right now which is we\u2019ve taken our estimate in our guidance and I think, the important thing here to remember is, in sixty days, we are going to have a pretty clear understanding of what we are dealing with in Europe.  And when we have our January call, we will give clear guidance as to the impacts pluses and minuses, both in Europe and potential opportunities that could be realized in our North American business in some of these international markets where the European competitors may have a problem servicing those markets.  So, the bottom-line is, it\u2019s just going to take 30 to 60 days to understand what we are dealing with. We have reflected our best estimate in our outlook today and we\u2019ll update our investors in January as this thing starts to become more clear. Akshay Jagdale : Got it. One last one, it\u2019s probably for Rob. The information systems investments typically when companies go through that, there is some disruptions. Can you give us a sense of what the plan is and how you are accounting for the uncertainty that comes with that kind of change? Thank you. Rob McNutt : Yes. Sure, Akshay. And again, the planning related to this, I mean, I have done a few of these over the course of my career in different companies and our CIO, Don Barber has done a few of these in the course of his career. And so, I think we\u2019ve seen those potential disruptions and so, it\u2019s a matter of good deliberate planning and just working through the process. And so, again, these things are never perfect, but the objectives that we have in mind and we\u2019ve successfully been able to do this in the past is, do not disrupt the business, so. Akshay Jagdale : Perfect. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Andrew Carter with Stifel. Andrew Carter : Good morning guys. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Carter : Hey guys. Could you all give us an update on your capacity utilization kind of your estimate for the industry and in particular just if you had the capacity out there to take advantage of any shortfalls from your European competitors caused by the adverse conditions in Europe? Tom Werner : Andrew, I would say, our capacity utilization has been similar to what it\u2019s been the last couple of years. We were running at a high utilization rates. The industry we believe continues to operate at high utilization rates. That\u2019s \u2013 the biggest priority right now is get our Hermiston line up and running and that\u2019s on track to come online in May of 2019.  But we have not \u2013 there is nothing that\u2019s changed from a capacity utilization significantly in the last two years. So, everybody is running wide open and we are doing some things from a maintenance standpoint, moving some things around to support our customers.  So, we continue to operate at a high level. The industry continues to operate at high levels and that\u2019s going to \u2013 with this situation in Europe, that\u2019s going to pressure some areas in the industry in terms of capacity. Andrew Carter : Got it. It\u2019s helpful. Second question, does your guidance contemplate any incremental pricing actions particularly on smaller foodservice customers? I know, you are not going to talk about prospective pricing. But we just want to understand how another round of contract negotiations could affect your pricing for the year and have any incremental pricing actions had been announced? Tom Werner : Andrew, I would say, our outlook, we certainly have contemplated the things that we can do in the market in terms of pricing and some pricing actions we\u2019ve taken. We are in the middle of some few contract negotiations right now. So, we have folded that into our outlook. So, right now, our best estimate, again is, has taken all that into consideration when we are guiding for the full year and any additional things we may do to offset any pressures of the business, that\u2019s just normal course of business going forward. Andrew Carter : Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Tom Werner : Yes. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Gallo with C.L. King. Michael Gallo : Hi, good morning. Tom Werner : Hi. Michael Gallo : I wanted to just delve in on - again on Europe and speak to whether you see perhaps some M&A opportunities emerging in this. I would think that there will be a number of distressed producers and obviously you have an opportunity to certainly grow your share that way. So, is that something you are kind of stepping up focus? Is that\u2019s something you are focused on and how should we expect to pursue that? Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes, Michael, it was always been a focus. As I have stated in the past, we are certainly interested in opportunities in Europe from an M&A perspective. This is going to pressure some of the competitors and as you can imagine, we are as active as we can be. But those things are hard to \u2013 it\u2019s always hard to predict when that\u2019s going to happen.  But this, who knows, it may give us an opportunity with the situation that\u2019s going on and if some shakes loose, we are going to be active in it. Michael Gallo : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Carla Casella with J.P. Morgan. Carla Casella : Hi, on that same front on the retail side of the business, can you just talk about your strategy there inside of your business where you consider selling to invest more heavily in the Foodservice and Global business? Tom Werner : Carla, I am a 100% committed to our Retail business. It plays an important part within our network in terms of balancing out the overall potato crop based on some of the retail products we make. So I have no interest in divesting any retail business. We are committed to it.  We launched Grown in Idaho. It\u2019s been an awesome launch and we are gaining share and right now, based on how we look at the category with all of our private-label license brands, Grown in Idaho, we are the share leader in the category and it\u2019s growing. So I am committed to it. Team does a great job and I have no interest in divesting that. Carla Casella : Okay, great and I wasn\u2019t suggesting that that \u2013 this does more than that frozen category is hot right now. I know there is probably a lot of demand. Just one clarification on the CapEx for the new facility that will all be spent by May, but will it be lumpy to the year or give a sense for the timing of that CapEx? Tom Werner : Yes, we \u2013 that \u2013 just to clarify, the cash spend won\u2019t all done by the year end necessarily. The line will be up and running by May, but there is typically some carryover on that because of payment terms and needing to hit performance milestones and so forth. But in terms of the timing of that, we haven\u2019t talked about how lumpy that\u2019s going to be on capital spending we have forecasted quarter-by-quarter on that, so. Carla Casella : Okay, but that\u2019s all \u2013 that was the forecast that was included in the guidance for 2019 or was that the total 200 spend over the period - over the restructuring? Tom Werner : Yes, 250 is the total cost. 360 is our total program for this year. Carla Casella : Okay. Tom Werner : So, part of that 250 or a big chunk of that 250 is going to be spent in this fiscal year. Rob McNutt : 200 of it, yes, it\u2019s 200 \u2013 with the 250. Carla Casella : And the SG&A, the SG&A increase that you talked about, you have significant increase in SG&A. We saw that this quarter. Is that something that would be that is lumpy through the year or it looks like, it maybe front-end loaded? Am I reading that correctly? Or could we see similar increases as we go into the back half? Tom Werner : Yes, we had indicated that we were going to have increases over the year related to one, the standalone company issues and then, some of the investments we are making specifically in IT, infrastructure and systems and so forth. So we anticipate that SG&A is going to be higher for the full year and that was included in those guidance numbers. As I mentioned, there are some lumpy things that flows through SG&A including FX, including things like equity compensation when stock price moves around that so forth. So there is lumpiness from things like that. But we expect SG&A to be elevated over the course of the year. Carla Casella : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Hi, it\u2019s Dexter. Any questions or follow-ups, just send me an email probably be the best way to get me and we can schedule a quick call. Other than that, thanks to everybody for joining us for our call today. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston second quarter earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our overall performance, some recent capital deployment actions, and an update on the operating environment in North America and Europe. Rob will then provide the details on our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2019 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you. Dexter. Good morning, everyone, Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered another quarter of strong sales, earnings, and cash flow growth, demonstrating our consistent performance since becoming an independent company a little over two years ago. The Lamb Weston team remains focused on executing against our annual and long-term strategic priorities, and this focus and organizational alignment across our entire company continues to drive our results and positions us for the long term. Specifically, sales increased 11% both in the quarter and through the first half of the year. This was driven by a good balance of price mix and volume growth. Adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures increased 18% to $223 million in the quarter driven by strong sales and gross profit growth. Through the first half, it's up 15% to $436 million. And through the first half, we generated more than $350 million of cash flow from operations, largely driven by earnings growth. Because of our strong year-to-date results, good operating momentum and confidence in our team's ability to manage through the challenging environment in Europe, we've raised our fiscal 2019 outlook for both sales and EBITDA. In addition, we continue to take actions that show our balanced, returns-driven approach when deploying capital. This includes the construction of our new 300-million-pound expansion in Hermiston, Oregon, which remains on track to start up in May of 2019. This new line will help us continue to support the growth of our strategic customers in the U.S., as well as support export markets. It also includes a couple of recent acquisitions. In December, we completed the purchase of our joint venture partner\u2019s interest in Lamb Weston BSW for about four times EBITDA. This consolidation allows us to realize the full financial benefit of the JVs production facility going forward. Also, in December, we acquired Marvel Packers, a frozen potato processor in Australia for about AUD125 million, which is about USD90 million. With Marvel's 50-million-pound facility, it gives us the opportunity to increase our position in Australia\u2019s 1.1-billion-pound market. The Marvel transaction is a great example of our strategy to strengthen and broaden our manufacturing footprint outside North America and we'll continue to evaluate other acquisition opportunities as they arise. And finally, as we announced a couple of weeks ago, our Board of Directors approved two items to return more cash to shareholders. First, we increased our quarterly dividend by about 5% to $0.20 per share. This is consistent with our stated policy to target a payout ratio of 25% to 35% of adjusted EPS. And second, we adopted a $250 million share repurchase program. This is an open-ended program, which will allow us to buy back stock on an opportunistic basis. Together these capital deployment actions show our commitment to investing strategically to drive growth both organically and through acquisitions, as well as providing a competitive return of capital to shareholders. Now turning to our operating environment. In North America, we expect the environment to remain generally favorable through the rest of fiscal 2019, as demand growth continues to be solid, while available manufacturing capacity remains tight. Our expectations for the cost environment are also unchanged.  We continue to expect modest, but steady inflation in each of our major cost categories. This includes a low-to-mid single digit cost increase for potatoes, as the crops in our growing areas in North America are consistent with historical averages in terms of yield, quality, and performance and storage. And as we discussed on our last earnings call, we expect the environment in Europe will be volatile through fiscal 2019 and into the first half of fiscal 2020 as a result of a poor potato crop in the region. Extreme heat and drought conditions in Europe during the growing season resulted in overall crop yields being down about 20% versus historical averages. The short crop along with poor quality is resulting in sharply higher potato costs for Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture and for the industry. While higher potato costs have already begun to affect Lamb Weston/Meijer's results this quarter, we expect the cost impact will be more pronounced in the second half of fiscal 2019. Since late summer, the team in Europe has been taking the necessary steps to mitigate the cost increase, including raising prices, which will be phased in over the next couple of quarters, working closely with customers as we navigate through poor crop quality and production yields for the balance of this crop year, and driving productivity and other cost savings initiatives across the organization. Despite these efforts, we expect Lamb Weston/Meijer's earnings to decline versus the prior year. The impact will be felt, especially, in our fiscal third quarter as the joint venture absorbs the higher costs but before much of the pricing benefits are realized. Our teams in Europe and the U.S. are working closely together to capitalize on our global capabilities to further offset this earnings pressure and maintain quality and service levels for our strategic customers. We are leveraging Lamb Weston's global manufacturing footprint by stretching US production capacity to support Lamb Weston/Meijer's customers in Europe and other markets as needed. We're also leveraging our U.S. assets to serve other potential customers as opportunities arise in key export markets, especially in Asia and the Middle East. The bottom line is that I'm confident that our teams in Europe and the U.S. are taking the right actions and we believe we have a good hand on this year's crop challenges in Europe. So, to quickly sum it up, because of the strong year-to-date results and execution in our base business, the actions our European team is taking to manage through the current volatile environment in Europe and our ability to leverage our global footprint to capitalize on opportunities, we are able to raise our sales and earnings targets for the year. We are strategically investing to drive growth and operating efficiencies and we are committed to return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and modest share repurchase program. Now, let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our results and our updated outlook. Rob? Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered another strong performance in the quarter and for the first half of the year. So, our teams continue to execute well in generally favorable operating environment in North America. Specifically, in the quarter, net sales increased 11% to $911 million. Price mix was up 6% as we continue to benefit from pricing structures in our Global segment contracts renewed last year, as well as from pricing actions and improved mix in our Foodservice and Retail segments. Volume increased 5% led by growth in our Global and Retail segments. Gross profit increased 20% to nearly $250 million, higher price-mix, volume growth, and supply chain efficiency savings drove the increase more than offsetting the impact of higher transportation and warehousing costs and material input and manufacturing cost inflation. Our gross margin percentage expanded 210 basis points to more than 27%. SG&A expense excluding items impacting comparability increased about $11 million to $75 million. This included a $2 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, which was more than offset by a $4 million benefit related to an insurance settlement. In addition, advertising and promotional expense was up about $1 million. In addition to inflation, the majority of the rest of the increase in SG&A was due to increased investments in our sales, marketing, operating, and information technology capabilities to support growth and drive operating efficiencies. While IT costs were up in the quarter, we expect them to build further as the year progresses and we continue to work on a new ERP system. Because of our strong sales and gross profit growth, adjusted operating income was up $30 million or 21% to $174 million. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe and Lamb Weston/RDO in Minnesota were $10 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to hedging contracts, equity earnings declined about $4 million. This was largely due to the higher raw potato costs in Europe that Tom described earlier, partially offset by higher price mix and volume growth in both Europe and the U.S. By putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA including the proportional EBITDA from our two unconsolidated joint ventures increased $34 million or 18% to $223 million. All of the increase was driven by strong sales and earnings growth in our base business. Moving down the income statement, interest expense was about $26 million, that's about $1 million less than last year, despite higher interest rates since we reduced our net debt. Our effective tax rate, excluding the impact of comparability items was about 21.5%, that\u2019s significantly lower than the 33.5% we posted last year due to U.S. tax reform. It's also a bit lower than we expected since it includes the benefit of some foreign-related discrete items. Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.80, that's up $0.26 or about 48%. The majority of the increase was driven by operating gains in our base business, while about $0.10 resulted from applying the lower tax rate as a result of tax reform. Now let's review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based chains, as well as all other sales outside of North America, were up 13%, price mix rose 7% as we continued to benefit from contract pricing structures put in place in the middle of last year. We also continued to improve mix. Volume grew 6%.  About a quarter of the growth was from limited time product offerings in both Asia and the U.S., the remainder was driven by growth in sales to strategic customers in the U.S. in key international markets. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit plus advertising and promotional expense increased $25 million or about 28%.  Its product contribution margin percentage expanded by 290 basis points. The increases were driven by favorable price mix and volume, as well as supply chain efficiency savings and were partially offset by higher transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing cost inflation. Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers increased 3%. Price mix increased 5% reflecting the carryover impact of pricing actions taken last year, as well as improved mix.  Volume declined 2% with the loss of some lower margin products, which was partially offset by increased shipments of higher margin products. Foodservice's product contribution margin increased $6 million or 6%, and contribution margin percentage expanded by 110 basis points. The increases were driven by favorable price, improved mix, and supply chain efficiency savings and were partially offset by higher transportation, warehousing, input manufacturing costs. Sales in our Retail segment grew 21%, price mix increased 5% driven by higher prices across our branded and private label portfolio and improved mix. Volume was up 16% with distribution gains of Grown in Idaho, other branded products and private label products driving the increase. Retail's product contribution margin increased $7 million or 34% due to higher price-mix, volume growth and supply chain efficiency savings. This was partially offset by transportation, warehousing, input and manufacturing cost inflation, while advertising and promotional expense was essentially flat. Product contribution margin percentage expanded by 200 basis points. Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.4 billion, while cash on hand was about $120 million. This put our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 2.9 times. However, since the end of the quarter, our net debt has increased somewhat as we used cash on hand and short-term borrowings to pay $50 million of the $78 million cost to acquire our partner's half of the BSW joint venture, we acquired the potato processor in Australia for about [USD$90 million], as well as to finance normal seasonal working capital needs. We continue to target leverage range of 3.5 times to 4 times and remain comfortable being below that range as we continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities. With respect to cash flow in the first half of the year, we generated $317 million of cash from operations, driven by strong earnings growth, that's up from $182 million generated in the first half of fiscal 2018. We invested about 170 million in capital expenditures, including for the ongoing construction of our new french fry line in Hermiston, Oregon. We also paid $56 million in dividends to our shareholders. Turning to our fiscal 2019 outlook. As Tom mentioned, our first half performance provided a solid foundation for the year. We feel good about how well the organization is executing and the operating momentum we've built and the current business environment in North America and our key international markets. As a result, we've raised our sales and earnings outlook for the full year. For sales, we now expect sales to grow at a mid- to high-single digit rate up from the previous estimate of mid-single digits. As we indicated in our initial outlook estimate, we continue to expect that our sales growth in the second half of the year will slow from the 11% growth we delivered in the first half. This is largely a result of lapping strong sales growth that we delivered in the second half of fiscal 2018, especially in the third quarter. As a reminder, in the back half of fiscal 2018, in our Global segment, we had a large number of contracts that were up for bid and successfully renewed with meaningful pricing step-up effective in the third quarter last year. In addition, some notable limited time offerings, as well as incremental capacity from our new Richland line also helped drive significant volume growth. In our Foodservice segment, the carryover impact of multiple pricing actions taken in fiscal 2017 and into early fiscal 2018 drove the sales increase and in our Retail segment, we delivered exceptionally strong volume growth and price mix improvement as we broaden distribution of Grown in Idaho branded products and gain market share across our entire portfolio, while our largest competitor face some temporary issues. In addition, the timing of some shipments from Q2 into Q3 of last year also benefited volume growth in the second half. To be clear, we still expect to deliver solid overall sales growth in the back half of the year. In Global, we're targeting volume to drive most of the growth as price escalators that are built into our multi-year contracts are more modest compared to those this past year.  In addition, we may be able to grow export volumes by leveraging our global footprint, while European processors face potato shortages. In Foodservice, we anticipate recently enacted price increases will drive most of the sales growth. Volume growth should improve versus the first half as we begin to lap the loss of some of the distributor label volume early in the third quarter last year and as we drive incremental benefit from our new direct sales force. In Retail, while the business is performing well, we expect to see sales relatively flat as we lap very difficult prior year comps, especially for volume. As a reminder, in the third and fourth quarters of last year, we delivered sales growth of 31% and 26% respectively in Retail segment. In short, for the total company, we expect to continue to drive solid sales growth in the second half with a good balance of volume growth and improved price mix. For earnings, we've increased our target for adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures to a range of $870 million to $880 million, that's up from a range of $860 million to $870 million. Using the midpoint of the new range that's an increase of about $55 million or 7% versus last year. We continue to anticipate the sales and gross profit growth will drive that increase. For the full-year, we're still targeting gross profit growth, at least in line with sales with favorable price mix and productivity more than offsetting higher transportation, warehousing, input, manufacturing cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense. For the second half, we continue to expect the gross profit growth may lag sales growth. This is largely due to higher transportation, warehousing and production cost inflation, including for raw potatoes, it's also due to potential unfavorable mix resulting from fewer limited time offerings compared to last year, as well as growth in exports, which typically carry a lower margin. Regarding SG&A for the full-year, we continue to target increasing significantly as we make investments in our IT and ERP systems, as well as in sales, marketing, innovation, operations and other functional capabilities. As I noted earlier, we expect these investments will build as the year progresses, especially as we begin to step up spending behind our ERP system. We believe that these investments are necessary to support growth and drive operating efficiencies over the long-term. While we expect spending behind these investments will be elevated for a couple of years, we continue to target total SG&A excluding advertising and promotional expense to return to a range of 8% to 8.5% of sales over the long term. For equity earnings, as Tom, mentioned earlier, we anticipate it will decline versus prior year. Most of this decline will be realized in the second half of the year, largely due to higher potato costs in Europe and will be partially offset by pricing actions and cost savings initiatives. In addition, due to a typical lag in the implementation of new pricing structures in that market, we expect the decline in equity earnings will be more pronounced in the third quarter. So, looking at our updated high level, we're targeting mid-to-high single-digit sales growth for the full year, while growth will slow from the 11% that we delivered the first half as we strong \u2013 as we lap strong prior year compares will continue to drive solid sales growth in the second half with a good overall balance of volume growth and improved price mix. For earnings, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of $870 million to $880 million. Strong sales and gross profit growth in our base business will drive most of the increase and will be tempered somewhat by higher investments in SG&A and softer results than we originally anticipated in Europe, especially, in the second half of the year. In addition, about $10 million of EBITDA increase will be from the recent consolidation of the interest in our joint venture Lamb Weston/BSW that we didn't know. That's down from about $20 million that we targeted in our original outlook due to the timing of the close of the transaction. Except for taxes, our other financial targets for the full-year remain the same, including total interest expense of around $110 million, capital expenditures of about $360 million and total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $150 million. For taxes, we now expect an effective tax rate for the full-year of about 23%, that's down from our previous estimate of 24% due to the benefit of discrete items. For the second half, we continue to anticipate it will be about 24%. Let me now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Rob. Let me quickly sum up by saying, our strong financial results in the quarter and in the first half of the year provided a strong foundation to raise our financial targets for the full-year. We demonstrated our commitment to our capital allocation priorities through investment in growth, in our base business and strategic acquisitions, continued support of a competitive dividend and the adoption of an opportunistic share buyback program. I'm confident that we remain well-positioned to continue to create value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston and we're now happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Andrew Lazar : Morning everybody and Happy New Year. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Tom, I think you mentioned a couple of times about the potential opportunity to service some of the export demand that potentially some of the European suppliers might be less able to do. And I'm just curious if the potential size or magnitude of that opportunity is, I guess is enough to \u2013 continue to impact the tightness of the U.S. or North American marketplace such that that helps to keep that marketplace reasonably tight even as we head into a period of time where there is expected to be some additional industry capacity coming online. Tom Werner : Yes. Andrew, I \u2013 it's still early with respect to how the difficulty with the European crop is going to play out, and I will tell you right now, I anticipate in the next couple of months that it's going to start to really \u2013 from an industry perspective, in a couple of months it's going to start moving around in terms of the overall crop availability in Europe. We haven't seen anything right now that indicates there is going to be some big movement in volume in terms of European availability versus U.S. support. We've taken actions within our business to help support our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture with some material volume that we moved to the U.S. My experience with this kind of situation in the past is it takes time, and I think in the next couple of months, we'll start seeing some impact of volume movement with customers, but it's always \u2013 the interesting thing in these situations, it always comes down to like the fourth quarter of a football game where the customers will realize that the impact and the availability of volume, they won\u2019t have an idea until the end of the crop year. So, it's going to take a couple more months to play out. I think we're going to have opportunities that are going to come our way, but it's going to be one-offs as this situation plays out. Andrew Lazar : Got it. And then on some of the previous calls, you've given us kind of an overall perspective, a little bit around what you're seeing from a trend perspective in the overall sort of key QSR sort of space with respect to consumption and takeaway and things of that nature. I'm curious if you've got just an updated view on how some of those trends look at some of your key strategic end customers? Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew, it's a mixed bag. Right now, I think the last two, three quarters, the data we look at, the QSRs that have -- the traffic\u2019s been up, check\u2019s been up, so that's a great trend. You go down the line and you look at the fast-casual mid-scale, they are still down, but they're not down as pronounced as they have been. So, we see it in our numbers, obviously, we\u2019ve got a broad customer mix within our portfolio. But right now, in the past two, three quarters, the QSRs, it's been pretty positive overall, and we can see it in our trends, our numbers, and obviously our quarterly report today, you\u2019ll see it in our global business unit, volume has been up. So, we are watching it closely, there is a lot of mixed indicators, but right now, everything looks positive for us. Andrew Lazar : Thanks very much everyone. Operator : We will now take our next question from Chris Growe of Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Chris Growe : Thank you. Good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi. I just had a question for you in relation to \u2013 you're transitioning to kind of the so called the second year of some of these contracts and pricing is expected to weaken a bit in the second half as you've noted. Can you give any color around the sort of pricing you expect in the second half, particularly in the Global division? And if I could just add to that, will the pricing coming through the second half be enough to offset inflation, which I think is remaining at a little higher pace in the second half of the year? Rob McNutt : Yes, Chris. This is Rob. Just to clarify, we will still see price increases in the Global business that are built into the contract. They just aren't as strong as what we saw last year in the third quarter. So, they're still up. And again, as I mentioned in my comments that, we are seeing inflation and especially transportation, warehousing continues to push on the inflation side, that is going to put pressure on margins in the back half of the year. Chris Growe : So, your pricing wouldn't be sufficient to offset the total inflation coming through, is that what I read through that comment then Rob? Rob McNutt : Well, I think it's going to be closer, it's going to tighten that margin up a bit. Chris Growe : Okay. Rob McNutt : So, where we saw nice margin expansion in the first half, it\u2019s going to be a little closer in the second half. Chris Growe : Okay. And then just a quick follow-on to, let\u2019s say Andrew's question in relation to Europe. With that weak potato crop, are you seeing any potential opportunity to acquire businesses in that area given kind of the turmoil in that market? Is that -- and your balance sheet is in great shape and below your targeted debt-to--EBITDA range, is that the area you've been \u2013 that you think could provide some opportunity for you in the future? Tom Werner : Chris, it\u2019s Tom. I'm not going to get into specifics obviously, but certainly I think the fragmented market in Europe, I believe there is great opportunity there. The cycle we're in right now with Europe, we've been through before, and what I will say is, we're continually active in terms of M&A, but right now, I'm not going to comment on how things are playing out. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Chris. Operator : We will now take our next question from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Akshay Jagdale : Hi, good morning, Happy New Year, and congrats on a solid quarter, again. Tom Werner : Good morning, Akshay. Akshay Jagdale : Good morning. First one is clarification, just follow-up on for Rob. Can you explain the \u2013 you said 10 million versus 20 million for the JV the difference relative to what you had modeled, and you said all of it is timing related. Can you just walk me through just high level the math there if it's complicated, we can definitely take it offline, but that I'm not sure I'm following that? Rob McNutt : No, it's pretty straightforward, that \u2013 again, if you go back to last year for the full-year, that JV, the partner share of that, that we deducted out of the bottom was about $20 million for the full-year in terms of EBITDA, right? And so, we had exercised our option at first date that we could and then it took us six months or so to negotiate through the detail of that and get that close. So, in our initial outlook when we had budgeted and provider a forecast, we assumed we close that out at the very first of the fiscal year, which we would have picked up that extra $20 million because it took us until December to get it closed about $10 million of that wasn't realized. Akshay Jagdale : Got it. Helpful. Second question, you mentioned, if I'm not wrong, some incremental price increases in Foodservice, is that correctly and can you just give us some color around that? Is that just on your brand, is it across the board, are you seeing your competitors follow et cetera? Rob McNutt : Yes, that's in September. There is a price increase announced in Foodservice, again, in Foodservice contracts vary and how that works and so that will play out and be implemented over several months and even quarters here. So, we are seeing that come through, others also announced price increases similarly, and again, I think it's again driven by the relatively tight capacity relative to demand. Akshay Jagdale : Awesome. And then just one last one, this is more, it's probably related to Europe, but it's more a broader question about capacity and supply and demand globally, right. So, if I'm hearing or interpreting your comments correctly, Tom and just correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I'm interpreting it is, we all know that there is a supply shortage globally, right, that seems to be pretty clear because of what's happened in Europe. The way I'm interpreting your comments about fourth quarter decision making is, be potential positive impacts of that for our North American operator like you, who has capacity to deploy haven't yet and most likely aren't going to play out in this fiscal year. So, number one, I mean, am I hearing that correctly? And if you can just give us your latest thoughts on the cost outlook on Europe that would be super helpful? Thank you. Rob McNutt : Sure, Akshay. I think, again, we've got a couple of months before this whole situation in Europe plays out and I think we're going to have opportunities to your point, Akshay. It's going to \u2013 potentially those opportunities are going to be more pronounced in our fiscal 2020 because it's going to be old crop, new crop transition, especially if there's customers that our service on the European industry that realize that they're going to have quality, crop, shortage issues that they may not understand right now. So, it's \u2013 it's a situation is going to play out. And I think that we'll have a clearer understanding in the next couple of months on what our opportunities are going to be with that. So, it's kind of \u2013 and to your point, it is going to be a fiscal 2020 opportunity for us because this is going to bleed over through our fiscal 2019 and our 2020. So, again, it's a volatile situation, our team is doing a fantastic job both in Europe and in the U.S. making sure first and foremost that we're supporting our customers and that's the priority. But I'm optimistic that we're going to have some opportunities and we'll see how it all plays out going forward. Akshay Jagdale : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Bryan Spillane : Hi, good morning, everybody, and Happy New Year. Tom Werner : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Just two quick ones for me. One, I might have missed it, but did you give an update on CapEx for the year? And also, I guess with the acquisitions, just how we would think about capital spending sort of go forward, is there any sort of I guess uptick in CapEx related to acquisitions? Rob McNutt : Yes, Bryan, it's Rob. Yes, I did mention that we maintained our $360 million target for the year on CapEx that does exclude the M&A, okay, to make that clear. BSW, the purchase of that interest in the joint venture because that was already consolidated that CapEx is already in that number. And so that doesn't move the needle and the Australian pieces are relatively small operation and so it's not going to be material, and certainly not going to be material this year. And so, we're still maintaining a $360 million. Bryan Spillane : Okay, thanks. And then in the Retail segment, you've had the \u2013 you've been able to take advantage of some of the supply issues that your large competitors had and it seems as though you've got pretty good traction with your own brands. So, can you just kind of talk about going forward is there opportunity still to gain more distribution kind of where do you stand today in terms of maybe where your ACV is and is there opportunity to kind of get yourself into maybe more larger customers going forward? Tom Werner : Yes, Bryan, I think, I'm super optimistic with our Retail business and we've had great traction with Grown in Idaho, no question about it. Our strategy, the 3-tier approach to remind everybody with Alexia the premium brand, we do a lot of private label for a lot of customers and we have our license brands that have a lot of momentum right now and Grown in Idaho has been \u2013 it's well ahead of our expectations at this particular point and we have opportunity with Grown in Idaho to get more distribution with some large customers. So, we've got a lot of traction, we've certainly had the benefit of misstep by one of our competitors, but the team has done a great job supporting our brands, our private label, our license brands in the market. We've got a lot of momentum and I think we've got plans to continue to support that business in the media and drive Grown in Idaho distribution. So, I feel good about where it's at. We certainly have opportunities and we got a lot of momentum. So, I'm excited about what the next year holds for that. Bryan Spillane : Thank you. Rob McNutt : Thanks Bryan. Operator : We will now take our next question from Michael Gallo of CL King. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Gallo : Yes, hi, good morning, and also congratulations on another strong quarter. Tom Werner : Thanks. Michael Gallo : My question is on just the gross margin line, just kind of delving in a little bit, obviously, the commentary that gross margin for the year will grow at a similar to slightly better rate than sale, I think you're up, call it 19% in the first half versus 11% sales growth implies gross margin would be down in the back half. So, I guess, bigger picture, you've been able to increase your gross margins, call it 600 basis points over the last 4 or 5 years. You haven't had a lot of \u2013 you've had a very good spread of pricing versus cost inflation. It would seem like we're coming to environment where you're not going to have as much pricing will have some more inflation. So, do you think kind of looking bigger picture, you can still expand your margins further all things being equal, how volume dependent, does that become and if things slow from a volume standpoint are there any kind of offsets that you can prevent margin degradation from here? Thanks. Rob McNutt : Yes, I think Michael that margin expansion is going to be more modest. We've had a terrific run to your point as you pointed out last 4, 5 years, and one of the things that we continue to do to drive overall profitable growth is invest in our business and expand capacity and we've been pretty consistent over the last 4, 5 years, expanding our operations. Obviously, part of our invest for growth is looking at opportunistic M&A, and that's going to be part of the play book going forward. And we're coming into an environment that's going to be a lot different than it has been in the last 3 or 4 years in terms of overall industry competitiveness. We've got our competitors, it's well known in Europe and North America that capacities coming online, we've got capacity coming on in our business and we're going to maintain discipline in our business and maintain our pricing, maintain our discipline, but the overall margin expansion is not going to be as pronounced as it has been in the last 3 or 4 years to your point. So \u2013 but I feel really confident about \u2013 when you step back and look at the big picture, the category continues to grow, our projections are 1.5% to 2.5%, that's a big \u2013 that's a critical element of driving our overall profitability, but the margin expansion is not going to be as pronounced as it has been in the last 3 or 4 years. There's no doubt about it. Michael Gallo : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : A lot of ground has been covered. I just wanted to go back on the guidance. Make sure, I've got the pieces correct to understand how you've adjusted the outlook. So, you've taken the range of $10 million, that includes $10 million less contribution from the purchase of the JV share. So, the base business outlook is up at least $20 million probably a little higher above that given what would seem to be a weaker outlook in Europe given the cost side there. Just making sure on the domestic side, how \u2013 is it volume domestically has price mix come in stronger, has unit costs in the first half of the year been better than the domestic kind of base business performance has exceeded the expectations to that extent there, just help me with that bridge? Rob McNutt : No, I think your bridge Adam is spot on and in terms of what's driving, it's really across the board. As I mentioned that \u2013 on the commercial side, the teams are doing a great job. We've got some pricing momentum, especially in the Foodservice and then good volume really in our Global in our Retail business has been playing out nicely for us. At the same time, we have gotten some benefit from mix. And then on the supply chain side, the folks running our manufacturing operations have done a very, very good job of continuing to drive and squeeze efficiencies out of the manufacturing facilities. And so, it's really throughout the income statement that we're seeing that benefit in our base business. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the base business as I think about the balance of the year usually this is when you get a better feel for the performance of the 2018 crop through the plants that \u2013 are the yields there and the recovery rates meaningfully different than average or normal that caused the outlook to change at all? Tom Werner : Adam, the crops is right at historical averages, yield is good, recovery is good, storage is good. So, right down the middle of the fairway on the crop for this \u2013 the balance of the rest of the year. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just finally from me going back to late December, you did announce the repurchase program, which is a new feature to your capital allocation. Just there isn't a deadline or an expiration date on the program. Just any thoughts on how we should think about you utilizing that and is it really just come down to \u2013 would you actually add debt to buy back stock, or is it just excess cash flow that can't be deployed with \u2013 through other inorganic opportunities that they're going to repurchase? Rob McNutt : Yes. Adam, that share repurchase program is really opportunistic and as you mentioned, it is open-ended. So, it's really just to give us flexibility to buy back shares on an opportunistic basis. Adam Samuelson : Okay. So, sort of thing I'll have to think that necessarily gets used up in the short term, it's just there if the excess cash comes through and you don't have the M&A? Rob McNutt : Yes, I think that's fair way to read it. Adam Samuelson : Okay. All right, very helpful. I appreciate the color. Operator : We will now take our next question from Carla Casella of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Carla Casella : Hi. Just want a little more clarity on the ERP roll-out, timing of it when you're going to start, I guess turning on the switch and if it's scale, if it's scheduled geography by geography or just more clarity on the timing? Tom Werner : Yes. So, we're on the front-end of the ERP project transformation. It's \u2013 these things always take some time, obviously everybody understands that. So, our projection right now is over the next couple of years, we'll start rolling on that and implementing it in terms of how we're going to do that organizationally, we're still working through that on the front-end of our planning. Carla Casella : Okay. And do you expect to have it done in \u2013 is it in the next fiscal year or is it 18 months? Rob McNutt : No. Carla, I think as Tom mentioned that this will be over a couple of years, because again, it's the global exercise and it's not something that we feel the need to rush or jam in. There is no fuse on this thing, and so we want to do it thoughtfully, deliberately. And so, we'll take our time and do it thoughtfully, so it will take couple of years for us to fully roll it out. Carla Casella : Okay, great. Thank you. Rob McNutt : Thank you. Operator : It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Hi, it's Dexter, thanks again for everybody joining the call. If you like to have a follow-up discussion, please e-mail me first and we'll try to set-up a time to have a discussion. Again, a Happy New Year, and good morning, everyone. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Lamb Weston Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's third quarter earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our performance and some updates on the operating environments in North America and Europe. Rob will then provide the details on our third quarter results and our updated fiscal 2019 outlook.  With that, let me now turn the call over the Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call today. I'm pleased to say that we're continuing to successfully execute on our strategies as we leverage our advantage global platform to serve our chain restaurant, food service and retail customers. We have a good operating momentum in each of our channels and remain committed to investing back in our business to support long-term growth and create value for all our stakeholders. In the third quarter, we delivered solid results despite facing difficult year ago comparisons and a challenging operating environment in Europe. Our top line growth of 7% was driven by solid mix of volume and price mix in our Global and Food Service segments. Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures was also up 7% and through the first nine months of the year, we generated about $445 million of cash flow from operations. Because we delivered another solid quarter and have built good operating momentum, we\u2019ve again raised our fiscal 2019 outlook. We now expect sales to increase high-single digits and EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures to be $895 million to $905 million. Our third quarter results reflect the continued strong execution and focus by our commercial supply chain and functional teams. Our global team continues to work closely with our large chain customers to drive growth across our key markets. This included driving incremental growth from limited time offers both in the U.S. and Asia, winning new business from a fast growing regional quick serve restaurant chain and supporting customers affected by the short crop in Europe. Our food service direct sales team has been improving mix by increasing sales of Lamb Weston branded products. As part of that the team has been working with a number of small and regional chain customers on trials for Crispy on Delivery, a unique fry that we created specifically for restaurant delivery. Customer trial so far had been very successful, with sales volume is greater than expected along with strong consumer response. We're looking to expand these trials and leverage our new direct sales force to broaden our Crispy on Delivery footprint. In fact, we're gaining traction on expanding our Crispy on Delivery customer base beyond traditional burger and chicken QSRs to include movie theaters and lodging for room service. Our retail team continued to build momentum with a strong increase in shipments of branded retail products, including Grown in Idaho. It continues to gain distribution, and we're increasing support with the national advertising campaign and targeted digital marketing efforts. In supply chain, our teams overcame extreme weather challenges in the Pacific Northwest, as well as disruption to some key inputs. The teams delivered strong performances in our manufacturing plants, and implemented transportation workarounds to minimize supply interruptions to customers, all while continuing to drive costs and productivity savings. In addition, the team has our new 300 million pound production line in Hermiston, Oregon on track to be operational this May. Our functional teams also continued to execute well. Our investments to upgrade our IT, sales, marketing and operating capabilities also remain on schedule, as does the integration of Marvel Packers the Australian potato processor we acquired in December. Now turning to our operating environment, in North America, we expect the environment to remain generally favorable through the rest of fiscal 2019 as demand growth continues to be solid. In addition, as Rob will discuss later, despite higher potato costs, we expect inflation will remain modest as a result of lower than anticipated production and logistics costs. In Europe, the effect of the historically poor potato crop on the operating environment is playing out largely as we expected. The short crop has resulted in sharply higher potato costs for our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture and for the industry and that will persist through fiscal 2019 and in the first half of physical 2020. While the effect of these higher potato costs was pronounced in lamb Weston/Meijer's third quarter results, they were in line with our expectations. We continue to anticipate that higher prices and cost savings initiatives should steadily began to offset the effect of higher potato costs over the next couple of quarters. In addition, our teams in Europe and the U.S. will continue to work closely to leverage our global capabilities to serve existing customers affected by the short crop, as well as evaluating support potential opportunities as they arise over the coming months. So as you can see, we delivered another quarter of solid results by focusing on our strategies, executing well across the organization and working through some near-term challenges. We feel good about our performance and the operating momentum we built and it has enabled us to once again raise our financial targets. Now let me turn the call over to Rob, to provide the details on our results and our updated outlook. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we're pleased with our results for the quarter, as solid results in our base business more than offset softness in Europe, specifically in the quarter, net sales increased 7% to $927 million, driven by a good balance of favorable volume and price mix. Volume increased 4%, led by growth in our Global segment price mix was up 3% due to both pricing actions and improved mix. Some of our growth reflects the impact of a new accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of this fiscal year. Specifically, the new standard effects when we recognize sales of customized products, which we define as products that we manufacture using a customer's unique recipe, such as a McDonald's French fry, or a limited time offering product that's made for a single customer. Under the new standard, we recognized revenue for customized products at the time we have a legally enforceable right to payment, which is once we've manufactured the product and have received a customer purchase order. Since sales of customized products are generally recurring, there hasn't been much of an impact on a quarter-to-quarter basis. However, in the third quarter, we received a higher number of purchase orders for customized products. In short, the effect of the new standard is all timing, which may create incremental quarter-to-quarter volatility. Gross profit increased $31 million or 13% to $273 million. Overall higher prices, favorable mix from increased LTO activity, volume growth and supply chain efficiency savings drove the increase, more than offsetting the impact of relatively modest material input, manufacturing and transportation costs inflation. The increase in gross profit also reflects a $4 million gain in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments related to hedging contracts. This compares to a $1.3 million loss in the prior year period. Our gross margin percentage expanded 140 basis points to more than 29%, excluding the mark-to-market adjustments, gross margin expanded by 90 basis points. As you may recall, when we updated guidance after the second quarter, we indicated that there could be some pressure on gross margin percentage in the back half of this fiscal year, due in part to accelerating cost inflation coupled with more modest pricing. However, despite low to mid-single digit increase in raw potato cost, overall cost inflation was lower than we had anticipated in the third quarter. This was a result of very strong execution by our supply chain teams, coupled with prices of some key inputs breaking our way. Specifically we capitalized on contract structures for edible oils that allowed us to enjoy the benefits of falling prices during the quarter, while limiting exposure to price increases. As oil prices dropped during the quarter, we realize the benefit, including the unrealized mark-to-market impact contracts that will settle in future period. We mitigated transportation costs inflation in part by implementing new software tools that helped us more efficiently optimize the mix between rail and trucking. And we continue to leverage our Lamb Weston operating culture to drive efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities. As a result of these supply chain initiatives, we expect cost inflation will remain relatively modest in the fourth quarter. SG&A expense excluding items impacting compatibility increased about $8 million to $80 million. The increase in SG&A was due to investments in our sales, marketing, operating and information technology capabilities to support growth and drive operating efficiencies.  In addition, advertising and promotional expense was up about $1 million. IT cost continued to build in the third quarter, and we expect them to rise further in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2020 as we build and implement a new ERP system. Adjusted operating income increased $23 million or 13% to $194 million. As I've just outlined, this was driven by strong sales and gross profit growth. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe and Lamb Weston/RDO in Minnesota were $14 million. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments related to hedging contracts, equity earnings were down about $9 million, largely due to higher raw potato costs and lower sales volumes in Europe associated with the poor crop. So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA including the proportional EBITDA from our two unconsolidated joint ventures increased $16 million or 7% to $253 million. Simply put, about $26 million of our EBITDA growth was driven by operating gains in our base business, plus another $4 million from the acquisition of the remaining interest in our Lamb Weston/BSW joint venture. This was partially offset by a $14 million decline in EBITDA from unconsolidated joint ventures. Moving down the income statement, interest expense was about $27 million, which is a decline of more than $1 million due to lower average total debt. Our effective tax rate excluding the impact of comparability items was about 22%, up from about 19% last year. As you may recall, our relatively low tax rate in Q3 last year was related to the timing of implementing U.S. Tax Reform. Turning to earnings per share, adjusted diluted EPS was up $0.04 to $0.95. The increase was driven by operating gains in our base business, which included a $0.02 benefit related to additional sales of customized products under the new revenue standard, partially offset by lower equity earnings and higher taxes. Now let's review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes top 100 U.S. based chains, as well as all sales outside of North America were up 11%. Price mix rose 2%, primarily reflecting pricing adjustments associated with multi-year contracts. Volume grew 9% with about 4 points related to the additional sales customized products under the new revenue standard. As Tom mentioned, we delivered the remaining 5 points of volume growth by driving increased sales of limited time product offerings in both Asia and the U.S. Sales to new chain restaurant customers and increased sales to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets, including to customers affected by the short crop in Europe. We're very pleased with Global\u2019s high quality volume growth in the quarter, especially as we lapped the 6% volume growth that we delivered in the prior year. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit, less advertising and promotional expense increased $15 million or 13%. Its contribution margin percentage expanded by 50 basis points. Favorable price mix, volume growth, including the benefit of additional sales of customized products under the new revenue standard, as well as supply chain efficiency savings drove the increase, which was partially offset by modest cost inflation. Sales for our Food Service segment with services North American food distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers increased 5%. Price mix increased 4%, reflecting the benefit of pricing actions initiated in fall 2018, as well as improved mix. Volume increased 1% led by growth of Lamb Weston branded products. Food Services product contribution margin increased $5 million or 6% and contribution margin percentage expanded by 40 basis points. The increases were driven by favorable price mix and supply chain efficiency savings and were partially offset by modest cost inflation. Sales in our Retail segment fell 1%, price mix increased 1% largely due to improved mix. As expected, volume declined 2% as we lapped the 22% volume growth that we delivered in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As you may recall, Q3 last year benefited from the timing of private label product shipments from the second quarter, as well as distribution gains of Grown in Idaho and other branded products. In the current quarter, we continue to improve mix by driving mid-teens growth in our branded products led by Grown in Idaho. Retail\u2019s product contribution margin declined $1 million or 4% as input manufacturing, transportation cost inflation along with lower volumes and modestly higher advertising and promotional expense more than offset favorable price mix. As a result, product contribution margin percentage fell 70 basis points. Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow, our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.5 billion. This puts our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3 times. We continue to target a leverage ratio of 3.5 to 4 times and remained comfortable being below that range as we continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities. With respect to cash flow, in the first nine months of the year, we generated about $445 million of cash from operations, which was driven by the strong earnings growth. That's up from $310 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Our priorities in deploying net cash remain the same. Our top priority is to continue to invest in our business and we spent about $245 million so far this year on capital expenditures, including the construction of our new fry line in Hermiston, Oregon. As Tom mentioned, the Hermiston line is on track to be operational in May. Another top priority is acquisitions. This year, we've expanded our global footprint with the acquisition of Marvel Packers for about $89 million and completed the purchase of the remaining interest in Lamb Weston/BSW for $78 million. Finally, we're returning cash to shareholders, including paying $84 million in dividends in the first nine months, and repurchasing nearly 110,000 shares for about $8 million. Turning to our updated fiscal 2019 outlook, we're confident in our ability to continue our good operating momentum as we close out the year. As a result, we've raised our sales and earnings outlook for fiscal 2019. After posting strong results in the third quarter, we now expect sales to grow at high-single digit rate from our previous estimate of mid to high single digits. This implies mid to high single digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. For earnings, we've raised our target for adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures to a range of $895 million to $905 million, up from a range of $870 million to $880 million versus last year, that's an increase of about $80 million, or nearly 10% at the midpoint of the new range. Sales and gross profit growth are driving the increase. For the full year, we're still targeting gross profit growing at least in line with sales, with favorable price mix and productivity more than offsetting higher transportation, input and manufacturing costs inflation as well as higher depreciation expense. Previously, we anticipated that gross profit growth may lag sales growth in the second half of the year due to increased inflation and the potential for unfavorable mix. However, as I described earlier, the impact of input and transportation inflation has been lighter than expected, and our manufacturing facilities have been performing well. This along with solid top line growth enabled us to grow to drive strong gross margin expansion in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect inflation to remain relatively modest in our manufacturing facilities to continue to deliver operating efficiencies. As a result, we expect gross profit growth will likely be at least in line with sales growth, even after absorbing around $3 million of startup costs associated with our Hermiston production line. Regarding SG&A, in the fourth quarter we anticipate investments in our sales, marketing, innovation, operations and IT capabilities will continue to build, especially as we begin to step up spending behind our ERP system. As we've previously noted, we expect spending behind these investments will continue to be elevated for a couple of years. We continue to target total SG&A excluding advertising and promotional expense to return to a range of 8% to 8.5% of sales over the long-term. Our equity earnings, as Tom mentioned, the effect of the short crop in Europe is playing out largely as we had anticipated. In the fourth quarter, we expect equity earnings will decline versus the prior year, largely due to higher potato costs and lower sales volumes. So looking at our updated outlook at a high level, we're targeting high-single digit sales growth for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect to drive mid to high single digit sales growth, with a good overall balance of volume growth and improved price mix. For earnings, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of $895 million to $905 million for the year. In fourth quarter, sales and gross profit growth in our base business will drive the increase and will be tempered by higher investments in SG&A and softer results in Europe. We also expect to have about a $4 million benefit from the acquisition of the other half of our BSW joint venture. We also made changes to a couple of our other financial targets. For taxes, we now expect an effective tax rate for the full year of 22% to 23% that's down from our previous estimate of 23%. For the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate that it will be about 24%. For capital expenditures, we're now targeting it to be around $350 million, down slightly from our previous estimate of about $360 million. Our other financial targets for the full year remain the same, including total interest expense of around $110 million, total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $150 million. Let me turn the call back over to Tom, for closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Rob. Let me quickly sum up by saying we're pleased with our results in the quarter and are confident that we'll finish the year on a strong note. We're executing well across the organization and have built good operating momentum in each of our core segments. We remain laser focused on executing on our strategies of investing to support long-term growth and create value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston. And we're now happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Just two questions for me, I guess, first, as we're kind of looking at the situation in Europe and thinking about it, I guess for 2020, can you elaborate a little bit more on just how you see sort of the potential kind of crop conditions or plantings, are there enough seed potatoes, is there anything else that might sort of drag this supply issue into 2020. And then also, if you could talk a little bit about the opportunity to fill some of the supply gaps in Europe out of North America, how that's progressed? Tom Werner : Bryan, it\u2019s Tom. So in terms of seed, potato seed and crop and planting, all those kinds of things it's no concern about seed, I would say, we're early in the planting. So, we feel good about our growers and how that's progressing. And as I do every year, further down the year we'll give an update on how the crops progressing not only in Europe, but across North America. I think the -- your other question in terms of how this is going to play out, it's going to pressure the business as we've stated. Obviously, you've seen the result in Q3, we expected -- they're in line with our expectations. It's going to continue in Q4 through the first half, but will progressively improve based on cost initiatives and pricing that all started flowing through the P&L. But it's definitely going to be impactful through the first half of 2020, as we've stated. And the last part of your question, we've got ourselves positioned with our book of business between Europe and U.S. supporting some of the European customers out of our U.S. operations. And right now, I stated, I think, there's going to be some opportunities. And it's still early and it still has to play out. I believe we may get some opportunities, but right now, we've had nothing material that\u2019s been brought to our attention. Bryan Spillane : Okay, thanks for that. And then just as a follow up, one of the questions we've got a lot in the last few weeks has been just concern with the capacity coming into North America that is, maybe got to put some pressure on prices and potentially margin. So, I guess, as you've kind of looking at the landscape as it sits right now, is that something that that you're concerned about at this point or has anything really changed in terms of the environment? Tom Werner : As of right now, there has been some capacity come on. It has not materially impacted our business, we are obviously monitoring it. We've got capacity coming on in May. And a part of this to, again, it's going to normalize run rates back to a more sustainable level. And I suspect this fall, we may have pressure in pockets, but we're going to continue to execute pricing discipline in the market and let things play out. But I think it'll be immaterially impactful in the near-term. Bryan Spillane : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Just had a question for you, I want to better understand the limited time offering performance in the quarter. And the mix effect, it sounds like that was positive year-over-year against exceptionally tough comparisons. So I want to just understand kind of how that played out and what that meant to mix, maybe I guess to a degree to margins. And then can that continue in the fourth quarter? Are you seeing a continuation of the strong LTO performance you think continuing into Q4? Tom Werner : We had several -- Chris, this is Tom, we had several LTOs that were planned in the quarter. And as we always do, we take a conservative view of how those are going to perform. Had a couple domestically and international LTO that exceeded our expectations. We will get into how things are shaping up in the next quarter. But, again, the LTOs performed better than we expected. And every year we're going to have LTOs in our business periodically. So -- and we always take a conservative view. Chris Growe : Okay. And then just a question for you on the gross margin somewhat following on that that question, I guess, the gross margin was much stronger than I expected in the quarter. You had a favorable mix performance as well. You indicated that you expect it to be about or at least in line with sales for the year -- I'm sorry, sales growth for the year. But given the performance to date, is there anything unique to the fourth quarter we should be aware of or anything that could be pressuring the gross margin in the fourth quarter that could keep the expectation for the year down a bit? Rob McNutt : Chris, it's Rob. Typically, as you know, that fourth quarter the raw costs tend to be higher than in the third quarter, third quarter tends to be most attractive just because of storage cost and the aging of the raws. But beyond that normal seasonality, we don't see anything in the fourth quarter that\u2019s going to pressure margins. Chris Growe : Okay, thank you for the time. Dexter Congbalay : Hey, Chris. I mean, we said we're going to have about $3 million of startup costs related to Hermiston in our prepared remarks. So something else just to remember. Chris Growe : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, Dexter. Operator : We'll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : I was hoping to go back Tom to something you said in response to Bryan's question on the impact to capacity. And kind of the word - your word was pockets of pressure. And just maybe elaborate on where and how that would really manifest itself based on kind of your historical experience in the industry, when you've had bigger incremental capacity come on, just category customer type is it something that you would actually see with your bigger global customers, especially as we look to calendar 2020, when you've a bigger part of that business up for renewal. Tom Werner : Sure, Adam, the -- couple of things to your question is, as the category is -- we expect the category to have a 1.5% to 2.5% growth. So there's always going to be an organic component that's going to need capacity support that\u2019s the first thing. The second thing that we\u2019ll have to monitor closely is some of the contracts that are coming up for renewal with a few bigger customers and that's where we may see some pressure on pricing. But we'll deal with that as those contracts come up for bid. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just on the performance kind of in the quarter and just try and think about the implications. I mean, do you think that has your view of market growth changed in a material way, I mean, I think we've kind of always been operating under the assumption, this is a kind of 2%, 2.5% growth business for the North American industry. Do you think that the market has been kind of meaningfully outperforming that? And if so, is that just new use occasions in different channels. Just elaborate on that the Crispy on Delivery, just being more incremental to demand than you might have thought potentially? Tom Werner : Yes, right now, I don't have a different point of view on the overall category growth based on all the data and how we analyze not only North America, but international markets in total. So I would say, the 1.5% to 2.5%, we feel pretty good about. Over the long-term that's where it's going to shake out at and some of the incremental Crispy on Delivery for example, that's really -- I don't view it as a new occasion, but that's meeting an occasion with a better quality fry that travels better, and that's how I view that product. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just lastly, just quickly it seems like the potato crop in the Pacific Northwest, the planting might have gotten started a little bit later than the normal. Is that something that would materially impact you as you move into kind of the August through October timeframe or not enough deviation from history to matter? Tom Werner : No, Adam, it's -- right now the plant crop is two weeks late planning in the Pacific Northwest. We had a point of view that 30, 45 days ago and took actions to ensure that we were balanced on our raw. And again, it's early planning. I've been around this business a long time to know that at times we always tend to catch up, but we got to let it play out and we\u2019ll provide more context on crop in a couple of calls as we always do. Adam Samuelson : Okay, really appreciate the color. I'll pass it. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go next to David Mandel with Consumer Edge Research. David Mandel : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. First, how would you rate the state of your plans given the high utilization rates? Will they get the necessary rest with the oncoming capacity or does the Europe shortage precludes that how should we think about that? Rob McNutt : Yes, this is Rob, Dave. The -- as you recall, we started up a new line in Richland here in last a year or so, and that\u2019s allowed us to take capacity to more normalized levels in our plans. And so we are able to get caught up on the maintenance that we may have differed over the prior few years. And then, we'll have the new line coming on in Hermiston, which will give us further capacity to help support the continued growth in the business. David Mandel : That's great, thanks. And my last question, we've covered a lot of ground so I just want to ask a high level question. The faster growing markets, I assume that they're not all created equally, you have China, Mexico, Middle East, Russia. I assume some processing plants might be turnkey and some might be fixed or uppers. How can I think about that in terms of those four markets? Tom Werner : Well, I think that's exactly right that the growth rates aren\u2019t all created equal. And you also have to think through the overall market size. So some of those markets give you directional 500 million pounds, 600 million pounds, some of them a 1billion pound, which is very different than North America and Europe. So they're not all created equal. In terms of your second question, capacity is not all created equal as well. So as you look at capacity in China those plants have different capabilities versus our plant, not only in China, but in North America. So you are right they are now created equal. David Mandel : Great, thank you very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Carla Casella with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Sarah on for Carla. We just wanted an update on your capital allocation parity in regards to shareholder activities versus delevering? And then also maybe an update on your M&A? Tom Werner : Okay. Sarah, it's Tom. Very consistent on our capital allocation, we're going to continue to invest in our business as we have in the past and this year will in the future to drive growth. We're going to support a dividend. We've implemented a share repurchase, which we've been active in the market recently. So we're committed to -- as we've been very consistent since the spin that's our capital allocation strategy. In terms of M&A that's part of the strategy as well. I can't get into specifics about where we're at and what we actually have going on. But we are committed to pursue M&A, targeted M&A where it makes sense for us. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : And there are no further questions in queue. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks everyone for joining the call. I'll be available for any follow-up questions, either via phone or via e-mail. And look forward to speak with you later. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with, our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our performance for the year as well as some comments on the operating environment we expect to see in fiscal 2020. Rob will then provide the details on our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our fiscal 2020 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. In fiscal 2019, we delivered another year of record financial results and significantly exceeded the financial targets that we initially outlined a year ago. We delivered these results with the strong performance in our base business, which more than offset crop-related challenges facing our European joint venture. For the year, sales were up nearly 10% with a good balance of higher volume and price mix. Adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures was also up 10%, driven by strong gross profit growth. Adjusted earnings per share increased more than 20%, driven by operating gains in the benefit of tax reform. And finally, we generated more than 40% increase in cash flow from operations and invested much of that cash back into the business, while also returning $145 million of cash to shareholders. This performance reflects our commercial, supply chain and support team's successful execution against our 3 strategies of accelerating category in customer growth, differentiating our global supply chain to drive growth and investing for growth.  Now let me take you through some highlights for each of these. To accelerate category and customer growth, our global innovation and supply chain teams work closely to develop, produce and sell a higher amount of limited time offering products in the U.S. and key markets in Asia. These LTOs enable customers to expand their menus with exciting new products and increase traffic into their stores. For the year, about a quarter of our Global segment volume growth was driven by increased LTO penetration.  In addition, we continued to partner with U.S. and non-U.S. restaurant chains as they look to expand operations internationally. In our Foodservice segment, we successfully replaced our broker relationships with the direct sales force solely focused on selling frozen potato products to small and regional chain customers as well as single restaurants. Over the course of the year, the new team was able to drive overall volume growth, including for Lamb Weston branded products. Over the long term, we expect our direct sales force will lead to deeper customer relationships and broader customer coverage leading to faster growth and optimized product mix.  In retail, we helped drive overall category growth with distribution gains of our Grown In Idaho, Alexia, and licensed brand products. For the year, nearly all of our 7% volume growth in retail was from our branded products. Our investment in part has encouraged retailers to expand freezer shelf space allocated to the frozen potato category. Regarding our strategy to differentiate our global supply chain to drive growth, we continue to leverage our Lamb Weston operating culture to generate cost savings and efficiencies as well as distressed production capacity to improve profitability and support customers growth. We've also completed much of the upfront work to replace our obsolete enterprise resource planning system. Once the new system is implemented over the next couple of years, we expect it to drive productivity and reduce costs by streamlining supply chain, commercial and back-office processes, while also improving our demand in operations planning across our global manufacturing footprint.  And finally, we leveraged the geographic diversity of our global supply chain platform this year by having our North America plant serve Lamb-Weston/Meijer and its customers as they manage through the effect of a poor crop in Europe. We also leveraged our operations in Canada to manage through a shifting trade and tariff environment. For our third strategy leg, investor growth, we acquired some businesses and built new capacity. We completed the purchase of our joint ventures partner interest in Lamb Weston BSW allowing us to realize the full financial benefit of the JV's production facility. We also acquired Marvel Packers, a 50 million-pound potato processor focused on serving the fish and chip market in Australia.  And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Ready Meals, a 70 million-pound potato processor that also services the Australian fish and chip market. Together these 2 acquisitions provide us with an opportunity to strengthen our position in Australia. We'll continue to seek other acquisition opportunities to strengthen and broaden our manufacturing footprint outside North America.  And finally, we completed a 300-million-pound expansion of our Hermiston, Oregon facility in May. This investment will enable us to continue to support customers growth in both North America and key export markets as well as provide more flexibility to leverage our innovation capabilities to partner with our customers to develop innovative and traffic-driving limited-time offerings. We're very pleased with the progress we've made on these initiatives and we'll continue to focus on executing these strategies to drive sustainable growth over the long term.  In addition to delivering strong business performance, we're proud of the work we're doing to support our local communities. We continue to focus on combating food insecurity by supporting regional food banks and other hands-on efforts through local outreach programs and employee volunteer activities. Through the Lamb Weston Foundation, we've also provided financial assistance to organizations combating food insecurity and other worthy causes. And we have contributed another $5 million to the foundation to continue to add support over the coming years.  Now turning to our operating environment. For fiscal 2020, we believe the overall operating environment will continue to be generally favorable assuming no significant economic shocks or material changes to trade policies. In the U.S., we expect restaurant traffic will continue to grow supported by low unemployment, rising disposable income and additional promotional activity by quick-service restaurants, including more limited time product offerings. This increased traffic typically translates into solid demand growth for our products. We also see continued solid demand growth in Europe and our other key developed markets like Australia, Japan and South Korea, largely fueled by many of the same factors driving U.S. demand.  In our key emerging markets, such as China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, we anticipate continued strong demand growth as customers build additional restaurant outlets and as traffic continues to increase as consumers look towards Western-style dining options. With respect to supply, recently added industry capacity in North America as well as capacity is scheduled to become operational within fiscal 2020 should allow processes to operate their factories closer to normalize rates. However, due to continued demand growth, we expect industry utilization will remain relatively high. As a result, we expect that we'll continue to be able to increase prices overall to offset modest input cost inflation.  And while we've only finalized a handful of global and regional restaurant chain customer contracts over the past few months, we are encouraged by how the pricing discussions have been progressing. We'll have a clear view of how the overall pricing situation will shake out as we continue contract negotiations over the next few months. Of those chained restaurant customer contracts that were renewed over the past couple of years, especially for customers in our Global segment, most were renewed on a multi-year basis. As we enter into the second and third year of those agreements, we'll continue to realize the price increases embedded in those contracts.  With respect to costs, we expect the environment in North America to be manageable. Per pound contracted prices for raw potatoes, which account for about a third of our cost of goods sold, are set to increase in single digits. Taken together, we anticipate that inflation rates for our other key inputs and supply chain costs, such as oils, packaging, transportation and warehousing will also be in that range. In Europe, due to a poor crop last year, raw potato prices were high and supplies were limited. Assuming an average crop this year, we anticipate that operating levels will normalize, which may lead to increased competitive intensity in Europe and in the region's key export markets. Nonetheless,, lower raw potato costs resulting from an average European crops should provide an opportunity for Lamb-Weston/Meijer to improve profitability, especially as these lower-cost potatoes become available in the second half of our fiscal year.  So in summary, we expect to continue to build upon a strong financial results that we delivered in fiscal 2019, and the good momentum in each of our channels by continuing to focus on serving our customers and executing against our strategic initiatives. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver solid results again in fiscal 2020 and remain committed to investing back in our business to support sustainable top- and bottom-line growth and create value for all our stakeholders over the long term. Now let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our results and our fiscal 2020 outlook. Rob? Robert McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we're pleased with our strong sales and EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Specifically in the quarter, net sales increased 9% to just over $1 billion driven by a good balance of favorable price mix and volume. Price mix was up 3% due to pricing actions in our Global and Foodservice segments as well as favorable mix.  Volume increased 6% led by growth in our Global segment. Marvel Packers, our acquisition in Australia that we closed in the middle of our fiscal year, added about 0.5 point of volume growth. For the year, sales grew 10% to $3.8 billion with volume up 5% and price mix also up 5 points. Gross profit increased $18 million or 8% to $251 million in the quarter. Higher prices, favorable mix, volume growth and supply chain efficiency savings drove the increase, more than offsetting the impact of input manufacturing, transportation, cost inflation. The increase in gross profit was tempered by a $7.5 million loss in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments related to commodity hedging contracts this quarter. This compares to a $1 million loss in the prior-year period. Gross profit also included approximately $3 million of cost related to the start-up of our french fry line in Hermiston, Oregon. All in, our gross margin percentage in the quarter was down 40 basis points to 25%. However, excluding the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and the Hermiston start-up cost, gross margin expanded by 50 basis points.  For the year, gross profit grew 14% and gross margin expanded 100 basis points to 26.7%. The improvements were largely driven by favorable price mix, volume growth and supply chain productivity more than offsetting cost inflation and higher depreciation expense, primarily associated with our french fry production line in Richland that became operational in mid fiscal 2018.  SG&A expense excluding items impacting comparability increased about $4 million to $103 million in the quarter. The increase in SG&A was due to investments in our sales, marketing, operating and information technology capabilities to support growth and drive operating efficiencies. Advertising and promotional expense was down about $4 million due to the timing of spending last year behind Grown In Idaho. For the year, A&P spending was up less than $1 million to $32 million.  In addition, as Tom noted, we contributed an additional $5 million to our charitable foundation, which focuses on combating food insecurity. We made a similar contribution in the fourth quarter last year when we initially set up the foundation. Adjusted operating income increased $14 million or 10% to $148 million in the quarter behind strong sales and gross profit growth. For the year, adjusted operating income was up 14% to $668 million. Similar to the fourth quarter, the increase was due to higher sales and gross profit, partially offset by higher SG&A.  Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb-Weston/Meijer in Europe and Lamb-Weston/RDO in Minnesota were $15 million in the quarter. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments related to commodity hedging contracts, equity earnings were down about $12 million, largely due to higher raw potato costs and lower sales volumes in Europe associated with poor crop. For the year, equity earnings were $60 million. Excluding the mark-to-market impact, equity earnings declined about $22 million due to the crop issues in Europe.  So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA including the proportional EBITDA from our two unconsolidated joint ventures increased $13 million or 6% to $215 million for the quarter. Operating gains by our base business along with contributions from acquisitions drove about $23 million of EBITDA growth. Even though we absorbed higher mark-to-market losses and Hermiston startup costs, this was partially offset by a $10 million decline in EBITDA from our unconsolidated joint ventures.  For the year, EBITDA increased $84 million or about 10% to $904 million. That's at the high-end of the guidance range that we provided at the end of the third quarter despite the mark-to-market losses and $5 million contribution to our charitable foundation in the fourth quarter.  Moving down the income statement, interest expense was about $27 million, which is similar to prior year. Our effective tax rate excluding the impact of comparability items was about 20% and includes the benefit of discrete items. For the year, our rate was about 22%.  Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted diluted EPS was up $0.09 or 14% to $0.74 in the quarter. Operating gains in our base business and a $0.02 benefit from a lower tax rate and approximately $0.02 benefit from the BSW acquisition drove the increase, partially offset by lower equity earnings.  For the year, adjusted diluted EPS was up $0.56 or 21% to $3.22. The increase was driven by higher income from operations, a $0.17 benefit from a lower tax rate to U.S. tax reform and a $0.05 benefit from the BSW acquisition. These gains were partially offset by lower equity earnings.  Now let's review the results for each of the business segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes top 100 U.S.-based chains as well as all other sales outside of North America, were up 13% in the quarter. Price mix rose 3%, primarily reflecting pricing adjustments associated with multi-year contracts. Volume grew 10%. The strong increase was driven by growth in sales to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets, including to customers affected by the challenging crop in Europe as well as increased sales of limited time offering products.  In addition, the Marvel Packers acquisition contributed about 1 point of volume growth. For the year, Global sales grew 12% with volume up 7 points and price mix up 5. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense, increased $11 million or 11%. For the year, it's up $71 million or 19%. Favorable price mix, volume growth and supply chain efficiency savings drove the increases, which were partially offset by cost inflation.  While Global's price makes and volume growth more than offset higher costs on a dollar basis in the quarter, the segment's contribution margin percentage declined 40 basis points. Increased international sales, which generally carry lower margins than the segment's average accounted for some of the margin decline. For the year, Global's product contribution margin percentage was up 120 points. Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American Foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, increased 7% in the quarter. Price mix increased 6%, reflecting the benefit of pricing actions initiated in the fall of 2018 as well as improved mix. Volume increased 1%, led by growth of Lamb Weston branded products. For the year, sales increased 5% with mix up 5 and volume flat.  Foodservice's product contribution margin increased $15 million or 16% in the quarter, while contribution margin percentage expanded 260 basis points. For the year, the segment's contribution was up $37 million or 10% and margin percentage expanded 150 basis points. The increases were driven by favorable price mix and supply chain efficiency savings and were partially offset by cost inflation.  Sales in our Retail segment increased 3% in the quarter driven by 4 points of volume growth behind increased sales of Grown In Idaho and other branded products as well as private label. Price mix fell 1% largely due to increased trade support behind our branded portfolio. For the year, sales were up 11% with volume up 7 points and price mix up 4. Retail's product contribution margin declined modestly in the quarter as lower advertising and promotional expense offset increased trade support. Retail's contribution margin percentage fell 70 basis points. For the year, Retail's contribution margin increased $11 million or 13%, while margin percentage expanded by 40 basis points.  Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.3 billion. This puts our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 2.8x. We continue to target leverage ratio of 3.5 to 4x over the long term. We remained comfortable being below that range as we continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities.  With respect to cash flow for the year, we generated about $680 million of cash from operations, that's up from about $480 million or about 42% versus last year driven by strong earnings growth and lower cash taxes as a result of U.S. tax reform. Our top priorities in deploying that cash continue to be investing to grow the business organically and through acquisitions. In fiscal 2019, we spent about $335 million on capital expenditures, including the construction of our new french fry line in Hermiston, Oregon. We also completed the purchase of the remaining interest in Lamb Weston BSW for about $80 million and expanded our global footprint with the acquisition of Marvel Packers in Australia for about $90 million.  Finally, we returned $145 million in cash to shareholders. We paid about $113 million in dividends and in the 5 months in which we had a share buyback program, we repurchased nearly 460,000 shares for about $32 million. At the end of fiscal 2019, we had about $220 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization.  Turning to our fiscal 2020 outlook. As Tom noted, we anticipate the overall operating environment to remain generally favorable with continued solid demand growth in our markets. New industry capacity should allow processors to operate their factories at more normalized rates, easing the strain on those assets while also providing more flexibility to support customers growth. Consistent with our overall guidance philosophy, we're taking a prudent approach to our fiscal 2020 outlook. Specifically, we're targeting sales to grow at mid-single digit rate, including the benefit of the 53rd week, which will benefit the fourth quarter. We expect volume to be the primary driver of sales growth. The incremental capacity from -- available from our 300-million-pound Hermiston, Oregon production line, which became operational at the end of 2019 will help support that growth.  In the near term, you shouldn't consider all 300 million pounds to be incremental. As when we commissioned the line of Richland 2 years ago, we'll take some time to ramp up the facility. We'll also shift production to Hermiston from other lines, which will take down for some deferred maintenance as well as retooling to meet evolving market needs. In addition to volume growth, we expect the prices will increase modestly and enable us to offset input cost inflation. We've taken a prudent approach when incorporating expected results of pricing discussions in our outlook.  Most of our chain restaurant contracts in our Global segment are multi-year agreements. And we're in the process of negotiating renewals for about a quarter of our Global segment volume this year. While we've been encouraged by how the discussions have proceeded so far, there is always competition for these contracts. We remain disciplined and taken approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships. As Tom noted earlier, for those multi-year chain restaurant contracts that were renewed over the past couple of years, we'll continue to realize the price increases embedded in those contracts. We're targeting adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, to be in the range of $950 million to $970 million, including the benefit of the 53rd week. We expect gross profit growth will drive a significant portion of the EBITDA growth -- increase and that volume gains will largely drive gross profit growth. As I just noted, favorable price mix and productivity savings should offset higher input, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing inflation as well as an increase in depreciation expense associated with the new Hermiston production line. The rise in our production costs reflect an increase in the weighted average contracted raw potato price in the low to mid-single-digit range on a per pound basis. Contracted prices, as you may recall, are only one element of understanding our total potato cost. Potato yield, quality and how they hold up in storage are all key to determining how the potatoes perform in our production facilities and/or actual costs. As typical, when we provide our initial outlook, our financial targets assume an average potato crop. At this point, we don't see anything negative for the North American crop in our growing areas.  We'll have more insight into the yield and quality of the potato crop as the harvest takes place later in the year. Through a combination of volume growth, favorable price mix and supply chain savings, we expect a largely sustained gross margin percentages. We're projecting that the increase in gross profit will be partially offset by higher SG&A, reflecting inflation and incremental investments in sales, innovation and other support capabilities as well as investments to implement a new ERP system. We expect our base SG&A, which excludes advertising and promotional expense as well as ERP investments will continue to be within our target of 8% to 8.5% of sales. While we're targeting A&P expense to remain in line with what we've spent in fiscal 2019, our total ERP spending will depend among other factors, on the pace of the implementation. At this point, we're estimating ERP expenditure between $10 million and $20 million for the year. As we previously noted, we expect our total SG&A spending to be elevated until we create the ERP implementation over the next couple of years, after which, we'll begin to reduce our total SG&A expense excluding A&P expense.  In addition to our expected operating gains, our outlook includes an approximately $10 million earnings benefit from acquiring the 50% of our consolidated joint venture Lamb Weston BSW. This benefit will be realized in the first half of fiscal 2020. For equity earnings, we're assuming an average crop in Europe, which should drive an increase versus fiscal 2019 results as potato costs decline and sales volumes improve. However, our European JV's results through the first half of fiscal 2020 will continue to be challenged as it works through the last of the old crop. With respect to the new crop, while European processing potato futures increased in response to the recent heatwave, moderating temperatures and recent rains have helped the crop. However, it's still too early to determine how the crop there will perform overall.  In addition to our operating targets, we anticipate total interest expense of around $110 million, which is about the same as in fiscal 2019. We're targeting an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%, which is in line with our long-term target. We expect capital expenditures of about $275 million, which includes capital in support of the ERP replacement as well as some relatively large maintenance and facility upgrade projects.  And finally, we expect total depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately $175 million, up from nearly $160 million this past year, primarily reflecting depreciation expense associated with the new Hermiston production line. So looking at our fiscal 2020 outlook at a high level, we're targeting mid-single-digit sales growth, largely driven by volume growth and modestly higher price mix. For earnings, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of about $950 million to $970 million, largely driven by sales and gross profit growth. Before turning the call back over to Tom, there's one more item to address. As we stated in this morning's press release, we plan to report in our Form 10-K, a material weakness related to a deficiency in an information technology general control. We do not expect these matters will result in any changes to our financial statements. We began remediation efforts and expect that the remediation of the material weakness will be completed as soon as practicable during fiscal 2020.  Now here's Tom for some closing comments. Thomas Werner : Thanks, Rob. Let me quickly sum up by saying, again, in fiscal 2019, we finished strong and delivered another record year of sales and earnings. We built great operating momentum and are well positioned to deliver solid results in fiscal 2020. And we remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives to support long-term growth and create value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston and we're now happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Two questions from me, if I could. I guess, first would be, assuming that the Lamb Weston gets a healthy benefit year-over-year from the equity method earnings, has the benefit from the extra week as well as the BSW and then some contribution from the recent acquisition as well. I guess I'm trying to get a sense of what that implies for sort of base business profit growth in fiscal '20. It would seem like perhaps that might be fairly modest or muted and I realize there is higher ERP spend, which impact some of that and as you said, you're being prudent on sort of pricing and your outlook there, but perhaps just some comments around sort of base business profit growth and how that plays out in fiscal '20? Robert McNutt : Sure, Andrew. This is Rob. You can get to the BSW historically out of the financials as you see the add back and so as we say, let's call it $10 million of add back there, the 53rd week adds a bit. Taking that all together, take out the ERP, increased expense, expense related to that, you still get into low to mid-single-digit kind of organic growth and profitability in the business. Andrew Lazar : And then if we're thinking about organic sales again for fiscal '20 and looking for mid-single digit rise, obviously, you take out the benefit from the 53rd week. So maybe we're talking more 3% or so and then I assume there is some benefit from obviously the recent acquisition in Australia. So, I mean, are we talking really more or something like 2% or so organic and if volume is the largest part of that, it sounds like very limited or as you said, very modest in the way of price. So I'm just trying to get a sense if that is -- if that's right, is that consistent, I guess, with the being encouraged, if you will, about some of the initial conversations around pricing that you've had? Thomas Werner : Andrew, this is Tom. Good morning. I'm encouraged by the contract negotiations that are happening right now in terms of the pricing. And the other thing to remember too, we always take a prudent approach to guidance. We also have the carryover contracting our global business unit, the pricing that we put in place last couple of years. And I would say, when you step back, this fiscal year, it's going to be largely driven net sales by volume and more than it will be by price as it has in the last couple of years. But I'm confident that how the contract discussions are progressing, feel good about how we've projected our pricing this fiscal year and I think, as we evaluate what's going on in the marketplace, I think there is going to be opportunities for us to continue to drive the pricing across multiple channels. Operator : Let me take our next question. Chris Growe of Stifel. Christopher Growe : I want to ask, there's been a lot of concern around incremental capacity and it sounds like that will have a minimal effect on pricing overall as you're seeing some good results so far in your negotiations. Where is utilization overall for the industry? Do you have a good sense of that? And maybe even including the facilities coming on later this year and early next year. Do you have a good sense of that and therefore, kind of where the industry will be operating, overall, at that level? Thomas Werner : Yes, generally, we believe with the additions in North America, including our Hermiston plant, this year, we're going to operate around the 95, 96 level in North America. In Europe, it's a little bit of a different story. There has been a lot of capacity put on in Europe. Compounded with the potato crop issue last year, it's a bit harder to read at this time until we get further in this fiscal year, but generally, we believe they are operating at a pretty high utilization rate as well. So as we stated in the past, that's kind of normalized levels. I think, over time, with the category growth at 1.5 to 2.5 points as we're projecting, it's going to continue to elevate utilization rates over the next couple of years as it has in the past year. So -- and then the industry, based on how they've been running in the past couple of years, at a really high, 100% utilization rate, I know in our business, we've got some catch up things to do in maintenance, but we'll some capacity off-line for us for a period of time. So I think if you think about it, Chris, running a business at utilization rates that we want at -- is that we run at, it's a pretty high utilization rate and that's just the nature of where we're at right now. So a lot of these things really just need to normalize and then, as the category continues to grow, we're going to be evaluating additional capacity ourself, potentially, in the near future. Christopher Growe : Okay, that's good to know. Just to be clear, at that level of utilization, you believe you can price the cost inflation at that level, is that current? Thomas Werner : Yes, I feel really confident that we can do that. Christopher Growe : Okay. And just one follow-up will be on the ERP spending. I think you said $10 million to $20 million expense this year you said how much you have in capital -- at the capital portion of that? And then just to get an idea, is that a little higher than next year as you kind of push through this implementation? That's my last question for you. Robert McNutt : Yes, Chris, this is Rob. Yes, the $10 million to $20 million expense, we have not disclosed specifically the capital on that and the timing of that as I said in prepared remarks that part of that is pace of timing of implementation as well, but the ERP spending is embedded within the capital guidance -- overall capital guidance I gave you. Christopher Growe : And that would grow next year then, Rob? Robert McNutt : Yes, again, it depends on timing of implementation, but I think that's fair to say it would be a little bit higher next year. Operator : And we'll now take out next question. It comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I guess, first coming back to the question on price mix and the QSR negotiations a little bit. The guidance for the year assumes kind of modest contribution. And this quarter and last, you are running about 3% price mix at the consolidated level. We're still in calendar '19 for the first half of fiscal '20 so my base assumption will be similar to that for the first half of your fiscal year. And you've got inflation escalators for the contracts that roll into -- that aren't up for renewal for 2020. So in the context of guidance that it assumes kind of modest contribution, it would seem like there's a notable decel embedded in the back half of the fiscal year on the price mix side. And I want to just make sure I'm thinking about that right. And if so, kind of just talk about whether it is inflation escalators from contracts not up for renewal or is the price mix on the new contracts more like 0 to 1? I'm just trying to make sure I understand the math there. Thomas Werner : Adam, again, as consistent with practice, we're being very prudent. And as I said in the prepared remarks, being very prudent of how those negotiations on pricing are going to evolve. Again, also recognize that growth -- as we're projecting growth, international markets, we assume we're going to grow a bit quicker than domestic markets in terms of demand and those typically as we've talked about before, command a lower margin than our domestic markets and so, part of it is into that mix peace across business and customer mix with international, waiting a little bit that is impacting your math there. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. So maybe that actually is a good segue into the second question. And you talked about being kind of happy with the pricing so far on the QSR negotiations. Can you talk maybe on the volume, market share side, just the aggregate kind of, are we happy just with pricing? Are we happy with the volume, market share price in aggregate, just maybe frame it a little bit more broadly than just the pricing component? Thomas Werner : Yes. So Adam, when you step back to your point in aggregate, we're very comfortable with not only the pricing component of it, but volume as well. And as I have -- as we worked hard over the last 2, 3 years to align our segments with strategic customers that; are growing in the marketplace. So we have a really good customer portfolio mix, not only in the Global segment, but in Foodservice and retail. And when you step back and look at both pieces, volume and pricing, we are in a sweet spot right now. So all this has to play out over the next couple of months, but I feel good about the growth opportunities we have in all of our segments. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a very quick follow-up from me. The acquisitions in Australia that you've done in recent months, I mean, I would guess that those are $10 million to $15 million EBITDA tailwind to fiscal '20. Is that assumption reasonable and that's in the guidance? Thomas Werner : Yes, I think, Adam, we don't want to talk about individual planned profitability per se, but I think it's fair to take the capacity volumes of those and apply a margin against those and you are going to get reasonably close and that's going to get you somewhere in that range. Also recognize that for the first few months that an acquisition, we have the markup on the inventory. So we won't get that margin on those acquisitions for the first few months, but bottom line answer to your question is, is it in the guidance? Yes, it is. Robert McNutt : Adam, mechanically, just, the Marvel acquisition, we got middle of last year, just mechanically, we did get the benefit of that in the fourth quarter and we talked about that in the prepared remarks, how much that was. And then, most recent acquisition, Ready Meals, that's $70 million, we got that at the... When was that? Thomas Werner : July 2, very first [indiscernible]... Robert McNutt : Yes, so we're about one month in, and so not all of it is going to be obviously in the first year. Operator : And we will now take our next question. It comes from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan. Thomas Palmer : Could you provide some clarity about the gross margin outlook? You're calling out modestly higher price mix, low to mid-single-digit input cost inflation plus looks like you'll have higher D&A expenses from the new facility. All this together seems like it would suggest gross margin pressure, but you're guiding to sustain your gross margin. So I guess, am I interpreting these pieces correctly? And are there other items that should help the gross margin line that are not being factored in that I just listed? Thomas Werner : Tom, this is Tom Werner. I'm real confident that we could maintain margin levels where they're at today and we continue to focus on. We've had a lot of discussion about prices this morning already, but we're focusing on mix too across all of our segments and customer mix. And we're also leveraging our Lamb Weston operating culture, supply chain to drive cost savings across our supply chain networks. So the business unit leaders, sales team, everybody is focused on maintaining our margin levels and I'm confident, based on, how things are playing out early on, that we'll be able to maintain our gross margin at these levels and interim up over the course of time. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Thanks for that. And then I know you're a little limited in how much you can discuss here, but I wanted to follow-up on negotiations again. You mentioned about a quarter of your global contracts were up for renewal this year. How does that compare to the number coming up for renewal next year? And are you seeing or looking to kind of change the terms in terms of the length of how long they continue for or any changes in terms of how you have structured escalators relative to the past? Thomas Werner : Yes. So we've worked over the past several years to spread the timing across all of our segments that we negotiate contracts with to sequence them 1, 2, 3 years where we can. So we have changed that sequencing in terms of negotiation timing. So as far as next year, I'm not going to get into specifics about what's coming up for bid next year, next year, we will have the same conversation and be talking about negotiations. Operator : And will now take our next question. It comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : So two questions, just two quick ones from me. First, the strong volume performance in the Global segment in the fourth quarter. Is there any benefit that you got from -- I think, you might have mentioned this in prepared remarks, but just any benefit you may have gotten from taking some orders from Europe or due to the shortage in Europe? And second, does any of that strength kind of -- is it all pull forward from 2020? Thomas Werner : Bryan, in terms of the picking up some orders related to Europe, that was really more focused on strategic European customers in support of those. The volume wasn't the big driver there. And in terms of is it pull forward, no, I wouldn't say any of that is pull forward. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Great. And then I guess, second one is just as we're modeling 2020, I know there has been a lot of focus on price in the discussion today, but is mix going to be negative? It just seems to me that maybe the Global segment ends up contributing a little bit more and that might be negative as you roll up at a consolidated level on mix? I'm just trying to get understanding how mix affects the price mix piece on an enterprise-level? Thomas Werner : Sure. On the mix side, again, I think your point is spot on. The global growth is we are expecting to be a bit faster. Recognize in retail, for example, we've had great growth here over the last couple of years. Expect that growth rate to moderate somewhat, but continue to push the mix within retail for the branded products and that will help our mix within the segment. Foodservice, similar drive growth with market, but don't expect outsized growth. It's really the growth in Global driven by export that's going to pressure a little bit margins in Global -- margin percentage in Global as the mix turns to more export business relative to the growth rates domestically. And as mentioned, those exports business tends to be a little bit lower margin. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Mandel of Consumer Edge Research. David Mandel : It's a quick one. When it comes to Europe, it looks like the weather is getting a little bit better, but there might be another bad crop. Can you point to any learnings that came from last year? Were there any surprises that the European processors were using table potatoes and stored inventory? So I was wondering if you could speak to any learnings that you could share with us? Thomas Werner : Sure, David. This is Tom. One of the things -- the opportunity in all that for Lamb Weston is the ability for ourselves, Lamb Weston and Lamb-Weston/Meijer to come together and look at first and foremost, the customers that we needed to make sure get serviced. And we did move some production around to North America from Lamb-Weston/Meijer. The team over there did a terrific job early on making sure we had sourced the potatoes we needed to service our business. So we got ahead of it and we organized ourselves more efficiently in terms of moving production around the globe. That was the big learning. Could we -- we've obviously, as we did that, we learned some things. And if that situation ever happens again, we're going to be more efficient at it. In terms of the potato crop this year, yes, Europe has been hot again, and we're obviously close to it on the ground there with Lamb-Weston/Meijer team. The difference is, they're getting rain periodically this year even with the heat. It's early on and as we get to our October call, we'll give you an update on that. But right now it is hot but it's still too early to tell the impact on the crop over there. Operator : And this concludes our Q&A session for today. So I'd like to hand the call back to our speakers. Dexter Congbalay : Hi, everyone. It's Dexter. If you have any follow-up questions, please send me an e-mail first. We could either set up a time or -- either today or later on in the next few days. Thanks for joining on the call. Talk to you later. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Lamb Weston First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations, of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's first quarter 2020 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our Web site, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with, our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our performance as well as some comments on the current operating environment. Rob will then provide the details on our first quarter results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our solid start to the year with each of our core business segments driving volume, price mix, and earnings growth. Specifically sales increased 8% behind strong volume growth, EBITDA including unconsolidated joint venture increased 9% driven by strong sales growth and higher gross profit. Diluted earnings per share increased 8%, reflecting operating gains, and finally we generated nearly $240 million of cash flow from operations. These results provide us with a good foundation to deliver on our full-year commitments. They also reflect how our commercial and supply chain teams continue to execute on our strategic and operational objectives. For example, in our Global segment, we drove strong growth by supporting customers in North America and internationally. We also continue to grow sales of limited time offering products in the U.S. and key markets in Asia, despite lapping a very strong prior-year quarter. In our Foodservice segment, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of volume growth behind sales of Lamb Weston branded products as our direct sales force continues to strengthen relationships with customers. In retail, our Alexia, Grown in Idaho, and licensed branded products each grew volume. Grown in Idaho continue to expand distribution, helped in part by the recent launch of two new items that are phenomenal, Dipper and Waffle Fries. And finally, our supply chain team continued to ramp up our new \u00a3300 million French fry line in Hermiston, Oregon, providing us with additional flexibility to service and upgrade other production lines that have been operating at peak capacity. Although we delivered a solid quarter, we did face some challenges in our supply chain. As you know, we've enjoyed the benefits of operating our manufacturing assets at very high utilization rates over the past couple of years. When possible, and without compromising food or employee safety, we've taken opportunities to defer maintenance in order to continue to support our customer's growth. However, it has also placed a strain on our production assets. During the quarter that strain showed. As Rob will discuss later, we had instances of production issues resulting in unplanned maintenance and repair costs, as well as some unscheduled operating downtimes, in turn, this increased our costs. Our manufacturing plants are now operating better, while we're making good progress and working through the issues that affected our performance, we expect to realize some residual impact on our results in the near-term. Before turning to the operating environment, let me give you a few quick updates. First, on a preliminary basis, we believe the crop in our growing areas in the Columbia Basin and Idaho, where we source the vast majority of raw potatoes, will be consistent with historical averages. While crop yields in Alberta and Minnesota may be just below average due to weather events, we do not expect this to have a notable impact on our overall results. So, at this time, we do not expect any significant issues with the crop in North America. As usual, we'll provide our updated view of the crops yield and quality, and how we expect the crop will hold up in storage when we report our second quarter results in early January. These factors are all key to determining how the potatoes perform in our production facilities, and along with contracted raw potato prices or actual costs for raw potatoes. Second, our early read on the potato crop in our growing areas in Europe is that it will be a bit below the long-term average. This is due to hot weather conditions this summer. However, despite being below average, we believe it will be better than last year's historically poor crop. As a result, we expect that Lamb-Weston/Meijer's performance will gradually improve as the year progresses as cost pressures ease in the second-half of our fiscal year once the new potato crop begins to be processed. And finally, with respect to contracts with our large customers, we finalized most of the agreements that are up for renewal this year. In aggregate, we're satisfied with how the discussions progressed and the terms on which we ultimately agreed, including price. These contracts reflect our balanced approach to improving price and mix in order to offset inflationary pressures, and importantly, to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships. Now, turning to our operating environment, we believe the current global environment is generally favorable. We believe industry capacity utilization rates in North America remain elevated during the first quarter. For the remainder of fiscal 2020, we anticipate that new capacity in North America will allow processors to operate their facilities closer to normalize rates, but utilization rates will remain elevated. With respect to demand growth in our fiscal first quarter was strong. In the U.S., positive restaurant traffic trends continued to be supported by low unemployment. Quick serve restaurant traffic growth was especially strong led by growth at chicken-based outlets. Growth in French fry servings was also encouraging. These trends help drive our Global segments strong volume growth in the quarter. In our key international markets, demand continued to grow in line with recent trends, and in Europe, demand growth was solid despite higher frozen potato prices as a result of last year's crop. While the recent frozen potato demand has been higher than average, we're monitoring signs of softening macro-economic conditions which may temper demand growth towards more normalized rates. However, French fry demand has proven somewhat resistant to the effect of challenging economic times as most rides are consumed at QSRs. Generally, consumer traffic at QSRs tends to weather periods of slower economic growth, better than fast casual, and other casual restaurant formats. That's why we've stayed aligned with our strategic QSR customers and partnered with up and coming QSRs in many of our key markets. As a result, along with our broad market coverage, advantage global manufacturing footprint, focus on execution and commitment to serving our customers, we believe we're well-positioned to deliver our financial objectives for the year and create value for our stakeholders over the long-term. So, in summary, we delivered a strong start to the year despite some manufacturing-related challenges. The potato crop in North America is in line with historical averages, and the crop in Europe has improved versus the prior year. We're satisfied with the outcome of customer contract renewals, and we're on track to deliver on our fiscal 2020 financial targets. And one more thing before I turn it over to Rob, earlier this year, Rick Martin, our Global Head of Supply Chain, told me of his intention to retire. For the past 25 years, he has been a tremendous asset to Lamb Weston and especially to me through the last three years as we transitioned to a standalone public company. Rick has been a steady hand leading the supply chain organization during our transition, including building and starting up several new lines to support our growth. He has also been a tireless champion for safety in our manufacturing facilities, and a great partner for me and my management team. On behalf of Lamb Weston, we wish Rick a happy and healthy retirement. And as we announced a couple of months ago, we're welcoming Gerardo Scheufler as our New Supply Chain Leader. Gerardo has more than 25 years of supply chain experience, most recently as the Vice President of Global Operations at Mondelez International, where he oversaw a major global restructuring program to optimize the global supply chain footprint that included more than 50,000 employees, and more than 150 global locations. Prior to Mondelez, he spent more than 20 years at Procter and Gamble in a variety of roles of increasing responsibility. We're happy to have Gerardo join the team and to leverage his experience as we make progress against our strategic plan. Now, let me turn the call over to Rob to provide details on our first quarter results. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning everyone. As Tom noted, we're pleased with our solid start to the year. Net sales increased 8% to $989 million with growth in each of our business segments. Volume increased 6%, led by growth in our Global segment. Together, our two acquisitions in Australia, Marvel Packers and Ready Meals added about a point of volume growth. Price mix was up, 2% due to pricing actions and favorable mix. Our strong sales growth drove an $18 million or 8% increase in gross profit, specifically higher prices, volume growth, and favorable mix drove the increase more than offsetting the impact of higher manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies, cost inflation and higher depreciation expense associated with our new production line in Hermiston. It's important to note that the increase in price was enough to offset input cost inflation on a $1 basis. In addition, the increase in gross profit includes nearly $2 million benefit from unrealized mark-to-market adjustments related to commodity hedging contracts compared to a $5.5 million loss in the prior year period. While we drove a solid increase in gross profit dollars, our gross margin percentage was down a modest 10 basis points to 25%. However, excluding the mark-to-market adjustments, it was down 80 basis points. The gross margin decline, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment was primarily driven by manufacturing and efficiencies. As Tom noted earlier, these inefficiencies were largely a result of the strain that we've placed on our assets by operating at very high utilization rate levels over the past few years. In the quarter, we incurred higher maintenance, repair, and related costs such as additional labor expense. We also had higher than normal periods of unscheduled operating downtime. Together, both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance affected our production levels, which in turn impacted our fixed cost absorption. Raised overall maintenance cost and lowered recovery rates. Most of our plants are now operating more normal levels. In addition, getting our new Hermiston line operational and qualified to make a range of products has provided more flexibility across our network. And the overall transition to processing the new potato crop is going well. Nonetheless, we'll continue to realize some carryover effect from these manufacturing inefficiencies on gross profit as we make progress on correcting these issues over the coming months. And as we work through finished goods inventories early in the second quarter, SG&A expense increased less than a $1 million to about $79 million. The increase in SG&A was due to higher expenses related to information technology services and infrastructure, including approximately $1 million associated with designing a new enterprise resource planning system, as well as investments in our sales, marketing, and operating capabilities. We expect SG&A will increase as we ramp up the training and transition process for the new ERP system. The increase in SG&A in the quarter was largely offset by a $4 million decline in foreign exchange expense, and a $1.5 million decline in advertising and promotional expense. As a result, income from operations increased $17 million, or 11% to $170 million reflecting solid sales and gross profit growth. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe and Lamb Weston/RDO in Minnesota, were $11 million in the quarter, excluding mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings were down about $10 million. The decline was largely due to higher raw potato and manufacturing costs and associated with last year's poor crop in Europe carrying through inventory during the quarter more than offsetting the benefit of higher prices and volume growth. This impact is largely behind us and we should see profitability improve in the second quarter. So putting it all together, EBITDA including the proportional EBITDA from our 2 unconsolidated joint ventures increased to $20 million or 9% to $233 million. Operating gains by our base business along with contributions from the BSW in Australian acquisitions drove $28 million of EBITDA growth. This was partially offset by an $8 million decline and EBITDA from our unconsolidated joint ventures. Moving down the income statement, interest expense was about $28 million, which is about $1.5 million more than last year. This increase reflects the right off of debt issuance costs and connection with a refinancing of a portion of our term loan facility to secure lower costs and to extend the maturity date. Our effective tax rate was about 24% consistent with our full-year guidance. Turning to earnings per share, diluted EPS was up $0.06 or 8% to $0.79. Operating gains in our base business and our approximately $0.03 benefit from the BSW acquisition drove the increase. This was partially offset by lower equity earnings. Now, let's review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S. base change, changes all as well as all other sales outside of North America were up 11%. Volume grew 9% with growth driven by higher sales, including increase sales of limited time offering products to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets. It also includes a two-point benefit for Marvel Packers and Ready Meals acquisitions in Australia. Price mix Rose 2% primarily reflecting pricing adjustments associated with multi-year contracts. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense increased $8 million or 9%. Favorable price mix and volume growth drove the increase, which was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost, input cost inflation and higher depreciation expense associated with the Hermiston production line. Sales for our food service segment, which services North American food service distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, increased 3%. Price mix increased 2% reflecting improved mix and the benefit of pricing actions initiated in the fall of 2018. Volume increased 1% led by growth of Lamb Weston branded products. Food Services contribution margin was essentially flat increasing about $0.5 million price mix and volume growth offset higher manufacturing cost, input cost inflation and higher depreciation expense. Sales in our retail segment increased 11% driven by eight points of volume growth behind increased sales of branded and private label products across our portfolio. Price mix increased 3% largely due to favorable mix and pricing actions. Retails product contribution margin increased 6 million or 27%. Higher price mix, volume growth and the timing of A&P spending probably increased. Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow, our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.2 billion. This puts our net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.7 times. With respect to cash flow, we generated nearly $240 million of cash flow from operations. That's up about 5% versus last year driven by earnings growth. We use nearly half of that cash to purchase Ready Meals in Australia for about $117 million and invested about $60 million combined in capital expenditures and IT projects. We bought back about $5 million worth of stock or more than 72,000 shares at an average price of $66.67 cents. Our ability to repurchase shares in the first quarter was limited since we only had a very narrow trading window in August. We also paid $29 million in dividends to our shareholders. Turning to our fiscal 2020 outlook, as Tom noted, our financial targets are unchanged and we remain on track to deliver our financial commitments for the year. Our targets include the contribution of a 53rd week that will benefit the fourth quarter. For the year, we continue to target sales to grow at mid single-digit rate, primarily driven by volume and price mix to increase in order to offset input cost inflation. We also continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures to be in the range of $950 million to $970 million, with sales and gross profit growth driving the increase. We expect gross profit growth will drive a significant portion of the EBITDA increase with volume growth and favorable price mix more than offsetting input cost inflation and higher depreciation expense as well as the effect of some manufacturing inefficiencies. As I noted earlier, we continue to realize some effect from the manufacturing inefficiencies on gross profit as we work through finished goods inventories early in the second quarter. Turning to SG&A, for the year, we continue to expect our base SG&A which excludes advertising and promotional expense, as well as the ERP investments to be within our target of 8% to 8.5% of sales. We're targeting A&P expense to remain in line with what we spent in fiscal 2019. We also continue to anticipate total ERP spending of between $10 million and $20 million, and that it should ramp up over the course of the year depending on the pace of the implementation of the system. We continue to expect equity earnings to gradually improve as we put the challenges of last year's poor crop in Europe behind us. In addition to our expected operating gains, our outlook includes an approximately $10 million year-over-year earnings benefit from the BSW acquisition in the first-half of fiscal 2020. Most of our other financial targets also remain the same, including total interest expense, around $110 million, an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%, and total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $175 million. We're raising our capital expenditure target to $300 million from $270 million to reflect updated spending estimates for our new ERP system and other projects. Now, here's Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Rob. Let me quickly sum up by saying we are pleased with our solid sales earnings and cash flow growth to start the year. We're on track to deliver on our physical 2020 financial targets, and we remain focused on serving our customers, executing against our strategic initiatives to support long-term and creating value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston. And we're now happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : So, I've got just one quick one on some of the supply chain challenges, and then a broader follow-up. With the supply chain piece you mentioned some of the higher costs you incurred. Were there any -- it didn't sound like it, but were there any, I guess, supply issues with any key customers or shorting customer of product given some of the unexpected plant downtime and things like that, or were you able to kind of make that up, just albeit with higher costs? Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew, we -- this is Tom. We, with our manufacturing footprint, these things unexpectedly happen. We do have the ability to move production around to other facilities. So to pointblank answer your question, there wasn't any customer disruption associated with planned downtime and the manufacturing challenges we had in the first quarter. Andrew Lazar : Great, thanks for that. And then in the release this morning and then in your prepared remarks you mentioned how Lamb is monitoring the potential for a softening of macro economic conditions that I guess could temper frozen potato demand towards more normalized levels. So I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe what signs that you're either currently seeing or that you're monitoring, and are they regional in nature or maybe more broad-based? And then I've got a follow-up to that. Tom Werner : Right, Andrew, we obviously look at all the syndicated data, and we also have some data that we look at in the international markets. And it's exactly what I just stated this morning, we're monitoring it. And we had a great quarter in terms of traffic in the U.S. with QSRs, so it's -- that's counterintuitive to what we're concerned about economically. But it's been choppy the last three, four quarters in terms of traffic. So we're continuing to watch it. It's -- there's a lot of economic concern in the market, but right now it's just - it's just something we monitor. But again, we had a great traffic quarter in the QSR in the U.S. International markets are on trend in terms of what traffic and what we're seeing our growth. So it's just something we're monitoring. Andrew Lazar : Okay. And then the last piece of that would really be, maybe, could you just remind us of what demand has been. We can see obviously what demand has been more running at, but can you remind us what you see as more normalized rates of growth in North America, and Internationally. And just the reason I ask is I want to make sure how we should think about, if we get to a point where there's more normalized rates, and I realize right now that's not the case, what that means in the context of some increased industry supply in the market even though current utilization remains pretty tight, as you said? Tom Werner : Yes, so Andrew, a normalized that we look at is 1.5% to 2.5% globally. And obviously there's going to be different growth rates in different markets. And just to give you context, broad strokes is a \u00a330 billion market category globally, so 1.5% to 2.5%, that's a big chunk of volume growth on a normalized basis. So that's how when I talk about normalized growth rates, that's the window you need to think about. Andrew Lazar : Okay, thanks very much. Tom Werner : Yes. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : So, I guess first, I wanted to just touch on the pricing discussion a little bit, and it ties into the capacity side. And in the quarter, I mean you talked about kind of being pleased mix being favorable and getting pricing to cover cost. Any additional color you could have as you've gone through additional contracting discussions with your global customers into 2020? And then in the Foodservice side, the price mix line did decelerate pretty notably from where you were last quarter, and I thought the lapping of a price increase was going to be more in the upcoming quarters, so just any color on the 400 basis point deceleration in price in Foodservice. Tom Werner : Yes, so just generally, Adam, this is Tom. Overall, the contracting exercise we just finished, up by and large, are pricing -- kind of landed where we thought it was going to be. And I know there was some concern out there that with the capacity coming on that there was going to be some pressure -- a lot of pressure on pricing. And by and large where we ended up is exactly where we thought we would be. Historically, based on my experience with this business, in these times where you have a little extra capacity, yes, you're not going to get maybe the lifts that you've had in the past, but overall pricing landed exactly where we thought we would be. So I'm pleased with where all that ended up. In terms of the Foodservice pricing deceleration, I would say it's at a more normalized level based on from a historical standpoint, and we've had significant price increases over the last few years based on a number of economic reasons and business reasons. And we were able to get some pricing through, as we expected. And I'm -- even though it's decelerated we're lapping some big price increases from prior year. I'm super happy where we landed on all this. So I feel good about where we're positioned in terms of that. And again, the belief out there was it was there was a lot of concern whether or not we were going to be able to price. And the team did a great job getting it through the marketplace. Adam Samuelson : Okay, I appreciate that color. And then second for me, just on the potato crop side, I think you indicated in your key growing regions in the Pacific Northwest you're comfortable with the supplies. Are there any pockets though, you talked Alberta or Minnesota as areas where their crop might be a little bit weaker. Any residual impacts to the broader market or broader industry capacity utilization that could be potentially opportunities where you have potatoes that some of your competitors' plants might be more challenged, or any pockets of supply disruption on that front that you could call out? Tom Werner : Yes, Adam, I'm going to kind of defer answering that question. We are right in the middle of harvest, and as I do in Q2, I'll give you a broader base point of view on the crop in total. All I will say right now is exactly what I said on the call is we feel good about the Pacific Northwest. There's some challenges in Alberta and the Midwest, and right now it's really about understanding how that crop is going to process. And we really just need time. Another month and then we'll have a good idea, and I'll get back to you in Q2, like I do every year, and give you point of view of where there are challenges or not. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And if I could just squeeze a quick clarification, just the other segment, the profit jumps about $5 million year-on-year, any color on what drove that? Rob McNutt : No, the other profits also includes our mark-to-market, and so, the other category does, and so that that's really the noise in there; nothing operationally. Q \u2013 Adam Samuelson : Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll now move to Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : Good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning, Tom. Tom Palmer : Firstly, I just wanted to ask about the higher ERP-related CapEx. Is this any type of shift in terms of the spending from operating expenses to CapEx either for this year or down the road? And then is the increase like a pull-forward of expenses or just a outright increase in terms of expected spending for the ERP, just some color on that would be great. Tom Werner : Yes, Tom, the ERP project, and again, recognize the accounting around those kinds of things in computer systems has changed here recently. And so, some of that is when you're doing these licenses gets put into SG&A expense, and then there's some of the things that go into CapEx. So there's a little bit of change in the accounting standards, but from us for our spending is we're exactly on plan as expected, and we're very deliberately going through and making these upgrades. And so, the adjustment to the CapEx is just we've got a little more clarification and specificity over the spending for that project. And so, that's where we raised our CapEx for that as well as some other project work we're doing. Tom Palmer : Okay, thank you. I wanted to also ask just on the volume side, you called out both planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance, but your volume growth didn't seem to be negatively affected by a large amount. Why was this? And should we expect volume growth to decelerate as we look at the remainder of the year, or you think these rates are -- you're able to maintain them? Tom Werner : Well, just in terms of kind of what I said earlier, Tom, the great thing about Lamb Weston and our diversified asset base is when we have some of these challenges in the business with the start-up at Hermiston, that gives us flexibility in terms of capacity, additional capacity, we're able to move production around, if you will. So, we didn't impact customers, and tend to the needs of the unplanned downtime. So you're not going to feel the impact in the quarter, because we're able to flex our asset base in terms of production. In terms of volume expectations, going forward, we're very prudent in our forecasts and our outlook. We had a strong volume quarter. A lot of it was driven by the strong QSR traffic. So, I would not take this quarter and extrapolate it out, because we have remained prudent in our outlook based on what we think volume is going to be for the year. Tom Palmer : Okay. So, just to clarify, it sounds like you're essentially not factoring in this 5% growth, just to be safe on the traffic side, or are there specific reasons that volume was particularly strong this quarter, and you do not see those recurring? Tom Werner : Again, Tom, we had the traffic in the quarter was as good as we've seen it, and what we do as a company is we're very prudent in our outlook. And these traffic trends, if you look at the syndicated data, they can turn on a dime. So, yes, we're monitoring our customers. Yes, we have an outlook on what our customers are thinking about doing in terms of in-market promotional activity, but we will always be prudent in our projections going forward, and historically that's what we've done. That's what we're going to continue to do. Tom Palmer : Understood, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi, just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the just a couple questions around volume. You talked about this kind of 1.5% to 2.5% global growth, and it may kind of gravitate back towards that level. Do you have like what volume growth was globally in the quarter, I think you said about 5% traffic growth? Was that a U.S. comment or is that a global comment? Tom Werner : That was a U.S. comment. Chris Growe : Okay, got it. And then it would seem like based on your volume performance, you gained significant market share. Did you give a little bit of breakdown of volume by international versus U.S. were they about the same or was one better than the other? Dexter Congbalay : Hey, Chris, it's Dexter. Yes, international was stronger overall than domestic, as you would expect, and I'd say little bit meaningfully so. But the category overall, I mean, normalizes 1.5%, 2.5%. The category has been little bit better than that over the last call, nine, 12 months. I think we've talked about that before. And that's why we're saying that in our prepared remarks, we said we've seen higher than average category growth, particularly this past quarter. And obviously, we were part of the beneficiary to that as well. Chris Growe : Sure, that makes sense. And I think you're trying to be prudent in your expectations going forward for the category if I heard that properly. So that makes sense. And then just one of the questions if I could in SG&A, you talked about SG&A less advertising, less ERP. What was it on that basis in the first quarter, I guess, I was just trying to understand is the ERP funding sort of picking up throughout the year? SG&A was a little below what I thought for the year -- for the quarter, which was good. I just want to get a sense of what it was on that basis of which you're modeling for the year? Dexter Congbalay : Yes, SG&A in the first quarter ex-A&P and I don't have that is million dollars of ERP spend, but was about 7.5% ex-A&P to put that in context, last year Q1 was 7.8% -- 7.8% sorry. Tom Werner : Yes, Chris, I would say that anticipate that the ERP spend is going to increase over the course of the balance of the year. And so that 10 to 20 I talked about that's going to take place really in the back half of the year. So you will see it grow. Chris Growe : Okay, that sounds great. Thank you so much for your time. Tom Werner : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : So, a couple of questions, I guess the first one, just, as we've touched on, on pricing a couple of times in the quarter. We had heard that some of your competitors had put some price increase letters out in the food that what would be I guess, kind of relative to the Foodservice segment to you, I guess like during the course of the quarter, so is that something that you've seen and is there potential, I guess for some more price incremental pricing in that segment as we move forward? Tom Werner : Yes, Bryan it's Tom, I'm not going to get into specifics about pricing and competitive pricing, but we executed our plan pricing in the marketplace across all of our segments as we normally do. And I will tell you, like I said earlier, I'm pleased with how all that, how the team did and they executed it. So we'll start seeing that pricing in the marketplace here. It takes a while for the pricing to get in the marketplace. And so, we'll start seeing the benefit of that, but it does take a while, from the time we announced until it actually starts flowing through to the business, but we've executed across all of our segments on the pricing that we felt we could get through. Bryan Spillane : So just to be clear, so is it whatever you've announced, isn't really even reflected in what we saw in this quarter's results because it's going to take some time to flow through? Tom Werner : That's correct, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then second on potato supply? I know, you commented on your growing regions, I guess in the trade press, it seems like the Eastern, like Eastern Canada crop, maybe not as good. So, can you just kind of talk about how if there's a tight supplies in potatoes on the East Coast, just how that affects the industry, right? Is it possible that some of your competitors that are more East Coast dependent will be kind of tight on potato supply and just how that affects the whole supply demand dynamic in the market? Tom Werner : Yes, Bryan, so again, it's early on, and there's been some weather challenges in Canada, Midwest and the East, and it does put pressure on raw potato supply and it causes some of natural things that happen like shipping potatoes across the country. When you ship potatoes, they don't travel very well. So, as the - potentially the competitors are facing these issues. Historically, they have assured supply, but they have to do some unnatural things, and it increased our costs, and typically my experience when that goes on, we haven't seen a lot of disruptions. Do we get a few calls from customers here and there? Yes, we do, but typically the competitive set even though they have to do unnatural things and incur cost by shipping potatoes across the country, they are going to support their customers too, but it really comes down to -- it pressures their margins, I think\u2026 Bryan Spillane : And then -- yes. Tom Werner : I am sorry, just add to that, that in terms of the impact on us, I mean, because we contracts such a high percentage, high 90% of our raw ahead of the season going into the season that really isn't going to impact our cost structure even though they're pulling potatoes maybe out of Idaho or something. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then just the last one from me, maybe Rob, if you could just help a little bit the gross margins in the first quarter I guess there was a few kind of one off items that affected gross margin, right. You'd mentioned the supply chain inefficiencies as being one of them. I think tariffs also crept in this quarter and would've affected gross margins. Could you just give us a sense of how much of was pressuring gross margin in the first quarter, the magnitude of what it was and I guess it's going to linger a little bit into 2Q and then how much we might get back if things are more normal in the back half of the year. Just trying to understand how much of the gross margin pressure was kind of more transient in nature versus you know, carry through the year? Rob McNutt : Yes. If you take the 80 basis points down that I called you know, ex mark-to-market, ex the noise in the manufacturing facilities, we would've been modestly positive in terms of gross margin percentage growth, right. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And some of that will, kind of linger into the second quarter, but we should sort of be through that by the time we get to the second half? Rob McNutt : Exactly. Bryan Spillane : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from David Mandel with Consumer Edge Research. Tom Werner : Good morning, David. Operator : And David, you may be on mute. David Mandel : I was on mute. I'm sorry. Good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning. Rob McNutt : Good morning, David. David Mandel : So, just to pick up on the tariff and the slowing growth, possibly reverting to normalize rates, I was just wondering how prudent is that exactly, I mean if there is a macro slow down and tariffs are an issue in export market, particularly China, Is a slowed down to normalized rates really prudent or could it get even worse? Tom Werner : Yes, David. I will address the tariff question first. With all the tariff discussion and everything that's going on, we have a pretty sizable business in China. Obviously we've got a manufacturing plant in China, and we have executed our contingency plan, as the tariff rates change. So we've adjusted production and it's been -- have we been impacted absolutely have. It's been immaterial. So the team has done a great job, looking at ways to mitigate a tariff increases on French fries specifically, so, nothing material in the tariffs right now. The second part of your questions, I'll answer it, it's interesting. I'll give you a perspective. When you go back 10, 11 years when we had the financial crisis and the interesting thing in our business a little bit to what I said earlier in my prepared remarks is even through all that period, our volume held pretty steady, and it's a combination of consumer behavior. This is my belief of the QSR traffic. People still eat out, but they eat out at QSRs in the traffic, and we saw it in our volume, and we have international markets that continue to grow. So, our experience, if something finance, some economically happens, even in that time, our volume continue to -- it grew, but it kind of grew, I don't remember what the rates are, but it continued to grow. So that's the data point I have, and we have as a business when we have a significant economic downturn, and again, back to my earlier comments, that's why we're always going to be prudent with our outlook going forward. David Mandel : Thank you. That's really helpful. Earlier in the call, you referred to maintenance issues, did the Hermiston plants come online faster than usual, to kind of rescue maintenance issues or\u2026 Tom Werner : No. I mean, the Hermiston plant came out as planned. Yes, the Hermiston plant was online in May as planned and on target, so we're ramping it up. David Mandel : Sorry, so it fully ramp up faster than usual. Tom Werner : No, it was right on track, and the team did a great job, getting up and running, and it did certainly helped relieve some of the some of the pressures were filling in, some of the other manufacturing facilities, but by and large, it was on track. David Mandel : Great. Thank you for that. And my last one, can you break up the mid single-digit sales growth a little bit? I mean, if I think about the 53rd week adding about 2%, and pricing to kind of offset input costs, but it's really -- sales growth is going to be volume-driven. I'm just trying to think about how much volume and how much pricing, because there -- once you back out the 53rd week, there isn't all that much left? Dexter Congbalay : Yes. Hey, David, it's Dexter. I mean if you think about broad stroke sales is mid singles for call that four to six, right? And that's the 53rd week. I've been basically saying three to five. So I said a couple points, probably a little bit more than a point. And then, we're saying the bulk of that is going to be more largely driven by volume. So, you can use your assumption, whatever you want to use for price mix. David Mandel : Great, thank you for that, and that's all I have. I'll pass it on. Operator : And it appears there are no further telephone questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thank you everybody for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please pop me an e-mail, we can schedule a call, and look forward to talking to you later. Thank you. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference, and we thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's second quarter 2020 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially and due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with, our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our performance, some recent capital allocation actions, and an update on the current operating environment. Rob will then provide the details on our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2020 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Happy New Year everyone and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute well, specifically sales increased 12% behind strong volume growth and favorable price mix in each of our core business segments. EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures increased 17% while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 19%, and in the first half of the year we generated $345 million of cash flow from operations. Because of our strong year-to-date results and good operating momentum, we\u2019ve raised our fiscal 2020 outlook for both sales and EBITDA. As Dexter mentioned, I\u2019d like to update you on some capital allocation actions we\u2019ve recently taken, as well as our thoughts on the potato crop in the current operating environment. On capital allocation, in October we acquired a 50% ownership interest in a new joint venture in Argentina. This JV will provide us better access to a strategic and growing market where we have been under-represented. Before this investment, our market share in South America was less than 2%. While this JV is a modest side operation today, it provides a good base for expansion to serve the broader South American market with a low-cost high-quality product. This should enable us to drive faster share growth over the long-term. We also remain committed to reinvesting capital back in this business to support customer growth. We\u2019ve added three new French fry lines since 2014. And despite these additions, our current capacity utilization is above our targeted operating rates, due to recent demand growth being faster than historical averages. While we are not prepared to announce any capacity expansion projects today, we are aggressively evaluating opportunities to expand production capacity inside and outside North America to support our customers growth. We look forward to sharing our expansion plans with your soon. In the meantime, we\u2019re actively working to stretch existing capacity by debottlenecking lines and driving productivity. And finally, in addition to reinvesting back into the business, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. Last month, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.23 a share or $0.92 on an annual basis. That puts our dividend payout ratio at about 27% on a latest 12-month basis, which is within our target payout range of 25% to 35%. We will continue to supplement our dividends with share repurchases. In the second quarter, we bought back about $8.5 million of stock, which is largely consistent with our goal to at least offset equity compensation dilution. To do so, we estimate that we need to buy back around $40 million of stock annually. Now, switching to the potato crop. Recent press reports have led to market fears of raw potato and French fry shortages. As we discussed on our last earnings call, the crop in our growing areas in the Columbia Basin and Idaho will resource the vast majority of our raw potatoes and where we have most of our production facilities is consistent with historical averages in terms of both yield and quality. As a result, we expect to operate our plants there at normal utilization rates. In Alberta, Canada where we have one plant crop yields and quality are below average as a result adverse weather conditions during the growing season and harvest periods. However, we\u2019ve been able to secure enough potatoes to operate that plant at normal rates. Nonetheless, overall potato availability in Alberta is limited. In Minnesota, where we have a single plant through our joint venture Lamb-Weston/RDO, crop yields and quality are below average, also due to poor weather conditions during the growing season and harvest periods. As a result, potato availability in the upper Midwest will also be limited. However, our partner in that plant is a primary supplier of raw potatoes and they expect to provide adequate supply for the plant to operate as planned. Also, we understand that the crops in other key growing regions such as Manitoba and Prince Edward Island are below average due to adverse weather. This limits the availability of potatoes in North America. It\u2019s important to note that we do not currently source raw potatoes from these regions. So, let me be clear, given our concentration of processing facilities in the Columbia Basin and Idaho, as well as our strong grower relationships in Alberta and the Midwest, and most importantly, our decision to source open potatoes several months ago, we\u2019re confident that we have raw potatoes to deliver our volume growth targets for the remainder of our fiscal year. However, potato supply in North America is tight and this may pressure our ability to pursue incremental volume growth opportunities both domestically and internationally for this crop year. Accordingly, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to improve price and mix in each of our business segments. Now, turning to Europe, the potato supply there is also expected to be challenging due to quality and late harvest weather conditions. Compared to last year's historically poor harvest, the potato crops in the Netherlands and Belgium this year are better, but still below average. The crops in Germany, Poland, and the UK are more challenged. As a result, raw potato prices in Europe remain elevated versus historical averages, but are below prices that we experienced last year. So, we expect that Lamb-Weston/Meijer performance will continue to improve, compared to last year as cost pressures ease in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the new crop. With respect to the operating environment, we believe that industry capacity utilization rates in North America remain elevated during the second quarter and they will likely remain so for the remainder of our fiscal year subject to raw potato availability. We believe global demand growth for frozen potato products is generally favorable and will remain so through fiscal 2020. Similar to what we saw earlier in the year, U.S. demand in the second quarter continued to be underpinned by positive restaurant traffic trends and quick service traffic growth was strong, again, led by growth at chicken-based outlets. Demand in our key international market, as well as in Europe continue to grow in-line with recent trends. Together, these factors help drive our strong volume growth in the quarter, especially in our global segment. So, in summary, we delivered strong second quarter and first half results. We expect the overall operating environment to remain generally favorable for the balance of the year underpinned by solid demand growth. We are well-positioned with raw potatoes to deliver our volume targets. And finally, our successful execution of our strategy is generating strong cash flows, which allows us to continue to reinvent in the business to support growth and step-up cash return to shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our second quarter results and our updated outlook. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered another strong performance in the quarter and for the first half of the year. Specifically, in the quarter, net sales increased 12% to $1.019 billion with volume growth and favorable price mix in each of our core business segments. Volume increased 10%, led by growth in our Global and Food-Service segments. Our two acquisitions in Australia, Marvel Packers and Ready Meals, added about a point and half of volume growth. In addition, we had a couple of extra shipping days than we had in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, due to the timing of Thanksgiving. These extra couple of days contribute about another point of volume growth. As a result, this will pose a headwind to our Q3 results on a year-over-year basis. Price mix was up 2%, due to pricing actions and favorable mix. Our strong sales growth drove a $36 million or 14% increase in gross profit. Favorable price mix, volume growth, along with lower transportation cost drove the increase, more than offsetting the impact of higher manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies and higher depreciation expense associated with our new production line in Hermiston. In addition, the increase in gross profit includes a $4 million benefit from unrealized mark-to-market adjustments related to commodity hedging contracts. That\u2019s compared to a $2 million loss in the prior year period. Our gross margin percentage increased about 65 basis points to 28%. Excluding the mark-to-market adjustments, it was up about five points. While we made a lot of progress improving our plant operating performance from the first quarter, in the second quarter, we continue to incur higher than normal periods of unscheduled operating downtimes, which affected our production levels. This impacted fixed cost absorption, raised overall maintenance costs, and lowered recovery rates. In addition, some of the cost that we realized in the second quarter was a carryover effect as we work through finished goods inventories from the first quarter. Since our plants are now operating at more normal levels, we expect only a modest carryover effect from these manufacturing efficiencies in our fiscal third quarter results. SG&A expense was $92 million, an increase of about $17 million. About $6 million of this increase was related to higher incentive compensation accruals based primarily on our performance. About $4 million of the change reflects an insurance settlement that we had last year, but this is partially offset by a $2 million reduction in foreign exchange losses. About $7 million of the increase related to investments in our sales, marketing and operating capabilities. Finally, more than $2 million of the increase was related to designing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system. As we previously discussed, we expect to spend about $10 million to $20 million of one-time cost this year on implementing a new ERP system. To-date, we\u2019ve spent about $4 million. So, we expect spending to ramp up in the second half of the year. Income from operations increased about $20 million or 11% to $194 million. This reflected solid sales and gross profit growth. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe, Lamb Weston/RDO in Minnesota, and our new joint venture in Argentina were $15 million in quarter. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $6 million, largely reflecting lower raw potato prices in Europe. So, putting it all together, EBITDA, including joint ventures, increased $38 million or 17% to $261 million. Operating gains by our base business along with contributions from the BSW consolidation and the Australian acquisitions drove about $32 million of EBITDA growth. Our unconsolidated joint ventures added about $6 million. Moving down the income statement, interest expense was about $25 million, which is about $1 million below last year. Our effective tax rate was more than 23%, or about two points higher than last year, due to discrete items. Turning to earnings per share, adjusted diluted EPS was up $0.15 or 19% to $0.95. Operating gains in our base business and higher equity earnings drove the increase. We also had an approximately $0.04 benefit from the BSW consolidation. Now, let\u2019s review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our global segment, which includes the Top 100 U.S.-based change, as well as all sales outside of North America, were up 15%. Volume grew 14%. The increase was driven by higher sales, including increased sales of limited time offerings to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets. It also includes a three-point benefit from the acquisitions in Australia and a one-point benefit from the additional shipping days related to the timing of Thanksgiving.  Price mix rose 1%, primarily reflecting pricing adjustments associated with multi-year year contracts. Global product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotion expense, increased $17 million or 15%. Volume growth, favorable price mix and lower transportation cost drove the increase, which was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and higher depreciation expense associated with our Hermiston line. Sales for our food service segment, which services North American food service distributors and restaurant chains outside the Top 100 North American restaurant customers, increased 9%. Volume increased 5%, led by growth of distributor private label and Lamb Weston branded products. About half of the volume increase was due to the additional shipping days in the quarter. Even after adjusting for the Thanksgiving ship, we delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of volume growth as our direct sales force continued to strengthen customer relationships. Price mix increased 4%, primarily reflecting pricing actions taken in October. Food service\u2019s product contribution margin increased $14 million or 14%. Favorable price mix, volume growth, and lower transportation costs more than offset higher manufacturing costs and depreciation expense. Sales in our retail segment increased 7%, driven by four points of volume growth behind increased sales of branded and private label products. About 2 points of the volume growth was due to the additional shipping days in the quarter. Price mix increased 3%, largely due to favorable mix and pricing actions. Retail\u2019s product contribution margin increased $3 million or 10%. Favorable price mix and volume growth drove the increase and was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, depreciation expense, and A&P spending. Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow, our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.2 billion. This puts our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.6 times. With respect to cash flow, we generated nearly $345 million of cash from operations in the first half of the year. That\u2019s up about 9% versus last year, driven by earnings growth.  We used about $135 million towards acquisitions, including a $17 million initial payment for our half of the new joint venture in Argentina. We also invested nearly $110 million combined in capital expenditures and IT-related projects. In addition, we bought back more than $13 million of stock and paid $59 million in dividends to our shareholders. Turning to our updated fiscal 2020 outlook, as Tom noted, because of our strong first half performance, we\u2019ve raised our sales and earnings outlook for the full year. As a reminder, our targets include the contribution of a 53rd week that will benefit the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to be prudent when updating our annual outlook. For the full year, we\u2019re now targeting sales to grow at the high-end of our original mid-to-high single digit rate range. We continue to expect that sales will be primarily driven by volume and it will deliver price mix increases to offset input cost inflation. As you know, we delivered 10% sales growth in the first half, including a 2% higher price mix and robust 8% volume growth. We expect our volume growth will moderate in the second half for a number of reasons. In our global segment, volume growth in the first half of the year was faster than we had anticipated due to domestic QSR traffic growth above historical trends and international demand was also above our initial expectations. While we expect global demand will remain generally favorable in the back half of the year, we expect these trends may begin to normalize towards historical growth rates. Also, in our global segment in the third quarter, we\u2019ll be lapping strong sales of limited time offering products. Also, in the third quarter, we\u2019ll realize a headwind of approximately one percentage point due to a lower number of shipping days versus the prior year quarter as a result of the timing of Thanksgiving. This will affect each of our core business segments with the most pronounced impact in our food service segment. Finally, in our retail segment, we\u2019ll realize the effect of losing some low margin contracts in our private label retail business. In short, we expect to drive solid sales growth in the second half led primarily by volume growth with modestly higher price mix. For earnings, we\u2019ve increased our full-year target for adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures to a range of $965 million to $985 million. That\u2019s up from a range of $950 million to $970 million.  For the second half, we expect the gross profit will rise largely in-line with sales growth with volume growth and favorable price mix offsetting input cost inflation and higher depreciation expense. As a result, we expect that gross margin percentage will be essentially flat in the second half. However, gross margin in the third quarter maybe pressured as a result of difficult prior year comparison. Gross margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 included a $4 million benefit from unrealized gains on hedging contracts, a mix benefit, due to strong sales of higher margin limited time offering products in our global segment and cost benefit from supply chain efficiencies, especially around edible oil from transportation. Regarding SG&A, for the year, we continue to expect our base SG&A, which excludes advertising promotional expenses, as well as one-time ERP investments will be within our target range of 8% to 8.5% of sales. [Interest] expense in the second half should be a bit above the $11 million we spent so far. As I previously noted, we anticipate total ERP system implementation spending to ramp up versus a 4 million of one-time expense that we incurred in the first half. We continue to target total one-time expenses related to the project between $10 million and $20 million for the full year. With respect to equity earnings, we continue to expect that it will continue to gradually improve in the second half, despite the potato crop in Europe again being somewhat challenged. To summarize, in the second half of the year, we\u2019ll deliver solid growth in EBITDA, including joint ventures driven by sales and gross profit growth, as well as improved earnings. This growth will be tempered by higher SG&A expense as we step-up spending behind our ERP implementation.  In addition, it\u2019s important to note that we had an approximately $10 million year-over-year earnings benefit from the BSW consolidation in the first half of fiscal 2019 or 2020. Since we completed that transaction around mid-fiscal 2019, we\u2019ll no longer have that benefit in the back half of this fiscal year. Finally, most of our other financial targets remain the same. We continue to target total interest expense of around $110 million, total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $175 million, and total capital expenditures which includes some CapEx for our new ERP system of around $300 million. We\u2019ve updated our effective tax rate target to be about 24%, that\u2019s on the high end of our previous estimate of 23% to 24%. Now, back to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thank you, Rob. Let me sum up by saying, we\u2019re pleased with our strong first half performance as we continue to execute well on a generally favorable environment. We\u2019ve raised our sales and EBITDA targets for the full year and remain prudent with our updated outlook. We are well-positioned with our raw potato supply to deliver our volume target and support customers growth and we remain focused on reinvesting in our business to drive long-term growth, return capital to shareholders, and create value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank you for your interest in Lamb Weston, and we\u2019re now happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question and that is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Good morning everybody and Happy New Year. Tom Werner : Happy New Year Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Two questions if I could. Tom, I guess, first as you mentioned through fiscal 1H Lamb Weston sale was running close to 10% or so, even excluding the benefit of the holiday timing, to get to the high end of mid-single digit for the full year suggest some sales growth in the back half of something like low-single digits maybe 2% or so? And I realize that you and Rob went through some of the factors that drove sales growth to be above your expectations through the first half, but I guess \u2013 what I guess would drive this sort of pretty significant deceleration, particularly with favorable restaurant trend expected to continue? And then I just got a follow-up. Rob McNutt : Hi Andrew, it\u2019s Rob. Again, as consistent we think we're prudent with our outlook. As you say, mid \u2013 at the high-end of the mid-single digits, we may be stretch it out further than you do, and you said 6, and I think you go to somewhere in the 7% range is more where we think that ends up. But again, going through those individual elements there, again, we're anticipating that we\u2019re going to return to more normal growth rates in the back half of the year where we had accelerated growth rates, especially in our international business in the Global segment. Tom Werner : Andrew, this is Tom. I think the other thing, as we've been very consistent with our outlook to be prudent, a couple of things that I\u2019ve alluded to on prior calls, the restaurant traffic trends have been favorable. The Q1 that was up 2% traffic, is up 1% this last quarter, which is significant and that's an area where it's really hard to predict. So, we're being conservative absolutely, but we got work \u2013 that's a trend we're monitoring going forward. And obviously if the trends continue as is, then we could see some upside to this. Andrew Lazar : Got it. That's helpful perspective. Thanks. And then you mentioned the 1% price mix that you saw in the Global segment was primarily driven by multi-year contracts, and I'm curious if given some of the pricing \u2013 some of the incremental pricing that went into place more recently would \u2013 in Global, I guess, would your expectation be that price mix there accelerates a bit sequentially as we go into the back half of the fiscal year, or do I have that wrong? Tom Werner : Yes. So, just to reset, Andrew, our global contracting ended up where we projected it to end up and there was pluses and minuses, net-net as we plan this fiscal year based on what we thought the environment would allow us to price it kind of ended up, where we thought. So, what you're seeing in Global relative to the pricing that we got through during the contract negotiations, it's going to be pretty stable for the balance of the year and I would say, remember when we have international volume growth like we have, it's been \u2013 again ahead of where we projected. The pricing in those international markets are different than our pricing in our North American markets. So, you get a dilutive pricing factor in that. Andrew Lazar : Yeah. Got it. Okay, very helpful. Thank you so much. Tom Werner : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. We will go and take our next question. And that is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning and Happy New Year everyone. Tom Werner : Happy New Year Adam. Adam Samuelson : I guess I was hoping maybe [indiscernible] the discussion on the global business a little bit and if you could contrast a little bit some of the growth rates in your export business as North America relative to domestic, I mean the volume growth [indiscernible] put up, I mean, again, well in excess of the 1% traffic growth for QSRs that you just cited? I'm just trying to get a sense of, kind of, maybe geographies that are contributing. If you think the U.S. is gaining share from other export regions? Just any additional color there would be helpful. Tom Werner : I'm not going to get into specific market growth rates. We don't \u2013 haven't typically talked about that, but what I will tell you and just reiterate is, the international markets at least this last quarter have grown above historical averages. And that's true for North America as well. So, you know, as we think about the go forward, again, we're being prudent in our outlook. And we've got a strong first half of growth across the international and North American markets in the Global Business Unit, and we'll see how it all plays out in the next several quarters, but it's just been strong demand quite frankly. Rob McNutt : Yeah, Adam, this is Rob. The other thing I'd say related to that, Tom mentioned it in his comments that that \u2013 while the traffic maybe 1%, our weighting of customers in North America maybe a little stronger and that we\u2019re weighted to the chicken side, maybe heavily, more heavily than the market and that's where they had outsized growth. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That color is very helpful. And then just as we think about the impact of some of the raw potato shortages in different parts of North America, how \u2013 just tell us, not just the fiscal 2020 per se, but all of calendar 2020. Help me think through kind of how you think the market will absorb that or handle that? And if there were pricing and mix opportunities that would emerge, is that something that would happen in the May quarter, is it more of \u2013 do you think there is more pressure in August before you get to the next harvest, if you can lay out the calendar a little bit, just how some of those raw potato issues could have could affect the marketplace and how some opportunities may present themselves? Tom Werner : Yeah, I think it's \u2013 my experience with situations like this is, you got to \u2013 you have to be patient and we'll see how this all plays out in the spring, quite frankly. And there are several things that the industry can do to augment potato supply whether it's harvest early, plant more acres, there\u2019s a number of different things. So, it's really, Adam, a little bit early to speculate on what's going to happen. We have an idea, but we have to \u2013 the most important thing for us is, we are well-positioned with the raw potatoes that we\u2019ve secured, we got ahead of it. So, we're going to take care of all of our customers' needs. We will opportunistically evaluate opportunities that may come our way, but our focus is to execute against our customers and the plans that they have and drive their growth. That's it. And you know, if there\u2019s things that come our way, we'll evaluate it as they happen. Adam Samuelson : Okay. I appreciate all the color. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question. And that is from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : Thanks, good morning and Happy New Year. You gave a lot of helpful color on the potato crop in North America, I hope you could maybe provide a bit of quantification on your annual outlook for potato and non-potato costs, and also, how you see COGS inflation in the second half of the year relative to what seemed to be low-single digit inflation in the first half? Rob McNutt : Yeah, Tom, this is Rob. In terms of our inflation. Again, as we've talked about before, we contract the vast majority, I mean, in the high 90s of our needs for the year. And as Tom mentioned in his remarks, before things started to run up, our guys did a great job of getting ahead of it and contracting for the remainder of the potatoes that we needed a small amount additional that we needed. And so, we're still targeting our COGS inflation to be really in-line with what it's been in the first half of the year. And so those kind of low-single-digit inflation. Tom Palmer : Okay, great, thanks for the color there. And then I just wanted to clarify something, you've mentioned a few times opportunities that may come your way on the price mix side. I just wanted to clarify, this is more related to potentially seeing a migration of customers who might not be able to get the volumes that they might typically procure from others or are you also considering maybe a regularly-timed list price increase? Rob McNutt : It's more of the first, I would say, but again like I said earlier, we'll see how that all plays out. I've seen instances when we had situations like this with the raw in other areas of the world where everybody just managed through it. So, we just again have to be patient execute against what our plans are to take care of our customer needs and if there is customers that come to us, that are \u2013 want us to provide product and we'll evaluate that. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning and Happy New Year, as well. Rob McNutt : Good morning, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi. I just had a question for you. First on comment you made about capacity utilization, and we're seeing this really strong volume growth, and I just want to understand how limiting this could be to your volume growth going forward perhaps around LTOs. And then given the time it takes to build capacity, I know you're always thinking about that, but I'm just trying to understand where we are in that thought process, because we see more capacity, and the need for more capacity coming more quickly. Tom Werner : Yeah, Chris this is Tom. A couple of things. As I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we're aggressively evaluating capacity addition in our current footprint inside and outside North America. That's number one. And the second thing is, our supply chain team has full core press on operating efficiency and projects on unlocking capacity in our footprint today. So, in terms of where we're at, I feel good about the near future if you will, on our ability to unlock capacity and drive efficiencies to support volume growth on a normalized level, but again to your point, what you're pushing at is, you know, we're evaluating additional capacity in our network and that's just a function of the overall category growth that we continue to see. Chris Growe : Sounds like a good place to be in. I got that. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-on and perhaps it relates to the strong volume growth in the quarter, but you had a much stronger gross margin performance this quarter and pricing was just a touch below what I thought, but it sounds like that would more than compensate for the cost inflation, so was it just the volume growth and the efficiencies in the quarter that allowed for the stronger gross margin performance? Rob McNutt : Yeah. Chris, this is Rob. We did have good gross margin performance and spot on. I mean, we had good pricing, especially in the Foodservice as you see, but really good cost control. I would say. And recall in Q1, we had some headwinds that we talked about in terms of operating inefficiencies and the plants not running particularly well. And so, a lot of that\u2019s cleaned up and we operated better. We're still not all the way to bright through Q2, but a lot closer and so we cleaned up a lot of that, and so input cost inflation was managed well and then the operating level of the plants was a lot better. Chris Growe : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Rebecca Scheuneman : Good morning and Happy New Year. So, I just, you know I'm really impressed with this volume growth in your Global segment, and I'm \u2013 you did mention that part of that was driven by some benefits to the chicken segment, I'm wondering also, if given your relative favorable sourcing of raw potatoes in your regions, how the quality \u2013 your experiences is better than some of your competitors [out there], if there's also some share gains possibly that is driving some of the strength? Tom Werner : Yes, this is Tom. In terms of quality, kind of your first question, the industry is kind of on an even playing field. There is areas that are better. There is areas that are worse in terms of raw potatoes. So, I wouldn't attribute the volume growth, any raw quality advantages. It's all about getting ourselves positioned over the crop year to ensure that we have the raw potatoes available for our customers\u2019 growth, and I've talked about this on this call at [indiscernible] but we're in a great position. So, it's not about the raw potatoes, it's about traffic and it's about the markets \u2013 in our global markets across the globe, the demand was just better than we expected and so it's really about what I talked about previously, we've had Q1, we had good traffic; Q2, we've seen an increase in traffic year-over-year. You know, so if that continues, then we're in a great position to support that. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay, great, thank you for clarifying that. And the second question I have is just, is it safe to assume that the negative hit in Q3 from the timing of Thanksgiving is also going to be about 1%? Tom Werner : Yeah. I went through those details earlier. You can follow up with Dexter again to reiterate that. Rebecca Scheuneman : Yeah, that's fine. Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Bryan Hunt with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Bryan Hunt : Thank you. My first question and I'm sorry if I'm beating on the subject, but if you look at your global sales, they accelerated sequentially and even backing out the adjustment for the calendar, as well as the acquisitions you saw acceleration and that's with a declining trend in restaurant traffic, so based on the previous comments you saw QSR traffic up 2 , and then up 1, but yet your sequential growth accelerated. So, I was wondering if you could dive into that, were there any contract wins, do you see some incremental initial benefits of the shortages in parts of the world where you all took share? Again, it's a very important topic and I was just wondering if you could dig into it a little bit more for us? Rob McNutt : Yeah, Brian, this is Rob. Again, as I talked about in prepared remarks that we did have good growth in the international side of our global business and then, and then good QSR growth here domestically. And then as we talked about our waiting in QSRs maybe some customers that had a little stronger growth rates. And so, I think that that contributes a lot of it and then as we look forward, again went through the comps and where we had some good LTO performance last year in the third quarter that we may not see this year in the third quarter. Bryan Hunt : So, I guess, basically there is no reason for us to believe that there is a level of permanence that you all will grow above the industry overall. Rob McNutt : Nothing that we\u2019ve reflected to you know. Bryan Hunt : My next question is, and thank you for the incremental color. The next question is, you all mentioned historically looking at capital allocation your target leverage is 3.5 times to 4 times, you're running at 2.6, based on your comments and you will generate significant free cash flow based on our projections over and above your incremental dividend and your maybe $40 million with share repurchase. So, basically, you all have to do something meaningful to get back within that 3.5 times to 4 times bandwidth, so do you all feel like you adjust your financial targets down to something lower in terms of leverage and if that's the case, do you feel like that makes you an investment grade company instead of a high yield company? Tom Werner : Yes. So, it's Tom. You know, consistent with what we've talked about in the past. Since we've been public, we have three priorities. First one is, we're going to continue to invest in this business and that means adding capacity and that costs $350 million to $400 million when we decide to pull that trigger.  Second, we are going to actively pursue M&A. And third, we return capital to shareholders. And so, I'm comfortable with where our leverage is. I think our investment rating right now gives us the opportunity to pursue potential M&A as we have in the past. Now, branded they've been a small bolt on acquisitions, but I want to make sure I've got plenty balance sheet capacity to do a potential big deal that comes around.  So, I feel good about where our leverage is and it gives us, you know with our cash flow we're returning shareholder \u2013 we were returning capital to shareholders with a dividend increase that we just recently announced and our share buyback program. And I want to have some balance sheet available in order to pursue opportunities in the marketplace. Bryan Hunt : Yeah, I guess the only thing, you know based on our math would get you back into that 3.5 to 4 churns of leverage would be a sizable acquisition, is there anything on the horizon, or is there anything out there available for sale that is sizable in your opinion at this moment? Rob McNutt : Well, I'm not going to get into specifics. What I will tell you is, we're as active as we can be in the market. Bryan Hunt : Very good, I'll hand it off to others and Happy New Year and I appreciate your time. Rob McNutt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Carla Casella : Hi. On the CapEx side, I had a question. The 300 million CapEx, can you just remind us, how much of your CapEx is maintenance and do you have a sense for any other major projects beyond 2020 that we should be considering in our kind of go forward CapEx? Rob McNutt : Yeah Carla this is Rob. The maintenance level of CapEx we've talked about in the past has been in the 115 to 125 range, somewhere in that 120-ish range and really, the only thing that you may think to \u2013 think about is, Tom\u2019s comment in the not too distant future. We're going to have to add some capacity. And so, think about it in those terms and we've talked about that in the past. Carla Casella : Okay, great. And then on the Thanksgiving timing shift, you mentioned it added about a point of growth this quarter, did you \u2013 I don't think I heard you, did you quantify how much you expect that to take some growth in the next quarter? Dexter Congbalay : Yeah. Hi, it's Dexter, Carla. It's not the same, it's a pull-forward. That's all. Carla Casella : Okay, great, thanks. Dexter Congbalay : [Indiscernible] your last question. So, this is Dexter, if anybody who wants to have a follow-up conversation just email me and we\u2019ll set up a time. Other than that, Happy New Year to everyone and have a good weekend. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. All participants may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's third quarter 2020 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially and due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with, our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our priorities for managing through COVID-19 pandemic crisis as well some thoughts on the near term demand environment. Rob will then provide some details on our third quarter results, financial liquidity and capital structure. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call today. We're clearly in a time of considerable uncertainty as it relates to the scope and speed of the COVID pandemic, and the impact on the global economy, our industry and each of our lives. We'll do our best to answer your questions relating to consumer demand and our response to the crisis, but please recognize that much is still unknown. As a consequence of this uncertainty, we've withdrawn our financial outlook, despite only two months remaining in our fiscal fourth quarter. At this time, it's extremely difficult to reasonably forecast customer and consumer demand in North America and our key international markets. In a few minutes, Rob will provide details on our performance for the third quarter. But let me start by sharing with you our priorities as it relates to our Lamb Weston team, our operations and our customers. First, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team. I'm proud of how we're managing through this adversity including all the efforts to protect and support our employees, families, neighbors and local communities meeting our obligation to continue to provide food to help feed people all over the globe, working with our customers, and continuing to support our business, rallying together to care for one another. It's that spirit of teamwork as well as our service-oriented culture that serves as a cornerstone for making Lamb Weston so great. It's paramount to ensure the health, safety and emotional well being of our Lamb Weston team. People must feel safe and comfortable where they work. Since the potential severity of this outbreak became apparent, my management team and I have led a cross functional task force to ensure that we make decisions using the most up-to-date information from the CDC and other authorities. We're leveraging our experience in China where except for a government mandated 10-day extension of the Chinese New Year, we operated through the worst of the outbreak. We've taken steps to enhance sanitation protocols in our production facilities and offices, promote social distancing by having employees work at home when possible, and canceling almost all travel. Second, as a leader in our category, and as I mentioned earlier, we have the obligation to continue to make food and do our part to feed people across the country and around the world. And we take this responsibility seriously. We're confident in our ability to continue to safely produce fries and other frozen potato products. As you can imagine, the demand situation remains fluid so there will undoubtedly be an effect on our operations and supply chain. We're watching consumer and customer demand and have begun to adapt our production schedules to react accordingly. As appropriate, we'll take further actions to align our manufacturing operations including temporarily reducing production. Third, we and our joint venture partners are committed to remaining a trust in the value business partner for our customers as they all managed through supply chain and inventory concerns. Several large QSR chain customers have already indicated to us that fries are a priority item. We and our customers will not likely be able to forecast consumer demand trends given the breadth of the pandemic and the pace under which it continues to unfold. However, while good data on the pandemic effect on restaurant traffic, consumer buying patterns, and French fry demand is limited we can provide some insight into what we've seen so far in some of our markets in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. In China, after the government placed severe social and movement restrictions that significantly reduced restaurant traffic French fries demand declined about 50% for about a month. As restrictions have relaxed we've seen volume climb back to about 70% of pre-crisis demand today. Our team there has responded well and continues to manage through the impact of the virus. We're adopting lessons learned from them to our operations around the world. In other key markets in Asia such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, we've seen only a modest impact on French fry demand. While our sales in these markets mirror these trends, we're continuing to closely monitor the situation for additional evidence of consumer reaction and fry demand. In the U.S., it's still too early to determine how the impact on demand will play out. Normally, about 65% of all fries are purchased at a quick serve restaurant with another 20% purchased at a full serve restaurant. The remaining 15% is purchased at retail. Our sales breakdown is broadly consistent with that split of our global segment, which accounts for about 52% of our total sales primarily serves large QSR chain customers in the U.S. and internationally, largely including Asia, Australia and Mexico. Our food service segment which is about 30% of the sales, primarily sales to range of food service operations. We estimate that close to 80% of the segment sales are to full service restaurant and outlets such as workplace cafeterias, hotels, hospitals and schools, with more than 20% to smaller QSRs. Our retail segment historically accounts for about 13% of our sales. Of the fries purchased at a QSR normally about two-thirds have been purchased via drive through carry out or delivery, with the remaining third consumed on-premises. Prior to the adoption of more severe social and movement restrictions, we saw a little change in orders and shipments to QSRs as increases in drive through traffic as well as higher delivery orders cushion much of the decline in on-premise dining. However, with the adoption of more severe restrictions across more states, we're seeing orders beginning to slow. If the China experience provides an appropriate guide, then we would expect QSR volumes to begin to recover at a faster rate, and for full service restaurants after the more severe restrictions are relaxed. Traffic at full service restaurants and operations in the U.S. is expected to be down much more sharply than the QSRs. While many of these operators are taking steps to boost takeout and delivery sales we expect this will make up only a fraction of lost business. So our sales to these types of customers are more at risk. In contrast, retail demand for frozen fries has significantly increased as food at home consumption rises with the adoption of social distancing policies and family stocking their freezers. We've taken steps to boost production of our retail products in order to meet the increased demand. So the bottom-line is that in the U.S. QSRs that have established drive through takeout and delivery capabilities are in a much better position in the current environment than full service restaurants and other outlets that largely cater to dine in traffic. Retail will likely benefit in the near term with more meals prepared at home and pantry loading. In Europe, which is served through our Lamb Weston Meijer joint venture although a high proportion of our sales are to QSRs, fry purchasing patterns are much different than in the U.S. Most of the consumption is dine-in or takeaway via walk-in traffic, since drive through options are much more limited. The impact of the virus on-demand so far has been most pronounced in Italy after it adopted severe social movement restrictions. Other European nations have since adopted similar restrictions. So we expect the decline in demand to accelerate in those countries as well, which will further negatively impact Lamb Wesson Meijer's results. Before turning the call over to Rob, I will just talk about our financial liquidity and capital allocation. We have a strong balance sheet and have sufficient liquidity to weather this crisis even if it results in a prolonged downturn in demand. Last week in an abundance of caution, we fully drew down our existing $500 million revolver in order to provide additional financial flexibility in light of the market uncertainty. As you have seen a couple of weeks ago, we declared our regular quarterly dividend. However, we temporarily suspended our modest share repurchase program. Finally, we'll take the necessary actions to manage our cost structure, working capital and capital expenditures. This means deferring capital when possible, including postponing all non-critical projects. Let me close by saying that these are extraordinary times; nothing about confronting this pandemic will be easy. But Lamb Weston is well positioned in terms of our business mix, operating flexibility cost structure and liquidity position to weather the storm. Our entire team is committed to stepping up and doing our part to keep feeding people, support our communities and be a valued stable business partner for our customers. We're taking the necessary actions in our operations to navigate through this crisis by working in close partnership with customers and suppliers across the globe. Now, let me turn the call over to Rob. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As you've seen in our earnings release, our reported performance in third quarter was mixed. However, it's important to note that through February, which was before the pandemic raced across the globe, we were on track to deliver the financial targets that we outlined on January 3, 2020. We provided a more detailed description of our third quarter results in our earnings release, and in the 10Q which we will file later today. Here is some brief highlights. Net sales increased 1% due to a 1% increase in price mix, volume was flat as growth in food service segment was partially offset by a decline in our global segments reported volume. While volume growth of non-customized or limited time offering products in our global segment was strong. It was more than offset by timing of sales of customized and higher margin limited time offering products, as well as the initial effects of the pandemic on restaurant traffic in China. In addition, acquisitions contributed more than one point of volume growth, but this was largely offset by one point decline due to pure shipping days in the quarter related to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. Gross Profit declined $23 million or 8% primarily due to input and fixed cost inflation. Edible oils drove most of the input cost inflation, while higher insurance rates and medical expenses drove most of the increase in fixed costs. In addition, unrealized gains on commodity hedging contracts was a $4 million headwind, largely as a result of a $4 million gain that we realized in the prior year quarter. SG&A expense increased about $8 million and included 2 million of non-recurring consulting expenses associated with developing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system. Through the first nine months, we realized about 6 million in one time ERP related costs and expect to spend around 10 million for the year. Regarding our ERP project we're slowing it down a bit to manage both costs and risks in light of the challenging operating environment at hand. Equity method earnings excluding comparability items declined about $2 million. But this was due to a negative $6 million change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, equity earnings increased about 4.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures declined $26 million, or 10% to 228 million, lower sales and gross profit in our base business, which again largely reflected the timing of sales in our global segment and cost inflation, as well as higher SG&A drove the decline. Adjusted diluted EPS declined to $0.18 or 19% to $0.77 due largely to lower sales and operating profits as well as lower equity method earnings. Moving to our segments, our food service and retail businesses reported in line with our expectations and you can find the details in our earnings release and 10-Q. But let me touch quickly on our global segment given the headline performance this quarter. Global reported sales were down 2%, including a 1% decline in both volume and price mix. Volume was down primarily because we lapped a very strong growth of customized and limited time product offering products in the prior year quarter. This created about a 7 percentage point volume headwind. The Coronavirus related impact on restaurant traffic in China accounted for an additional 2 points of the volume drop. For the timing of Thanksgiving was another 1 point. These declines were nearly offset by a 6 point increase in shipments of non-limited time offering products, as well as a 2 point benefit from acquisitions. So after taking into account the timing of sales, the pandemics impact on restaurant traffic benefit from acquisitions. Global's volume in the third quarter was largely in line with the growth that we delivered in the first half of the year. Global's price mix declined 1% as pricing actions were more than offset by unfavorable mix. This was due to lower amount of customized and limited time offering products sold versus a strong sales of these kinds of products in the prior year quarter, as well as higher proportion of sales to international customers. Global's product contribution margin which is gross profit, less advertising promotional expense decreased $20 million or 15%. The factors driving the decline in segments profitability primarily lower volume and higher manufacturing costs are consistent with what drove our total company's gross profit. Moving to our cash flow liquidity position and balance sheet, we generated about $435 million of cash from operations year-to-date. That's down about 2% versus last year due to increased working capital requirements to support our growth. We've also invested more than $150 million in capital expenditures and IT related projects year-to-date. For fiscal 2020, we've reduced our CapEx target by $100 million to $200 million as we seek near term opportunities to preserve liquidity. Through the first nine months, we bought back about $23 million of stock and paid 88 million in dividends to our shareholders. As Tom mentioned, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to weather the current operating environment even if there's a prolonged decline in demand. This includes having more than $500 million of cash on hand after drawing down our revolver last week. We have a strong balance sheet with about $2.2 billion of total debt at the end of the quarter. Our maturity profile is also attractive. We have an approximately $280 million balance on a term loan facility that matures in November of 2021 and are approximately $290 million balance on another facility that matures in June 2024. The mandatory annual amortization on these two loans is about 30 million combined. In addition, we have two $833 million high yield notes that mature in 2024 and 2026, respectively. We're also in good shape with respect to our financial covenants. Our first covenant is to maintain debt to EBITDA including joint ventures, leverage ratio of less than 4.5x. At the end of the third quarter, we were at 2.4x. Our second covenant is an EBITDA including joint ventures to interest expense ratio of at least 2.75x. At the end of the quarter, we were at nearly 9x. Now, here's Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thank you, Rob. These are difficult times for all of us. And we don't know how long these times will last. But we faced challenges before and we will always come out stronger on the other side. I hope we were able to provide you with some insight on our priorities and our ability to manage through this crisis. We don't have all the answers, but I'm confident that our entire team will focus on doing our part to keep feeding people around the world. We're closely working with our customers and our suppliers as we continue to navigate through this environment. And because of that Lamb Weston will continue to be a strong and valid business partner. Thank you for joining us today. Now we're ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good morning everyone Hope everyone is staying healthy on your end. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi, there. For Tom, Lamb Weston obviously come through, by all measures a pretty fantastic, a couple of years certainly from an industry supply/demand perspective, almost utopic in certain ways. And I realized there's really not any precedent for this and much is still very fluid but just as you think about this generally and thinking forward, with industry capacity having come online this year and obviously that was proved not really be an issue given how strong demand was, but with now maybe weakening of demand for some period of time, I guess, how would you -- at this stage see current events sort of impacting this -- what's been this really fantastic sort of supply demand balance, maybe closer in and then, over a longer term period of time. Tom Werner : Yes. Andrew, it's all about the demand curve right now. And obviously, it's a fluid situation, as I indicated in my remarks, and the most important thing is to, that our customers are talking about is a assured supply. And that's what we're focused on. The situation is fluid. How the demand curve continues and where it flattens out, it's difficult to forecast right now. So, the most important thing is, what I alluded to in my remarks is, continue to make food products and feed people. And, the indication that I talked -- that I'll talk about is the fact that I do know is, what we're seeing in China. So, we had a downturn, we got through the worst of the crisis over there, at least as we know it today production went down 50% it's running about 70% demand. So I'd like to think about the market is all about assured supply, keeping our people safe, producing food safely, all those things. And, it's going to take time to see how all this all plays out. Andrew Lazar : Understood. Thank you for that. And then just a quick follow up, you've got some very large scale facilities in the manufacturing side and are there certain actions that you can take kind of in the near term when demand slows and sort of the volume leverage becomes -- the fixed cost absorption becomes less significant. Are there things that you can change in the sort of the fixed cost base or really near term should we expect like the detrimental margin, just given the lack of the kind of volume leverage you used to have like an outsized impact on profitability, trying to get a sense for that, if at all possible. Thanks so much. Tom Werner : Yes. Andrew, as you can imagine, we're looking at a lot of different scenarios in the production plan, based on how things are changing every week. So, I will assure you that as we think through slowing production down, we're taking all the actions necessary. To take cost out where we can and but at the same time, we've got to support our employees that are coming to facilities every single day. But certainly everything is in play and we're reacting in real-time. I am super proud of our supply chain team and what they've done and how they reacted to this. And, we've taken a lot of steps to ensure that not only are we providing our customers with products, but we're keeping our employees as safe as possible in this environment. Andrew Lazar : Thanks very much and stay well everybody. Tom Werner : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : So a couple of questions. The first one, maybe a follow up to Andrew and this is one that we've fielded a few times in recent weeks. So it's really simple question, if you needed to turn a plant off, is there anything that would stop you from being able to do that? I think there's a perception that your plants are kind of like glass furnaces that just have to be continuously run. So just want to make sure that's the right perception or if you needed to shut down or shutter a plant is that complicated to do it? Rob McNutt : Yes. This is Rob. If you think about, it is food processing facilities. And we very regularly take the lines down for normal sanitation just as part of producing food. And so, every couple of weeks, we take a line down. We'll take each of our lines down just to make sure that we're continuing to keep the lines food safe. And so, as you think about this across the globe we've got 20 some odd French fry manufacturing plants. And so those are each individual units and within those units, there are lines and those lines go down regularly. And so in contrast to that perception that it's like a glass furnace that's continuous, yes, they're continuous when they're operating, but we regularly take them down, so that's just part of our process. Bryan Spillane : All right. Thanks. And then the second related to the change in capital spending guidance for this year, how far can you stretch that? I guess I'm trying to -- just get a sense for if you're deferring something today, are there some CapEx needs that are required, whether it's maintenance CapEx or whatever it would be that you can only defer six months or a year, just how much flexibility, I guess, you have on capital spending over, let's say 12 months or 18 months? Rob McNutt : Yes. This is Rob again. The -- on CapEx, our base level of capital kind of keep the wheels on, capital is around $125 million a year for the Lamb Weston consolidated business. So, we think we can operate at that level for some period of time and maintain the productivity of the plants. Now, that doesn't include anything that's going to enhance productivity or improve our cost structure necessarily, that's just maintaining. So, but that's our base level of capital. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then last one for me. Just -- there always been a lot of focus around your sort of relationships and negotiations with your customers and there always been a lot of focus on pricing. But, I guess, given this current situation and how fluid or uncertain demand will be, how much flexibility can you provide for your customers in terms of being able to offer them ranges and outcomes on volume? And is that maybe more valuable in discussions you're having with customers today than just purely price? Tom Werner : Well, Bryan, it's Tom. It's all about demand right now and understanding what the demand curve is and it's about ensuring that our customers were meeting those needs. So it's -- that's the focus right now versus the pricing discussion. So it's assured supply and that's what everybody is focused on right now. Bryan Spillane : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Tom Werner : Good morning, Chris. Chris Growe : I hope you guys are well. I want to ask first of all on the supply chain and a bit to Bryan's question, but temporarily reducing production, I understand in this environment, I guess, I want to understand if you frame that for what you expect to do in the coming quarter or so or a couple of quarters? And then I'm curious also how you accommodate an input that spoils. So is it you have to produce these products and put it in freezers? Is that an incremental cost for you or how do you accommodate that in this environment? Rob McNutt : Yes, Chris, this is Rob. The -- you're right. We have the raw. The raw over time will spoil. We can stretch it out some, can't stretch it out forever. And so you -- so we have the ability to manage that to some degree to meet demand to try and optimize that cost versus the degradation of the raw get past September, and it's really tough for us to run raw from the prior year. But we can stretch it out a bit and so that's exactly the math that we're doing to try and optimize that given what we're seeing in demand. Chris Growe : Okay. And then just one other question, which is we knew this quarter had a tough comp for LTOs and customized products. I guess, I'm trying to understand, does that become an ongoing concern, say, Q4, where I would not have expected that based on the comps, but is that something your customers are doing there, are they foregoing those opportunities, and therefore you have more of a risk in future quarters around this mix factor from LTOs and customizable products? Rob McNutt : Let me start, there are two components to that. One is LTOs, which there's always some level of volatility depending on what customers want to promote and how to promote it, the other is these customized products. And so for a number of our large chain customers in particular, which report in the Global Business Unit, there are very customized products for those customers. And the way -- and we started reporting under the new revenue recognition standard in first quarter of 2019. And under that standard, we recognized the revenue for those customized products when we manufacture it and have a purchase order in hand from those customers as opposed to traditionally the way I learned it 30 years ago when the product ships and title changes. And so there's some volatility in when we receive purchase orders on those things. And so we have some large customers and if we don't have timely receipt of purchase order, we don't recognize that revenue. And so that's what happened between global if you look at Q2 to Q3. Q2 wasn't really as good in underlying shipments as what it reflected and -- or was reported in Q3 wasn't as bad in underlying shipments. And, so I think, so I want to take that revenue recognition piece out of that. In terms of LTOs, interestingly, some of our customers in China are really looking at LTOs and trying to determine when is the right time to launch those to get customer traffic back. And so think about LTOs as a customer traffic incentive and that's how they use it and so that's what we're gearing up for now. So, I don't think there's anything that would say that customers are or aren't going to use LTOs in the future, in fact, I think, if anything, I think they're going to only going to be used as we indicated in China to leverage people back into the stores. Tom Werner : Yes, Chris, this is Tom. I think that's right what Rob said in China, but the other thing as I stated in my prepared remarks, right now in the environment in the near-term, some of our customers are talking about menu simplification. So, the near-term, it's about making sure fries are on the menu, their base fry item, and some of the promotional items, we're going to be pushed out for a while. Chris Growe : Okay. That was very good color. Thank you for that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : I guess, first, Tom, I was hoping to just maybe taking a little bit on the U.S. trends and the framework that you gave on China and the experience you've had there over the last couple of months is very helpful. And appreciate that this is very dynamic and seemingly changing day by day. But any -- do you guys have any visibility in terms of regional trends in the U.S. for some of the states and jurisdictions where some of these short-term [Technical Difficulty] versus other jurisdictions where they're not in place or only recently put in place and kind of the -- do you see some of the -- your U.S. markets following that pattern and any quantification of that, if you could? Tom Werner : Yes, Adam, as you can appreciate, this is a very fluid situation and I'm not going to get into specific regional areas of our country. What I will tell you is, we've got a team that's analyzing daily order patterns across the regions. I can't get into specifics because it's -- a lot of it would be speculative going forward because it does change, but we're monitoring it certainly as more restrictions on the social distancing are more pronounced, that's going to impact demand. So what I will say is, we're watching it closely and we're monitoring it every day. We're watching our order patterns and this is a fluid situation and you can understand that. I'm not going to put out any kind of, hey, here's this number, that number in any of these regions because it changes every single day right now, but we've got a team all over it and we're reacting to what we're seeing every day and that's what we're doing to manage this business going forward. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's very helpful. And then the second question for me is in -- is on Europe and the joint venture, and it's probably maybe more Rob's. Any framing of where especially your customers -- while the QSR customers are just completely shut and they don't have that drive-thru as a demand outlet. Just framing the balance sheet liquidity position of the joint venture where tools available to manage that and just thinking about kind of obviously your commitment to the joint venture and any cash needs that, that business might have if the demand declines are more severe? Rob McNutt : Yes. In terms of liquidity and balance sheet position of the joint venture, the joint venture is in good shape in terms of both its balance sheet covenant compliance and in terms of liquidity. They have their own standalone revolving credit line access and the sensitivities we've run there similar to what we've run here even in a prolonged downturn in demand that they appear to have sufficient liquidity to weather the storm here. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That color is very helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : Good morning, and thank you for the question. Tom Werner : Good morning, Tom. Tom Palmer : First, just wanted to ask on the COGS basket, get an idea of fixed versus variable costs in terms of mix, both as we look on a near-term time horizon, and then maybe if you could help with what portion of those fixed costs maybe you could spot over a several week or so period if needed? Rob McNutt : Sure, Tom, this is Rob. In terms of fixed variable, we've talked about before that about 70% of our manufacturing costs are variable costs, on a COGS basis, 30% fixed, so that includes depreciation and you run the math there. The components that are included in fixed, repairs and maintenance sits in fixed is a big component of that fixed cost and as well as labor and then warehousing, but the -- clearly on maintenance, if you've got a line down, you're encouraging the folks to not go in with big maintenance crew and do a lot of work. And so those are the kinds of things that you actually have pretty good control over, that makes sense. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thanks for that detail. And then also wanted to clarify some of the mix factors in the Global segment. I think you detailed the sales shortfall mainly came from international, especially, China, but then you also called out negative mix from international markets as a margin headwind, which would seem to suggest they grew as a percentage of segment sales. So maybe just reconcile that, and, I mean, were U.S. volumes also down in this segment or is that more going to be in the fourth quarter that you see U.S. volumes dip? Thanks. Rob McNutt : Yes, I think that -- if you look at again that reported top-line that revenue recognition issue that I talked about is a significant piece of that. And then if you look at actual shipments, the international markets tend to have a lower margin on average than our U.S. markets just simply as a result of market structure and then additional freight cost and so forth. Tom Palmer : So just to clarify, U.S. volumes were up during the third quarter? Rob McNutt : We don't split it out that way publicly, but I will tell you that the revenue recognition issue was largely a U.S. issue. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thank you so much. So, look I mean, obviously right now you're watching demand very closely as you say, which is the given. I'm -- frankly a bit new to Lamb -- to the Lamb Weston company and how the harvest works and demand contracts what have you. So, I'm just curious like as you would -- seems like normally you set those contracts now right with the farmers to figure out -- and then which are based upon that potential go-forward demand later for the harvest this year in the fall, which would really help supply/demand in calendar '21, which seems kind of impossibility to forecast at this point and how do you work through that now with the farmers given just the fluidity of the situation, if you basically still have the contract with the farmers to secure supply come October, November? Tom Werner : Yes, Rob. I'm not going to comment on that because we're right in the middle of negotiating contract price at this point and other needs. So I'm going to not comment on that and you can respect that till we get through the process. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Yes, no, completely makes sense. Apologies for asking. I mean, I would say though it seems like there obviously are you have to have some type of internal guess, kind of some guess to just kind of work, help you work through whatever those negotiations are, I mean, that's kind of where we are. Is that right? Tom Werner : That's fair. Rob Dickerson : Okay, cool. I get it. Sorry, you're in that circumstance. And then I guess, just very simplistically when do we normally get kind of a read, an early read on the health of the harvest that would come in this year and that's, I think that's around May. Is that right, May, June? Tom Werner : No, we usually have a good idea. And what we do and we'll continue to do it is, we'll have an early read in July and we'll provide full color on how we're seeing the crop in October. Rob Dickerson : Okay, okay, fair. And then just lastly, just in terms of overall labor situation, I mean, obviously, I think every company is probably dealing with the same thing. But for now at least you feel comfortable with your supply chain, right, ability of workers to get to the plants. So it's more of a demand forecasting variable moving forward relative to anything on the labor side and that's it? Thank you so much. Tom Werner : Yes, Rob, it's all about demand forecasting. We've got obviously our protocols in place in terms of reacting to the COVID situation in our plants. And we're taking necessary actions to adjust our production scheduling as I mentioned earlier and we'll continue to do that. And I'm committed to continue to support our employees as they come in the plants every day and produce food to feed people in the U.S. and around the globe. So, it's a fluid situation. It's emotional. The most important thing is to do everything we can for the health and well-being of our employees and that's the focus. Rob Dickerson : Sounds great. Really, thank you so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Carla Casella : Hi. I'm just wondering, so on the Foodservice and Retail on the production side, how many of your plants are doing both Foodservice and Retail and how easy is it to switch lines from one line of production to the other? Tom Werner : I'm not going to give you -- we don't break out specifics on which plant produces what. There are -- what we've done is, we've been able to convert some of our quote Foodservice lines to Retail to meet that demand where we can, not all lines are created equal. So it's a matter of how these lines are configured and, but I will tell you what we've done everywhere possible is to shift that production from Foodservice to Retail and ensure that as we look at the demand curve across our product line, we're adjusting where we can. And the teams done a -- the supply chain team has done a terrific job converting at light speed to adapt to the environment that we're operating in. And so what I will tell you, I'm not going to tell you specifics, but we're doing everything we can to convert lines where we can. Carla Casella : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our last question from Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar. Rebecca Scheuneman : Yes, good morning. Thank you for the question. Tom Werner : Good morning. Rob McNutt : Good morning. Rebecca Scheuneman : So it can be difficult to get a read for exactly what is happening in China, but there have been some reports of, that new cases of the COVID-19 virus are spiking up again as people are getting back to work and back out in the general population. Are you seeing anything in your demand data to indicate that, that is happening? Tom Werner : This is Tom. I know that the news that's coming out is mixed that's what I know. Factually, what I know in our business and in China is what I stated earlier. When all this happened in January, February, the last two, three weeks, our business fell off about 50%, team worked through it. They did a terrific job. The China team continuing to operate, provide food for people. And now we're seeing traffic patterns to our business about 70% of normalized levels, and with the recent news that you alluded to, it's new news to all of us. So I can't speculate on what our business is going to do, but as I stated earlier, this is a -- this -- we're managing this every day. So we're looking at the data, it's very fluid. We haven't seen any indications based on what you alluded to the new news, the new cases. And so it's really a day to day thing that we're going to continue to monitor, but right now, we haven't seen any change based on the last 24 hours. And so that's -- but again, we're watching this every single day based on what we know. Rebecca Scheuneman : Yes, okay, great. Thank you. And then my next question is a follow-up to the previous question. Several packaged food companies have been reporting surges in demand in the last few weeks of 70% to 80% and specifically in some frozen food categories where you reside. And I was just wondering if you talked about trying to ship some production over to the Retail product. Is it likely that you have enough additional capacity to meet that type of demand in Retail? Tom Werner : What I will say is, what we've done is shift as many lines as we can to Retail based on the demand changes we're experiencing. So, we are doing everything we can to meet the demand, and I'm not going to give you a percentage of what we're seeing in our Retail business, but obviously it's up. And we'll do all we can to help support the Retail demand that we're seeing, and we have changed some of our production lines, where we can again to support the Retail demand surge. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Congbalay, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks everybody for joining the call. I'd be happy to arrange for follow-up calls and conversations. If you would just email me, and we can set up a time. Other than that, hope everybody stays safe. And again thanks for joining the call. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And at this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, VP Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter -- a second okay my screen just went blank pause Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. This morning we issued our earnings press release which is available on our website lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks we will make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are; Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the near-term demand environment as well as our efforts to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Rob will then provide some details on our fourth quarter results, financial liquidity and trends we're seeing so far in the first quarter of fiscal '21. With that let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. Before getting into our performance in the quarter, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for their commitment to support our communities our customers and our consumers during these trying times, while keeping themselves and their colleagues safe. We should be proud of doing our part to help feed people around the world. It's their commitment and spirit of teamwork that makes me so honored to be part of this great company. Now let me turn to the performance. The final months of fiscal 2020 were some of the most challenging in Lamb Weston's history. After starting to realize the impact of government efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus in China on our local operations in February, we saw a more severe effect on our overall business beginning in late March as governments in the U.S. and Europe took actions to try to slow the spread of the virus. These government restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice businesses abruptly and significantly reduced restaurant traffic and the demand for fries. In addition the initial drop in demand was so steep and quick that customers needed to adjust inventory levels which further reduced our shipments. As a result our sales and earnings fell in the fourth quarter. Starting in May, U.S. demand for fries began to recover and that improvement has continued through mid-July. The recovery has been led by quick-service restaurants as consumers leveraged drive-through options. By the end of June, QSR traffic rebounded significantly. As expected, full-service restaurants were affected much more severely than QSRs. They adapted by increasing carryout and delivery options.  And starting in late May, consumer traffic began to increase as certain state governments gradually eased restrictions to allow for more on-premise dining. However, while steadily improving our shipments to this channel currently remain well below prior year levels. Fry demand by our noncommercial customers such as hotels, schools, universities and sporting venues was hit hard as traffic at these outlets suffered. Our shipments to these customers remain very soft and will likely remain so until the pandemic ends and consumer confidence improves. In contrast consumers sharply stepped up food-at-home purchases in the fourth quarter and retail purchases remain a bright spot for the category and for Lamb Weston. Fry demand in Europe which is served through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture has also improved since the end of May. Although a high proportion of our sales are to QSRs most of the consumption is dine-in or takeaway since drive-through options are much more limited. These QSRs act more like full-service restaurants. Like in the U.S. weekly shipments bottomed in April and they have steadily improved since in but currently remain well below pre-COVID levels. Fry demand in our other key international markets has been mixed. China's recovery has been solid with our weekly shipments in July approaching pre-COVID levels. Demand in Asia outside of China has been varied, but consumption overall has held up better than in the U.S. and Europe. Consumption in Latin America including Mexico, held up relatively well in the fourth quarter, but began to soften at the end of May. We have been encouraged by the breadth and the pace of recovery in fry demand. It's been faster than we anticipated when the crisis first arose. However, there's still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the recovery sustainability. For example, recent actions by California and Texas to reimpose restrictions on restaurants and foodservice outlets as well as New York City's decision to postpone lifting restrictions for on-premise dining, illustrate how volatile and fragile the U.S. recovery and demand can be. Because of this uncertainty, we are not providing a financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Instead, Rob will detail later, we're providing trends in our shipments that we have observed so far during our fiscal first quarter. Managing through this crisis has been difficult, and I am proud of how we're executing on a range of priorities and actions to navigate the business in the current environment and position us for success as demand continues to recover. First, we're prioritizing the health and safety of our Lamb Weston team, and have adopted enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols at each of our manufacturing, commercial and support locations. Nonetheless, we've had a number of production employees contract the virus, which has required us to temporarily shut down manufacturing lines to be sanitized. Unfortunately, the possibility of temporarily shutting down lines remains a risk until the virus is under control. We're always seeking ways to improve testing processes that can help us identify affected employees before they show up for work. The safety of our employees has and will continue to be our number one priority. Second, we're working to remain a trusted and valued business partner for our customers, as they manage their supply chains and commercial operations. For example, for our larger chain restaurant customers, we've helped them manage inventory levels in a time of heightened volatility. We've also begun to help customers identify the best fries for delivery and carryout as well as develop limited time offering products that would be available as soon as this fall in the U.S. For independent operators, our direct sales force has been a real asset in allowing us to stay close with customers to identify the appropriate products for simplified menus, creatively broaden our fry offerings and react quickly to customer needs in this volatile market. Third, we're adapting our manufacturing operations to meet the new demand environment. While necessary our actions in the resulting disruption has come at a cost during the quarter. For example, we've incurred incremental costs to redirect certain manufacturing lines to make retail products. We've also adjusted production schedules and run times in an effort to spread production across our network and keep factory employees on payroll. Since the demand environment remains fluid, we'll continue to evaluate further actions to align our manufacturing operations as appropriate. However, meeting customer demand with a workforce that's being affected by the virus creates a difficult scheduling exercise for our manufacturing team, which will continue to make capacity and cost management challenging. Finally, we've significantly enhanced our liquidity position by securing additional debt financing and taking steps to preserve cash. Based on these actions and our ability to generate cash, we feel confident enough about our liquidity that we fully repaid the borrowings under our credit facility in July. In summary, we believe that by executing on these priorities and actions, we're positioned to navigate through an uncertain environment in fiscal 2021 and to emerge as a stronger company once we're on the other side of this virus. Before handing off the call to Rob, let me quickly update you on a couple of items. With respect to this year's potato crop at this point, the crops in our North America growing areas and in Europe are consistent with historical averages. As usual, we'll have more insight on the yield and quality of the crop after the harvest takes place later in the year. With respect to our customer contract negotiations, we're encouraged by how the discussions have been progressing and have already finalized a handful of the global and regional restaurant chain customer contracts. For those remaining contracts, we'll remain disciplined in taking approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships. So, as you can see in the near term, we're taking the necessary actions across our manufacturing, commercial and support teams to navigate the prices, including most importantly prioritizing the health safety and well-being of our employees and partnering with our customers and suppliers across the globe. We're facing an unprecedented challenging and volatile operating environment that will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but we remain confident in our strategies in the long-term health and structure of the category. Let me turn the call over to Rob. Rob McNutt : Thanks Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our fourth quarter results reflect the pandemic's effect on frozen potato demand, as well as the impact on our cost structure as we manage through the crisis and position ourselves for fiscal 2021. While the quarter was highly challenging, we've seen improvements in recent months from the lows we saw in April. We believe that we're well-positioned to manage through the continuing recovery. Specifically in the quarter net sales declined 16% including the benefit of an additional week of sales versus the prior year. Excluding that benefit sales declined 22%. Sales volume was down 17% or 23% excluding the extra week as frozen potato demand at restaurants and other foodservice outlets fell sharply in the last two months of the quarter, following government imposed restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice operations and stay-at-home orders related to the pandemic. The volume decline also reflects inventory destocking by chain restaurant and foodservice customers in April through mid-May as they adjusted to the abrupt drop in near-term demand. Our weekly shipments towards the end of the quarter more closely mirrored consumer demand trends by channel, but we're still down versus the prior year. Specifically our weekly shipments to large chain restaurants in the U.S. were about 50% of pre-COVID levels from late March through early April then improved to around 85% by the end of May as consumers took advantage of QSR drive-throughs. Our weekly shipments to full-service restaurants and non-commercial outlets such as hotels, schools and universities, sporting venues and workplace cafeterias bottomed at about 20% of pre-COVID levels in mid-April then improved to approximately 70% by the end of May as some states began to ease restrictions on restaurants and bars. In contrast, our retail segment's weekly shipments in April through mid-May spiked up around 50% versus prior year as consumers increased food-at-home purchases in response to shelter-in-place orders. Demand remained high as we exited the quarter with weekly shipments growth of about 30%. Price/mix increased 1% for the total company with gains in retail, partially offsetting unfavorable mix in our global and foodservice segments. For the year, sales were up 1% including the benefit of the 53rd week. Excluding that benefit, sales were down 1%. Gross profit in the quarter declined $139 million. This included about $47 million of cost related to the pandemic's impact on our operations. In the quarter, we elected to keep all of our plants open and continue to pay our employees, and therefore, spread reduced demand across the entire system. This led to all of our plants operating at lower rates resulting in labor, energy and materials utilization levels that were well off of our standards. Accordingly this had a significant impact on our margins. Of the $47 million, about $25 million reflects utilization related costs and inefficiencies arising from disruptions to our manufacturing network. These costs and inefficiencies largely consisted of; first, spreading lower volume across our entire manufacturing network there -- including modifying production schedules and reducing run times, thereby, sub-optimizing utilization at each facility; second, costs net of any government credits to retain factory labor, including paying them full weekly wages, although hours worked may have been well below that; third, cost to shutdown, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities after a factory employee had tested positive for the virus; and finally, incremental cost to produce retail products on foodservice oriented production lines. To be clear, we expect to incur utilization related costs and inefficiencies as long as our manufacturing operations are impacted by the pandemic, especially with respect to disruptions arising from shutting down and sanitizing facilities including the cost of shifting production to non-affected locations. The other $22 million of the $47 million consists of non-utilization-related costs, which largely included nearly $14 million of which $10 million in the quarter was non-cash to terminate certain raw potato purchase obligations related to the 2019 crop, nearly $6 million of incremental warehousing transportation and supply chain costs and about $3 million of other costs. We expect over half of these non-utilization-related costs will be non-recurring. While these pandemic-related costs had a pronounced impact on our results for the quarter, the remaining $92 million decline in gross profit largely reflects lower sales volumes as well as higher manufacturing costs due to unfavorable mix, other inefficiencies and input cost inflation. We partially offset the decline in gross profit by a $22 million reduction in SG&A expense, which was largely driven by lower incentive compensation accruals and adopting a broad range of cost mitigation efforts. We also reduced advertising and promotional expense by $5 million, primarily related to our retail segment and suspended contributions to our charitable foundation in order to preserve cash. Partially offsetting these SG&A reductions were $11 million of expenses related to the pandemic, which largely included expenses to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols; expenses net of government credits to retain certain direct sales employees in our foodservice segment so that we're in a better position to drive growth as demand improves; and expensing more than $3 million of capitalized costs associated with manufacturing expansion projects that were shelved for the time being. We expect to incur some of the pandemic-related SG&A expenses going forward, especially for maintaining enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols. Equity method earnings swung to a loss of $6 million down from a positive $15 million last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings declined $25 million of which about $16 million reflects pandemic-related costs and expenses similar to what we incurred in our base business. The remaining $9 million of the decline was largely driven by lower sales primarily in Europe. As Tom mentioned, the pandemic's effect on European fry demand was similar to what we saw for full-service restaurants in the U.S. with Lamb Weston/Meijer ship -- weekly shipments bottoming in April at about 35% of prior year levels and recovering to around 60% by the end of May. Adjusted EBITDA including joint ventures declined $137 million to $78 million, about $74 million of the decline was due to the pandemic-related costs and expenses that I previously discussed, which included $58 million in our base business and $16 million at our unconsolidated joint ventures. The remainder of the EBITDA decline was driven by lower sales, higher manufacturing costs and lower equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted EBITDA including joint ventures was about $800 million, down 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was a loss of $0.01 down from $0.74 last year. For the year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.50 down 22%. Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment which includes the top 100 U.S.-based chains as well as all sales outside of North America were down 18% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 2% largely due to unfavorable customer and product mix, including the impact of lower sales of limited-time offering products. Volume fell 16%. This was due to the sharp drop off in U.S. consumer demand and inventory destocking with weekly shipments to large chain customers as low as 50% of prior year levels in mid-April and rebounding to about 85% by the end of May. International sales were mixed. In China, monthly shipments in March recovered to nearly 70% of pre-COVID monthly run rate and recovered to about 80% in May. Monthly shipments to other markets in Asia, Australia, and Mexico were 70% to 80% of pre-COVID levels through late April, but began to soften by the end of the quarter in certain markets due to inventory destocking. Global's product contribution margin which is gross profit less A&P expense declined $77 million to $34 million. Pandemic-related costs accounted for $29 million of the decline with the remainder, primarily driven by lower sales and higher manufacturing costs. Sales for our Foodservice segment which services North American foodservice distributors and chain restaurants outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers declined 44% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 2% due to unfavorable mix as sales of Lamb Weston branded and premium products softened. Price alone was positive reflecting the pricing actions that we've taken last fall. Volume declined 42% reflecting the severe impact of the shutdown had on full-service restaurants and non-commercial outlets including customers destocking inventories in April through early May. By the end of May, our weekly shipment rate had recovered to around 70% of prior year levels. Foodservice's product contribution margin declined $66 million to $43 million with pandemic-related costs accounting for $8 million of the decline. The remainder was primarily driven by lower sales, unfavorable mix, and higher manufacturing costs. Sales in our Retail segment increased 56% in the quarter. Volume increased 39%. As we discussed earlier our weekly shipments have been strong since late March led by demand for our mainstream branded products such as Grown In Idaho as well as for our premium Alexia branded products. Price/mix increased 17% largely driven by favorable mix and pricing actions. Retail's product contribution margin increased $10 million to $31 million. This was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable mix, and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by $10 million of pandemic-related costs.  Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Since the pandemic crisis began we've taken steps to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our financial position by drawing $495 million from our previously undrawn credit facility, entering into a new $325 million term loan, and completing a $500 million note offering. At the end of the quarter, our net debt was less than $2.2 billion, which is down nearly $140 million from the end of last year and we had about $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. As Tom mentioned, based on these actions and efforts to generate and preserve cash, we feel confident enough in our liquidity that in July, we fully repaid the $495 million that we've drawn on our credit facility. With respect to cash flow, for the year, we generated about $575 million of cash from operations. That's down more than $100 million versus last year with the decline in earnings. Nonetheless, in the fourth quarter, we generated about $140 million of cash from operations. Our top priorities in deploying that cash continue to be investing to grow the business and returning cash to shareholders. For fiscal 2021, we currently expect capital expenditures of about $140 million as we conduct appropriate plant maintenance and implement phase one of our new ERP system. With respect to capital returns as you may have seen last week we declared our regular quarterly dividend. However, we continue to suspend our share repurchase program due to the current operating environment. Now, turning to fiscal 2021. As we've noted, we're not providing an outlook for the year, because of the unpredictable effect of the pandemic on fry demand in North America and our key international markets. The business environment remains volatile, especially in the U.S. where increases in COVID cases have recently led government authorities in a number of states to reinstate restrictions on, restaurant and foodservice outlets. We believe these actions may slow or possibly even reverse, some of the recovery in fry demand. Instead of providing near-term financial targets we're providing a summary of our shipments during the first seven weeks or just more than half of our fiscal first quarter. In aggregate, the demand environment and our weekly shipments has improved since the end of May. Specifically, in the U.S., shipments to-date is approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our Global segment, weekly shipments to our large chain restaurant customers, which are predominantly QSRs have recovered to 85% to 90% of prior year levels, during the most recent weeks of the quarter. In our Foodservice segment which is largely full-service restaurants and other non-commercial customers, weekly shipments during the most recent weeks have been 70% to 75% of prior year levels, including solid recovery in sales of Lamb Weston branded products. Weekly shipments to Retail customers in the most recent weeks have been 5% to 10% more than prior year levels as food-at-home purchases begin to normalize, pre-COVID rates. Our growth has been led by our branded products. In Europe, shipments to-date by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture are around, 75% of prior year levels. Early in the quarter, weekly shipments were trending at more than 65% and have recovered to around 80% in the most recent weeks as more countries ease restrictions and consumers gain confidence, about dining in restaurants. In China, which is included in our Global segment, shipments to-date are approximately 85% of prior year levels, with monthly shipments improving from about 80%, in May to more than 95%, in the most recent weeks.  Demand in our other key international markets which are also included in our Global segment, has softened since the end of the fourth quarter. In Japan, customers have been destocking inventories due to postponement of the Olympics. In sum, the amount and pace of recovery in fry demand has been better than what we had anticipated, when the crisis first arose. QSRs in the U.S. have bounced back faster than we expected, while full-service restaurants have also recovered somewhat faster due to states easing restrictions. Demand in Europe and China has progressed largely in line with our expectations, while other international markets are a bit softer. However, to be clear we believe that this improvement remains fragile, as COVID cases continue to rise in the U.S. and in Latin America. We are currently seeing evidence of orders slowing after some states recently placed restrictions, for on-premise dining at restaurants. We expect that this high degree of uncertainty will likely continue, until the pandemic has ended and consumer confidence has been restored. With respect to costs, as Tom discussed, we've taken a range of actions to reduce our cost profile. We'd expect to continue to incur incremental costs and expenses resulting from the pandemic's impact on our operations. For example, these include expenses to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols throughout the company. Cost to modify, production schedules and reducing run times thereby sub optimizing plant and labor utilization. Cost to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities when necessary. And cost to produce retail products on foodservice-oriented production lines. So as you can see, it was a challenging quarter, where we've executed well, and took the necessary actions to maintain through a potentially volatile period going forward. Now, here's Tom, for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Rob. Let me just quickly sum up by saying, we are managing through this difficult and volatile environment, by prioritizing the health and safety of our employees. And supporting our customers as they deal with uncertainty. We believe that the tough decisions we made and the actions we've taken have us well positioned for fiscal 2021 and beyond. The recovery in demand, these past few months has been encouraging with solid improvements in most of our channels, especially at QSRs. While we expect there will be some bumps on the road to recovery, we'll continue to overcome them as the year progresses. Our long-term view remains the same, and we remain confident in our strategies, our ability to generate top and bottom line growth and create value for all our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us today. And we're now ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi, there. Tom you mentioned that some of your at least early discussions around customer contract negotiations and such were encouraging. I know on the last call, you talked about approaching some of these key customers maybe a little bit earlier even in the process than you might have otherwise. Just to kind of get in front of it, hopefully, have some of these not RFP the business and go through this process to try and avoid some of that. I know, there's always \u2013 you're somewhat more limited obviously in how specific you can get around some of this. But I was hopeful, if you could provide a little bit more color on what you've seen from that new approach? What you're seeing that's been encouraging? In other words is your sense that, that you wouldn't expect a lot of business shifting, let's say between various competitors? Is that kind of the outcome? And how do you think, if you can a little bit around what has it taken to sort of make that happen right with respect to \u2013 or what's the give back sort of been in order to make that happen if that's the case? Tom Werner : Yeah, Andrew I \u2013 yeah, I'm not going to get into a lot of specifics. But I will tell you, it's been really encouraging. We've had some early discussions. We closed some negotiations early in the process. And it's a partnership and that's what it's all about with our customers, especially some of the big customers. It's a challenging environment. Everybody recognizes that. And one of the most important things is assured supply. We certainly have our challenges in the network that Rob and I discussed on our prepared remarks in terms of manufacturing disruptions. But the plan was to get ahead of it talk to some of our customers with some of these big contracts coming up for negotiations. And there is some give and takes, but I will tell you how we ended up some of the negotiations. I feel good about where we ended up. And I'm not going to get into specifics. I don't talk about customers. But it's more to come on that down the road. We got several more contract negotiations coming up. But I feel really good, where we ended up with the ones that we've got completed to this point. Andrew Lazar : And I guess, obviously demand and trying to forecast demand is certainly the key one and that's the hardest one without question. But if I can summarize maybe some of the comments you just made, is it fair to say maybe that your anticipation at least around the contract negotiation piece of all this is one where maybe there's a little bit more visibility than you might have had a couple of months ago and a piece that maybe will be, I don't know for lack of a better word maybe more manageable in the context of all these things such that it's really all about demand and how quickly that comes back and pricing is not necessarily the piece that sort of derails the recovery, if you will? Tom Werner : Yeah. I think Andrew it's \u2013 you hit the key to the whole environment we're operating in is demand forecasting. And what's manageable today is different tomorrow, it's different yesterday. But we do have a lens of future demand based on orders in the system. Now, it's narrowed down a lot from what it used to be just because of the uncertainty in the channels. So it's \u2013 again, it's ensuring as best we can with the disruptions, we're having in our manufacturing plants making sure we've got taking care of the key customers. Certainly, we're having some challenges with the plant shut down, but the demand signal, we look at a lot of data just like every other company the demand signal is the key that's going to drive the near-term going forward. Certainly, when we have some of these contracts done and behind us that's helpful, but that's not necessarily an indicator on the demand forecast because the historical demand that we would have with these big customers has completely changed. So we're hand-to-mouth right now on what they're seeing in their store and store traffic. As you can imagine with the things that are going on in the environment in the U.S. specifically of some of our bigger markets that are -- have more spikes in cases and more restrictions the signal is mixed. So -- but the encouraging thing to all this is over the past six, eight weeks as Rob alluded to the things we look at, it's hanging in there pretty well across all of our channels. But the whole key to this is demand signal. And we look at a lot of different data. We certainly have a lens on what our forward orders look like. But the outlook period is a lot shorter than what it used to be, but we're monitoring it closely. Andrew Lazar : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Adam Samuelson : Hi, guys. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A \u2013 Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Q \u2013 Adam Samuelson : So I guess maybe digging in continuing on that discussion and thinking about kind of what we can glean from the fiscal fourth quarter from kind of the margin performance and how it works out prospectively from here is the demand environment certainly is less bad than it was in the May quarter as your quarter-to-date commentary alluded to. And I'm just trying to really think about those incremental kind of production costs that you laid out in the press release and how much of that was more onetime? How much of that is more recurring as long as you've got this kind of the COVID issues playing? And maybe finally how would you frame how to think about the decremental gross margins as your volumes are certainly still down year-on-year just over the next the three months to 12 months? A \u2013 Rob McNutt : Sure Adam. This is Rob. As I walk through those, I broke it into the $25 million that's utilization-related costs and then the $22 million that's not utilization related costs. And if you look at that $22 million, $14 million of that was related to the 20 or the 2019 crop write-off. And so there may be some tweaking and true-up here in Q1 as we finalize those discussions with the growers. But not likely that that's going to recur in our minds. Transportation, warehousing inefficiencies may have some recurrence of some of that, but hopefully we would -- the steps we've taken to improve and the additional volume pushing through that we're getting should help that as well. And then you go to the utilization costs and really that's the tough -- that's the one that's really tough to forecast because that's largely driven by really jerking around production schedules. So think about it as we've got a production schedule in a plant to go run couple of people show up after a long weekend with COVID and we don't have enough people and we don't have the assurance to continue to run that line and keep people safe and healthy. And so we then take a step to shut that down. I have no idea how to forecast that. And so that's one that you look at that $25 million and it's hard for me to get my head around that we're not going to continue to incur some of those costs. And I'll tell you in Q1, we have had some additional hits and some shutdowns and restarts and sanitizations of the lines. So that's the way I think about it. I know it's not perfect information but I think that's reality of what we're dealing with here. Q \u2013 Adam Samuelson : No, that's very helpful color. And then maybe just, I know a lot of uncertainties at this point as well but any SG&A expectations for 2021, or how would you bound those just given kind of the reality of the business environment today? Rob McNutt : Yes. In terms of SG&A we have continued to squeeze hard on the SG&A. Now recognize some of that is an automatic governor as we saw in the fourth quarter as incentive comp adjusted down and then nobody is traveling. So it's easy to control T&E right now. But right now what we've done is, we've got a hiring freeze in place on our SG&A, ex-critical replacement kind of roles. We're not spending a lot in terms of some of the more forward-looking developmental spend. We have suspended further work on Release two of our ERP system. We are finishing up Release one because we're just about done with that and thought it made sense to finish that up. So again we're taking the steps and you saw that in Q4. So we'll continue to maintain a really tight fist on SG&A costs as we go forward, until we can see things start to stabilize where we think that continuing to -- some of those forward-looking investments like the Release two of the ERP and so forth makes sense. Adam Samuelson : Okay, I really appreciate that color. I will pass it on. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thank you. So Tom, look just kind of a overarching question in terms of current situation and positioning. Obviously you go back to March everyone's kind of flying blindly right? You had to put in the orders for the -- with the growers for the 2020 harvest. It sounds like not only you, but other larger players in the industry kind of pulled back temporarily on capacity like you're saying, there's some line shifts that were required from foodservice to retail etcetera. But like where you sit now, looking forward for this year versus where you were a couple of months ago, kind of holistically in terms of 2019 inventory rolling off 2020 crop yields you mentioned currently demand obviously is still a question mark. But kind of overall do you feel like -- all things considered, we're actually not in a bad spot. We think that maybe hopefully the worst is behind us. And what we saw in Q4 hopefully right would be the worst. And now we can kind of work our way back because demand has been created, the harvest seems okay, contract lowers, supply orders actually came in decently. And basically our forecasting might actually prove out to be okay and we might actually be in a pretty good spot once we get to the end of the year. I mean that's the hope. So just kind of any overarching comments on kind of state of the industry and where you think you're positioned? Tom Werner : Yes Rob I sit here today we made a lot of decisions in the last 90 days based on a lot of unknowns. And there's -- where we're positioned right now as a company? I feel really comfortable how we're set up for this fiscal year. Now demand is going to be the wildcard, the demand signal. And I'm really encouraged by what's been happening in the last six to eight weeks. I think a lot of the things that we navigated through in April when all this hit, I would do the same thing again. And so, we'll navigate through the balance of this year with the new crop and next year's crop and the demand signal. I feel good about how the company is positioned. We certainly have our challenges that the team and the Lamb Weston employees are working through in our operations. We're continuing to enhance safety protocols for our employees. We got -- we have the entire organization focused on business recovery plans and cost savings. And so you step back and I feel the company is focused. We're going to have bumps in the road. There's no question about it. But the thing -- the big things that we decisioned in the last 90 days, 100% confident that it's the path forward. And now, we just got to operate this business over the next 12 months, it's going to be bumpy. We'll make adjustments as we need to, but we got everybody focused. So I feel good about where the company sits right now. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Great. Because what I'm hearing, it doesn't sound like -- there was nothing really in the prepared remarks or the press release. It doesn't sound as if you're in a dire enough position such that the plan would be for some form of restructuring or overhead reductions, right? It sounds like you want to hold the line so to speak. So, when demand recovers you're in hopefully a better competitive spot. Tom Werner : Absolutely, 100%. That's right where we're at. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : Good morning. I wanted to ask on the utilization rate side. I think I've seen a couple of announcements about facilities or workers being furloughed at some facilities. So, just was wondering one, how much capacity have you taken offline over the past couple of months? And then, from a utilization rate standpoint, where do you guys think you're running today? Tom Werner : The -- we made a decision about 30-ish days ago to temporarily shut down two of our factories just based on manufacturing efficiencies. And we've opened those factories back -- we're in the process of opening those factories back up. And part of the reason for that is, we're -- what we've been talking about on this call is the shutdowns that we've experienced have been a little bit more pronounced than we anticipated. Especially after the first part of June, we had a lot more positive in our plants. So, it's been more disruptive. At the time, we made the right decision to temporarily shut down a couple of factories and we since opened it back up and it's a need to the business as recoveries are improving. And we're -- work in production schedules and things are a little bit more disruptive than we thought. So that was the decision we made. We've reversed the decision. It's the right path going forward and it's just going to help us navigate through the demand improvement as things recover. Tom Palmer : Thanks for that. Also, wanted to follow-up on Adam's guidance question. In addition to SG&A in the past, you've given some expectations for items like cost inflation, CapEx and then it gets more specifically within SG&A the ERP spend. So, I appreciate you're not giving full financial guidance, but I wondered if you might give updates on maybe those line items? Rob McNutt : Sure. This is Rob. In terms of the CapEx, I think I've mentioned that for the year 2021, our expectation on CapEx right now is about $140 million. We've said in the past that it's really somewhere in the neighborhood of $120 million -- $125 million for maintenance level CapEx. And so, we want to continue to maintain the facilities. We had a couple of projects underway that we want to finish off including the ERP. And so, we'll finish that off. So that brings us to the $140 million expectation for the year. Again, as things open up later in the year assuming that we continue to trend positively in terms of COVID and so forth in demand that may change. But at this point, we're settled on the $140 million. In terms of SG&A costs, again as I spoke to that we'll continue to maintain a pretty tight handle on SG&A. We have the Release one that will go live here in the 1st of September. And so, we're currently incurring some training costs related to that. But that's the only element of SG&A that I would say would be anything that's outside the norm and that's going to be in the sub-$10 million. I mean, it's not a huge amount of money in the grand scheme of the year. Other than that again, we'll keep SG&A pretty tight for the year unless and until we see any light on the horizon. Tom Palmer : And then just on the cost inflation piece? Rob McNutt : I'm sorry yes, cost inflation continue to see, broadly speaking kind of that low single-digit kind of cost inflation across the system that we've seen in the past year. So don't expect anything dramatically different there. Tom Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning, Chris. Chris Growe : Good morning. Just had two questions for you. The first one would just be in relation to your crop contracts being down 20%, 25% for the coming crop. Does that reflect your view of demand? And really as those expectations can change, as we go through the year there's a lot of volatility right now or \u2013 is the idea to contract for less and just be able to buy more in the open market. And if I can ask related to that are there levers in place you have to acquire more potatoes as demand improves? They're going to be there but are you having ability to get those at a reasonable price if in case there is inflation in that spot market? Tom Werner : Yes, Chris, the point in time is our plan all along was to reset our contracting crop volume with the intent as things become more clear that we have the ability to go procure open potatoes and that's the plan and we're executing that plan. I feel confident about where we're positioned from a crop and our ability to procure potatoes with our growers that we partnered with for a long time. So no concern at all on that front. And as the year plays out Chris, we get six to eight months down the road and we start talking about 2021 crop. We can make some adjustments with that crop \u2013 early crop going forward, if the demand returns to normalized levels so to speak. So I feel good about how we're positioned. We made a point-in-time decision. There's a lot of \u2013 in the industry, there's a lot of different decisions made. But generally, the industry was kind of in the same spot. So I feel good about where we're at. There's open potatoes available. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you. And then I had a second question for you which was \u2013 is it possible you could tell us your capacity level as you exited the quarter? I'm just \u2013 I'm wondering also have you \u2013 you see \u2013 obviously, I heard your answer before you closed a couple of facilities. You're now reopening those for out of need. Have you reduced your workforce? Have you closed any other facilities? And then again kind of where you exit the quarter if you can speak to that? Tom Werner : No we've got all of our factories running with the exception of one of the factories that we temporarily shut down, it's in the stage of start-up. We have all of our employees, especially in the factories still on payroll. And we absolutely have to run all our factories and it's based out of a need of the disruptions we're having with the COVID hits and sanitization. And every positive is different so \u2013 or we follow the protocols that we need to follow some factories that have a positive which had a line down. Some of them we have to shut the plant down for a day some \u2013 we've had instances where we shut a factory down for a couple of weeks. And so the team is doing a terrific job navigating through all that Chris. The \u2013 I'm not going to even speak to utilization levels because it's so variable right now across the network that it's \u2013 until this thing stabilizes, it's going to be really difficult to talk about utilization levels in this environment. Chris Growe : Okay. I appreciate. Thank you. Operator : Okay. We'll next go to Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everybody and thanks for taking the questions. I got a couple of quick ones for you. And really I guess more focused on 2022, 2023 more so than 2021. So maybe the first one Tom, just if you think about industry capacity in total, I know the investment community we've all focused a lot on the additions that have been made over the last couple of years. But if you were to kind of think about what that could potentially look like in 2022 and 2023, again just talking about North American capacity, is it your sense that it would sort of not change, or is there a potential that maybe some older factories or facilities, get weeded out in this disruption? Tom Werner : It's a great question, Bryan. I think, as I think about the industry, it kind of gets back to demand. And I believe it's going to get back recover. It's just a matter when obviously. And I think, like any industry and everybody is going to reflect on current footprint. And think through strategy on what the footprint should look like in the next three to five years, what modernization looks like in the next three to five years. Certainly, as we're experiencing the disruptions in our manufacturing facilities, we've taken a very close look at efficiencies, and cost to manufacturer, and a lot of things. So I think the whole, the whole industry is going to do that around the globe. And I don't -- I expect that there could be some footprint changes. There's -- as demand recovers to levels in a couple of years that we've experienced, there's going to continually be investment in capacity, at some point down the road. And how that translates into modernization of new plants versus taking older plants out of the system, I anticipate that may accelerate, Bryan to your point. Bryan Spillane : All right. Thanks for that. And second question, you talked a little bit about -- you've talked on the call today about demand recovery is tied to I guess, normalizing mobility and consumer behavior, right? So all around pandemic but as we think about recession right, and especially as we move in, if there's going to be less stimulus money put in consumers' pockets. Just to the extent that we're in a recession, could you remind us first, what that was like in 2008 and 2009? And more specifically, how aggressive the maybe the behavior was in terms of competitors going after pieces of business? And do you anticipate that that could be sort of a factor, again not so much in this current round of contracts, but as we're looking out into 2022 or 2023, anything that you're seeing that would make you think that it just could become more competitive in that regard? Tom Werner : Yeah. I think, in 2008, 2009, the behavior from the consumer, we really didn't feel it as a company, looking back at the history, because there's a lot of trade down to the QSR space. And the -- at that time, the international market was growing exponentially faster than the overall North America and European market. So, our volumes as a company, wasn't hung in there and actually grew, through that period of time. The next two, three years, Bryan is -- it's really hard to predict. But I think there'll be some of that behavior. And time will tell how it all plays out. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thanks. And then, just the last one for me, Tom, has -- given all of the uncertainty that there is around demand at this point, as you're talking to customers contracting with customers, has it changed at all either the duration of the contracts? Like, is it really difficult to do a two-year deal or a 2.5-year deal right now, just because there's so much uncertainty? And/or is there anything different in terms of the mechanisms of the contract? So the contract goes one way if demand is X, but things are different if demand is Y. Just trying to understand if there's anything different in these contracts and the way you're kind of thinking about structuring them now, just given how unusual the environment is. Thanks. Tom Werner : Yeah, Bryan, there hasn't really been any material changes in any of the contract negotiations that we've had at this point. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thanks. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bryan. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Carla Casella : Hi and two questions. One on the costs that you incurred this quarter for COVID, the unusual costs related to the non-utilization. How much of that should linger into the next quarter or does that really linger until the next growing season is tabulated? Rob McNutt : Yes. Carla this is Rob. In terms of those costs, again, I think, that as you look through those, I broke them down into the $25 million related to utilization and the $22 million that was not related to utilization. Of that $22 million, again, a big chunk of that was related to raw write-off related to 2019 crop and settling of those contracts. And so, I would not expect anything material out of that to recur or extend, other than there may be some minor true-ups here that we clean up in Q1, but it's going to be much smaller than what we saw previously. And then, I said, there were some capital write-offs that we had in the quarter that don't anticipate those will recur. And then, transportation warehousing, I said, that expect those to improve versus what we saw in Q4, may still have some, but they'll be better. On the utilization costs, the $25 million of utilization costs, as Tom and I\u2019ve talked through, it's really tough to predict and to forecast what's going to happen, because those are largely driven by a couple of things. One, what's happening on the demand signal. And two, what's happening in terms of employee health, as they show up for work. We can keep them safe at work and keep them healthy at work. But outside of work, as they circulate in the community, they may get sick and so we may have unexpected shutdowns of plants. And so, that's what's driving that $25 million as that utilization that is tied to both of those issues. So that's the one that I would expect will have some recurrence. Hopefully, we're getting better and smarter at managing those costs. But that's the one where there's a risk I think. Carla Casella : Okay. And on the CARES side, did you break out how much was the CARES incentive? And does any of that linger into 1Q or is that all just fourth quarter? Rob McNutt : Yes. In Q4 and I don't know that I spoke to it, but it's disclosed either in the release or the K. I think about $9 million of CARES Act relief is what we received in the quarter. And then there is some carryover into Q1. We'll see what new legislation that's being kicked around, what that has in-store and see how we can quantify that going forward. Carla Casella : Okay. And then, just one last one. Can you remind us how much of your business is the schools, universities, hotels and maybe where it was in 2019 versus where you expect to be in 2020? Rob McNutt : Yes, we don't break out\u2026 Carla Casella : 2020 versus 2021? Rob McNutt : Sure. We don't break out that level of detail. The bulk of that business is reported through our foodservice business, but -- by our Foodservice segment. But by far the bulk of that Foodservice segment is the restaurants up and down the street, but we've never broken out the specifics on the hotels. But, again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that our demand on that is the same as you'd expect and what you're seeing in that segment and the economy generally. Carla Casella : Okay, great. Thank you. Rob McNutt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our time for questions and answers on the call today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks everyone for joining us for our Q4 call. If you'd like to set the time to have a discussion, please e-mail me and then we can schedule time either today or for the next couple of days. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And again, that does conclude today's call. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, VP Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release which is available on our website lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we\u2019ll make some forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment as well as other business updates. Rob will then provide some details on our first quarter results as well as some trends that we are seeing so far in the second quarter. With that let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you Dexter. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that you and your families continue to be well. Let me just start of by saying and I feel good about our performance in the quarter and how we are executing as a company. This is a testament to the Lamb Weston team and I want to thank them for their commitment to each other and our company as well as our continued service to our customers, suppliers and communities. As we navigate this challenging environment, our first priority remains ensuring the health and safety of our employees. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have instituted more rigorous operating protocols across the company, especially for our production and frontline teams that work to keep feeding the world -- while keeping our manufacturing facilities and product safe. In some cases, this has created additional burdens for our team members and their families. And I want to thank them for their commitment and understanding. I continue to be inspired by the spirit of teamwork that our employees show every day, and that makes me proud to be a part of this great company. In addition to the hard work by our team, our improved financial performance versus our fourth quarter of 2020 reflects two broad factors. First, the operating environment has steadily recovered over the past few months with restaurant traffic and fry demand improving in North America and most of our key markets. Second, we have gotten better in managing through the disruption that the pandemic has created in our manufacturing operations, as well as controlling costs across the business. With respect to the operating environment, we are optimistic about the sequential improvement, breadth and pace of recovery in restaurant traffic and fry demand. However, we also remain cautious about the uncertainty of the recovery stability, with COVID continuing to be a challenge in the U.S. and some key international markets. In the U.S. overall restaurant traffic and fry demand steadily improved early in the quarter then largely stabilized at levels that were below what we saw just before the pandemic. Traffic at large quick service chain restaurants approached prior year levels, especially during the latter half of the quarter, by leveraging drive-through, takeout and delivery formats. Full service restaurant traffic also improved as the quarter progressed, then stabilized at about 75% to 80% of prior year levels as governments relaxed restriction for on-premise dining, and restaurants lean more on carryout delivery, and outdoor dining to generate sales. Traffic and demand at non-commercial customers which includes lodging and hospitality, healthcare, schools and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environments remain at less than 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter although it did improve modestly as the quarter progressed. In retail demand growth in the quarter was strong. After peaking in more than 50% weekly category volume growth in April and May, weekly volume growth steadily moderated to between 15% and 20% growth by August as restrictions on restaurants eased. In Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, Fry demand approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter. Although it's important to know that demand at this time last year was somewhat soft for us due to a poor potato crop. Demand improvement in our other key and all international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand steadily improved and approached prior levels by the end of the quarter. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, the improvement in demand was uneven as governments employed different approaches to contain the spread of the virus. In short, demand steadily improved in the U.S. and across most of our international markets as summer progressed, then stabilized below pre pandemic levels. Along with that steady recovery in demand, our team's leveraged lessons learned when COVID first hit and have adapted our operations to better manage through the current environment. As I noted earlier, since the onset of the pandemic, we've stepped up our employee safety and sanitation protocols at each of our manufacturing, commercial and support locations, which has resulted in earlier detection of COVID among our workforce. We've also steadily become more efficient in minimizing disruptions to our manufacturing facilities and service levels, including isolating specific areas of our facilities that would be needed to shut down sanitize and restart after members of our production team are affected by the virus, as well as increasing flexibility to adjust production schedules and runtimes across the network. Our supply chain team has been able to significantly reduce our incremental production costs and inefficiency as compared to what we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We've also taken a range of steps to aggressively manage our selling general and administrative expenses, including shutting down all travel and large meetings and deferring other discretionary expenditures and projects. Our project that we did not differ was implementing phase one of our new enterprise resource planning system, as we believe it will be a key enabler to driving efficiencies over the long term. We are currently evaluating options for when to begin implementing phase two. Before handing the call off to Rob, let me update you on the potato crop and the pricing environment. With respect to the crop, on a preliminary basis we believe the crop and our growing areas in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta, and the Upper Midwest will be consistent with historical averages in the aggregate. Our early read on the European potato crop is that it will also be consistent with historical averages and that's a welcome sign given the poor crops in recent years. As usual, we'll provide our updated view of the crops yield and quality and how we expect the crop to hold up in storage when we report our second quarter results in early January. With respect to contract discussions and pricing, we\u2019re largely through the negotiations for the domestic large chain restaurant contracts that are up for renewal this year. And in the aggregate, we have maintained stable pricing in the portfolio. For those contracts yet to be finalized, we'll remain disciplined and take an approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships. Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts on balance, domestic pricing continues to hold up well. However, we have begun to see increased competitive activity in some domestic market segments, as well as more value oriented product segments in some international markets. As demand continues to strengthen, we expect pricing pressure in these segments will lessen. In summary, we feel good about our performance in the quarter and how we're executing as a company. We're optimistic about the positive demand trends in the U.S. and in our key international markets but we remain cautious due to the continued uncertainty with the current operating environment. We're navigating through the crisis by prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, leveraging our manufacturing footprint and operational agility to make sure we service customers and aggressively controlling costs across the entire company. And finally, we're encouraged about the health of this year's crop, as well as the overall pricing stability across our portfolio. These are challenging times which we expect will be around for a while but we also believe that by focusing on our strategies and our commitment to our employees and servicing our customers will emerge a stronger company. Now let me turn the call over to Rob. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we believe that we weathered the worst of the pandemic\u2019s effect on our operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Demand across most restaurant sectors, has improved from the lows of Q4 providing a backdrop for us to deliver a 3% sequential sales growth in our first quarter. The sequential increase in earnings was more dramatic. We nearly doubled gross profit from $111 million to $214 million and increased EBITDA including joint ventures by more than two and a half times from $78 million to $202 million as we increased operating leverage and we greatly improved our ability to control costs and manage through the disruption that the pandemic has on our manufacturing network and distribution chain. While our results remain below pre-pandemic levels, and down versus prior year, this sequential improvement in the demand environment and our financial performance is encouraging. Now turning to our year-over-year results. Net sales declined 12% versus prior year quarter to $872 million. Sales volume was down 14% as frozen -- potato demand outside the home continued to be affected by government imposed restrictions on restaurant traffic and other food service operations. However, after realizing some benefit from customers reloading inventories early in the first quarter, our weekly shipment trends in each of our domestic channels and most of our international markets steadily improved as a quarter progressed. I'll discuss this in more detail when reviewing our business segment performance. Price mix increased 2% due to improvements in both the food service and retail segments. Gross Profit declined $35 million with about $16 million due to pandemic related costs on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. That $16 million is down from $47 million of pandemic related production costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Of this $16 million, about $6 million were utilization related costs and inefficiencies arising from disruptions to our manufacturing network. That compares to about $25 million of cost for utilization related costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other costs to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID, cost associated with modifying production schedules and reducing runtimes across our network to compensate for facilities impacted by COVID, and incremental costs and inefficiencies related to manufacturing retail products online is primarily designed for food service products. The other 10 of the $16 million consists of non-utilization related costs, and included about $3 million of expense to the remaining crop, year 2019, raw potato purchase obligations, and about $7 million for enhanced employee safety, sanitation protocols, as well as for incremental warehousing transportation and supply chain costs. As we previously discussed, we expect to incur utilization and non-utilization related costs and inefficiencies. As long as our manufacturing and supply chain operations are impacted by the pandemic. The remaining $19 million decline in gross profit largely reflects lower sales volumes partially offset by favorable price mix, a $5 million year-over-year change in mark-to-market adjustments and cost efficiency savings. SG&A in the quarter was essentially flat. Cost management efforts, including a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense, offset $1 million of non-recurring expenses associated with implementing our new ERP system and $4 million of pandemic related expenses, largely related to net costs over retaining certain sales employees. Equity method earnings were $12 million, up $1 million from last year. However, excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings declined $2 million, with half due to pandemic related costs similar to what we incurred in our base business. While down versus last year, equity earnings increased sequentially as a result of significant decline in pandemic related costs in the first quarter, as well as steady improvements in our weekly shipments by our European joint venture. EBITDA including joint ventures was $202 million, down $31 million. About $21 million of the decline was due to pandemic related costs I've discussed. The remainder of the EBITDA decline was driven by lower sales and gross profit. Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.61 down $0.18 or 23% from last year. Now moving to our segments, sales for our global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S. based QSR, and full service restaurant chains, as well as all sales outside of North America were down 14% in the quarter. Price mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Volumes fell 13% due to the decline in demand for fries outside of the home. However, weekly shipments to large QSR chains, which historically comprise about one half of global segments sales improved from around 85% of prior year levels at the end of May to near prior year levels by the end of the first quarter. Weekly shipments to large full service chains, which historically comprised about 10% of global sales improved from 45% to 50% in May, to 70% to 80% by the end of the first quarter, as governments relaxed restrictions on on-premise dining and as restaurants improved carry out and delivery capabilities. International sales, which historically comprised about 40% of segment sales were mixed. As Tom noted, monthly shipments in China and Australia approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter as demand steadily improved. Monthly shipment trends in other markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America were uneven. This mirrored pattern -- in demand recovery but also generally lag is the rate of customer -- the lag, the rate of customer improvement as customers and distributors in these markets continued to right size, their inventories. Global's product contribution margin which is gross profit less A&P expense declined $25 million to $78 million. Pandemic-related costs accounted for about $9 million of the decline with the remainder, driven by lower sales. Sales for our Foodservice segment which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers declined 22% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 6% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of fiscal 2020. Mix was unfavourable for two reasons. First, independent restaurants which purchase a high amount of Lamb Weston branded products have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. And second, some customers have traded down to more value oriented products in order to reduce costs. It's important to note that this impact was more pronounced in the fiscal fourth quarter. And we've steadily regained much of this business as restaurant traffic improved in recent months. Volume declined 28%, reflecting the continued impact that government imposed restrictions have had on consumer traffic. Our weekly shipments to full service in small and regional quick service restaurants, which together have historically compromised three quarters of the segments sales improved to 80% to 85% of prior year sales by the end of the first quarter. Our weekly shipments to non-commercial outlets, which have historically compromised the other 25% of the segment sales modestly improved as a quarter progressed, but were soft at about 50% of prior year levels. Food Services product contribution margin declined $17 million to $86 million. With pandemic related costs accounting for $4 million of the decline. The remainder was primary driven by lower sales offset by favorable price mix. Sales in our retail segment increased 19% in the quarter, volume increased 11%. Although this masks the performance of our branded portfolio, which historically is compromised about 40% of the segments volume. Our brands are winning volume growth of our Grown in Idaho, Alexia and licensed brand products was up together more than 30% in the quarter. That's well above weekly category volume growth rates, which ranged between range between 15% and 25%. However, retail segments volume growth was partially offset by decline in private label shipments, which reflects the loss of certain low margin private label business that largely began during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Price mix increased 8% reflecting that favorable mix of more branded products. Retail product contribution margin increased $7 million to $36 million and was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable mix and lower A&P expense. This increase was partially offset by $3 million of pandemic related costs. Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. In the first quarter, we generated more than $250 million of cash from operations. That's up $12 million versus last year. Our top priorities in deploying cash continue to be investing to grow the business and returning cash to shareholders. In the quarter, we spent $33 million in CapEx, including for our new ERP system. Given the outlook for the business, cash flow and improved liquidity position, we're increasing our capital expenditures target for the year to $180 million from $140 million as we invest in productivity and optimization projects, as well as some targeted growth capacity. With respect to capital returns, we declared our regular quarterly dividend two weeks ago. Since the pandemic began, we've taken steps to enhance our liquidity and further and strengthen our financial position by entering into a new $325 million term loan and completing a $500 million note offering. In September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new three year $750 million revolver to replace the $500 million facility that was set to expire in November of 2021. The new revolver remains undrawn and fully available. In conjunction with the revolver, with more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we chose to prepay the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November 2021. All-in the financing actions we've taken since the pandemic began, have increased our liquidity by nearly $1 billion, lowered our weighted average interest rate and stretched our debt amortization, while only increasing our expected annual after tax interest payments by about $11 million. So along with our current, so along with our ability to continue to generate cash, we feel good about our current liquidity position. Now turning to some demand trends that we're seeing in the second quarter. As Tom mentioned, in the aggregate the demand environment and our weekly shipments have largely stabilized during the latter half of the first quarter and into the first four weeks of September. Specifically, in the U.S. shipments to date in the second quarter are approximately 90% the prior year levels. In our global segment, weekly shipments to our large QSR and full service chain restaurant customers in the U.S. are trending at around 95% of prior year levels. While QSR are light are likely to be largely unaffected, we anticipate that shipments to full service restaurants could take a step back as outdoor dining options become more limited with the onset of colder weather. In our food service segment, weekly shipments to our full service restaurants regional and small QSRs and non-commercial customers in aggregate are trending at approximately 80% of prior year levels. Shipments to full service restaurants and small and regional QSRs had been trending above that rate, but could soften due to colder weather. Shipments to non-commercial customers have been trending well below that rate, and are likely to remain so until the spread of COVID is broadly contained. In our retail segment, weekly shipments are trending even with prior year levels, with strong volume growth of our branded products offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. In Europe, weekly shipments to date in the second quarter by our European joint venture are approaching prior year levels, although consumer demand at this time last year was somewhat soft due to high prices and quality concerns as a result of the poor crop. As in the U.S. we believe that shipments to full service restaurants in Europe may also begin to soften as cold weather reduces outdoor dining options. Shipment trends in our other international markets are mixed. In China and Australia, shipments are approaching prior year levels. In other markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America, demand has improved since the end of the first quarter although our shipments continue to generally lag demand improvements as customers and distributors continue to right size their inventories. As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our global segments results. In short, overall demand across our markets is largely consistent with what we observed during the latter half of the first quarter. Although we remain cautious about the effect of the onset of colder weather on outdoor dining, as well as the continuing spread of the virus in the U.S. and its resurgence in some key international markets. In addition, when estimating sales for the quarter recall that our second quarter results last year benefited from strong sales customized products, including limited time offerings, as well as from additional shipping days related to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. With respect to costs, as we've previously discussed, we plan to process potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual. We stretched out the old crop in order to manage inventories in light of the pandemics impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in higher cost as a result of higher raw potato storage fees and lower recovery rates, since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory will realize the impact of these higher costs in our second quarter income statement as we sell that inventory over the coming months. Now, here's Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Rob. Let me just quickly sum up by saying it was a solid quarter in the context of the current operating environment. And I'm proud of how our manufacturing, commercial and support teams that continue to focus on the right strategic and operating priorities to serve our customers. We're optimistic about a steady improvement in restaurant traffic and fry demand in most of our markets as well as our ability to control costs and manage through the pandemics impact on our operations. However, we do expect some choppiness and demand as the world continues to manage through the crisis. We remain confident that Lamb Weston is well positioned to emerge as a strong company once we get to the other side of the pandemic, and create value for our stakeholders over the long term. Thank you for joining us today. And we're now ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi, thank you for the time. I just had a -- just to start off, I had a question for you on the gross margin. Obviously, there's a marked improvement sequentially. You talked about the leverage, you talked about you had lower COVID costs as an example. One other element of this that we've seen is stronger price and mix and stronger than expected, especially that in the food service division. I just want to get a sense of its sound like mix was positive. You have some pricing coming through as well. I guess I'm trying to think about the first quarter versus the fourth quarter and how important that component was to the gross margin performance, or was it more the leverage than that price mix improvement? Tom Werner : Yes, this is Tom. The important thing comparing to Q4, it's really about the volume returning. And because Q4, we just fell off a cliff in food service. And as you guys know, that's one of our stronger margin segments. So, it's a -- it's a combination of pricing flow through and really the restaurants re-openings and volume starting to recover in Q1 that really drove the sequential improvement. Chris Growe : And in relation to that the from the pricing, you had the pricing in the fourth quarter just with mass by mix, is that the way to say in that food service division? Tom Werner : Well, yes absolutely. And it's, we had significantly lower volume in Q4. So it was a major component of it. And as you, as you look at, we talked about Q1, it's really volume and price flown through and volume returning as I said. Rob McNutt : Yes, in food service, Chris, that it's not a -- that that price increase comes through over time. I mean, it's not, it's not one customer. They're all different contracts. So they roll at a different time. So some of that has, a little bit more impact in Q1 than we saw in Q4. Chris Growe : Okay. I just one more follow on to that, and I'll let it go. But my question on the gross margin would be as I think about, normally, from Q1 to Q2 you have a nice sequential improvement in gross margin. It sounds like that you have some residual cost coming through from utilizing [row] [ph] crop as an example and utilizing as an inventory, you have a tough comp as well. Do we think about the gross margin? Is it just contingent on volume? Or is there [enough on] [ph] the cost side there that we should think about the gross margin maybe been a little softer in Q2, versus Q1, even though sequentially that normally is better? Tom Werner : I think you're spot on Chris. That one, we've got some cost carryover that we don't normally have in Q2. Q2 normally we're selling crop that was processed directly out of field, so no storage cost to it. And they're fresh potatoes, so they process better. So that's going to have some impact on our Q2 margin. And in addition, as I mentioned, I think in my comments that that recall the Q2 last year, we had strong performance in LTOs and other specialty products like that, that help on the pricing side. Chris Growe : Okay, thank you for the time. Thank you. Tom Werner : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Morning, everybody. Tom Werner : Morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi. First thing, I think Tom you mentioned, it sounds like there's some maybe increased competitive pressure in some segments of the U.S. maybe outside of some of the large chains, and some of the more value oriented I think international segments you may have said. I was hoping you could just maybe go into that a little bit more and give us a sense of sort of what's happening there and is it -- is it through sort of contracts or not necessarily contract pricing just kind of more like spot pricing types of competitive dynamics? I'm trying to get a better handle on that. Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew, it's predominantly spot pricing in certain regions in the -- in North America, and it's, it's a little, I'd characterize it this way. It's a bit more pronounced than normal. And like I said, everything overall from a pricing standpoint, is pretty stable. It's nothing that we haven't seen before. So we're watching it carefully. But obviously, with capacity available, we just need to manage through it and we will. The international side of it, the way to think about it, the pricing pressure is on the lower not the lower line flow type items. That's that we characterize as non-value added. So we play in that a little bit and a lot of these markets. But our most of our focus is on the value added, like Crisscut curly fry type items in the international markets, but it is getting competitive on the lower value than on value added side. Andrew Lazar : Got it. And then you talked about sort of sequential demand trends and traffic trends, certainly improving pretty dramatically over the course of the quarter, of course from the from the lows, if you will in the in the fourth quarter. But that, maybe last couple weeks it seems to have kind of like stabilized or plateaued a little bit at some of the levels that Rob went through. Trying to get a sense of what you think is, is driving that sort of moderating pace, right of sequential improvements in sort of restaurant traffic or away from home eating. Because obviously, we haven't necessarily come into like super cold weather and things it's your point of kind of moderated or the pace right of sequential improvement is moderated a bit. So trying to get a sense of what you're seeing out there and what you think is driving that. Thank you. Tom Werner : Now, some of the some of the Q1- think about it this way, Andrew. In Q1, as we reopened up, a lot of our customers started rebuilding stocking inventory, because they dramatically decreased their orders. And you know, starting in March, April, May. So there was a restock happening kind of mid-May through June, and everybody trying to get caught up. And so I think, as I think about where we're at today, in terms of demand, it's been pretty stable at the levels that we talked to in the script. And the thing -- we got our eye on is as, as the weather changes, and you have flare ups and COVID hotspots, we certainly have data where we look at the markets that are potentially put more restrictions on, we're watching those ordering patterns very closely. So, those are a couple things that we continue to remain cautious about. We just got to work through it. And it'll actualize itself over the next 90 days, but we're watching it carefully. Andrew Lazar : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Bryan Spillane : Hey, thank you. And good morning, everyone. So a couple questions first, on the -- on margins, and it gets us we're thinking about cost going forward understanding that some of the COVID costs, probably stay in the base for a while. Can you just give us a sense for how much expenses maybe you're deferring into the out year? So just how much cost avoidance is happening this year and that we might have to think about adding back into the out years? And then also just this, we're talking about cost, if you can comment at all on just what you're seeing in terms of freight costs. And if, if that's something we should be thinking about? Tom Werner : Yes, thanks, Bryan. In terms of deferring cost, I mean, that those inefficiency costs and the COVID costs and so on and so forth. Those are flowing straight through the inventory. Now, if you're asking about are we deferring any maintenance costs or things like that, that might bite us in future years, none of that; we continue to maintain our facilities as we normally do, and so nothing there. So really nothing that I would say gets deferred into out years. Now we did mention last, last call that we had deferred some expansion capital that we were looking at, but again, that's we'll reassess that as market recovers. In terms of freight costs, I've heard others have had challenged with some near term freight. We tend to contract a lot of our trucking, as opposed to play a lot in the spot market, where we'd had some freight volatility, maybe more in Q4 is in early in Q1 was as we were trying to catch up those inventories and hot shooting some things our rail, truck freight, had some negative impact to it, but that we've pretty well stabilized. And again, so because we contract the trucking, largely, we're not as exposed as maybe some others that you may have heard. Bryan Spillane : Okay, and then and then just tying back to Andrew\u2019s question around pricing, and just the competitive dynamics in the market. Can you give a sense now of kind of where capacity utilization rates are or just how much slack there is in the system in North America? And again, I think we spoke about this last quarter, it seems like there were some plant older plants maybe that had been taken out of commission. And so it's a little bit difficult I think, from the seats, we're sitting in really to get an understanding of just where, where the industry sits right now, in terms of utilization rates, any color you can help us with that would be would be, would be helpful? Tom Werner : Yes, Bryan, I -- I'm not going to get into a specific number on utilization rate, because it's, really a moving target right now. And, we if you think about playing less than obviously, our utilization rates below, were reading [ph] historically operated. But on top of that, we as we have shutdowns and start-ups over the past, since the pandemic started, it really muddies the waters on what your overall capacity is. Now, we know the absolute number historically. But it's about running production as much as you can, in light of the disruptions we're experiencing, and they've gotten a lot better. And we're getting, like I noted in my remarks, we're a lot better at adjusting and moving production around when we have a disruption to service our customers, which also there's a cost element to that. So, I think, I think as this becomes more stabilized. Bryan we\u2019ll have a better understanding of the overall capacity utilization across the industry. And the competitive set is experiencing some of the same things that we are. So it's a bit of a moving target right now. Bryan Spillane : All right, yes. I appreciate that. Thank you. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bryan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : Good morning, and thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the retail shipment side, I was a bit surprised the quarter to date figure was only flat given how robust your branded takeaway is. I appreciate branded much stronger than private label. But do you think that the quarter-to-date shipment for [indiscernible] is an accurate reflection of overall takeaway trends for you at retail, or are shipments may be lagging that that takeaway a bit? Tom Werner : Yes, I think that that again, as I said in prepared remarks that on our branded business, we continue to perform very well. And private label, we've, seeded some of that, that volume that started really in Q3 of last year. And so I think that our branded performance, I think is continues to be very strong. But that private label offsets our offsets as our overall sales out of the retail I think that that accurately reflects it. Now, category trends out of the retail stores. I mean, you get the Nielsen data as we do. And so you, you see those are continued to be pretty strong overall. But for us, it's that it's that mixed trade. Tom Palmer : Okay, thanks. And you mentioned the tough comp for LTOs next quarter. We see QSR volumes, at least beginning to trend more favorably. Are you seeing those customers returning back towards or starting to plan limited time offers and to you know, to what extent might those start to flow through in the next quarter or two? Tom Werner : Yes, Tom. I won't get into specifics on customers and LTOs. What I will say is, there's renewed interest across many of our customers. But those, obviously take some time to get through the innovation and then get it on menu. So more to come on that. But also say is, there's some renewed interest in it. Tom Palmer : All right, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Rob Dickerson : Great, thank you so much. So just, in terms of the crop this year, it sounds like, what you were saying in the prepared remarks is basically the crop maybe in your sourcing areas, it sounds, about average this year, which is good. But given, the reduction in number of potatoes that went into the ground this year for this year's crop, and kind of where we are, in terms of the harvest time. And again, do you kind of currently find the demand supply equation fairly healthy at this point when you look at the overall broader crop? And then secondly, could others be maybe somewhat disadvantaged, given their, re-emergence of demand, but maybe some varied regional supply sourcing? Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes. Rob, I think overall, how I'll characterize it is right now, based on our overall demand forecasts were balanced from around like, the industry is kind of in the same spot. So as we do every year, as the our forecasts change, we quickly align that with our raw needs. And our Ag team does a great job canvassing our growing areas, and ensure that we're covered to serve as our customers. So I think everything's pretty balanced right now. Rob Dickerson : Okay, great. And then also, we've heard recently, no large part of yours since we started construction in one of their plants, right. They were constructing it, they start construction, probably hit the back building. I know, Bob, this is only willing to say so much, but I just, you know, curious, you know, if you'd be willing to comment on just maybe, like infact a symbol of confidence on the overall industry, like structural basis of the industry, as we think about, even going into calendar 21 because a lot of questions to be asked around utilization now. But, if you\u2019re thinking 12 to 18 months in a large competitors back at a plant, you know, it seemed to me that the industry is saying, yes, we're trying to get through this, but we also have to be prepared for when demand comes back because the industry overall isn't structurally impaired at this point. Thanks. Tom Werner : chapter: Rob Dickerson : Okay, great. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks good morning everyone. Adam Samuelson : Maybe, hey, maybe kind of keying off of Rob's question just on the raw supply. I believe the contract rate is up in the Pacific Northwest. This year it was up about 3%. And I'm just trying to make sure when you say pricing stable in terms of your contract negotiations with your customers, is that pricing stable a net number? Or is that a gross number? And so we got to think about flat top line price and there's a there should be a kind of low-to-mid single digit inflation on the on the potato cost side? Tom Werner : Yes, Adam, in terms of the pricing negotiations with customers. I think what we were speaking to is that generally the pricing negotiations were consistent with expectations. And so I think there was some concern that some had expressed on our last call that there might be some pricing pressure and we just hadn't seen that. Now recognize that in our global business unit, those big chain customers, we tend, on average to have about a third of those contracts come up every year. And those contracts structures are different. Some have cost pass through elements, some have just cost inflation elements and so forth. And so that, that it's fairly variable in terms of how those contracts work. But I think overall, I think the read is that, that pricing in our marketplace for sales, continues to be in good shape stable from our expectations. On the raw side, the crops in good shape and we've got what we need to serve as our customers for this year. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that's helpful. And then the follow up just thinking about the SG&A line and any way to help frame, how what that can look like this year. I know, you're probably taking a very tight lid on all the discretionary spending, and some things like team here fairly easy to control in the current environment. But what that could look like and [indiscernible] is any update on the ERP project in terms of timing and completion? Tom Werner : Yes, Adam it\u2019s Tom. In terms of SG&A, we've -- early on, like we mentioned put a lid on stopped all non-discretionary spending and projects, and travel those kind of things, and we'll continue to do that. As sort of terms of levels of SG&A I think we target around 8%, 9% of sales. And, the -- with that said, as, as things continue to improve there's, some things we may choose to invest in within SG&A. But we'll manage that tightly like we have, and the team's done a good job putting the lid on cost of non-discretionary. In terms of ERP\u2026 Rob McNutt : I\u2019ll take that Tom. In terms of the ERP, we have implemented released one of that ERP, which covered our financial reporting, covered our maintenance in the plants and covered our indirect procure to pay cycle. And that was that\u2019s been implemented and is now operating and standard ERP exercise not perfect, but not horrible. It's all it's, it's fine and operating well, the team has done a great job with it. In terms of release two, that impacts more customer facing and inventory elements and in given the current environment. We're really stepped back from that. One, to let the key people in the business run the business in this challenging time, and two, just managing through the risk. So we're going through the assessment now to determine what the timing is to do that, but we haven't relaunched it at this point. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that color is very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bryan Hunt with Wells Fargo Securities. Bryan Hunt : Thanks for your time this morning. My question has to do with your potato supply. You know, you had said coming into the year your contracting is down 20% to 25%. And you made some earlier comments your balance from our raw perspective relative to your forecast. How much latitude do you have to catch up with demand with spot potatoes, if you were to see demand come in stronger than your forecast. Tom Werner : We have like we do every time this year, we have a pretty good idea of working with our growers, strategic growers of potential open potatoes available, and we make decisions. We made decisions this year already to make sure that we have raw valuable based on the changing forecasts. And we'll continue to make those decisions throughout the course of the next 60, 90 and 120 days as things change. So there is some flexibility in the system and the whole industry does kind of the same playbook. So, like I said, we feel we've made some decisions to do some things to keep it balanced right now based on our latest thinking on how the demand is going to play out for the balance of the year. And we'll continue to evaluate it and we have a great ad team that has a very good understanding of what's available in the market. So I have no concern that we'll be if things improve dramatically. We have a plan in place to make sure we stay balanced. Bryan Hunt : Great. My next question is, you touched on LTOs potential, and the margin opportunity that you've seen historically in LTOs. In your discussions with in contracting for the upcoming year, with your QSR customers, what, what is their mind set around LTOs? Is there potential for more of them? Or less of them year-over-year? You know, like can you just touch on the potential quantity of LTOs on a year-over-year basis? Tom Werner : Yes, I think the way to think about it is, there was a period, where a lot of customers of all different sizes, were focused on many simplification, based on, the environment that unfolded in the last six months, and I think, now that now that there's a return of demand, the mindset was, some of our customers is a clarification. So that's, that's leading towards renewed discussions on LTO activity, and what that could look like for some of our customers. And every customer is different. So some are more aggressive on menu items than others and the, thing to remember is, once those discussions starts, it does take some time to get them in the marketplace and on menu. Bryan Hunt : And then my last question is, and you touched on this briefly. When you look at capital allocation, you talk about growth, returning cash to shareholders. Given the lower capacity utilization in the industry, we could see there might be from the outside looking in opportunities to maybe make some capacity acquisitions that more favorable multiples, and you have in the not too distant past. Can you touch on maybe what the M&A pipeline looks like today versus a year ago? And do you feel more confident and putting money to work on acquisitions versus returning it to shareholders? That's it for me. Thank you, Tom and Rob. Tom Werner : Yes so consistent to what I've talked about in the past. One of our strategic pillars is invest for growth, an important part of that is M&A. And we continue to canvass the industry. Even in the last six months, we're staying as in touch with opportunities as possible and it's a, it's an environment that may lead to some opportunistic M&A. And the great news is, Rob and his team have done a good job getting our, getting the revolver done in this environment, and building some additional debt. So we got cash on the balance sheet, got a lot of firepower, and if the opportunity presents itself, ready to play. So, we continue to do everything we can to move some forward and we're ready to go. Bryan Hunt : Thanks for your comments. Operator : We'll take our next question from Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Sarah [ph] Clark on so Carla Casella. On your COVID related costs thanks for breaking that out in more detail. What percent of those do you expect to recur each quarter going forward throughout this year? Rob McNutt : Yeah, that this is Rob. It -- that's so hard to determine, because what you're what you're trying to forecast there is how many infections you're going to have, where they're going to come on, what line and so how you shut that down. So I think that's a challenge to forecast. So the best that we can do is disclose what has happened and disclose enough of the detail and then, I'll let you do your own forecast on COVID in these in these spots. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you, and then how are you evaluating your shelf space at retailers? Do you feel like you have the right skews at retail and then how are you looking at this in the food service space as well Tom Werner : Yes, I think from a retail standpoint, we feel good about our shelf space and facing. As Rob mentioned, the branded offerings on shelf are doing pretty well. And, we were continuing evaluating shelf set. So we feel good about all that. In terms of the food service, I'm not quite following your question. Unidentified Analyst : I'm just, that's fine. The [indiscernible] view is fine. And then last question, in terms of margin differential by product. Have you ever broken out the difference between branded and private label margins? Tom Werner : No, we don't. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Tom Werner : Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's question and answer session, Mr. Congbalay at this time I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks everyone for joining the call this morning. If you would like to set up a follow up call please email me and we can get something set up either today over the next couple of days. Again, thanks for joining and disconnect the call. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's second quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be - should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment, while Rob will provide some details on our second quarter results as well as some shipment trends for the third quarter. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our entire Lamb Weston team continues to execute well through this challenging environment. That's only possible because of their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, suppliers and communities. And I can't thank them enough for their dedication and support. Our second quarter results also reflect operating conditions that were generally similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. Overall restaurant traffic in the U.S. was resilient quite holding steady at around 90% of pre-pandemic levels for much of the quarter. However, traffic and frozen potato demand rates continued to vary widely by channel. Traffic at large chain restaurants were essentially at prior year levels as quick service restaurants continued to leverage drive-through, takeout and delivery formats. Traffic at full service restaurants was 70% to 80% of the prior year levels for much of the quarter. However, traffic began to soften in November as governments reimpose social and on-premise dining restrictions in an effort to contain the resurgence of COVID and as the onset of colder weather tempered outdoor dining opportunities across many markets. Traffic and demand at non-commercial customers, which includes lodging, hospitality, healthcare, schools and universities, sports and entertainment, and workplace environment was fairly steady at around 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter. In retail, consumer demand continued to be strong with weekly category volume growth between 15% and 20% versus the prior year. Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic in fry demand were uneven across markets and varied within the quarter. In Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston Meijer joint venture, fry demand during much of the quarter was similar to last year, but softened the 75% to 85% of prior year levels during the latter part of the quarter as governments reimpose social restriction and as weather turn colder. As you may recall, unlike in the U.S., QSRs in Europe generally have only limited drive-through capabilities. Demand in our other key international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand was near prior year levels. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, overall demand improved sequentially from our first quarter, but remained well below prior year levels. Going forward, we expect many of the softer traffic and demand trends that we began to see in November to carry-over into our fiscal third quarter. The sharp resurgence in COVID in the U.S. and Europe has led governments to impose even more rigid social restrictions. In addition, we expect outdoor restaurant dining traffic in our largest markets to fall further as we enter the coldest months of the year in the northern atmosphere. Not surprisingly, we expect traffic at full service restaurants will continue to be disproportionately affected. Major QSR chains in the U.S. should be able to continue to hold up well due to their ability to serve customers via drive-through and delivery. Retail should also benefit as consumers eat more meals at home. And as Rob will discuss later, while still early, our shipments to those channels in December support that view. So on one hand in the near-term, we anticipate facing even more challenging and volatile operating conditions than what we experienced in the first-half of our fiscal year. On the other hand, we believe this COVID-induced shock to demand is temporary. We're confident in the strength of the frozen potato category and do not see any structural impediments to recovery in demand and growth over the long-term. As COVID vaccines become more widely available in the coming months and as the virus is more broadly contained, we expect governments will gradually less social restrictions. This should lead to steady growth in restaurant traffic as the year progresses. We believe this growth will lead to overall frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. In the meantime, we're confident in our business fundamentals, the pricing capacity utilization and potato supply and our ability to manage through the pandemics impacts on our manufacturing operations. Our recently announced increase in our quarterly dividend and the planned resumption of our share repurchase program reinforce our conviction in the strength of our business and the category, as well as our commitment to support customers and create value for our stakeholders. In summary, we delivered solid Q2 results and are executing well in a challenging environment. We expect frozen potato demand has softened in the near-term due to reduced traffic, following government reimpose, social restrictions as well as the onset of colder weather, and we're optimistic that the increasing availability of COVID vaccines will enable restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses and that demand will approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar 2021. Now let me turn the call over to Rob. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter, as our teams continued to manage through an ever-changing demand environment as well as COVID-related disruptions to our manufacturing and distribution networks. For the quarter, net sales declined 12% to $896 million. Sales volume was down 14%, largely due to fry demand at restaurants and foodservice being negatively impacted following government imposed restrictions to contain the spread of COVID, as well as colder weather beginning to limit outdoor dining across many of our markets. In addition, volume was down as we lap the benefit of additional shipping days related to the timing of Thanksgiving of last year. Overall, as Tom described earlier, restaurant traffic and our sales volumes in the U.S. stabilized at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels, although performance varied widely by sales channel. International sales were mixed but improved sequentially versus our first quarter. Price mix increased 2%, driven by improved price in our Foodservice and Retail segments as well as favorable mix in retail. Gross profit declined $62 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing costs more than offset the benefit of favorable price mix and productivity savings. As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we expect that our manufacturing cost to increase in the quarter. This was partly due to processing potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual. We did this in order to manage finished goods inventories in light of the pandemics impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in increased cost due to significant - due to higher raw material storage fees and lower recovery rates. Since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we realize the impact of these costs in our second quarter income statement as we sold that inventory. We also realized higher manufacturing costs due to input cost inflation, primarily related to edible oils, raw potatoes and other raw ingredients. Overall, our input cost inflation was in the low-single digits. Finally, we continue to realize incremental costs and inefficiencies resulting from the pandemic's disruptive effect on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other cost to shutdown, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID. Cost associated with modifying production schedules reducing run-times and manufacturing retail products on lines primarily designed for foodservice products and cost per enhancing employee safety and sanitation protocols as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs. Specifically in the quarter, we had notable disruptions in our facilities in Idaho, as well as lesser ones in some other facilities. We expect to continue to incur COVID-related costs through at least the remainder of fiscal 2021. As a result, we consider these costs and disruptions as part of our ongoing operations and are no longer disclosing these costs separately. SG&A declined by nearly $8 million in the quarter, largely due to lower incentive compensation expense accruals and a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense. The decline was partially offset by investments to improve our operations and IT infrastructure, which included about $5 million of non-recurring consulting and training expenses associated with implementing Phase 1 of our new ERP system. Equity method earnings were $19 million, which is up $4 million versus last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments equity earnings increased about $2 million due to better performance by our European joint venture. However, like in the U.S., our shipments softened during the latter part of the quarter reflecting the effect on restaurant traffic of governments reimposing, social restrictions, as well as colder weather on outdoor dining. EBITDA, including joint ventures was $213 million which is down $48 million. The decline was driven by lower income from operations and it was partially offset by higher equity method earnings. Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.66, down $0.29 largely due to lower income from operations. EPS was also down due to higher interest expense reflecting our higher average total debt and the write-off of some debt issuance costs as we paid off the term loan, a year early. The decline was partially offset by higher equity earnings. Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American based QSR and full service restaurant chains, as well as all sales outside of North America were down 12% in the quarter. Volume was down 11% due to softer demand for fries outside the home, especially in our international markets. Shipments to large chain restaurant customers in the U.S. of which approximately 85% are to QSRs approach prior year levels as QSRs leveraged drive-through and delivery formats. However, some of that strength also reflected pulling forward sales of customized and limited time offering products from the third quarter. International sales, which historically comprised about 40% of segment sales, we're at about 80% of prior year levels in the aggregate, but vary by market. Shipments in China and Australia approach prior year levels. Our shipments to other parts of Asia and Latin America, improved sequentially as customers and distributors in many of these markets were able to right-size inventories, however, they remained well below prior year levels. Price mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Price alone was flat. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense declined 28% to $93 million. Lower sales volume, higher manufacturing costs, and unfavorable mix drove the decline. Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 21% in the quarter. Volume declined 25%. Segments to smaller chain and independent full service and quick service restaurants tracked around 70% to 80% of prior year levels through much of October, but slowed to 60% to 70% in November, following government's reimposing, social restrictions and as colder weather tempered restaurant traffic in some of our markets. Shipments to non-commercial customers improved modestly since summer but remain at around 50% of prior year levels, with strength in healthcare more than offset by continued weakness in the other channels. Price mix increased 4% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of fiscal 2020. Mix continued to be unfavorable with some hard hit independent restaurants looking to reduce costs by purchasing more value-added products rather than the premium Lamb Weston branded ones. While we've regained much of this business since the pandemic first struck last spring on a year-over-year basis, it remains a mix headwind. Foodservices product contribution margin declined 21% to $88 million. Lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline and was partially offset by favorable price. Sales for our Retail segment increased 7% in the quarter. Price mix increased 7%, primarily reflecting favorable mix benefit at selling more of our higher margin branded portfolio of Alexia, Grown in Idaho and licensed restaurant trademarks. Volume increased nominally. Sales of our branded products were up about 30% which is well above category growth rates, which ranged between 15% and 20%. The increase in our branded volume was offset by the loss of certain low margin, private label volume to began late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as well as an additional amount that began a couple of months ago. As a result, we expect private label losses to continue to be a headwind. Retail's product contribution margin increased 6% to $30 million. The increase was driven by favorable mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. We are comfortable with our liquidity positioned and confident in our ability to continue to generate cash. In the first half, we generated nearly $320 million of cash from operations, which is down about $25 million versus last year, due to lower sales and earnings. We spent $54 million in CapEx, including expenditures for our new ERP system. We paid $67 million in dividend and a few weeks ago, announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend. In addition, we plan to resume our share repurchase program this quarter. As you may recall, we temporarily suspended our buyback program in late fiscal 2020 in order to help preserve our liquidity during the early days of the pandemic. As we discussed in our previous earnings call, in September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new three-year $750 million revolver. At the same time, using a portion of the more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we prepaid approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November of 2021. At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $760 million of cash on hand and our new revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was $2.75 billion and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.1 times. Now turning to our shipments so far in the third quarter. Broadly speaking, in U.S., demand at QSRs and at retail are holding up well, while traffic at full service restaurants continues to soften. Specifically, U.S. shipments in the four weeks ending December 27, were approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our Global segments, shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain customers in the U.S., where more than 95% of prior year levels. We expect that rate will largely continue for the remainder of the third quarter. In our Foodservice segment, shipments to our full service restaurants regional and small QSRs and non-commercial customers in aggregate were 60% to 65% of prior year levels. That is largely in line with what we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We anticipate that shipments to full-service restaurants and small and regional QSRs will continue to soften as social restrictions broaden and as winter weather takes a bigger bite out of outdoor dining. Shipments to non-commercial customers, which have historically comprised about 25% of the segment's volume were roughly half of prior year levels and will likely remain soft for the remainder of the quarter. In our Retail segments, shipments were above prior year levels with strong volume of our branded products, partially offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. We believe that this rate will largely continue for the remainder of the quarter. Outside the U.S., overall demand has slowed, but it's varied by market. In Europe, shipments by our Lamb Weston Meijer joint venture were approximately 85% of prior year levels, continuing the softer demand that we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We believe that shipments will continue to soften due to severe social restrictions and colder weather. Shipments to our other international markets, which primarily include Asia, Oceana, Latin America were mixed. In aggregate, international shipments so far in the quarter have been softer than what we realized during the latter half of the second quarter. As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our Global results. In short, other than at U.S. QSRs, which can leverage drive-through access, global demand for fries at restaurants and foodservice will be soft in the third quarter, following government's reimposing restrictions to combat the resurgence of COVID, as well as colder weather in our Northern Hemisphere markets limits outdoor dining opportunities. With respect to contract pricing, after completing discussions for contracts that were up for renewal, we expect pricing across our domestic large chain restaurant portfolio in aggregate to be flat versus prior year. Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts on balance domestic pricing is holding up well. However, we continue to see increased competitive activity in more value-added oriented products in some international markets and to a lesser extent in some value tiered domestic market segments. With respect to costs, the potato crop in our growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta, and the upper Midwest is consistent with historical averages in aggregate. We don't see any notable impact on cost outside of inflation. Crop in our growing areas in Europe is also broadly consistent with historical averages, which should help ease cost pressures there versus last year. However, we do expect to continue to incur additional cost as a result of COVID's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and supply chain operations and we expect that we'll continue to do so until the virus is broadly contained. Now here's Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks Rob. Let me just quickly sum up by saying while the near-term environment will be volatile. We believe that the restaurant traffic will gradually recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar 2021. We'll continue to focus on the right strategic and operating priorities to serve our customers and build upon the long-term health of the category in order to create value for our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us today and we're now ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody, and Happy New Year. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Happy New Year. Andrew Lazar : Two questions from me, if I could. First, with visibility to getting back to pre-pandemic levels of demand by calendar year-end. I'm curious if there are any signs you were seeing of any lasting shifts in competitive dynamics among sort of the key North American players that could result in Lamb Weston coming out of this in a stronger relative position than it went in? Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew. So I think, right now, the industry - we're all navigating through the pandemic. And from Lamb Weston standpoint, our strategy has not changed. And while we have paused a few things that we are thinking about pre-pandemic, I will tell you that we're actively engaged in some projects and it's all of our positioning this company, as we believe the demand is going to return by calendar year. And if you think about 18 months from now, we got to be ready to capture share demand across the whole globe. So while we have paused a few things, we have reengaged in some things, projects that we are working on and we're going to move those forward to get ourselves in position 12 months to 18 months from now to capture the demand that we believe is going to come back to pre-pandemic levels. Andrew Lazar : That's a good segue into my second question which is, I know it's an odd time in some regards to ask about incremental industry capacity. But if you see frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic levels again by calendar year-end and then assuming demand globally grows it normalized levels from there, and knowing, it takes a few years to get new capacity for the industry online. When would you think we might hear of new industry capacity additions being announced whether that would be Lamb Weston or others? Tom Werner : Yes. One of our competitors, they're in the process of expanding capacity that they were working on pre-pandemic. From our standpoint, again, we've got some things that we're moving forward and the right time and we'll do all the work around it. We will make that decision. The other thing that - one of the silver linings with all this is, we've really focused internally on our efficiency and operating efficiencies within our current footprint. And it's giving us visibility to opportunities we believe within the current manufacturing footprint to unlock capacity. So that's something that the supply chain team in Lamb Weston is focused on. We have a big initiative within supply chain to unlock capacity and drive efficiencies. And if you think about, Andrew, the timing of new capacity versus what we have in our current footprint, I'm not 100% confident that with our supply chain initiative unlock, hidden capacity in our current footprint that we're absolutely in a great position as demand returns to support not only our current customers as their business returns, but also future demand and category growth. So I feel we're really in a position. But again at the right time, we got to make those decisions in terms of getting ourselves ready for demand resurgence 18 months, 24 months out. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks for your time. Tom Werner : Yep. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Rob McNutt : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Good morning. Hi. So I guess my first question is really related to some of the pricing comments that you made earlier and just some of where you're seeing some of that incremental competitive activity. Internationally, is that - I presume that's in your export markets out of the U.S. not in the European JV. But is that European competitors who are looking up to push into Asia? Just help me think about kind of \u2013 frame kind of where you're seeing that. And is that places they haven't played before? And then in domestically in the value-tier side, is that just European imports into the East Coast? How do you think about the origin of that competitive threat and kind of how salient and how much your volumes are really kind of framing in the exposure there? Rob McNutt : Yes, Adam, this is Rob. In terms of the pricing internationally, it is a mix of where that's coming from, the competitive, some of that in some markets where there is some of that lower end production is coming from local producers just run in the cash flow and some of it is coming from excess capacity in Europe. Similarly, in the U.S., again, it's in that lower end value market and we have seen some increases from the Europeans. That is certainly having some impact in that limited part of the market. Adam Samuelson : And just anyway, Tom, you could help think about just how much of that \u2013 of your business is really in those kind of categories where you're seeing. I\u2019m just trying to contextualize kind of pockets where there is some - a little bit of competitive intensity? Tom Werner : Yes. We don't necessarily disclose that. But to Rob's point, it's the lower line flow, what we call it, so it's really not a material piece of our business. The point is, it's more pronounced in Asia and the Europeans are being competitive in Asia and it's not one market, specifically, it's random markets in Asia and our teams did a good job trying to hold serve. But when you get no situations, customers are going to think about going to different direction. But we're watching it closely. It is more pronounced than it has been, but I will say, it's nothing that we're not used to dealing with. It's just more aggressive. And the team will work through it and capture opportunities where we can. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And then, just my second one was going to be and I think about the fiscal third quarter and kind of volumes, kind of slowing down from where they were, I mean, it seems - seemingly a little bit more orderly than you might have been in the spring. I'm just trying to make sure, I'm sensitive and thinking about the gross margin kind of implications of softer volumes in the near-term. And just kind of the levers you can pull or just the ability to plan better to manage that kind of lower volume near-term? Tom Werner : Yes. I'll talk to this patterns and Rob you can hit the margin. If you think back through the initial start of the whole pandemic, our business evaporated. We\u2019re down 60% in total, 50%, 60%. So as we look over this next quarter, while we're seeing softness in some of the channels specifically foodservice. I don't believe it's going to be anywhere near was when all these things started. Now that said, we gave guidance on what's happening through December. And I think that's going to be where it plays out over the next 30, 60 days we get winter things are open it back up. The most important thing for us to be prepared for the opening back up and we learned a lot of lessons last spring, as a management team and myself personally that we have to be ready. And what does that mean, it means if you think about April, May make - we're taking some measures right now to ensure we've got the right inventory, the right products, so wind demand snaps back, which we believe it will in the spring and start increasing we can service our customers. All the while recognize that we're still dealing with manufacturing operating issues because of COVID in terms of efficiencies. So on the one hand while, so things are slowing down in some areas. On the other hand, it's a great opportunity for us to get ourselves positioned to meet demand on this thing snaps back. So the near term is going to be volatile, but as we come out, get in the spring and summer, and you got vaccines and this thing hopefully starts getting behind us. I believe there's going to be some pent-up demand for people to get out, go out again. And so we're going to be prepared for that. Operator : We can now take our next question from Rob Dickerson of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Rob Dickerson : So just to kind of circle back, couple of comments you made on kind of where you are now in terms of, with your inventories and kind of how you have to be ready, right for potential demand snap back in, that's called April, May and June, whatever it is? Like, how do you feel, I guess for around or about Lamb Weston's kind of current inventory levels, and maybe the industry's inventory levels kind of B2B, right some of this kind of hopefully temporary softness in the Q3 and part of the business, right or is there like, if you step back, you say okay? This is where we are now. It's only potatoes we have, it's how many potatoes the industry has? I feel like we kind of see the forecast that somewhat appropriately relative to demand when we go back to raise March, April's of last year. And now as you said here do you think about Q3 into the spring and summer, do you kind of say, yeah, we still feel pretty good. The industry feels pretty good about this inventory levels as long as that demand does snap back. So we're now once again, kind of, so to speak over inventory is that fair? Tom Werner : Yes. I think my point of view is, I believe the industry's balance from Lamb Weston standpoint where we're balanced. I feel good about where we're at on raw availability and what we have in storage to meet the needs, Even if there is demand, I think we're in good shape. The thing that we're working on right now is to make sure we got the right inventory levels of product that was really pulled when the economy open back in May, June. And so we've got data and we can look and see what the customers, the products they were, we were shipping to all, so we're positioning those products to have a different level of safety stock, if you will to anticipate that. And I think we're in good shape from finished good inventory raw inventory. The thing to remember is the timing of whether it's April-May or June, the timing of consumer demand going out to eat more or maybe it's further down the road, we will manage it and we can manage our production schedules, we can manage inventory levels. So those things we could do and have done it, always do just to manage the supply and demand side of it. And so I feel good about where we're at. Now, like I said, we're getting ourselves prepared for demand returns as we get through Q3, and I think the company of being in shape and will react as needed just based on the ordering signals we're getting from our customers. Rob McNutt : Yes. Rob, the other point, I'd make or the distinction, initially when the pandemic first hit demand it - it's felt like when I have perfect insight into the downstream distribution through the channel, but it felt like they were working with old models and so the orders continue to come even as an end-user demand was coming off. We're seeing a quicker adjustment in that now. And so I think as we've learned, they've also learned and so that I'm not concerned about downstream channel being overloaded. Rob Dickerson : And then this might be too specific of a modeling question, like shot, your Global division right organic sales declined 12%, but two year stack basis like given we actually shipping days, maybe some LTOs is essentially flat, right? So that's pretty good all things considered. I'd argue, if I'm thinking about Q3, right, you don't have that big tough compare, so to speak on the volume side, then the speaking to global. So is there like, should we be thinking on the global side that it's sales the trajectory of that year-over-year should in theory really improve right assuming that shipments are still due to a pretty good relative to pre-pandemic because it kind of, it feels like we kind of all run a model down still, but obviously the year-ago does matter. So just any color on that would be helpful. Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes. I would say that in the QSR side, the big QSRs that demand seems to be just fine there. They figured out the model, and they're leveraging the drive-throughs and so forth. And there are other parts of that business, that sell to more sit-down restaurants and that's going to continue to look like our Foodservice. And then, in our international sales, okay, again that varies by country. We cited China and Australia being relatively strong, but there are some other international locations, which aren't strong. European to take you now, recognize Europe's not in our sales line. It's down in the equity earnings. And so, in Europe, the QSR don't have to drive through, so we'll have some headwinds there just because they don't have the same model. Rob Dickerson : And then just lastly very quickly, so if I kind of have to ask the past month or so, I think a lot of investors kind of come to and sale we've heard there might have been some contract pressure over the larger QSR domestically. I have no evidence of that from here you speaking to it sounds like things are pretty good, so to speak and what I'm hearing, so kind of give you the opportunity to address that so I just asked, because we've had - so many people asked me, is there any contract pressure in any larger QSRs? That's all. Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes. We don't specifically talk about customers and negotiations. What I will tell you is just like every other year we go through contract season with our customers, so to speak. And just like last year, just like the year before, this year we kind of came through as we expected and so that's generally where we ended up. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : Good morning and thanks for all the detail on current trends. In the press release and in the prepared remarks, you mentioned your view that the overall frozen potato industry demand could approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of this calendar year. I just wanted to clarify, how this would have quite a Lamb Weston would you assume that the company's sales trends would be comparable to the overall industry? Or are there reasons why you might diverged from the industry, either because of a different channel mix than the industry or because of some customer wins or loses that have been taken place? Rob McNutt : This is Rob. In terms of our overall performance again, the Foodservice business, that's where we expect to see the snapback. As we talked about the QSRs have largely kind of held their own. So really in the Foodservice is where we'll see a lot of that strength. And so, and then some of those international markets where we've talked about that has been a little more challenge. And so those are the areas where we think we'll see the strength. And again, as Tom talked about in terms of the capacity unlock that supply chain team is working on, while we haven't spent the capital for a new line per se. The guys are figuring out some ways to get some capital out. So if you think about that, the ability to service that capacity. I think our international sales team is well set up and well positioned. And we've talked about our Foodservice sales team with that direct sales model movement to being in a favored position relative to maybe some of our competitors who are more broker oriented that adjusted their service model, a little bit cost of that and so we do feel good that we'll have relative opportunities. Tom Palmer : So just to clarify what you mean by that is, you think you could either grow with the industry, if not better when you say return to pre-pandemic? Tom Werner : Exactly. Tom Palmer : And then just wanted to ask, you wrapped up prepared remarks with the commentary on contract renegotiations. I just wanted to clarify exactly what this means. So if you're saying that the contracts that were renegotiated this year were flat and then should we assume that the contracts that kind of rollover have the typical price increases that are normally baked into them. And so kind of the net-net of your contract basket would be positive or do you mean the net-net would be flattish? Tom Werner : Well, the contracts, as I stated earlier were - that we talked about and worked on this year and got negotiated we're at what we expected. And we don't necessarily get into the economics of that, so it's just we go through it, just like we do every other year. And there are some contracts that we have that there is inflationary pricing mechanisms that are adjusted every year and those contracts are in place, automatically the changes based on inflation just gets pass-through, so it's where we're at, just take every other year nothing's really changed. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : So maybe just to pick up first on the Tom questions on around inflation and pricing and I guess more on just focused on inflation. Can you give us sort of an update on what you're seeing now? I think like cooking oils have inflated recently and we know that freight costs are higher. Don't really know or would like to get maybe get some insight too is, in terms of grower inflation just is there inflation and things like, I don't know fertilizer seed potatoes, order. Just trying to get a sense of whether or not the industry or you'll feel maybe a little bit more input inflation as we move into the out-year versus what you've seen over the last - over the last few years? Tom Werner : Yes. Bryan, I'm not - but that I'm going to address the crop. As we do every year, we don't get into specifics, until we get through the negotiating which that's happening as we're talking here. So down the road, July, October we'll talk about what the overall crop looks like and economics of all that, just like we do every year, so... Rob McNutt : Yes, Bryan, it is Rob. If you think about it, I mean a lot of that is driven by energy fuel whether it's diesel to run the tractor, whether it's gas going into fertilizer production, things like that and those tend to move together. You've mentioned edible oils specifically, and yeah, there has been a little bit of an upswing in the market, recognize we do hedge and so - and enter into longer-term contracts in that. And so if you put all that together, I think that low-single digit inflation overall is what we're looking at in the near term. And as Tom said, as we go through raw negotiations, we'll see how that comes out. Bryan Spillane : And then just a second one related to innovation pre-pandemic, you look at last year and there is some nice upside, I guess, from some of the limited time offers and some of the more value added innovation, particularly with QSRs. So as we start to normalize, is there - can you give us just some color on kind of what the innovation pipeline maybe looking like and whether there is maybe a little bit of maybe a pipeline I guess that's maybe backed up a little bit in terms of getting some new products and some innovation into the market, just because it's been so disrupted over the last 10 months or 11 months. Tom Werner : You can understand is, I'm not going to get into a lot of the specifics of some of the things we're working on. We do have a full pipeline. I will tell you one thing that we are accelerating is our Crispy on Delivery offering and we came out with that about 15 months, 18 months ago and we're applying that technology to some different fry formats. So with the - and it's right in the sweet spot of delivery and drive-through and all those kind of things and we're getting some traction on it. It's a small base, but it's the growth on Crispy on Delivery is accelerating. Operator : We can now take our next question from Chris Growe of Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris Growe : Sort of a couple of questions on. The first one just be it in the bit of follow-ons earlier questions. You did note the higher cost approximately potatoes out of storage, that have been storage longer. I'm just trying to get a sense of your potato supply and the adjustments you made to supply to potentially that was later in the year. Do you feel like you're in a good place on the supply and therefore the future cost for processing those potatoes? Tom Werner : Yes, Chris. Like I said earlier, we're very well balanced with raw needs based on our latest forecast for the remainder of the year. So I feel very comfortable where we're at. And just in terms of the raw cost impact with the demand change last spring-summer, we made a decision to store and around potatoes longer than we ever had. And the implications of that is you just don't get the yield that we're used to based on in stores longer and it's just as a perform in the factories as well as the laundry storage. So we're through all that. Going forward with the current crop in storage, we will process that on a normal timeline as we have in previous years, so it was just a one-off thing. It was a decision based on the change in demand to utilize the old crop longer. So it's, but that's all behind us now. Chris Growe : Just wanted to clear on that. And then I just have a second question. We've had a number of questions around the - with the large chain contracts and some of the potential pricing elements. So just curious, are there one-time things you're doing or I mean that may weigh on pricing of it that I meant to drive better demand. I know we've talked about limited time offering, quite the opposite of that there could be an item at restaurants used to try to regenerate demand. Are other things are doing that are more pricing promotion driven the short-term and your pricing in those large contracts? Tom Werner : No. We're not seeing anything, any change that's driving demand. The interesting thing Chris that we - I wish to look at all kinds of different data. The encouraging thing is the importance of fries on menu is at an all time high. Now in theory if you say look if that holds as demand returns that's going to further add to overall French Fry demand going forward. And that's an interesting thing that we're monitoring, right now to understand and whether that holds or not remains we seen, but again, you look for positive in this and that's one thing that is really intriguing to us, because that could be, if it holds to the level that's holding on the importance, menu importance that's going to elevate demand even further than what we believe it's going to come back by the end of the calendar year, which is close of pre-pandemic levels. Operator : We can now take our next question from William Roger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. William Roger : I just have two quick ones. Last quarter you laid out what the one-time costs were associated with COVID. I was wondering if you could lay out that again for the second quarter and then what of those will remain post COVID? Rob McNutt : Yes. This is Rob. In terms of the detail of that cost, we've really concluded that those are just part of our operating cost now. And frankly, if you go back to the first quarter and then when we took a write-off on raw and we were shutting down lines for a long period of time. They were really easy to carve out. We did give some detail on like what the increased sanitation protocols and so forth and PPE and so forth are in the plants and that continues on. The rest of it, as you bring in lines up and down. It's become more difficult to really separate out what's operating versus COVID. And so just embedded into our cost structure on an ongoing basis now and so, it clearly our cost structure should improve as the virus gets less and less. And we have less impact on our pruning, and so forth. It's just gotten to the point where it's part of our normal operations of our business and embedded in our costs. So we're not breaking that out. William Roger : And then in terms of the gross margin pressures in the quarter that capacity utilization as well as this aged potato crop that had larger storage costs associated with that. I guess, which one of those was larger and will we continue to see the headwind of the elevated storage costs on your inventory or are you through that? Rob McNutt : Yes. In terms of the storage cost that was just the carryover from old crop. We got through the manufacturer that crop in the first and early part of the second quarter. And so, sitting in inventory and then sold and we're out of that now in the second quarter. So we shouldn't see that as a headwind going forward. William Roger : Okay. And I guess just one more, if I can sneak it in. The last time you gave us an update on a leverage target, it was 3 times to 4 times, is that still the range? Rob McNutt : Yes. We haven't changed our leverage targets at all. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Carla Casella of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Carla Casella : Most of my questions have been answered, but I guess given some of the weakness you're seeing. Is there ability to pick up new contracts and new business has that changed. You talked about some of the competition on the lower end and the contracts for the private, but I guess that sounds like it's more your existing. Can you just talk about new businesses and the opportunities there? Tom Werner : Yes. This is Tom. The team we're always talking to potential new customers, obviously, with the demand change those are more difficult. A lot of the customers that we have embark to is, initially, it was about assured supply, so kind of we got all that settled down as we go through the pandemic and our team, our sales team, are on the ground searching for new opportunities. And that really hasn't changed from a market standpoint. Operator : This concludes the Q&A session. Mr. Congbalay I would like to hand the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thank you all for joining our second quarter call. If you want to step a follow-up session, please pass me an email and we can get that scheduled, but again thanks for joining us and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call.

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston.  Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we\u2019ll make some forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today\u2019s remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment and our recently announced investment in China, while Rob will provide some details on our third quarter results, as well as some shipment trends for the fourth quarter. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid sales volumes in the third quarter as restaurant traffic and consumer demand improved as governments gradually ease social and on-premise dining restrictions in some markets.  While still down year-over-year, the rate of volume decline improved sequentially in both the U.S. and in our key international markets from what we realized during the first half of our fiscal year. Again, this was largely in response to governments easing restrictions as the quarter progressed and demonstrates that consumers are ready to go out as restaurants expand dining capacity. Specifically, overall restaurant traffic in the U.S. was between 85% and 90% of pre-pandemic levels. Traffic at large quick service chain restaurants continued at roughly prior-year levels as they leveraged drive-thru, takeout, and delivery formats. After a slow start to the quarter, traffic at full-service restaurants recovered to 70% to 80% of prior year levels. Traffic began to pick up later in the quarter as some governments gradually lifted social and dining restrictions that were put in place due to the resurgence of COVID, and as the relatively mild winter weather provided more outdoor dining opportunities.  While we expect this momentum will continue, we are mindful that some of this performance may be due to customers and distributors restocking inventories prior to an expected boom in restaurant traffic in coming months. In contrast, demand in non-commercial customers, which includes lodging and hospitality, healthcare, schools and university, sports and entertainment, and workplace environments remain around 50% of prior-year levels for the entire quarter. We are confident that demand from these customers will return but realize that recovery to pre-pandemic levels may take some time as governments slowly lift restrictions for larger gatherings. In retail, demand in the quarter was strong with weekly category volume at 115% to 125% of prior year levels as consumers continued to eat more meals at home.  Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic and fry demand has been mixed. In Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand in the quarter was 80% to 85% of prior year levels. However, we believe that demand rate is likely to soften as governments re-impose severe social restrictions in response to the resurgence of COVID infections. Demand in most of our international markets in Asia, Oceania, and Latin America improved in the quarter. Our shipments in China were strong. Demand in our other key markets in the aggregate remained below prior year levels, but continued to improve sequentially versus the first half of the year as well as in each month of the quarter.  So while demand in Europe remained soft, we feel good about the demand trends in the U.S. and most of our key international markets, and we expect governments will continue to gradually roll back social restrictions in the months ahead as more of their citizens get access to vaccines. This should serve to unlock pent-up consumer demand to visit restaurants and other food service outlets and ultimately demand for fries. As a result, we remain optimistic the overall frozen potato demand will steadily approach pre-pandemic levels on a runrate basis by the end of calendar 2021. The progress we\u2019ve made on sales volume in the quarter was offset by the pandemic\u2019s continued effect on our supply chain operations.  As Rob will discuss later, COVID-related disruptions significantly affected our production, transportation, and warehousing networks leading to significantly higher costs, as we focused on customer service, while dealing with the pandemic\u2019s impact in some of our communities and workforce.  In addition, decisions that we made in the first half of the year to defer certain capital, repair and maintenance projects further reduced our flexibility to manage disruptions and drove incremental manufacturing and distribution costs. So, in summary, in the third quarter, we delivered solid top-line results. Operating in a pandemic environment has been and will continue to be challenged, and we expect that we\u2019ll continue to incur higher costs across our supply chain in the near-term. Before I turn the call over to Rob, let me review a couple of items. First, we\u2019ll provide our normal update for this year\u2019s potato crop when we report earnings in July and October. Second, as you may have seen a couple of weeks ago, we announced that we\u2019re building a new French fry processing facility in China at a total investment of around $250 million.  This Greenfield facility will complement our planned Shangdu and is expected to add about 250 million pounds of frozen potato product capacity. We anticipate starting up the plant sometime during the back half of calendar 2023. We chose to build this plant in China because it\u2019s a fast-growing one billion pound plus market and a key driver to our international growth.  This new plant enables us to support customers in China using in-country supply, which is something that our larger customers there increasingly want as they continue to expand. In addition, our new facility will allow us to further diversify our manufacturing base and mitigate risks to potential trade disruptions as we look to drive international growth. So, in summary, in the third quarter, we delivered solid top-line results as demand continued to gradually recover, but incremental costs related to pandemic-related disruptions pressured earnings. We expect that the increasing availability of COVID vaccines and the easing of government imposed social restrictions will allow restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses, and we remain optimistic that overall frozen potato demand will approach pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. Now, let me turn the call over to Rob. Robert McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales results as overall demand continued to improve, but the pandemic\u2019s disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations significantly increased our costs. Specifically in the quarter, net sales declined 4% to $896 million. Sales volume was down 6%, largely due to the pandemic\u2019s impact on fry demand, but improved through the quarter after a slow start. Importantly, that rate of volume decline improved sequentially from the 14% decline that we realized during the first half of fiscal 2021.  Most of the sequential improvement was within our Global segment and largely reflects a steady recovery in shipments in our key international markets. Stronger sales of limited time offering products in the U.S. also contributed to the Global segment\u2019s recovery.  In addition, we saw a sequential improvement in our Foodservice segment led by casual dining as well as continued strength by our branded offerings in our Retail segment. Price mix increased 2%. Improved price in our Retail and Foodservice segments as well as favorable mix in Retail drove the increase. Price was up in our Global segment, although this was offset by negative mix. Gross profit declined $54 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing and distribution costs more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix and productivity savings. Let\u2019s focus on cost of goods sold. As Tom noted, the higher cost were largely a result of the pandemic\u2019s disruptive impact across our supply chain. The resurgence of COVID in many of the communities where our plants are located greatly affected our manufacturing workforce.  At times, the combination of the infected and quarantined employees significantly affected our ability to staff production lines and other key roles at a number of our facilities. The consequences were first, we lost days of production, which resulted in a number of our plants operating well below normal utilization rates, and reduced our ability to cover fixed overhead costs.  In addition, recall that a year ago, we decided to continue paying employees despite production lines being down due to COVID. While we believe that was a right thing to do to support our production teams, it has had an impact on our cost structure.  Second, focusing on maintaining customer service levels required us to quickly adjust production schedules to accommodate workforce and manufacturing line availability. This drove incremental costs and inefficiencies. In many cases, we shifted production from one facility to another, even though the alternate facility may not be the most effective in terms of cost or throughput for that specific product. That negatively impacted line speeds, throughput and raw potato recovery rates.  And third, the number of effective employees and facilities meant that we incurred even more costs related to temporary shutdown and restart of manufacturing facilities. Compounding these disruptions in the quarters were our decisions to defer certain capital, repair and maintenance projects on our production lines that were originally scheduled for the first half of fiscal 2021.  We planned on undertaking these capital and maintenance projects once the demand environment and our operations were more stable during the second half of the year. While deferring these projects was prudent in light of the uncertainties surrounding COVID, executing them at the same time as another COVID wave impacted our plants led to additional disruption in our manufacturing capabilities and further limited our flexibility to adjust production schedules across our network. This drove additional costs and inefficiencies on top of the staffing-related issues I described. The pandemic induced volatility in our production facilities also had a downstream impact on our transportation and warehousing operations. We generally prefer to rely on rail more than trucking to move products from our production facilities and warehouses to our distribution centers and customers across the country.  However, late changes to production schedules required us to switch significant volume from rail to trucking, which is more flexible, but also higher cost in an effort to maintain customer service levels. In addition, we typically employed trucks using contracted carrier rates, as opposed to securing spot trucking, which tends to be higher cost. Spot trucking has also had significant rate increases over the past six months, but because of the disruption to our production schedules and again to prioritize customer service, we leaned more on expensive spot trucking.  So our transportation cost significantly increased because of an unfavorable mix of rail and trucking, as well as an unfavorable mix of contracted and spot trucking. As you would expect, our warehousing cost also increased with the additional handling required across our distribution network. Finally, while the pandemic-related effects on our supply chain were the primary drivers of our cost increases, we also realized higher cost due to input cost inflation in the low-single-digits. We expect that rate will begin to tick up in the coming quarters as edible oil and transportation costs continue to increase. While our costs were higher in the quarter, we are starting to see the benefits of our supply chain team\u2019s work around a series of initiatives we call Win As One. These initiatives build upon the Lamb Weston operating culture productivity programs that we have in place.  Broadly speaking, Win As One seeks ways to reduce our variable and fixed cost, increase production throughput on existing assets and improve working capital, especially inventories. In the couple of the plants where the team has implemented these new ways of working, asset utilization is at or above pre-pandemic utilization rates and we are seeing the benefit in the cost structures in those facilities. As the team continues to rollout these programs to the rest of the network and as infection and quarantine rates decline through vaccination programs we are supporting for our production employees, we expect our cost structure and utilization rates will begin to normalize. Longer term, we expect these initiatives to enhance margins, drive cash flow and strengthen our culture of continuous improvement.  Since we only began to rollout Win As One at a couple of our plants few months ago, we are not providing any specifics on activities or targets today. We anticipate giving investors more insight into this program as we gain more traction. Moving to the segments, moving on from cost of sales, excuse me, our SG&A increased $8 million in the quarter. The increase was largely due to investments we are making behind the Win As One initiatives I just described.  Equity method earnings were $11 million, excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and a comparability item in the prior year quarter, equity earnings declined about $11 million.  Two factors drove the decline. First, fry demand in Europe fell as much of the region remained in lockdown and as colder weather affected outdoor dining. Second, our joint ventures also realized higher production cost related to COVID disrupting their manufacturing and distribution operations. Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures was $167 million, which is down $61 million. Lower income from operations drove the decline. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.45, which is down $0.32 mostly due to lower income from operations.  EPS was also down due to higher interest expense reflecting our higher average total debt resulting from actions we took to \u2013 in late fiscal 2020 and early fiscal 2021 to enhance our liquidity position. Now moving to our segments, sales for our Global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American-based QSR and full service restaurant chains, as well as all sales outside of North America were down 2% in the quarter. Volume was down only 2%, which is much better than the minus 12% we realized during the first half of fiscal 2021. Shipments to large chain restaurant customers in the U.S., of which approximately 85% are to QSRs increased nominally versus prior year. QSRs continued to perform well as they continue to leverage drive-thru and delivery formats. As I mentioned earlier, U.S. QSRs were also aided by the return of some noteworthy limited time product offerings. International shipments, which historically comprise about 40% of the segment\u2019s volume were about 95% of prior year levels in the aggregate. That\u2019s up from around 75% of prior year levels that we realized during the first half of fiscal 2021.  In the third quarter, shipments in China were strong versus the prior year when demand was negatively impacted by COVID. Shipments to our other key markets strengthened as the quarter progressed and were generally stronger in developed markets than emerging ones. Price mix was flat with positive price offset by unfavorable mix. Global\u2019s product contribution margin, which is gross profit, less A&P expense declined 27% to $79 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost, as well as unfavorable mix drove the decline. Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 22%. Volume declined 24%.  After a slow start, shipments to smaller chain and independent full service and quick service restaurants recovered to about 90% of prior year levels for the entire quarter as governments gradually ease social and indoor dining restrictions. We believe that some of the sales volumes strengthening during the last few weeks of the quarter may reflect distributors restocking inventory in anticipation of more governments lifting social restrictions in the spring.  However, it\u2019s difficult to gauge the extent of that benefit. In contrast, shipments to non-commercial customers remained at around 50% of prior year levels with continued strength in healthcare more than offset by weakness in the other channels such as travel, hospitality and education. Price mix increased 2% behind the carryover pricing benefit of pricing actions we took in the second half of fiscal 2020. This was partially offset by unfavorable mix versus the prior year due to lower sales of the premium products. As we\u2019ve discussed in previous earnings calls, we\u2019ve regained much of this business since pandemic first struck last spring, but on a year-over-year basis, it remained a mix headwind for the quarter. Foodservice\u2019s product contribution margin declined 30% to $70 million. Lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing and distribution cost and unfavorable mix drove the decline and was partially offset by favorable price. Sales for our Retail segment increased 23% with volume up 13%. Sales of our branded portfolio, which include Alexia, Grown in Idaho and licensed restaurant trademarks were up about 45%, continuing the strong growth trend we\u2019ve seen since the start of the pandemic and well above category volume growth rates that have been between 15% and 25% in the quarter. The increase in our branded volume was partially offset by the loss of certain low-margin private-label volume, which will continue to be a headwind on volume through the remainder of the fiscal year. Price mix increased 10%, primarily reflecting the favorable mix benefit of selling more of our higher margin branded products. Retail\u2019s product contribution margin increased 15% to $33 million. The increase was driven by favorable mix and was partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs, as well as $1 million increase in advertising and promotional expense. Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position, we continue to be comfortable with our liquidity position and confident in our ability to continue to generate cash. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly $715 million of cash on hand and our revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was more than $2.7 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 3.5 times. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, we generated nearly $375 million of cash from operations, which is down about $60 million versus last year due to lower sales and earnings. We spent $107 million in CapEx and paid $101 million of dividends.  In addition, in the third quarter, we resumed our share buyback program and bought back nearly $13 million worth of stock at an average price of just over $77 per share. Now turning to our current shipment trends. Please note that instead of providing a comparison to last fiscal year\u2019s fourth quarter, we are providing comparisons to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. We are doing this since fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which includes March, April and May of 2020 includes the severe impact of government imposed social restrictions at the beginning of the COVID pandemic.  It was also the height of personal and economic uncertainty for many businesses and individuals. As such, we believe the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 provides a more meaningful comparison for investors to understand the current condition of our business. Broadly speaking, we are optimistic about the recent restaurant traffic and significant \u2013 and shipment trends in the U.S. and many of our key international markets other than Europe. U.S. shipments in the four weeks ending March 28 were approximately 90% of levels during a similar period for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. In our Global segment, shipments to our large QSR and full service chain restaurant customers in the U.S. were more than 85% of fiscal 2019 levels and we expect that rate will largely continue for the remainder of the fourth quarter.  In our Foodservice segment, shipments to our full service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and non-commercial customers in aggregate were approximately 90% of fiscal 2019 levels. We anticipate that shipments for these customers will largely continue at similar rate for the remainder of the fourth quarter. Shipments to non-commercial customers, which have historically comprised about 25% of the segment\u2019s volume remained at around half of fiscal 2019 levels. We expect these shipment rates will likely remain soft for the rest of the quarter and will likely take time to fully recover from \u2013 to pre-pandemic levels. In our Retail segment, shipments were approximately 110% of fiscal 2019 levels with strong volume growth of our branded products, partially offset by a decline in shipments of private-label products. We believe this rate may gradually decline during the remainder of the fourth quarter, as consumers begin to shift purchases of fries to dining at restaurants as governments lift social restrictions. Outside the US, overall demand varies by market. In Europe, shipments by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture were at about 85% of fiscal 2019 levels. Demand has softened over the past few months as governments in some of our larger markets such as Italy and France re-imposed stricter social restrictions to combat resurgence in COVID infections. In addition, other than in the UK, vaccination efforts across Europe have lagged well behind rates in the U.S. As a result, we anticipate shipments may slow during the remainder of the fourth quarter. Shipments to our other international markets, which primarily include Asia, Oceania and Latin America, were approximately 75% of fiscal 2019 levels in aggregate.  As I discussed earlier, international shipment rates have steadily improved over the past few months and we expect that will continue during the remainder of the fourth quarter as governments slowly ease social restrictions and as the current congestion at shipping ports begins to clear up. For those markets that are currently already operating under more lenient social restrictions, we anticipate that current shipment rates for those countries will largely remain at current levels. In short, although Europe is challenging, we believe overall shipment and restaurant trends in the U.S. and most of our international markets will remain favorable as governments continue to roll back social restrictions and vaccine becomes more widely available.  These trends will keep us on a path of steady progress in restaurant traffic, which we believe will lead to overall frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic levels on a runrate basis by the end of calendar 2021. With respect to costs, in the fourth quarter, we expect to incur a similar level of incremental pandemic-related manufacturing and distribution costs as we did in the third quarter. We experienced significant disruption in our production facilities, transportation and warehousing networks in January and February and this continued into March. We will realize some of the costs related to these disruptions in the fourth quarter as we ship finished goods inventory produced during these months. Now, here is Tom for closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Rob. Let me just quickly sum up by saying, we continue to prioritize ensuring the health and safety of our employees during these challenging times by adhering to strict COVID protocols in all of our manufacturing locations and encouraging all our workers and their families to get vaccinated as soon as possible. We are confident that the near-term pandemic-related pressures on our manufacturing and distribution networks are temporary and that our cost structure will normalize once we get past COVID. In addition, we believe that the investments we are making in our supply chain will improve our cost structure over the long-term. We feel good about the trends in restaurant traffic and frozen potato demand in the U.S. and most of our key international markets and remain optimistic that overall frozen potato demand will approach pre-pandemic levels on a runrate basis by the end of calendar 2021. And finally, as shown with our investments for a new facility in China and to expand chopped and formed capacity in Idaho, we are focusing on the right strategic and operating priorities to serve our customers and build upon the long-term health of the category in order to create value for all our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us today. Now we are ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Robert McNutt : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : I know this could be little difficult, but I was hoping maybe you could help us maybe quantify a little bit, if you could some of these incremental COVID costs that I know you believe are largely transitory. And if demand ultimately returns on a run rate basis by the end of calendar year to pre-pandemic levels, I guess would you expect these higher costs under that kind of a scenario to bleed into the beginning of fiscal 2022?  Is that sort of an expectation we should have at this point or do we think that if this steady pace of improvement in restaurant traffic continues that it\u2019s largely more of a 4Q issue? And then I just got a follow-up Robert McNutt : Okay. Andrew, it\u2019s Rob. In terms of quantifying it, again, we did stop breaking that out as a specific as we viewed it as more normal. I think we started that in Q2, I believe. But the way I would think about it is that, you know what pricing has done. You know, we\u2019ve got modest input cost inflation.  And so, if you go back historically and look at margins, that would give you a sense of what margins should be in a normalized \u2013 ex the COVID costs. And I would argue that the bulk of any margin difference there is going to be related to COVID costs. And so, I think you can back into it that way and come pretty close. In terms of bleeding into Q1, again, it\u2019s going to depend on how quickly we can get people in the plants vaccinated and back to normal production and operating schedules. Again, we see demand recovering as we\u2019ve said by the end of calendar 2021 to pre-COVID levels.  And so, as you think about that, that tells you the operating \u2013 the pull on the demand side ought to be there, and so it\u2019s back to \u2013 as long as we can get people in the plants to operate the plants, we should over time get costs back to where they are.  But again, that will take some time to get people vaccinated, get them back into plants and stabilize all of that. So, I anticipate that certainly into Q4, and we\u2019ll probably have some bleed over into Q1 as well. Andrew Lazar : And then, this is just using back-of-the-envelope math and the comments, Rob, that you gave around sort of the first-month trend of fiscal 4Q. Based on that, it would seem to suggest maybe sales down around 10% versus 4Q of 2019, and that\u2019s sequentially a bit better than what we saw for the two-year trends in 1Q and 2Q, but maybe not quite as much as I would have expected during reopening and vaccine rollout and everything else, and so I didn\u2019t know if the math was generally right as we\u2019ve got it and if I was maybe expecting the sequential improvement to be a little bit greater in 4Q than it would suggest? Robert McNutt : Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Andrew, and I think if you look at Q4 of 2019, particularly I think in our global business that we \u2013 it was pretty strong for us. So, the comp is tough in that one. The other one is \u2013 and you know what, as I mentioned that in our foodservice business, we believe there is a bit of restocking going on. We\u2019ll see how that plays out through Q4 in actuality, but that\u2019s one where maybe we are taking maybe conservative perspective on that. Does that makes sense? Andrew Lazar : Yes. Great. Thanks very much. Robert McNutt : Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Bryan. Robert McNutt : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : So, just two questions for me. One, maybe just related to Andrew\u2019s question about the sales trends. I think, in the press release you talked about U.S. QSRs for U.S. Global running I think at 85% of prior year, and I think that\u2019s down, right. I think it was running at 95% when you reported the second quarter. So, A, is that true; and B, just is there something in the comps or just what\u2019s happening there that would have suggested maybe a slowdown or is there a slowdown suggested in that? Robert McNutt : Yes, I think that, again, that goes back to the comp back to 2019, if you look at the Global. And so, the comp to 2019, again that Q4 2019 had been a particularly strong quarter in the Global business unit if you [multiple speakers]. Bryan Spillane : Okay. So\u2026 Dexter Congbalay : Yes, maybe, Bryan \u2013 hey, Bryan, it\u2019s Dexter. In short, we don\u2019t see a slowdown versus if you think about it on Q3, Q4 sequential. I mean, the U.S. North American business is holding up well. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then second question, just could you give us a sense of where you stand now in terms \u2013 and I don\u2019t know what the right measure is, but COVID impacting, I guess the production rate, whether it\u2019s absenteeism or utilization rates or it seems like it surged to maybe a little bit more than you expected at some point during the third quarter.  I am just trying to get a sense of, like, current state of business, has it improved at all or are you still pretty much at the same level of absenteeism that you were experiencing in the third quarter? Tom Werner : Hey Bryan, it\u2019s Tom. I would say it is improving. We have taken a number of actions several weeks ago to encourage our employees to get vaccinated, but we are seeing improvement and the thing Rob talked about in his prepared remarks, the thing that I made the decision that we are going to service our customers, so that is causing, as we take the plants down like Rob said, we are moving things around, and it\u2019s very unnatural for us right now. This is not a systemic problem. This is a short-term issue that we\u2019ll continue to manage through, but we\u2019ve got the right team focused on the course corrective actions and \u2013 but there\u2019s adjustments every week on production and that\u2019s a decision. It\u2019s right for the company. It\u2019s right for us to service our customers for the long-term but it is improving. And I think as the employees and people get vaccinated and we are still following our protocols at the plants to keep the employees safe, but we are seeing improvement and it will gradually improve and I suspect we get to summer and we should be in pretty good shape close to the normalized runrates. Bryan Spillane : All right. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Rob. Tom Werner : You bet. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning, Chris. Chris Growe : Just \u2013 hi, just had a question for you if I could ask first about the international performance and really focus more on the outlook. You had indicated that the Europe, I guess, I understand given there has been some incremental restrictions there. But in some of those other key markets that I think about Asia and Oceania in particular.  And I know Latin America be a little weaker right now given restrictions in those markets, but to run at 75% of 4Q 2019 levels, I was surprised to that degree of decline or lower level of shipments. I just want to understand the kind of \u2013 the investment in China being very strong, but there are other markets that are weighing on that, especially in that Asia region that maybe resulting in this weaker performance overall? Robert McNutt : Yes, this is Rob. If you take to the Philippines, it\u2019s a little bit light, but we\u2019ve also had some miss in the shifts. We\u2019ve moved some of the business that has come through our top-line historically resumed to Lamb-Weston/Meijer.  And so, some of that\u2019s just shipped within our overall platform is part of it. But the other piece that just in the near term that\u2019s playing a little bit of a role is the port issues and some of the logistics channels as you\u2019ve seen more globally where getting containers available and so on and so forth is having an impact. We think that will clean up, but that\u2019s also having an impact on those volumes. Chris Growe : Okay. That port issue, was that an issue in the quarter or more issues, say going forward like in Q4 and moving forward? Robert McNutt : Well, it's certainly an issue in the quarter to some degree with exports. But going forward, it's not cleaned up yet and we are in the same boat as everybody else who is exporting out of the Port of Seattle and the West Coast ports that container availability and ship reliability. So we'll see a bit of what we think into this quarter, as well. Chris Growe : Okay. And then, there were some reports recently about potato cost being down from this current crop and I know that can vary by region and state and what not? I just want \u2013 I want to get just the overall sense that we are going to get a better update on the crop conditions. But can you talk at all about what\u2019s been reported at least that potato cost could be down little bit from this coming crop? Tom Werner : Yes, Chris, this is Tom. As I always do in July and October, Chris, I\u2019ll update you on the overall crop condition, acres yield, all those kind of things and I defer on the overall contract pricing as we are all the way close to that. I understand that there is reports out there, but I will address that in July as I always do. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you for that. Tom Werner : Yes. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Hi. Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Hi. So, I guess, I was hoping on the cost issues in the quarter and I \u2013 Tom, Rob, I appreciate that it was kind of a whole cascade of things that kind of snowballed on themselves. But is there any way to disaggregate some of the \u2013 then dimensionalized, some of those individual pieces in terms of the incremental freight expense kind of unplanned downtime, the cost under absorption.  I am just trying to make sure more sense it is to kind of how those really impacted the margin performance and again, where some of that might continue into the upcoming quarter, we can be sensitive to sort of wearing in that impact and then taking that impact out as we get into fiscal 2022 and 2023? Tom Werner : Yes. I think, it\u2019s tough to \u2013 I mean, obvious that we\u2019ve got the data internally, but I don\u2019t want to start down a path of disaggregating that and have an update on. But I guess, what I would say is that that it all stems from not being able to staff and operate those lines because of COVID. And so it\u2019s that cascading effect and so, there is nothing systemic in the operating cost there that I would call out.  It\u2019s really that one-timer or the temporary impact of the COVID. On the transportation side, again, the shifting around from rail to truck and more spot trucking and so forth, that\u2019s temporary as well, driven off of that same issue.  But I would point that that there is generally transportation cost inflation going on. And so, as we go, we contract freight for the coming periods, I think, we like, everybody else are going to see freight cost increase. Robert McNutt : Hey, Adam, it\u2019s Rob. Yes, we have tried to step back from giving on specific numbers. Of course, we got the data internally. But it\u2019s just one of those things that how much it\u2019s really specific to, call it, COVID and that things I could point to that might not be.  So, we are just trying to be careful in terms of doing that and trying to report that kind of going forward because of this and precise signs at the end of the day. But gave you the three biggest drivers plus inflation on our COGS. So, it\u2019s tough to give you a sense of how much specific to each individual item. So, sorry about that. Adam Samuelson : Okay. All right. I think, maybe I\u2019ll circle back with that one. The follow-up question was really on the new China plant and just thinking about those timing and market impact. And is that, do you think as we look at that when it comes online?  Is that \u2013 is there sufficient market growth in China that wouldn\u2019t actually need to displace imports and that the market growth domestically there could absorb that while the import number stays roughly the same or how do you think about the knock on effects of the China plant in terms of their import and how that would get back to the U.S.? Thanks. Robert McNutt : Yes, Adam, it absolutely, that\u2019s into our long-term strategic plan. China is a big market. It\u2019s 1 billion, 1.1 billion pound, it\u2019s been growing at 10% to 15% annually for a number of years. We expect that growth to continue. A lot of the bigger customers are expanding their store fronts, continue to do so and so \u2013 the plant is going to take about two years to come online.  And Adam, it gives us flexibility to shift current export production to in-country, which is another strategic reason to build that plant. And we are committed to China and we\u2019ll be committed to it long-term. But it again adds a geographical flexibility to our overall operating network around the globe and but it\u2019s two years out.  So, these things you got to think through what the category is going to look like in two years in some of these markets and you got to invest in it. And that\u2019s part of one of our strategic pillars is to continue to invest in this company for the long-term and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Adam Samuelson : Okay. Great. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks. Robert McNutt : Thanks, Adam. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : Good morning and thanks for the questions. Tom Werner : Good morning. Robert McNutt : Good morning. Tom Palmer : I appreciate that it\u2019s tough to be overly precise. But I wanted to ask about your segment mix expectations and you noted that volume could be back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the calendar year. How are you thinking about the mix between Global and Foodservice? Based on what you are seeing from customers, do you think that both segments could approach pre-pandemic volumes or should we be thinking about a shift towards the Global side? Tom Werner : Yes, this is Tom. I expect, at the end of the calendar year, based on some of the data we look at things we\u2019re projecting, Foodservice to be back to pre-pandemic levels and it\u2019s as \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen markets in the U.S. not all of them open up and just lift restrictions, we\u2019ve seen them approach or get pretty darn close to pre-pandemic levels.  Now the \u2013 we need some time to work through overall the consumer behavior going back to eat at restaurants or over a longer period of time. But that gives me confidence that there is some pent-up demand for the restaurants in our Foodservice segment and I think we\u2019ll get back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar year and the mix will, say, went into where it was before all that\u2019s happened in terms of segment. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thanks for that. Really helpful. And then, I had kind of a different type of mix. So you noted mix headwinds from a pricing standpoint in both Global and Foodservice during the third quarter. We are lapping some pretty big mix headwinds a year ago in the fourth quarter and here you are a month in with improving volume trends. Should we think about mix kind of swinging to a tailwind as we think about the fourth quarter? Tom Werner : Yes. Obviously, there is a going to be a significant mix change versus Q4 of last year, which everybody knows we are in the deep end of the pandemic. So, the Foodservice, we expect Foodservice trends improve Global\u2019s pretty steady state and growing to pre-pandemic levels.  And retail \u2013 recall, last year retail directionally was up like a 150%. That\u2019s going to taper off. Q3 it was a 105 to 115 roughly. So, the mix shift for us will be skewing back to, I call it more normalized segment mix in Q4. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Rob Dickerson : Hi. Great. Thank you so much. Based on just a question around capacity in the industry and then also your decision to filling into China a little bit, this combines all the comments you are talking about today, this kind of shifting maybe some volume into some less efficient plants. Should we take the China investments kind of as a kind of go forward use of cash as you think about incremental capacity versus potentially looking at some of your footprint within the U.S. and maybe making some of those platforms modernize, so to speak and more efficient? Tom Werner : In terms of China use of cash, that\u2019s we are evaluating that and the way to think about our North America footprint is we\u2019ve had a continual modernization program for five, ten years. So, we are upgrading these plans with the latest technology. There is a certain amount of maintenance we do every year. We are committed to for food safety, to people safety and some of the bigger equipment that\u2019s aged, we replace it. And just in terms of overall capacity in the industry, I think about the category two to three years out and based on our projections on the category growth overall, that\u2019s what drives a lot of our decisions in terms of investing because we got to make a decision now for what we think is going to happen in two to two and a half years.  And that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always operated. And I think the category will come back by the end of the calendar on a normalized runrate basis and I believe it\u2019s going to return to growth. And the things that we are going to do in the near-term is to make sure we are positioned to capture our share, capture the growth and service our customers and continue to evaluate the footprint and the cost competitiveness of our footprint in the marketplace and that will drive the investment decisions going forward, here in the next 12, 15 months. Rob Dickerson : Got it. Okay. So, I mean, for now obviously, it\u2019s a kind of wait and see where the growth goes in the next 12 months, it sounds like the footprint for now is good, right. There is not really a need to necessarily lean into the U.S. side with incremental capacity. But if the street continues to grow, that\u2019s obviously a use of cash potential going forward over the next two years let\u2019s say? Robert McNutt : Yes. I\u2019ll jump in. Think about it this way. We got to think through what the next two years, two, three years the category is going to look like, I am not going to sit and wait and see what happens. So, we are going to make some decisions and potentially move some things forward to get ourselves for the next two, three years.  So we have available capacity to meet the demand in the category growth and service our customers just like we have been in the past, we make decisions now anticipating what two to three years are going to look like. Rob Dickerson : Yes. Fair enough. Thanks a lot. I really appreciate it. Robert McNutt : Yes. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Jenna Giannelli with Goldman Sachs. Jenna Giannelli : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a follow-up on the China plant. Did you talk or have you talked about the cadence of the CapEx spend that you are planning there? And then just in terms of impacts, potential efficiencies gain anything that you can point to from maybe cost example through the expanded capacity and the type of overall benefit from a margin standpoint that you saw? Thanks. Robert McNutt : Yes, Jenna. We have not talked about a cadence of that CapEx spend there. Again it\u2019s $250 million. It will take us about two years to get it in and again, you got lead time more around equipment and progress payments against that. And so, I think, to some degree that it\u2019s going to be \u2013 the bulk of it\u2019s going to be a big chunk of the spend is going to be in the next fiscal year and then following into the last several months before start up there.  And so, some of it will be this year, but the bulk of it\u2019s going to be in next year and into the following year. In terms of efficiencies, clearly, we are going to gain technical efficiencies in areas like recovery, but there are so many variables that go into that. Clearly, labor costs are lower in China than they would be in the U.S.  But you get some offsets in some other things. But clearly, we\u2019ll gain some efficiency there. I will tell you that the folks who have been running our existing plant in Shangdu and we\u2019ve got some debottlenecking there to service growth there have done a great job of managing those assets and extracting the real value out of those. So we are very confident in the team and their ability to deliver when we give them the new asset to work with. Jenna Giannelli : Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s super helpful. And I just have one more if I can. I know that you mentioned that you may have seen it\u2019s hard to gauge, but some pull forward of demand from your Foodservice customers kind of in preparation for what they are expecting is more demand.  So, from your standpoint, how are you thinking about working capital requirements as demand ramps for you and that\u2019s mainly in kind of the Foodservice into a lesser extent that the Global segment? And that\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Robert McNutt : Yes. I think, if you think about the ramp up in that, if you just look at the demand, look at our DSO on the receivables side and what has been historically and we\u2019ll ramp back up to those kinds of levels on our Foodservice. So that\u2019s what we anticipate as we just get back to kind of normal DSO levels when you get to year end and it will carry through the receivables number. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our final question from Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Carla Casella : Hi. One follow-up on the COGS question. Have you \u2013 can you give us a sense of how much of your total COGS is feed grade oil or edible grade oil? Tom Werner : Dexter, I am not sure if we\u2019ve just\u2026 go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : No, we haven\u2019t. Carla, let me take that. We don\u2019t give a specific on that. What we have said on COGS just generally breaking down in a normal environment about roughly a third is raw potatoes, roughly another call it 20%, 25% is going to be a combination in the particular order here of edible oils packaging and miscellaneous ingredients and the remaining call it 40%, 45%, again, no particular order here combination of fixed overhead conversion cost which is largely labor, fuel, electric power and water. And then, finally transportation and warehousing. But we don\u2019t break it down any finer than that. Carla Casella : Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude our Question-and-Answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Hi, everybody. I appreciate the time today and listening to the call. Any follow-up questions or need to speak best thing to do just pop an email and then we can schedule a time. But have a good day, everyone. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today\u2019s call. We appreciate your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Lamb Weston Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, and Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. And Bernadette Madarieta, our CFO designated. Tom will provide a brief overview of fiscal 2021 as well as the current operating environment. Rob will provide some details on our fourth quarter results and Bernadette will discuss our fiscal 2022 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning. And thank you for joining our call today. Let me start by saying that I'm proud of how the entire Lamb Weston team stepped up this year to navigate through the most challenging operating environment in our company's history. We took necessary steps across our organization to focus on the health and wellbeing of our employees while continuing to focus on supporting our customers. At the same time, we continue to make timely investments to execute on our long-term strategic objectives. For our larger customers in our global and foodservice segments, we work through production and distribution challenges to maintain customer service levels and support them as they manage through near term volatility in demand and inventories. We also partnered with several large chain QSR to broaden their menus with new products and limited time offerings and to position them for a more aggressive set of offerings in a post-pandemic environment. In our foodservice segment, despite lower volumes in the near term, we maintain our direct sales force that services independent restaurants. We believed it was important to continue to invest in the sales capabilities to provide these customers with uninterrupted support as they adapted to capacity restrictions in new operating models. That investment is now paying off as sales of Lamb Weston branded products have rebounded. In retail, the surge in food at home consumption during the pandemic provides a strong tailwind to our branded portfolio. Each of our, [Indiscernible], Idaho and licensed restaurant brands gain share as compared to pre pandemic levels. Our branded portfolio market share in aggregate has nearly doubled in the past five years. And we've significantly closed the gap with a leading branded competitor, including what we produce for private label retail customers. We are now the clear leader in the category. In our supply chain, we're making some significant investments to support long-term growth and profitability. First, we began construction of a new chopped and form line in our facility in American Falls, Idaho that will be available in spring 2022. Second, we announced major capacity expansion projects in China and the US. We expect both lines to be operational in the next couple of years, which will have us well positioned to support market growth. In addition, through our joint venture in Europe, Lamb-Weston/Meijer, we announced a capacity expansion project in Russia. And just this morning a \u00a3400 million expansion in the Netherlands. These two expansions will be focused on supporting continued growth in their respective primary markets. Finally, we began to implement our Win As One series of safety, quality and productivity initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and across our procurement, transportation and distribution networks. This is an ambitious program that adopts and tailors lean manufacturing and other productivity tools that have been successfully used by other world class manufacturing organizations. We are excited about how these initiatives will further strengthen our Lamb Weston operating culture of continuous improvement and derive financial benefits such as enhanced margins and cash flow over the long term. We're targeting up to $300 million of gross productivity savings by reducing variable costs and waste while also increasing potato and asset utilization. We're also targeting up to \u00a3300 million of incremental capacity from de-bottlenecking, and other tools to increase throughput on existing assets. To put that into context, \u00a3300 million is equivalent to a new production line. Finally, we're targeting up to a 10% reduction in finished goods inventory, while continuing to target high service levels, and case fill rates. As I mentioned, these are long term targets, we expect benefits from the Win As One initiatives to gradually build as they become fully incorporated across the entire supply chain organization. We completed the initial phase of a new enterprise resource planning system early in the year. However, we defer the second phase which would have had a more direct effect on our manufacturing facilities at a time when those operations were managing through pandemic related disruptions. We continue to map out phase two and expect to begin implementation later this fiscal year. This project will tie into our Win As One initiative to provide better data and systems to drive more efficient execution. So although our results in fiscal 2021 were somewhat choppy due to the pandemic, we focused on the right near-term priorities, while making sure we continued the pursuit of our long-term strategic objectives. The pandemic showed the resilience of the category and our business model with demand and most of our foodservice segment channels largely offset by the performance in QSR and at retail. Our operating cash flow and financial liquidity were solid enabling us to invest in the infrastructure to support growth opportunities. As a result, I'm confident that we are well positioned to derive sustainable profitable growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term. Now turning to the current operating environment. While the pandemic continues to impact people and economies in the US and around the world, we believe the worst of its direct effect on our business restaurant traffic in French fried demand is behind us. We're encouraged by the pace of recovery in restaurant traffic in the US. While overall restaurant traffic remains below pre pandemic levels, it's recovered much of the last round and continues trending in the right direction. In May, QSR traffic was down low single digits versus pre pandemic levels, which is a modest improvement versus what we saw earlier in the year. The larger QSR chains have been generally outperforming small and regional ones with chicken base chains, outperforming more burger orient chains. Overall, traffic at full service restaurants in May was still down mid-teens as compared to pre pandemic levels. But that's a significant improvement versus down mid-20s that we saw just a few months ago. This reflects fewer social restrictions and consumers increased willingness to eat on premises. What's helped to offset the effect of lower restaurant traffic during the year has been an increase in fry attachment rate. Simply put, this is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant. The increase in fried attachment rate has been largely consistent through most of fiscal 2021 and we believe that rate may have some staying power. We believe that a fry orders continue at the higher rate as restaurant traffic normalizes it would lead to a meaningful amount of additional volume demand in the US annually. The increase in fry attachment rate in part helps to explain how our shipments and most of our key restaurant and foodservice channels have already reached or close to pre pandemic levels on a run rate basis despite restaurant traffic not yet fully recovered. Our shipments to large QSR chains essentially reached that level last fall as customers leverage drive thru and delivery formats. Shipments to commercial customers in our foodservice segment have essentially returned in aggregate to pre pandemic levels in the last few months behind strength in small and regional QSR as well as independent restaurants. The recovery shipments to our non-commercial foodservice customers which include lodging and hospitality, healthcare, schools and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environment continues to lag that in restaurants. However, we expect the rate of improvement will steadily increase through the fall especially in our education, lodging and entertainment channels. While restaurant foodservice demand continues to recover, demand in the retail channel continues to be strong. May volumes for the category were 15% to 20% above pre pandemic levels in our shipment of branded products were in line with those trends. However, we expect category growth will likely slow as it lack strong prior year results and as consumers step up food away from home purchases. We have seen these factors already begin to play out in the fourth quarter, and in the first couple of months of fiscal 2022. In short, we feel good about the frozen potato category in the US because of increase in strength and restaurant and foodservice channels, as well as continued solid performance in retail. As a result we remain confident that overall US fry demand will return to pre pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. Outside the US, it's more complicated story. While demand has improved in Europe in our key international markets, the pace of recovery has been much more uneven and generally behind that in the US as a result of slower vaccine availability and rates. In addition, the spread of COVID variants in many markets has also led governments to delay lifting, and in some cases re-imposing social restrictions, which has further increased volatility in demand and stretched out the timing of recovery. Overall, we expect the pace of recovery outside the US will continue to vary with Europe and the developed markets in Asia continuing to generate gradual improvement in demand. We expect the pace of recovery in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East to be more volatile and take a bit longer. With respect to supply chain and our cost environment. As with the pandemics impact on fry demand, we believe the worst of its effect on our supply chain is also behind us. We're making progress and stabilizing our manufacturing operations with a number of production days and throughput in most of our plants during the fourth quarter, improving on a year-over-year basis as well as sequentially versus in third quarter. However, we're not yet consistently operating at targeted levels across our network, and it will take some time as we gradually return to operating at normalized levels. In the near term, we'll realize incremental costs and inefficiencies incurred during and since the fourth quarter as we sell finished goods inventory in the first half of the year. Going forward, the lingering effects of the pandemic and the sharp recovery of the broader economy in the US has disrupted supply chain operations across all industries, including ours, which has resulted in increased costs. As a result, we expect input cost inflation, especially for edible oils, packaging and transportation to be a significant headwind for fiscal 2022. Our goal is to offset inflation using a combination of levers including pricing. To that end, we just began implementing broad base price increases in our foodservice and retail segments. And don't expect to see the most of their benefit until our fiscal third quarter. Before I turn the call over to Rob, let me review a couple of items. First, a few words about the current potato crop. We have recently begun processing early potato varieties in the Pacific Northwest. And early indications are that the recent high temperatures in the Pacific Northwest did not have a negative impact on yield or quality. With respect to the main crop that we harvest in the fall, we expect the recent heat waves may have some negative effect on yield and quality. But it's too early to tell. We will provide our usual updates on the crop when we report our first and second quarter earnings. Second, as you may have seen last week we announced an expansion of our facility in American Falls, Idaho, which will add about \u00a3350 million of French fry capacity. The total investment of around $450 million over the next couple of years is for a new production line, as well as to modernize the infrastructure at the facility. We anticipate starting up the new line by mid-2023, just as we expect capacity will be needed to support demand growth. So in summary, while this has been a challenging year, I'm proud of how the team has navigated through the pandemic's impact and remained focused on supporting our customers in the near term, while continuing to execute on our long-term strategic priorities. We're pleased by the strong recovery in demand in the US and continue to believe that it will be back to pre pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. And finally, while our supply chain is not yet operating where we want it to be, I'm encouraged by the improvement that we're making towards getting back to normalized levels, as well as the actions we're taking to offset input costs inflation. Finally, as we announced a couple of months ago, Rob will be retiring after more than four years with Lamb Weston. As part of the leadership team, he's been instrumental in setting up Lamb Weston as an independent company and creating world class finance and IT organization. With his past experience of manufacturing companies and capital markets along with his insights into the business, Rob has been a valuable voice as we drove growth, broaden our global footprint and navigated through the challenges of the pandemic. As Bernadette will be succeeding Rob as CFO on August 6, after serving as our Comptroller since just before the [Indiscernible]. Bernadette has been a key member of the leadership team from the beginning, and has had a hand in all our major decisions and initiatives. The succession has been long planned, so we expect a smooth transition. So I just want to say thanks, Rob, for being part of the Lamb Watson family. I'm grateful to have Bernadette stepping into her new role. And with that, here's Rob to review our fourth quarter results. Rob McNutt : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we delivered solid top line results in the fourth quarter as demand trends improved. While our earnings continue to reflect the pandemic's disruptive impact on our supply chain, as well as higher inflation. Specifically in the quarter, sales increased 19% to more than $1 billion, which is a company record for the fourth quarter, and within about $10 million of our best quarter ever. Volume was up 13% in price mix of six, excluding the benefit of the extra selling week last year, net sales increased 28% and volume 28% and volume was up 21%. The sales volume increase largely reflected the strong recovery in demand in the US, especially at full service restaurants, as well as improvement in some of our key international markets. It also reflected the comparison to soft shipments last year due to the pandemic which included the impact of customers significantly destocking inventories as they adjusted to the abrupt change in the operating environment. The increase in price mix was driven by favorable price and mix in each of our core business segments. For the year, net sales, excluding the benefit of 53rd week last year, was down 2% with volume down 6% and price makes up 4%. Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased $87 million driven by higher sales and lower supply chain costs on a per pound basis. The overall reduction in cost per pound as compared to the prior year was largely driven by lower incremental costs and inefficiencies related to the pandemics disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations. It also includes a $27 million year-over-year benefit from unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, as well as the absence of a $14 million write-off of raw potatoes that we incurred last year. The reduction in per pound cost was partially offset by inflation for key inputs, especially for edible oils and packaging. Canola oil prices in particular have nearly doubled in the last 12 months. Our transportation costs were also up sharply. While we reduce the pandemics downstream disruptive effect on our distribution network, we continue to use an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail as we took extraordinary steps to maintain customer service levels, as demand turned up sharply. However, the significant increase in our transportation costs was also driven by inflation as rail, trucking, and ocean freight suppliers all struggled to keep up with demand as economic activity surged. Moving on from costs of sales, our SG&A increased $19 million in the quarter. The increase was largely driven by three factors. First, it reflects higher incentive compensation expense, which was significantly down in the fourth quarter last year after the pandemic hit. Second, it reflects investments we're making behind our supply chain productivity, commercial and information technology initiatives that should improve our operations over the long term. And third, it includes an additional $3 million of advertising and promotional support behind the launch of new branded items in our retail segment. Equity method earnings were $10 million excluding the impact of the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $14 million versus a prior year. Higher sales volumes compared to soft shipments in Europe and the US last year, as well as lower manufacturing costs per pound drove the increase. Diluted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.44 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year. The increase reflects higher sales, income from operations and equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.16, down $0.34. Adjusted EBITDA including joint ventures was $166 million, which is up $88 million. The increase was driven by higher sales, income from operations and equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures was $748 million, down $51 million. Moving to our segments, sales for our global segment, which generally includes sales for the Top 100 North American based QSR and full service restaurant chains, as well as all sales outside of North America were up 19% in the quarter, with volume of 16% and price mix up 3%. Excluding the extra selling week last year, sales increased 28% and volume was up 24%. The volume increase largely reflected the year-over-year recovery in demand especially at large chain QSR and full service restaurants in the US. Shipments to these customers in the aggregate have essentially returned to pre pandemic levels. Shipments to customers in our key international markets also increased in the aggregate but remain below pre pandemic levels, as demand recovery continues to lag the US in some of these markets. In addition, traffic and logistics issues affecting ports along the West Coast hindered our export shipments in the quarter. The 3% increase in price mix reflected the benefit of inflation driven price escalators in our multi-year customer contracts, as well as favorable customer mix. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, increased 68% to $56 million. Higher sales volumes, favorable price mix and lower manufacturing and distribution costs per pound drove the increase. Sales for foodservice segment with services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the Top 100 North American restaurant customers increased 82% with volume up 64% and price mix up 18%. Sales increased 94% and volume rose 74% excluding the benefit of the extra selling week last year. Strong increase in sales volumes largely reflected the year-over-year recovery in shipments to small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants as government's further ease social restrictions. The increase also reflected a comparison to soft shipments in the prior year quarter, as customers significantly destocked inventories. Our shipments to non-commercial customers increase at a more modest rate, and currently remain at about two thirds of pre pandemic levels. As Tom noted, we expect the rate of improvement to steadily increase through the fall, as travel and lodging continues to ramp up and as schools and universities return to full capacity. Overall, shipments by our foodservice segment exited the quarter at around 95% of pre pandemic volume. The increase in the segment's price mix largely reflected the benefit of favorable mix from higher sales of Lamb Weston branded and premium products. As you may recall, sales of these products declined sharply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as customers which primarily included independent restaurants, destocked inventories or traded down to more value oriented products during the early days of the pandemic. Since then, our direct sales force has steadily rebuilt shipments of Lamb Weston branded products close to pre pandemic levels. Food Services product contribution margin rose 127% to $96 million, higher sales volumes, favorable price mix and lower manufacturing and distribution cost per pound drove the increase. Sales for our retail segment declined 28% with volume down 30% and price mix up 2%, excluding the extra sales week last year sales declined 22% and volume declined 24%. We expect this decline, it was against a very strong fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which included weekly retail sales for the category that were up around 50% on average, as consumers switch consumption patterns due to government imposed stay-at-home orders. The decline in sales also includes the loss of certain low margin private label volume which will continue to be a headwind through fiscal 2022. With social and on-premise dining restrictions largely lifted in the US, consumer consumption patterns have begun to swing back towards restaurants and away from home outlets. Despite this trend, the frozen potato category of retail remains strong. Overall category sales are currently up about 25% from pre pandemic levels and each of our branded equities continue to outperform the category. The retail segments price mix increased 2% reflecting favorable mix benefit of our branded business. Retail's product contribution margin declined 32% to $21 million; lower sales volumes and a $3 million increase in A&P expenses support the launch of new products drove the decline. Moving toward cash flow and liquidity position; we continued to generate solid cash flow, even while the pandemic severely impacted demand. In fiscal 2021, we generated more than $550 million of cash from operations, which is down about $20 million versus last year, due to lower sales and earnings, partially offset by lower working capital. We spent $161 million in CapEx, [paid 100] in CapEx, paid $135 million in dividends and bought back nearly $26 million worth of stock at an average price of just over $78 per share. We continue to be comfortable with our liquidity position. And at the end of our fiscal year, we had nearly $785 million of cash on hand and our revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was more than $2.7 billion. And our net debt to EBITDA including joint ventures ratio was 2.6x. Before turning the call over to Bernadette, I want to thank Tom and the entire Lamb Weston family for letting me be part of the team. It's been an incredibly rewarding experience. And I know that this team will continue to drive the company's success. In terms of my successor, I've known and worked with Bernadette for around 20 years on and off. And I expect that you'll find that she and I approach things in many respects with a similar mindset. As Tom said, she has been deeply involved in all of the key decisions at Lamb Weston. And that's certainly true in developing the broader finance team and strategy. I'm excited for Bernadette stepped into the role and sees the impact that I know she'll deliver. Now here's Bernadette to review our fiscal 2022 outlook. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Rob. Good morning. And I look forward to meeting everyone in the coming months. As you've heard this morning, we feel good about our top line momentum in the past couple of quarters and expect that to continue in fiscal 2022. For the year, we expect sales growth will be above our long term target of low to mid-single digits, with the drivers of that growth being somewhat different in the first half versus the second. For the first half, we expect growth to be largely driven by higher volume, although we also anticipate that overall price mix will be positive. The expected volume increase reflects the continuing recovery in demand in the US and our key international markets, as well as the comparison to our relatively soft shipments during the first half of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic. For the second half of the year, we expect our sales growth will reflect more of a balance of higher volume and improved price mix. While the volume drivers should be similar to those in the first half, the benefit of the shipment comparisons will be less pronounced, especially late in the year. Pricing in the second half will benefit from the broad based actions in our foodservice and retail segments that became effective in mid July, but won't be mostly realized until our fiscal third quarter. Price in the global segment in the second half should also benefit from price escalators built into multiyear customer agreement. In addition, mix should benefit as our shipments continue to steadily recover in some of our non-commercial channels in our foodservice segments. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to expect overall US French fry demand will return to pre pandemic levels on a run rate basis around the end of calendar 2021, which is essentially the beginning of our fiscal third quarter. With respect to earnings, we expect adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, and net income to gradually normalize as the year progresses. But it will be pressured during the first half by a step up in input and transportation cost inflation, as well as some residual effects of the pandemics disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations. As we noted earlier, we believe the worst of the pandemics impact on our operations is behind us. So we expect these near term cost pressures will steadily ease as we progress to the second half of the year. As you may recall, we generally hold about 60 days of finished goods inventory. So production costs that we incurred within the last couple of months are held on our balance sheet until the inventory is sold. Accordingly, we already have a good idea about the expected impact on our fiscal first and second quarter results from the disruption in our manufacturing assets in the past few months. We expect inflation to be a headwind throughout fiscal 2022, especially in the first half of the year. As Tom noted, we expect volatility in the broader supply chain as the overall economy continues to recover from the pandemic's impact. We believe this will contribute to significant inflation for key inputs, especially edible oils, transportation and packaging, continuing the trend that we began to see during the latter months of fiscal 2021. That said we're pulling a combination of levers which may collectively offset most of these inflationary pressures. First, there's pricing. As we've discussed, we began implementing a round of broad base price increases in our foodservice and retail segments a couple of weeks ago. These increases generally take three to six months to be mostly realized in the market, and will therefore lag the impact of inflation by a couple of quarters. We're also not ruling out the possibility of subsequent rounds of price increases based on the pace and scope of inflation. In our global segments, we're in the middle of negotiating contracts for our larger customers. And the results of those discussions including price won't be known until later this year. However, we will continue to benefit from inflation driven price escalators built into multiyear customer contracts. Second, there's mix. As I also mentioned earlier, we expect a continued recovery in shipments to customers and higher margin foodservice channels. And third, we expect to steadily drive increased productivity with our Win As One lean manufacturing initiatives. So while the ongoing impact of the pandemic is uncertain, we expect these levers together may largely offset inflation and allow us a more stable manufacturing and distribution operations will enable us to improve gross profit during the second half of fiscal 2022. We expect that some of this improvement will be offset by continued investments in our supply chain, commercial and IT operations, especially in the first half of the year. These investments will increase our operating expenses in the near term, but should improve our ability to support growth and margin improvement over the long term. In addition to our operating targets, we anticipate total interest expense of around $115 million. We estimate a full year effective tax rate of between 23% and 24%. And expect total depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately $190 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures of $650 million to $700 million, depending on the timing of spending behind our large capital projects. This CapEx amount is high relative to our past annual levels. And it's largely a function of growth capital to complete the construction of our Top 10 form line in Idaho, as well as to begin construction of new French fry lines in Idaho and China. It also includes capital associated with the second phase of our ERP implementation. So in sum, we expect net sales growth for the year will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits. With growth largely driven by volume in the front half and more of a balance of volume and price mix in the back half. We expect adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures will grow for the year, with earnings pressure in the first half, and gradual improvements towards more normalized results in the second half as operations stabilized and price mix improved. At this time, we're taking a prudent approach by not providing a specific earnings growth targets, given the increased volatility of key inputs and transportation costs, as well as the potential impact of the recent heat wave in the Pacific Northwest on potato yield and quality. Now, here's Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks Bernadette. We feel good about how well the category has been recovering for the pandemic. And believe these positive trends provide a good tailwind for above algorithm sales growth in fiscal 2022. We're making progress and stabilizing our manufacturing network and we are pulling the right levers to gradually normalize operations and offset significant inflationary pressures to improve profitability as the year progresses. With our Win As One productivity initiatives, we're putting in place the lean manufacturing and productivity tools to improve our operations and cost structures so that we can return to you or even exceed pre pandemic margin levels in the coming years. And finally, I'm confident that we're making the right investments to strategically expand our production capacity so that we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth and create sustainable profitable growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term. Thank you for joining us today. And now we're ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tom Palmer with J.P. Morgan. ThomasPalmer: Good morning. I look forward to working with you, Bernadette and Rob, congratulations on your retirement. Thank you for your help over the past few years. I wanted to ask about how costs have ramped over the past few months. Do you expect COGS inflation in the first half of the fiscal year to come in above the COGS inflation you faced in the fourth quarter? Is there a range you can provide? What are the items that have gotten worse over the last couple months? And then just to what extent did your COGS inflation ramp subsequent to you announcing these recent price actions? RobMcNutt: Yes, this is Rob, I'll take that. In terms of COGS inflation, first, remind you that our COGS does have some seasonality, just as the crop, the storage and the crop so encouraging those - incurring the storage costs, as well as the physical deterioration of the crop impacts yield. So that season also pull that aside. The key elements of the inflation have been in the outside of that is normal seasonality have been in edible oils, where we've seen sharp inflation and that really over the last 12 months that started moving up, about not quite a year ago, about almost a year ago, and has been moving up now recently, there's been a little bit more up and down rather than steadily up. So we'll see how that continues to develop and evolve. The other place where we've seen inflation is in packaging, I think that's just driven by general demand for packaging. And then again, the packaging producers, containerboard producers having the same challenges, production wise everybody else's. So those are two key elements that are driving our cost of goods manufactured up. Another piece that's driving our cost of goods manufactured up or has had an impact on it has been the volatility in our manufacturing operations that have is really a carryover from some of the pandemic related things. And as we recover what we're seeing is as demand certain comes up sharply, and we're trying to maintain customer service levels that we're doing some more break-ins to meet customer service levels on manufacturing. And so those are the elements driving manufacturing. On the operation side, as I think Tom mentioned, we're stabilizing those operations and seeing significant improvement there. On the other piece that gets into cost of goods sold is transportation, two elements to that. One is just the overall inflation. And that's really happening in trucking, in rail and in ocean freight across the board. And I think it's pretty common across industries to see that. The other piece, again, is we're maintaining customer service levels at a high level; we've been incurring more spot truck than we have our normal mix of primarily rail to move product to these coasts. So those are the elements in it. In terms of the outlook for inflation. Again the oils, we continue to hedge those and so a lot of oil is hedged through the year, the transportation, as we continue to stabilize operations, and as demand stabilizes, we expect that we'll get to more normalized mix of rail, truck freight. But we think that there's still some choppiness going to occur in costs in terms of spot trucking, and certainly ocean freight off the West Coast for us as we ship to our export markets. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We think that a lot of the oil inflation feels like it's more behind us not to say there won't be more. But the rate of increase over the last 12 months, as I mentioned, is really doubled in canola. So that's a kind of a long winded answer, but I think it covers basis there. ThomasPalmer: Okay, thank you for all that details. In the press release, and then on the prepared remarks you referenced earnings gradually normalize in the second half of the fiscal year. Could you maybe clarify what normalize means? Should we think about margins back within historical ranges, such as what we saw in 2018 and 2019? TomWerner: Yes, that's it. That's what we're expecting. Again Rob walk through this time or Rob walk through the inflationary challenges we're facing. And as we've priced in the market, pricing will catch up in the back half. We expect our operations manufacturing plants to hit pre pandemic throughput levels. And therefore in the back half, we think things - margins will be back to pre pandemic levels. Operator : We'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. AdamSamuelson: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone and Rob congratulations on the retirement. I guess first, maybe continuing on Tom's line of questioning, I just want to see if we can maybe dimensionalize a little bit kind of how much of the margin kind of impact in the quarter and what you're expecting over the next couple quarters is kind of unit cost and efficiencies as it relates to the manufacturing plants and kind of all the COVID impacts relative to underlying kind of non potato costs inflation, and freight transportation - freight and edible oils, et cetera. TomWerner: Just as a - I'm not going to get into specifics line by line item. But I will tell you that more than half of that is related to just inflation with less of it being in terms of operating performance. And again, as I mentioned, as we mentioned in prepared remarks, that's continued to improve through the quarter. So we exited the quarter in better shape than we started the quarter in terms of the [Indiscernible] AdamSamuelson: Alright, that's really helpful. And then maybe just on the demand side, you went through some of this in the prepared remarks, Tom, but just especially on the global business internationally, just it seems like things are a little bit kind of more uneven between different geographies, any color you could provide there and specifically how to think about potential competition from European suppliers in some of your export markets over time. TomWerner: Yes, Adam, it's really choppy in the international markets. And I mean, you read the headlines every day and some countries are shutting down, put more restrictions on, we're certainly seeing it in our markets in Asia, Oceania and Europe. So it's really - we'd kind of week by week on what's going on, especially with the delta variant that's going on. So the team's doing a great job managing the volatility in the demand forecast plus throw on top of that container challenges that every manufacturing company is having, especially on the West Coast, just getting product to the markets. And so while all that is being - is pretty volatile right now. We're just managing through it real time, just like everybody else. So that said, the second part of your question is the competitive landscape right now from the Europeans is pretty, I'll call it normalized. So what it's been, it has - there has been any - there's always spot pressures in certain markets, but it's been pretty I'll call it normalized. And that's one of the things I attribute that to is everybody's experienced the same thing we're experiencing. So it's manufacturing challenges, it's shipping challenges, a number of different things. Just to get product to the market and serve your customers. And that's the number one goal right now, I think, for everybody. So I think it's going to be choppy, especially in the international markets with all the freight pressure going forward until things kind of kind of normalize. And the question is when is that going to happen? And right now we're going to see freight challenges. We're going to see freight challenges in the near term for a while, and it's just going to be the way we have to operate. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. RobertDickerson: Great, thank you so much. So just first question, sort of focus on the top line, from - for cost. So Tom it seems like just kind of given the pricing that we saw come through in Q4, especially in foodservice, and then kind of what demand seems to be coming in, you're kind of forecast for that demands for the end of the year, the fiscal year? Is it fair to say that although kind of profits are more back halfway that we're also seeing, just in terms of year-over-year growth, that revenues could be up, let's say, like, mid teen, first half, but then like, maybe mid single back half, just trying to get proper cadence for the year on the top line? TomWerner: Yes, I mean, that's specifically all know what the - it's a comparable, year-over-year. But that's fair. And I would say one of the things that I feel really great about is how the category has responded. And it's been sharply lately, it's been a really strong in the US specifically, and I noted in my prepared remarks about fry incident rate, that's a big deal in terms of when people go to restaurants or ordering fries versus a different side. So that's good for the category. And that certainly has - that's helped the category rebound, and we feel good about and obviously over the long term, we are very bullish on the category based on all the investments we've announced over the last 12 months. So I think the demands going to be there, it's just we got to execute our operational side of it. RobertDickerson: Okay, fair enough. And then, I guess - TomWerner: Rob, just one thing on - you talked about foodservice pricing. And really, the bulk of that was related to mix. The improvement there. RobertDickerson: Okay, fair. Right. And then the rest comes through in Q3. TomWerner: Yes. RobertDickerson: Got it, okay. Cool. And then you, I think at least you provided some incremental detail around the Win As One program. I heard you say in the remarks; I think it was 300 million in targeted variable expense reduction. So just kind of want to get a little bit more color on that. I know these, as you said, these are long term targets, and I don't know if long term maybe means three years or five years. And I obviously am asking because at least extra investment 300 million in that variable expense reduction implies a 30% lift of pre COVID EBITDA. So maybe if we could just kind of talk about that for a minute. I'll pass it on. Thanks. TomWerner: Just in terms of the cost reduction, you said variable is really - it's really cost too good to manufacture. So some of that is related to getting more productivity out of a line. And so you're spreading the same fixed costs over more pounds. And so think about it is if you've got consistently higher line speed, your changeover times are down those kinds of things, optimizing the mix line by line, those kinds of elements are part of that. And so part of is fixed costs, but part of it is variable cost, whether it's recovery, or usage of - raw re-usage of oil, et cetera. In terms of the timeframe, we haven't put a timeframe to that specifically externally at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. PeterGalbo: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask one specific on global. I know, you said we would know kind of more later this summer around the pricing and contract negotiations, but for the inflation escalators, do those kick-in 3Q of '22, as well, or is it sooner than that? TomWerner: Yes, it varies, depending upon the contract renewal date. So it's really mixed. But generally, in general terms, the contracts that we have in place today will be in 3Q. PeterGalbo: Got it, okay. And then just on the gross margins in the fourth quarter just wanted to get a sense, maybe where those came in relative to your expectations. When you had kind of provided some thoughts around it at 3Q understanding and going forward into the first quarter, it seems like a lot of that is just being driven by higher finished goods inventory, but just want to kind of understand where you landed in the fourth quarter relative to your own internal expectations? RobMcNutt: Yes, I'll take that, this is Rob. We weren't that far off, I will tell you that. The pieces that maybe were sharper on the COGS side than we had anticipated, transportation was a bit sharper. And then really that one of the things that volume was stronger than we probably anticipated, going into Q4, and so there was more volatility, and so more break into lines more hotshotting, maintain customer service levels, those kinds of elements. And so as we think about it, we think that the long term of maintaining the customer service levels is a lot more important than incurring a little bit of extra costs in this kind of an environment in the short term. And so that's where maybe that you'd say that our margins are pressured a little bit more than what we had anticipated. Operator : Our next question comes from Jenna Giannelli with Goldman Sachs. JennaGiannelli: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. You talked about it a little bit with respect to the international business of the delta variant, but I guess I'm curious, there still seems to be a high degree of confidence for just US demand being backed towards pre pandemic levels by the end of this year. I guess are you hearing anything from your customers, whether it's the restaurants or some of your non-commercial customers that this strong demand that we've seen could pause a little bit with the onset or the growth in the delta variant here in US? TomWerner: Yes, thanks for the question. This is Tom, it's really - it's hard to - we're not hearing things directly from the customer in terms of a pause or what they're thinking about. If you think about our large in our global business unit, our large QSR customers, they're pretty much back and they've been operating through drive thru format or takeout and they've been at or exceeded pre pandemic levels for quite some time now. And as I talked about the independent, smaller QSR chains in our foodservice segment have steadily recovered, and they're down somewhat, but they continue to improve. And with a new variant, it's hard to say. And the barometer for me is some of the international markets that have re-impose restrictions. And we've seen volumes step back. But this whole thing, it's going to depend upon the restrictions that are imposed or not imposed. And if we kind of navigate through it, here in North America we expect with fry incident rates that I alluded to in my remarks. If that continues and holds, which we believe it will, and then the volume is going to be there, it's just a matter of servicing the customers. JennaGiannelli: Thanks for that. And that actually took me to my next question is the higher incidence and just the higher fry attachment rate that you were talking about. That is really interesting. Is this something that you've seen before? I guess, just any, like, thoughts on what's driving? Is it that menus are more limited? Or perhaps people haven't been out in a while, so they're more willing to gorge on French fries? I guess, just your thoughts on the drivers and the sustainability of that trend? TomWerner: Yes, it's - I'll give you a couple different perspectives in my mind. First of all, there's been menu simplification and a lot of independence. And what does that mean? That means they're slimming down their menus, so you may not have as many side menu items. That's number one. Number two the fry offering is very important and profitable, there are customers across all outlets. So that's important, especially in times like this when you're fighting for incident, when you're trying to get to them, when you're trying to get people in the restaurant. So that's a couple different perspectives. But I think the other thing to remember the fry incident pre pandemic was pretty steady. You look over the years, it's been pretty flat-ish. And the uptick is because everything I just said, so and fries, it's a great, obviously a great product. And people love it. And so we'll see where it all goes. But if it does stick, it's going to be meaningful volume going forward. Operator : And our final question comes from William Reuter with Bank of America. WilliamReuter: Hi, my question is around, you guys remain below your leverage target of 3x to 4x. I guess, given the high CapEx this year, you're certainly going to be burning through some CapEx and the conversation around EBITDA being pressured in the first half of the year. Do you have a sense where leverage may peak this year, and at what time is that - year that will be and then when we might see leveraged declining again? RobMcNutt: Yes, this is Rob. I think as we had mentioned that the pressure on the margins in the first half of the year, and as Tom mentioned, a more normalization to the back half of the year. And so I'll let you guys run your models for what EBITDA is going to do. I will tell you that the spending on that, those - especially those two large capital projects in China in American Falls, those are going to play out through this year and next year, that's really a kind of a 18-24 month bill is the bulk of the spending there. And so it'll ramp up. So a lot of that spending is going to happen in the back half of these this fiscal year and the front half of next fiscal year. WilliamReuter: Okay, and then one more if I could, just in terms of those contracts that you are negotiating now that have three to six month timing delays, I guess, in terms of the tone of those conversations, do you guys have a high degree of confidence that the price increases will be implemented pretty much broadly and more or less that there won't be customer pushback or you haven't heard customers pushing back. TomWerner: All the color I'll give you is it's the tones normalized just like it has been every other year. Certainly everybody understands the inflationary pressures. We're all dealing with but you go through the process and negotiate in good faith and we'll see where it all lands. But early indications are we're in a good spot. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Dexter Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks everyone for joining the call today. If you want to set a call with me, please email me. And we can set it up for later either today or later this week. And enjoy rest of day. Thank you. Operator : Once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, VP Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website lambweston.com.  Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some comments on our performance, as well as a brief overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our first quarter results and fiscal 2022 outlook.  With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. We are pleased with our strong sales growth in the quarter, which reflects the ongoing broad recovery in demand across our out of home sales channels, as well as continued improvement in our key international markets. However, our margin improvement lags our volume recovery as a result of the timing of pricing actions to offset cost inflation, as well as challenging macro factors that increase our cost and affected our production run rates and throughput.  These ongoing challenges, combined with the extreme summer's heat, negative impact on potato crops in the Pacific Northwest will result in higher cost as the year progresses. As a result, we now expect our gross profit margins will remain below pre-pandemic levels through fiscal 2022.  We believe many of these costs and supply chain challenges are transitory and we are taking aggressive actions to mitigate their effects on our operations and financial performance. We're confident that our actions, along with our investments to improve productivity and operation over the long-term, will get us back on track to deliver higher margins and sustainable growth. Before Bernadette gets into some of the specifics of our first quarter results and outlook, let's briefly review the current operating environment starting with demand.  In the U.S., we continue to be encouraged by the pace of recovery in restaurant traffic and demand for fries. Overall, restaurant traffic has largely stabilized at about 5% below pre-pandemic levels led by the continued solid performance at quick service restaurants.  Traffic at full-service restaurants continued to rebound in June and July, but it did soften a bit in August as the Delta variant surged across most of the country. Demand improved at non-commercial food service outlets, especially in the education market, which helped to offset the near-term slowdown in full-service restaurants. The fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is a rate in which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets also continued to help support the recovery in demand by remaining above pre-pandemic levels.  Demand in U.S. retail channels also remained solid with overall category volumes in the quarter still up 15% to 20% from pre-pandemic levels.  Outside the U. S., overall fry demand continued to improve in the quarter, although the rate of improvement varied widely among our key international markets. Demand in Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture gradually recovered as vaccination rates climbed.  Demand in Asia and Oceana was solid, but also softened in August due to the spread of the Delta variant and South America remain challenged, especially in Brazil. So, overall, we are happy with the recovery in global demand and believe it provides a solid foundation for continued volume growth in fiscal 2022.  With respect to the pricing environment, I am pleased with the progress of our recently implemented pricing actions to manage sharp input cost inflation. In our Foodservice and Retail segments, as well as in some of our international business, we'll begin to realize some of the pricing benefits in the second quarter and more fully in the third quarter. In our Global segment, the contract renewables for large chain restaurant customers have largely progressed as we expected and will generally begin to see the impact of any pricing actions associated with these contracts in our third quarter.  In addition, we'll continue to benefit from price escalators for most of the global contracts that are not up for renewal this year. These price adjustments reset based on the underlying timing of the contract renewals, but largely during our fiscal third quarter.  Overall, we expect our price increases across our business segments will in aggregate mitigate much of the cost inflation. However, depending on the pace and scope of inflation and the increase of potato cost resulting from this year's poor crop, we may take further price action as the year progresses. In contrast to demand and pricing, the manufacturing and distribution environment continues to be difficult.  Our supply chain cost on a per pound basis have increased significantly due to input and transportation cost inflation, as well as labor availability and other macro supply chain disruptions that are continuing to cause production inefficiencies across our global manufacturing network.  Although we are making gradual progress to mitigate these challenges, they have slowed our efforts to stabilize our manufacturing operations during the first half of fiscal 2022. As a result, we expect the turnaround in our supply chain will take longer than we initially anticipated.  Now turning to the crop. The early read on this year's crop in the Columbia Basin, Idaho and Alberta indicates that it will be well below average levels in both yield and quality due to the extreme heat over the summer. As we're still in the middle of the main crop harvest, the extent of the financial impact of the crop condition will be determined over the coming quarter as the harvest is completed.  While we expect this impact will be significant, we are examining a variety of levers to mitigate the effect on our earnings, as well as on customer service and supply. As usual, we'll provide a more complete assessment of the crop and its impact on earnings when we release our second quarter results in early January.  So in summary, I feel about the overall pace of recovery in French fry demand, especially in the U.S., believe it provides a solid foundation for future growth. I also feel good about the current pricing environment and how we are executing pricing actions in the marketplace.  We do expect higher potato cost input and transportation inflation, labor challenges and other industry-wide operational headwinds to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. While we are taking specific actions to mitigate these challenges, they will keep our gross margins below pre-pandemic levels through fiscal 2022.  And finally, I am confident that we're taking the right steps to get our company back on track to delivering more normalized profit margins.  Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our first quarter results and our fiscal 2022 outlook. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As many of you know, this is my first earnings call as CFO of Lamb Weston. I've now been in the role for about nine weeks. For those on the line that I haven't met, it's a pleasure to meet you over the phone. I am looking forward to meeting many of you in person over the coming months as we get back into the cadence of in person investor meetings and industry events. As Tom discussed, we feel good about the health of the category and our top line performance in the first quarter and expect our gross margins going forward will improve as we benefit from our recent pricing actions, as well as from other actions that we are taking to mitigate some of the macro challenges affecting our supply chain.  Specifically, in the quarter, sales increased 13% to $984 million, with volume up 11% and price mix up 2%. As expected, volume was the primary driver of sales growth, reflecting the ongoing recovery in fry demand outside the home in the U.S. and in some of our key international markets, as well as the comparison to relatively soft shipments in the prior year quarter.  Lower Retail segment sales volume partially offset this growth, largely as a result of incremental losses of low-margin private-label business. Overall, our sales volume in the first quarter was about 95% of what it was during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 before the pandemic impacted demand. Moving to pricing, pricing actions and favorable mix drove an increase in price mix in each of our core business segments. As I'll discuss in more detail later, our pricing actions include the benefit of higher prices charged to customers for product delivery in an effort to pass through rising freight costs. The offset to this is higher transportation cost and cost of goods sold.  Gross profit in the quarter declined $63 million as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher manufacturing and transportation cost on a per pound basis. The decline in gross profit also includes a $6 million decrease in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, which includes a $1 million gain in the current quarter compared with a $7 million gain in the prior year quarter.  The increase in cost per pound, primarily related to three factors. First, we incurred double-digit cost inflation for key commodity inputs, most notably, edible oils which have more than doubled versus the prior year quarter.  Other inputs that saw significant inflation include ingredients, such as wheat and starches used to make batter and other coatings and containerboard and plastic film for packaging. Higher labor costs were also a factor as we incurred more expense from increased unplanned over time. Second, our transportation costs increased due to rising freight rates as global logistics networks continue to struggle. Our costs also rose due to an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail as we took extraordinary steps to deliver products to our customers. Together, inflation for commodity inputs and transportation accounted for approximately three quarters of the increase in our cost per pound.  The third factor driving the increase in cost per pound was lower production run-rates and throughput at our plants from lost production days and unplanned downtimes. This resulted in incremental costs and inefficiencies. Some of this is attributable to ongoing upstream supply chain disruptions, including the timely delivery of key inputs and other vendor supplied materials and services.  However, most of the impact on run-rates was attributable to volatile labor availability and shortages across our manufacturing network. So, what are we doing to mitigate these higher costs and stabilize our supply chain? First, price. We are executing our recently announced price increases across each of our business segments and implementation of these pricing actions are on track.  Our price cost relationship will progressively improve as our past due pricing catches up with inflationary cost increases. We'll begin to see some benefit from these actions in the second quarter, and it will continue to build through the year. If needed, we will implement additional rounds of price increases to mitigate the impact of further cost inflation.  We've also increased the freight rates that we charge customers to recover the cost of product delivery, and we are adjusting them more frequently to better reflect changes to the market rates. These adjustments have also lagged the cost increases. While we saw some benefit in the first quarter, we expect to see more of a benefit beginning in the second quarter. In addition, we are significantly restricting the use of higher cost spot rate trucking.  Second, we are optimizing our portfolio. We are eliminating underperforming SKUs to drive savings through simplification in terms of procurement, production, inventory management and distribution. We are also partnering with our customers to modify product specifications without compromising food safety and quality. These modifications will help mitigate the impact of lower potato crop yields from this year's crop, as well as some of the impact of reduced potato utilization that results from poor raw potato quality. Third, we are increasing productivity savings with our Win As One program. While realized savings to-date have been small, given that the initiative is still fairly new, we began to execute specific cost reduction programs around procurement, commodity utilization, manufacturing waste, inventory management and logistics, as well as programs to improve demand planning and throughput. We expect savings from these and other productivity programs will steadily build as our supply chain stabilizes.  And finally, we are managing labor availability and volatility. This includes changing how we schedule our labor crews, which provides our employees, more control and predictability over their personal schedules and reduces unplanned over time. We are also reviewing compensation levels to make sure we remain an employer of choice in each of our local communities. This is an addition to the other recruiting tools and incentives such as signing and retention bonuses.  Moving on from cost of sales, our SG&A increased $13 million in the quarter. This increase was largely driven by three factors. First, it reflects the investments we are making behind information technology, commercial and supply chain productivity initiatives that should improve our operations over the long-term. About $4 million this quarter represents non-recurring ERP-related expenses.  Second, it reflects higher compensation and benefits expense; and third, it includes an additional $3 million of advertising and promotional support behind the launch of new branded items in our Retail segment. This increase compares to a low base in the prior year when we significantly reduced A&P activities at the onset of the pandemic.  Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.20, down from $0.61 in the prior year while adjusted EBITDA including joint ventures was $123 million, down from $202 million.  Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment were up 12% in the quarter with volume up 10% and price mix up 2%. Overall, the segment's total shipments are trending above pre-pandemic levels due to strength in our North American chain restaurant business, especially at QSRs.  Our international shipments in the quarter also approached pre-pandemic levels despite congestion at West Coast Ports and the worldwide shipping container shortage continuing to disrupt our exports, as well as softening demand in Asia due to the spread of the Delta variant. The 2% increase in price mix reflected the benefit of higher prices charged for freight, inflation-driven price escalators and favorable customer mix.  Global\u2019s product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expenses declined 45% to $43 million. Input and transportation cost inflation, as well as higher manufacturing cost per pound, more than offset the benefit of higher sales volume and favorable price mix.  Moving to our Foodservice segment. Sales increased 36% with volume up 35% and price mix up 1%. The strong increase in sales volumes largely reflected the year-over-year recovery in shipments to small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants.  However, shipments to these end-customers along with restaurant traffic slowed in August due to the surge of the Delta variant across the U.S. Volume growth in August was also tempered by the inability to service full customer demand due to lower production run-rates and throughput at our plants, largely due to labor availability. Our shipments to non-commercial customers improved through the quarter as the education, lodging and entertainment channels continued to strengthen.  Overall, non-commercial shipments were up sequentially to 75% to 80% of pre-pandemic levels from about 65% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in price mix largely reflected pricing actions, including the benefit of higher prices charged for freight.  Foodservice\u2019s product contribution margin rose 12% to $96 million. Higher sales volumes and favorable price mix more than offset input and transportation cost inflation, as well as higher manufacturing cost per pound.  Moving to our Retail segment. Sales declined 14% with volume down 15% and price mix up 1%. The sales volume decline largely reflects lower shipments of private-label products resulting from incremental losses of certain low margin business.  Sales of branded products were down slightly from a strong prior year quarter that benefited from very high in-home consumption demand due to the pandemic, but remain well above pre-pandemic levels. The increase in price mix was largely driven by favorable price, including higher prices charged for freight.  Retail\u2019s product contribution margin declined 59% to $15 million. Input and transportation cost inflation, higher manufacturing cost per pound, lower sales volumes and a $2 million increase in E&P expenses that support the launch of new products drove the decline.  Let's move to our cash flow and liquidity position. In the first quarter, we generated more than $160 million of cash from operations. That's down about $90 million versus the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower earnings. We spent nearly $80 million in capital expenditures and paid $34 million in dividends.  We also bought back nearly $26 million worth of stock or about double what we have typically repurchased in prior quarters.  During the quarter, we amended our revolver to increase its capacity from $750 million to $1 billion and extended its maturity date to August 2026. At the end of the first quarter, our revolver was undrawn and we had nearly $790 million of cash on hand. Our total debt was about $2.75 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA including joint ventures ratio was 2.7 times.  Now let's turn to our updated outlook. We continue to expect our sales growth in fiscal 2022 to be above our long-term target of low to mid-single-digits. In the second quarter, we continue to anticipate sales growth will be largely driven by higher volume as we lap a comparison to relatively soft shipments during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic.  We expect price mix will be up sequentially versus the 2% that we delivered in Q1 as the execution of pricing actions in all of our segments remain on track. For the second half of the year, we continue to expect our sales growth will reflect more of a balance of higher volume and improved price mix as we begin to lap some of the softer volume comparisons from the prior year and as a benefit from our earlier pricing actions continue to build.  Our volume growth however may be tempered by global logistics disruptions and container shortages that affects both domestic and export shipments. It may also be tempered by lower factory production due to macro industry and labor challenges, as well as a poor quality crop.  With respect to earnings, we expect net income and adjusted EBITDA including joint ventures will continue to be pressured through fiscal 2022. That's a change from our previous expectation of earnings gradually approaching pre-pandemic levels in the second half of the year. Driving most of this change is our expectation of significantly higher potato costs resulting from poor yields and quality of the crops in our growing regions.  We previously assumed the potato crops that approached historical averages. Outside of raw potatoes, we expect double-digit inflation for key production inputs such as edible oils, transportation and packaging to continue through fiscal 2022. We had previously assumed these costs would begin to gradually ease during the second half of the year.  We also expect the macro challenges that have slowed the turnaround in our supply chain to continue through fiscal 2022. That said, we expect the labor and transportation actions that I described earlier, along with our Win As One productivity initiatives will help us continue to gradually stabilize operations, improve production run-rates and throughput and manage cost as the year progresses.  For the full year, we expect our gross margin may be at least five to eight points below our normalized annual margin rate of 25% to 26%. While we recognize this is a wide range, it reflects the volatility and high degree of uncertainty regarding the cost pressures that I've discussed.  Consistent with prior years we will have a better understanding of the crop\u2019s financial impact in the next couple of months and we will provide an update when we release our second quarter results in early January.  Below gross margin, we expect our quarterly SG&A expense will be in the high 90s as we continue our investments to improve our operations over the long-term, while equity earnings will likely remain pressured due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs, both in Europe and the U.S. We've also updated a couple of our other targets for the year. First, we've reduced our capital expenditure estimate to $450 million from our previous estimate of $650 million to $700 million. This significant reduction is due to the timing of spend behind our large capital projects and effectively shifts the spend into early 2023 - fiscal 2023.  Despite the shift in expenditures, our expansion projects in Idaho and China remain on track to open in the spring and fall of 2023 respectively. And second, we're reducing our estimated full year effective tax rate to approximately 22%, down from our previous estimate of between 23% and 24%. Our estimates for total interest expense of around $115 million and total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $190 million remain unchanged.  So in summary, the strong recovery in demand helped fuel our top-line growth in the first quarter, but higher manufacturing and distribution costs led to lower earnings. For fiscal 2022, we expect net sales growth will be above our long-term target of both mid-single-digits, but that our earnings will continue to be pressured for the remainder of the year due to higher potato cost from a poor crop and persistent inflationary and macro challenges.  Nonetheless, we expect to begin to see earnings improve in the second quarter behind our pricing actions and the steps we are taking to improve our costs.  Now, here is Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bernadette. Let me just sum it up. We feel good about the near-term recovery demand in the U.S. and our key international markets, as well as the long-term health and growth of the category. We are taking the necessary steps with respect to pricing and continuing to focus on stabilizing our supply chain to mitigate near-term operational headwinds and improve profitability. We are on track with our recently announced capacity investments to support our customer and category growth, as well as our long-term strategic and financial objectives.  Thank you for joining us today. And now we are ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : Good morning, and thank you for the questions. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning, Tom. Tom Werner : Good morning. Tom Palmer : I guess just \u2013 thanks. Just to kick off, maybe asked on the pricing side. I know your initial round is just starting to work its way through the market. But it sounds like it's not going to fully offset inflation. Could you maybe talk about at what point, just from a timing standpoint, you could think about that second round being instituted? And then, to what extent do you think you'll be able to price for potato inflation? I know that your sourcing is maybe a little bit different than what the broader U.S. might be facing this year in terms of potato cost. So just trying to kind of understand that pricing dynamic? Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes. So the pricing - this is Tom Werner. The pricing generally, we have priced through to offset inflation across the portfolio. It's the matter of timing. So as we've stated, we'll start realizing some of that here in Q2, but the full impact of our pricing actions across our segments will start to realize in Q3 and that's pretty typical in previous years.  And one of the things that impacted this quarter is, we got behind on it, quite frankly. So we are catching up. And as we evaluate the go-forward, we are closer to it. We are taking a number of different actions, particularly in our freight area to pass those cost through based on freight availability and managing customer service.  So we've adjusted and we'll evaluate it going forward and determine based on how inflation is coming at us, we'll react a lot quicker. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I know this is a small segment, but it actually was a - I guess, a meaningful margin overhang this quarter. The other segment swing to a loss despite mark-to-market gains. What drove that this quarter? Is that something we should expect to recur? Or was it kind of unusual item? Dexter Congbalay : I can - hey, Tom, it's Dexter. You had a sizable gain. I think last year, it's still in mark-to-market and that flows to other and the gain in mark-to-market this year is smaller. Tom Palmer : Okay. Yes. I mean, even excluding that, I think you are looking at around a $15 million decline year-over-year. Dexter Congbalay : Oh, no, no, no, no. I have to look that up again. But it's not that. It's much small of that. I mean, the details on that will come out in the K offhand. But we'll circle back to you on this call to give you the answer on that. But we're just looking up real quick. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : Good morning. So, sorry, first, I\u2019m hoping to ask on some of the gross margin commentary, Bernadette, that you just gave in your prepared script. The 2022 gross margins coming in 500 to 800 basis points below your normalized range and I know that there was expectations of the first half of the fiscal year would have lower gross margins than the second half when you reported back in July.  So I am just trying to get a sense of how much that has actually changed and what the increment to - or the decrement to the outlook is this year on margins and specifically in terms of how that outlook has changed? How much is the potato crop at this point? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. Thanks for your question. The 5 to 8 basis points that we referenced, a lot of that is due to the potato crops. So the things that I mentioned that has changed is we've got a worst potato crop than we've seen in many years. There is a couple of things that we are doing as I mentioned in terms of SKU rationalization and the products spec changes that we are doing that we are hoping to offset some of that impact on cost. But most of that is related to a poor crop.  And then the other thing that I mentioned is that we had previously anticipated the inflation would gradually ease and we do no longer expect that. So, we've given the guidance of 5 to 8 points, but we will come back in January and we'll update that further depending on what we learn more about the crop as we typically have done. Adam Samuelson : All right. So, just to be clear, because there wasn't a similar kind of margin number frames back in July. What - how much did it change versus the outlook in July? Bernadette Madarieta : Well, I think the outlook in July we said we were approaching our normal margins, which is the 25% to 26%. And so, now we are saying, it's 5 to 8 points below. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And I guess, the second question is more of a conceptual one, because clearly these inflationary dynamics are not easing. Is the goal not just to recover cost one for one, but actually to price for margins as well. It's a very different item if we're thinking. Okay. Well, unit margins on a per pound basis go back to pre-pandemic levels as opposed to percent margins in an inflationary environment go back to pre-pandemic levels. And I'm really also thinking as we go into calendar 2022 and even year fiscal 2023, the way some of these input markets would be shaping up, it would seem like your contract to potato cost for next year are going to be up a lot. And I am just trying to think about conceptually, is it - is the goal to price for unit margins? Or is the goal to actually price for those percent margins? Tom Werner : Yes. Adam, so the goal is to continue to price through inflation and at levels we historically do. So that's number one. Number two, the 2022 crop, I'll comment on that as we do - as we get through negotiations on how that shaping out for the next crop year. And the thing I would just want to remind everybody is we are dealing with a challenging crop.  There's no question about it. And we'll work through it. We are focused on all the right things. The good news in this business, we get started all over for next crop. So we'll manage through as best as we can. We're focused on all the right things. But as things start playing out, like I said to the previous questions, we'll evaluate additional actions we need to take to price through inflation. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Dexter Congbalay : Hey, Rob. Okay hold on for a second. I just want to close off Tom's question on of the other product margin. Rob Dickerson : Yes. Dexter Congbalay : Year-over-year, we are - reported basis down 20, ex mark-to-market were down 4. So as you can see the biggest swing is due to the mark-to-market in this year and last year and from an operational basis again down $4 million. That's due to higher manufacturing cost and lower volumes from the vegetable - in our vegetable business. Sorry, Rob. Rob Dickerson : Yes. No problem, Dexter. Great. Thanks. I guess just first question. It sounds like upfront you said, demand is kind of overall maybe around 5% lower than it was pre-pandemic, but maybe shipments are a little bit lower, just kind of given all the supply chain issues.  So, as you then speak to trying to stabilize, the supply to improve the cost situation going forward, like how do you kind of view that shipment piece relative to demand? Because demand seems strong maybe you are - kind of you are underperforming a bit relative to that demand equation. But it sounds like there is obviously good line of sight how to get there. So I'm just kind of curious as the cadence after the year? Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes. So, this is Tom. The international business has been with the container shortages challenges on the ports and the exports and even the containers coming in. We're essentially allocated a certain number of containers. So, we're managing to that level based on our freight partners. And every day is a little bit different.  So the team is doing a good job, making sure we're allocating the product to our key customers internationally, but it's a challenge. And on the flip side to that, that does as we look at our forecast, weekly, we are managing the pile on production and other customers domestically to ensure they are getting their products.  So, it's a really dynamic situation with the containers and even the trucking and the rail and all those things. But essentially, we're managing through what we can ship based on our allocation of containers and that's what we're dealing with. And as that frees up and we get more containers available that will help the exports to our international markets. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Great. And then Tom, maybe just \u2013 now that just a question on kind of broader competitive dynamic. I heard some people say, maybe including yourself a bit kind of given your geographic sourcing focus then maybe you might be in less of a kind of beneficial competitive position versus just some of the other larger processors. That being said, I've also heard some of the other processors say kind of not so fast just given where demand is and kind of where kind of overall crop that\u2019s coming in that's supply in general could just be short, right? Not just for you. So, just curious if you can provide any color basically your perspective around kind of where you stand potentially in this environment relative to some of the other players that you are aware of in the market? And then I have a quick follow-up. Tom Werner : Yes, Rob, it's a fluid situation right now, because we're right in the middle of main crop harvest. So, obviously, we are \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 we are getting an early read like I said on how the quality and the yields are. We really won't have a clear view until the end of this month on what the overall potato yields, what that means, we have an idea. And I'd rather - as I do every year, in January, give you clear understanding.  So right now, it\u2019s - we're just learning how the main crop is going to perform as we harvest and how it's running through the plants that will have more info on that in January. Rob Dickerson : Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick technical question. In the Foodservice division in Q1, price mix was up 1%. Obviously, there was some material deceleration in outlook with what we saw in Q4, which is likely very mix-driven. So just any clarity as to kind of how we should think about that going over on the mix side just given the delta Q1 sorry, Q4 to Q1? Thanks. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. A lot of that \u2013 This is Bernadette, Rob. A lot of that is mix-driven. And then, what we see in the foodservice side is, we're not going to see a lot of those pricing increases effective until second quarter and then more in third quarter as we discussed. But, then again, two, we are seeing increases in our non-commercial segment in first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. We are now 70% to 80% there. So, a lot of its mix. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Bernadette Madarieta : It\u2019s branded products. Tom Werner : And then, last year, Q4 was such an anomaly, because that's the first quarter that was really impacted by the pandemic. And a lot of the perspective we sold a lot less branded product during that quarter as inventories were destocked. Rob Dickerson : Got it. Got it. Alright. Thank you so much. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi. I seem to remember at one point having a conversation around and correct if I'm wrong about, back many years ago, when it was like the worst potato crop anyone in the industry sort of could remember, it was sort of like a $25 million hit to EBITDA for Lamb Weston at the time. And I maybe off on that. But I'm curious if there is any anyway and it might be tough to do, but to dimensionalize what kind of an impact to EBITDA that specifically sort of this crop is likely to have on EBITDA this year?  And maybe too early to do that. But I don't have that data point right? And would this crop be worse than the one previously, that was the worst than anybody in the industry had seen. I am just trying to get some perspective on that. Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew, I think the - how you framed up, what we talked about in the 20 \u2013 the worst crop historically was 14. So, your numbers around $25 million to $30 million are right. And secondly, Andrew, it is too early to frame it up in terms of what the overall financial impact is going to be. And what I will say is, it's worst.  This crop is going to be worse than the previously worst crop ever. So the financial impact will put some guardrails around it in January as we get it harvested and we're running it through the plant and we understand what we are dealing with. Andrew Lazar : Yes. So, that's helpful. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, as we - I think a lot of us certainly knew that even from the fourth quarter call that \u2013 you are getting a lot of pressure points and sort of pain points on the cost side for a host reasons in fiscal 2022 and that it was really all about just like sequential improvement as you went through the year. And obviously that will take a little more time now. So I am trying to think out, if we just think ahead for a minute to fiscal 2023, and just maybe if you play out the \u2013 sort of the potential sort of puts and takes, what are the things that in theory could be more positive? Where are some of the things that maybe you still don't really have a lot of clarity on doing others. You're just clearly putting a lot of pricing through, potentially could put more through.  There is always a little bit of a timing lag. But one would think that's going to certainly better help you get a lot closer to where your costs are. I'm trying to - I'm trying to \u2013 I am just struggling with like the labor piece and are you making progress on that? Is it just slow? And I am trying to get a sense of some of these negatives can kind of bleed into 2023?  Or is there a reason that there could be a pretty dramatic bounce back in operating margin and gross margins in 2023? Like did the next three quarters give you enough time essentially to figure out some of these issues? Or frankly, are some of these thorny enough that they could go beyond that? Even if you don't think there is some structural reason quote longer term, to not get back to historical margins? Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew. I am a 100% confident over - we don't have any structural issues in the company and everything you're poking at, we focused on addressing labor challenges. Bernadette made a number of references of what we're doing differently and we're seeing progress. It's just slow going. The thing that will take time is even within our supply chain and our supplier\u2019s supply chain is disrupting our production and driving inefficiencies in our plants that we're doing a number of things to address that, as well.  And from last summer to now, it's just going to take more time. We are seeing progress. It's not as fast as we or any of us want. But as I think through the next three quarters, where we will be a year from now, with the things we're doing in the company in terms of addressing inflation, adjusting how our supply chain, we're focused on our supply chain differently, some of the actions we're taking.  And a year from now, we're in a new potato crop and that's going to be hopefully back to average normalized levels. We will have certain amount of probably inflation over that time that we will address. But everything we're doing it's going to take time, Andrew.  And the category is very healthy. And so, we're preparing for to - with the number of capacity investments that we're doing right now, our long-term strategy sound, it's just we're going to be a little choppy in the near-term, but the things we're doing operationally, I'm a 100% confident. It may take more time than any of us want. But we're addressing all the right things. Andrew Lazar : Yes. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi, Bernadette. Bernadette Madarieta : What I was just going to add that, the portfolio optimization that I talked about, that's just going to benefit us even more into fiscal 2023 and then the increases in productivity around a lot of those cost reduction programs around Win As One. Again, that should just continue to gain momentum into fiscal 2023, as well. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Take our next question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to piggyback off of Andrew's question there. I guess, Bernadette, as we're thinking about some of the things that are within your control, some of the SKU rationalization and cost savings, just, is there any way to kind of help us frame how much of that 500 to 800 basis points of normalized margin that you're losing this year?  Like, how much could that potentially make up as we start to think about a normal \u2013 a more normalized year for fiscal 2023? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So, the way I'd answer that, Peter is, a lot of the decrease that we've explained in terms of the five to eight points, that's taking into consideration that SKU rationalization and the spec modifications. So, the impact of the crop is what is significantly decreasing our margin estimate. And then, we are looking to get some gains on that to get to the five to eight basis point decrease with the SKU rationalization and product spec modifications. Otherwise, it could have been even greater without that, is the way I would explain it. Peter Galbo : Got it. Okay. Now, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just as we're thinking about the second quarter, I think you had mentioned kind of sequential gross margin improvement. Can you just dimension maybe a little bit more, how you're thinking about that? And Tom, I know you talked about on-premise or foodservice kind of in August being impacted by Delta. But just how did September trend? Was it materially better, worse, or kind of the same? Thanks very much. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So for second quarter and the sequential improvement that we're expecting to see there, generally, our lowest margin quarter is our first quarter. And even though the crop is not what it has been in the previous years, we are going to get some benefits in the second quarter of running out of field and not having to move those potatoes to storage before we start running those through.  And then additionally, these other actions that we're taking in terms of further SKU rationalization, we're going out with our second round of those and then the product spec changes. We're expecting to see some benefit from that and should see an increase from Q1, which again is our lowest margin quarter historically. Peter Galbo : Well, thanks. And Tom anything on September? Bernadette Madarieta : And the pricing, absolutely. We'll definitely see the benefit of pricing. And I am sorry, Peter. Was there another follow-on question that I missed? Peter Galbo : Yes. Sorry. Just on kind of foodservice, know Tom had talked a bit about the softening in August. But just I was curious if there was any early takes on September or even in the first week of October? Tom Werner : Similar to August, yes, it's pretty similar to August. I mean, it's softened a bit, but it's kind of leveled out. Bernadette Madarieta : And what I'd say there, Peter, is that, that foodservice demand is there and we are seeing just difficulty in some respects in making sure that we can provide that product given the lower throughput that we're getting through the plants. Tom Werner : And the logistics. Bernadette Madarieta : And the logistics issues. Peter Galbo : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Smith with Stifel. Matt Smith : Hi, thank you. I just had a question for you. In addition to the margin headwind, I believe you mentioned volume growth may be tempered by the challenges you're seeing in global logistics and supply chain and disruptions and the potato crop. Is that potential volume weakness reflected in your guidance calling for sales growth above your long-term targets? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. That has been included. Matt Smith : Okay. And then, is the potential impacts from the potato crop, should we think that more as a second half event as you run some older potatoes with the poor quality? Tom Werner : Yes. It will definitely be in the second half. It'll start manifesting itself. Matt Smith : Okay. And then, as a follow-up to that, is there - can you talk about how you can mitigate the impact of that as we look forward to the first half of next year? And I'll leave it there and pass it on. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, Matt, as I referenced, the way we're looking to mitigate that is with some of our product spec changes and the other things that we are doing by working with our customers. Matt Smith : Great. Thank you. Operator : That\u2019s today\u2019s question and answer session. Mr. Congbalay, I'll turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Great. Thanks for joining today. Happy to take some follow-up questions, if you would, just please send me an email that we can schedule something for either later this week, but today - later this week or sometime next week.  I appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, VP of Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some comments on our performance, as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our second quarter results and updated fiscal 2022 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you Dexter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. We are pleased with the improvement in our manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as the progress on our financial performance in the quarter, and I am proud of how Lamb Weston team has been able to navigate through this difficult macro environment. We generated strong sales and solid demand across our food away from home channels, drove volume growth, and the initial benefits of our recent pricing actions began to offset inflationary pressures. In addition, our efforts to stabilize our manufacturing operations are on track, including increasing staffing at our processing plants to improve production run rates and throughput. Together, our sales and operating momentum drove sequential gross margin improvement in the quarter and have us well positioned to better manage the upcoming cost pressures from this year\u2019s exceptionally poor potato crop in the Pacific Northwest. While our operations and financial results are not yet where we want them to be, we are on track to deliver our financial targets for the year, and our investments in capacity and productivity will get us well positioned to deliver higher margins and sustainable growth over the long term. Before Bernadette gets into some of the specifics of our second quarter results and outlook, lets briefly review the current operating environment starting with demand. In the U.S. overall fry demand and restaurant traffic in the quarter remained solid especially at quick service restaurants where demand has continued to be strong and above pre-pandemic levels. Traffic at full service restaurants during the quarter was also solid but remained below pre-pandemic levels. Restaurant traffic though has softened recently as the spread of COVID variants have tempered consumer demand for on premise dining and as restaurants closed temporarily due to staff shortages. While we expect the COVID wave will continue to temper demand for on-premise dining in the near-term, we do not anticipate that it will have a meaningful effect on traffic or demand at QSRs.  Demand at non-commercial outlets also improved during the quarter but continued to be below pre-pandemic levels. As with on-premise dining, we expect the spread of COVID variants will affect near-term demand. The fry attachment rate in the U.S. which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets continue to be above pre-pandemic levels. This served to support our out of home fry demand in the quarter. The increase in the fry attachment rate has been fairly consistent since the beginning of the pandemic, and we do not see that changing in the near-term. Fry demand in U.S. retail channels in the quarter was up mid-teens from pre-pandemic levels, and we anticipate it will remain strong in the near-term as the pandemic continues to affect demand in out of home channels.  Now outside the U.S. demand in Asia and Oceana has been solid, although the lack of shipping containers and disruptions to ocean freight networks continues to hinder our ability to fully serve our customers in these markets. Demand in Europe which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture has also been solid, although consumer reaction and the effect of recently imposed government lockdowns may reverse some of the recovery in restaurant traffic and fry demand in the near term. So, overall we are encouraged by the resiliency of demand and the long-term trends for the category but expect that there will be some near-term softness with another COVID wave in the U.S. and our key international markets.  With respect to pricing, we're making good progress in implementing recent pricing actions to manage input cost inflation. In the second quarter we began to see the initial benefits of the price increases that took effect in the summer in our foodservice and retail segments as well as in some of our international businesses. We expect the benefit of these prices will continue to build as the year progresses. In December, we began implementing another round of pricing actions in our foodservice and retail segments. While these actions do not affect our second quarter results, we'll see a gradual benefit from them over the next six months. In our global segment, we saw some benefit of pricing actions in the second quarter but expect to see a greater impact during the back half of the year. This reflects price increases related to contract renewals as well as the benefit of price escalators for most of the global contracts that are not up for renewal this year. We expect these price increases across our business segments will in aggregate mitigate much but not all of our cost inflation pressures. We will continue to assess the pace and scope of further cost inflation, and we may take further price actions as the year progresses.  With respect to costs, input cost inflation remains the primary driver to the increase in our cost per pound in the quarter. Commodity and transportation costs were each up double digits and we expect that trend will continue through fiscal 2022, especially as our raw potato costs significantly increased in the second half of the year. Outside of cost inflation, we're making good progress to stabilize our supply chain in order to improve cost, production run rates, and throughput. We've taken actions to simplify our manufacturing process to drive savings through a series of productivity initiatives eliminating underperforming skews and increasing potato utilization rates. Importantly, after making changes to how we staff production crews, compensation, and other incentives we steadily reduced our staffing shortfall. We are working to continue this positive trend but realize it is difficult in a very challenging labor environment. The pending implementation of government mandated COVID testing and vaccine regulations may also slow our progress and that of our suppliers in attracting and retaining workers in the near-term. Now turning to the crop. The yields and quality of the potato crops in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, and Alberta are well below average due to the extreme heat over the summer. Similar to prior years we have contracted with farmers to purchase potatoes to meet our production needs assuming an average crop year. But because of the extreme heat, the contracted acres yielded fewer potatoes and the quality is also poor. As a result, we're purchasing our remaining potato needs in the open market to meet our production forecast. We were able to reduce the number of potatoes we otherwise have been required to purchase in the open market by successfully partnering with our customers to secure changes to product specifications. Given that raw potato supply is tight and that fry demand is largely recovered, we've been purchasing open potatoes at a premium to contract at potato prices. When possible we've been securing them from a nearby growing regions but we have also transported potatoes from the Midwest and East and North America which results in increased transportation costs. We included an estimate of these additional costs in our updated earnings outlook. We'll begin to see more of the financial impact of this year's poor crop including the high cost of open market potatoes in our third quarter results. So in summary we feel good about our financial and operating progress in the quarter. The overall demand environment is solid but may soften in the near-term due to another COVID wave and we're pulling the right pricing and operating levers to manage through this challenging environment. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our second quarter results and updated fiscal 2022 outlook. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. As Tom discussed we're pleased with our progress in the quarter. We generated strong sales and solid demand across our restaurant and food service channels in North America, drove growth, and we implemented pricing actions. We believe our pricing and cost mitigation actions have us positioned to navigate through this difficult operating environment and to support sustainable profitable growth over the long-term. Specifically, in the quarter sales increased 12% to a little over $1 billion. This is only the fourth time in Lamb Weston's history that we topped $1 billion of sales in the quarter.  Sales volumes were up 6%. Volume growth was driven by our food service segment which reflects the continued year-over-year recovery in on premise dining and by strong shipments to our large chain restaurant customers in North America that is served by our global segment. Sales volumes of branded products in our retail segment were also up in the quarter, but the segments overall volume decline due primarily to lower shipments of private label products. While our overall volume growth in the quarter was strong, it was tempered by industry wide upstream and downstream supply chain constraints, including delays in the availability of spare parts, edible oils, and other key materials to our factories, as well as labor shortages, which impacted production run rates and throughput at our processing plants. In our global segment, volume growth was also tempered by the limited availability of shipping containers and disruptions at ports and in ocean freight networks. We expect these production and logistic challenges, as well as the near-term impact of COVID variants to limit our volume growth through at least the end of fiscal 2022. Price mix was up 6% as we realized benefits from our previously announced pricing actions in each of our core segments. As a reminder, we began implementing product pricing actions in the first quarter as the primary lever to offset inflationary cost pressures. And it generally takes a couple of quarters before these actions are fully realized in the marketplace. We've also taken actions to more frequently change the freight rates that we charge to customers so they better reflect market rates. Historically, we only adjusted these rates once or twice a year. Most of the increase in price mix in the quarter reflects these product and freight pricing actions, with favorable mix providing only a modest benefit.  Gross profit in the quarter declined $18 million as the benefit of increased sales was more than offset by higher manufacturing and transportation costs on a per pound basis. Double-digit inflation for commodities and transportation costs accounted for almost 90% of the increase in cost per pound. Of the two commodities played a bigger role and we're again led by edible oils, including canola oil, which nearly doubled versus the prior year quarter. Ingredients such as wheat and starches used to make batter and other coatings and containerboard and plastic film for packaging. Freight costs rose, especially for ocean freight and trucking, as global logistics networks continued to struggle. Our costs also increased due to an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail in order to meet service obligations for certain customers.  As Tom mentioned, we also incurred higher cost per pound versus the prior year due to incremental costs and inefficiencies driven by lower production run rates and throughput at our factories, which resulted in fewer pounds to cover fixed overhead. Lost production days and unplanned downtimes were primarily due to labor shortages across our manufacturing network, including COVID related absenteeism. While the cost drivers in the first two quarters of the year have been largely consistent, in the second quarter we began to realize the initial benefits of the pricing and cost mitigation actions that we discussed during our last earnings call. As a result of these efforts, gross margin increased sequentially versus the first quarter by 500 basis points to more than 20%. While pricing actions provided the larger lift to the sequential improvement to gross margins, our production run rates and throughput improved sequentially, primarily due to our efforts to stabilize factory labor. While still lower than average, labor retention rates improved modestly versus the first quarter and the number of new applicants has been steady. With more stability we in turn drove more factory throughput.  Finally, our actions to optimize our portfolio are also providing benefits. We've eliminated underperforming SKUs to simplify our portfolio and increase throughput in our factories. We've also successfully partnered with our large customers to secure changes to product specifications to mitigate a portion of the operating impact of the poor quality of this year's potato crop. In short, while our run rates and cost structure are not yet where we want them to be, we look forward to building on the notable sequential progress that we made in the quarter and believe that we positioned ourselves to manage through this challenging near-term increased cost and poor potato crop environment.  Moving on from cost of sales, our SG&A increased $7 million in the quarter, largely due to a couple of factors. First, it reflects higher labor and benefit costs and higher sales commissions associated with increased sales volumes. Second, it includes a $2.5 million increase in advertising and promotional expenses as we stepped up support for our retail products. While these expenses are up compared with the prior year, they are still below pre-pandemic levels. The increase in SG&A was partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses associated with improving our commercial and supply chain operations as those consulting projects ended, as well as fewer expenses in the current quarter related to the design of a new enterprise resource planning system. We had approximately $2 million of ERP related expenses in the quarter, which consisted primarily of consulting expenses. That's down from about $5 million of similar type expenses in the prior year quarter. We're resuming our efforts in the second half of fiscal 2022 to design the next phase of our new ERP system.  Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.22 down $0.44. About $0.28 of the decline was related to costs associated with the redemption and write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes that were originally issued in connection with our spin off from ConAgra in November 2016. We identified these costs as items impacting comparability in our non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.50, which was down $0.16 due to lower income from operations and equity method earnings. Moving to our segments. Sales for our global segment were up 9% in the quarter. Price mix was up 5% reflecting a balance of higher prices charged for freight, pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals, and inflation driven price escalators. Volume was up 4%. Higher shipments to large chain restaurant customers in North America drove the volume increase, while logistics constraints tempered our international shipments. Overall, the global segment's total shipments continued to trend above pre-pandemic levels. Global product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expenses declined 13% to $81 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound more than offset the benefit of favorable price mix and higher sales volumes.  Moving to our food service segment. Sales increased 30% with volume up 22% and price mix up 8%. The ongoing recovery in demand from small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants, as well as from non-commercial customers drove the increase in sales volumes. The initial benefits of product and freight pricing actions that we began implementing earlier this fiscal year, as well as favorable mix drove the increase in price mix. Food services product contribution margin rose 19% to $104 million as favorable price mix and higher sales volumes more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound.  Moving to our retail segment, sales increased 1%. Price mix increased 4%, reflecting the initial benefits of pricing actions in our branded portfolio, higher prices charged for freight and improved mix. Sales volume declined 4% as an increase in branded product volume was more than offset by lower shipments of private label products, resulting from incremental losses of certain low margin business. Retail shipments in the quarter were also tempered by the industry wide supply chain constraints and production disruptions that I discussed earlier. Retails product contribution margin declined 29% to $21 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound, a $2 million increase in A&P expenses and lower sales volumes drove the decline.  Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our liquidity position remains strong. We ended the first half of fiscal 2022 with almost $625 million of cash and $1 billion of availability on our undrawn revolver. In the first half we generated more than $205 million of cash from operations. That's down about $110 million versus the first half of the prior year due primarily to lower earnings. During the first half of the year we spent nearly $150 million in capital expenditures as we continued construction of our top [ph] informed expansion in American Falls Idaho and our new processing lines in American Falls in China. We continued to put significant effort into managing certain material equipment and labor availability issues to keep our capital projects on track.  In the first half of the year we returned $145 million to shareholders including nearly 70 million in dividends and 76 million of share repurchases. This includes $50 million of share repurchases in the second quarter alone. Last month we announced a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend rate which equates to approximately $144 million annually and a $250 million increase to our current share repurchase plans reflecting our confidence in the long-term potential of our business. As a result, we have about $344 million authorized for share repurchases under the updated plan. As I referenced earlier, during the quarter we redeemed and issued nearly $1.7 billion of senior notes. In doing so our average debt maturity increased from four years to more than seven years and we reduced our annual interest expense by approximately $8.5 million. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities, first to reinvest in our business both organically and with M&A and then to return free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over time.  Now turning to our updated outlook, we continued to expect our full year sales growth in fiscal 2022 to be above our long-term target of low to mid-single-digits. In the third quarter we anticipate price mix will be up sequentially versus a 6% increase that we delivered in the second quarter as the benefit of previously announced product pricing actions in each of our core segments continues to build. We expect volume growth in the third quarter will decelerate sequentially versus the 6% we delivered in the second quarter as a result of the near-term impact of COVID variants on restaurant traffic and demand, the macro industry supply chain constraints and labor challenges that will continue to affect production run rates and throughput in our factories, and global logistics disruptions and container storages that affect both domestic and export shipments. We expect further deceleration in the fourth quarter as we begin to lap some of the higher volume comparisons from the prior year.  With respect to earnings we continue to expect net income and adjusted EBITDA including joint ventures will be pressured through fiscal 2022, reflecting significantly higher potato costs in the second half of the year resulting from the poor crop, double-digit inflation for key production inputs and freight and higher SG&A expenses. For the full year we expect our gross margin will be 600 to 700 basis points below our pre-pandemic margin rate of 25% to 26%, implying a target range of 18% to 20%. That's a change from the 17% to 21% range that we provided in our previous outlook. We narrowed the range for a number of reasons. First, we're confident about the pace and execution of the product and freight price increases that we are implementing in the market. Second, we expect to build upon the incremental progress that we made in the second quarter to stabilize our supply chain operations and drive savings behind our cost mitigation initiatives. However, we expect that the improvement in our run rate, throughput, and costs will continue to be gradual, reflecting the broader macro challenges facing the labor market that will likely persist through fiscal 2022. And third, we have greater clarity on the net cost impact from this year\u2019s exceptionally poor potato crop. As a reminder, will begin to realize the full financial impact of this year's poor potato crop in the third quarter, and will continue to realize its effect through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.  For low gross margins we expect our SG&A expenses to step up to $100 million to $110 million in the third and fourth quarters as we begin to design the second phase of our new ERP project. Equity earnings will likely remain pressured due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs both in Europe and the U.S. We expect our interest expense to be approximately $110 million, excluding the $53 million of costs associated with the redemption of the senior notes in the second quarter. We previously estimated interest expense to be approximately $115 million. Our estimates for total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $190 million and effective tax rates of approximately 22%, and capital expenditures of approximately $450 million remains unchanged.  So in sum, we're seeing the benefit of our pricing actions which drove the sequential improvement in our top line and gross margin in the quarter. Along with our pricing actions we're on track with our other cost mitigation initiatives, positioning us to manage through the impact of the very poor crop. And finally, for fiscal 2022 we continue to expect net sales growth will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single-digits, and we have enough clarity in our sales and cost outlook to narrow our previous target gross margin rates. Now, here's Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks Bernadette. Let me just quickly reiterate our thoughts on the quarter by saying we are pleased with our progress in the quarter and we're taking the right steps on pricing actions and in our supply chain operations to navigate through this difficult operating environment. We are on track to deliver on our targets for the year and we believe we're on a path to get back to pre-pandemic profit levels after we get past the impact of the poor crop in the first half of fiscal 2023 and remain committed to investing to support growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term. Thank you for joining us today, and we're now ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris Growe : Hi, good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning Chris. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning Chris. Chris Growe : Hi, nice quarter there for the second quarter here. I had two questions for you. I first wanted to ask in relation to pricing, you\u2019ve mentioned Tom that pricing will mitigate much of the input cost and pressure but not all of it and that's not surprising as pricing picks up here. I know you also have some product spec changes, probably some productivity savings coming through, perhaps even some lower COVID costs year-over-year, I just want to get a sense of if I bundle all of it together and I look ahead whether it's third quarter, fourth quarter, in the second half there will be a point where you are able to offset the majority or all of the inflation, and are those other factors beyond pricing helping offset some of the inflation? Tom Werner : Yes, it's a combination of everything you just said, Chris, and we expect as we progress through the back half of the year. As we said, we'll start seeing more price realization based on the actions we have taken to this point. And also, as we continue to evaluate our input cost inflations and what's going on with the crop and the open potatoes, all those factors, the commercial team, we're constantly evaluating, when we're introducing new pricing in the market. So, it's multiple factors as you indicated, we're managing it real time, and we're going to have to continue to do that because the inflationary environment right now is pretty volatile. Chris Growe : Okay. And then I had another question, there are couple items you noted in the press release around production run rates which are down and raw potato utilization, and not to get too deep in the weeds, but those are items that are hard for us to model and are things that are unique to your business. I just want to get a sense of like, from a production run rate standpoint, how much is it down if you can even say that and raw potato utilization, how much are you able to utilize the potato maybe that's different from what it was in the past? Tom Werner : Yeah, broad strokes, historically we talked about running our factories at capacity. I'd say we're down around 10 points to that right now. And in some weeks, a little below that, a couple of points even down further. The team is making great progress. As Bernadette has stated, our staffing is improving although gradually, and we expect hopefully by the spring-ish, we'll have our staffing situation squared away, but the labor market is tough. And, in terms of potato utilization, it's historically I'll just give you the numbers broad strokes. We utilize about 62% of the potato to make fries. With the poor crop right now, that's down five to seven points, and that's something we're really watching close, it's going to be pretty volatile in the back half of the year as we start chewing up the new crop potatoes making fries. So hopefully that gives you something to range. Chris Growe : That does, yeah, thank you for that color and that outlook, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We will hear next from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning, Peter. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys good morning.  Thanks for taking the questions. Tom, I was wondering, you spent a bit of time talking about some of the manufacturing initiatives and if you could expand some of the details there on just what exactly you're doing to set yourself up in a position. Once we get beyond this poor crop, what's really going to kind of help you regain some of that profitability and, I know Dexter is sending around kind of some of the videos you guys have put out on automating more of the plants, but just what you're doing in the plant to improve there? And then also, just as you start thinking about, planting for this next crop, right, the 2022 crop, what are the conversations you're having with farmers, are you starting earlier, is there more acreage being planted, anything you can do to help us kind of think about the go forward? Tom Werner : Yeah, in terms of productivity, we have a winner's one initiative, which is call it a pretty systematic savings program that we kicked off in the summer of 2020, and we're making progress against that. And as we become more stable in our operating environment, my expectation is that's going to drive savings that will be apparent as we get through a more stabilized cost environment going forward. And we're rolling it out systematically across our network, we're not all the way bright rolling it out to all of our plants, it's taking a bit more time because of the current operating environment and the focus on ensuring we get our throughput, breaks up, and staffing and all that. So, I expect it to be more visible in our margins, once the operating environment stabilizes. And, with respect to the 2022 crop, it's early on. I'm not going to get into specifics on discussions with growers. And there'll be some news coming out and I'll talk more about it in the third quarter. Peter Galbo : Okay, now that's helpful and I appreciate that. I guess the other just broader question, you spent a bit of time in your prepared remarks talking about fry attachment rate running at a pretty healthy level even from pre-pandemic. And just in the sales force conversations with restaurant customers, is it really a structural change that you're seeing at this point. We've heard a lot about menu, restaurant operators SKU routing their menus and do you feel like that's just temporary until we get through all the supply chain noise across everything or do you really feel like it's structural? Tom Werner : It's really hard to say across the entire menu of a restaurant. What I will tell you is from a side options standpoint, obviously French fries are a really good category and they're an important part of the operator's menu item because of profitability. So, while there has been a lot of simplification and we've done the same thing within our portfolio with our SKU rationalization project, I think the simplification of menus is going to be around for a while. And, a lot of it is going to have to do with the overall supply chain worldwide and food and having availability of the products to menu at a normalized regular basis. So I think this is going to be around for a while. The good news is our categories is more or less back to pre-pandemic levels and it remains an important menu driver and profit driver for our customers. Peter Galbo : Thanks very much guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Tom Palmer with J.P. Morgan. Tom Palmer : Good morning and thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the price mix side. So you indicated in prepared remarks price mix should continue to ramp as the year progresses. Based on what you have secured thus far, how should we think about the pace of that step up, is the biggest sequential step up as we go quarter-by-quarter going to be what we just saw from the first quarter to the second quarter or should we look for even more substantial increases taking hold as you will see pricing flow through it more clearly in that global segment? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, thanks Tom. This is Bernadette. We do expect price mix to go up sequentially in Q3 from the plus 6% that we reported in Q2. Again, that's just broad based pricing actions becoming more fully implemented. Tom Palmer : So, maybe just to clarify the step up that we saw from 1Q to 2Q, should we see something similar to that? Bernadette Madarieta : No. No, I wouldn't expect that large of an increase. Tom Palmer : Okay, thank you. And then just wanted to ask on the freight surcharge, have you seen that have much impact from a competitive standpoint, are you seeing competitors take similar actions, and that is just kind of a broader industry change? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, I can't speak to what competitors are doing but I can say from our standpoint, we aren't seeing a lot of our customers switching freight lanes or that sort of thing. So we continue to remain competitive. Tom Palmer : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So my first question is really trying to take a step back, and you've updated kind of the margin framework for this year to 18% to 20% and maybe just as we think about those longer term aspirations to get back, the margins back to pre-pandemic levels 25% to 26%, can you help us think about kind of the key buckets of that bridge and the 500 to 700 basis points, and you still have to get whether it is just much more aggressive pricing, recapturing kind of that 10 points of capacity utilization and the benefits that would have on your unit cost, I am just trying to think about the productivity actions you're taking, just trying to think about how we walk back up to 25 and kind of some of the key milestones to think about getting there? Yeah, so as we think about our tactics to getting back to those levels, it's going to be important that we have an average crop year, first of all. And then we're going to have to have sufficient pricing to offset input in transportation inflation. Our supply chain will have had to have stabilized and no significant impact on demand, which we're not anticipating. So those are going to be the key things that are going to be important to return to that pre-pandemic margin level. And we think that, that's absolutely there and that's supported by the solid health and the long term growth of the frozen potato category that we continue to see. Adam Samuelson : Okay, and the clarity... Tom Werner : The other thing I'll add on that is, the productivity initiative that we're rolling out and the cost saving projects we're introducing into some of our factories are also going to help us hopefully bridge back to that, and then some. Adam Samuelson : Okay, and just to clarify on the point of a normal potato crop, does the normal potato crop that just yields because I'm thinking about kind of what your -- what contract of potato prices are going to look like in calendar 2022 and they're probably going to be up a lot so I'm just trying to think about, normal yield? Tom Werner : Yeah, Adam it's a combination of a couple different things. Its yield per acre and its recovery as we're processing them in the plant on kind of the range of numbers I said earlier. And, it's size and quality and all those kinds of things that there's kind of three or four factors there. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just a separate question, you talked to Tom about your capacity utilization, maybe running about 10 points below kind of your normal. But you also talked about underlying demand in the category returning to pre-pandemic levels, pre pandemic you were running basically at capacity. Do you think -- have you exceeded some business in some areas or just areas do you think there's competitors who gain market share in areas of the market that you want to keep or is it more just the low end retail in areas that you kind of walked away from? Tom Werner : Yeah, I mean, we're managing our customer portfolio Adam and there is areas where we made some tough decisions, not to serve some customers. But it's a pretty -- we have to be very nimble and flexible. And this environment have been and the team's doing a good job, but we've made some tough calls and in terms of the market share, and all those kinds of things, I haven't seen the latest data. But the category share, pie so to speak, really hasn't changed that much. And, so I think everybody's battling the current operating environment and working through as best they can. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that color is really helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Robert Dickerson with Jeffries. Robert Dickerson : Great, thanks so much. This first question, just to clarify on the guidance a range scenario to 18% to 20%, which is great and helpful. But you also now only have a half a year relative to the full year. So just to ask you, Tom, I'm curious kind of given that range, and kind of what that could imply at the low end or the high end, and the back half is still fairly wide. So maybe if you could just kind of come in on what could be some of the drivers that would get you to the lower end and then what could be some of the drivers that could actually get you to the higher end? And then I have a quick follow up. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, so talk about couple of things as it relates to our guidance. In the first half, we're already plus 13% as it relates to growth. And in the second half, we do expect price to accelerate from the plus 6% that we recorded, or reported in Q2. So, in the second half volume is going to continue to grow, although below the 6% that we delivered in the second quarter. And we talked about all the reasons for that. As we looked at the range of guidance that we provided, we wanted to provide the prudent guidance as the operating environment does still remain really challenging. And, we've got volatility in our near put -- near-term input costs and ongoing production disruptions and things. And that's what's going to result in whether or not we end up at the bottom or the top of the range. The other key piece that's going to affect where we land in that range is going to be the storage performance of these potatoes. We talked about it being a very poor crop and we don't know how it's going to store and that's going to affect our potato utilization. And then the other piece is what we feel good about our cost estimates related to our open market purchases. And we procured most of those, we still are out and procuring those potatoes and so that's what's going to tend to pull us from one end to the other of our gross margin range that we provided. Robert Dickerson : Okay, super, very helpful. And then I guess Tom just quickly, I heard you briefly before comment that kind of hope to have some of the labor situation kind of self-corrected sometime in the spring which sounds like what would imply that as we look forward into 2023, hopefully, you are seeing a good position on the labor front, and I kind of ask, because obviously, that flows through into some incremental costs and throughput, but what have you, so just any additional commentary on that would be helpful? That's it. Thanks. Tom Werner : Yeah, sure. So, like I said, we've made really good progress with staffing up in our factories in particular, based on some of the actions we've taken, and they're sticky too. So, I -- and that gives me confidence based on the last couple 60-90 day trends just in terms of labor filling jobs, those kinds of things that if that continues, then we should be in really good shape in the next 60-90 days. Robert Dickerson : Okay, Super, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take the next question from William Reuter [ph] with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. My question it sounds like the context of the December increase versus the one which was pushed through earlier this year, that it was relatively small, I guess, is that the case? And two, I guess I'm just wondering how much ability do you think you have for further price increases should they be needed next year? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, thanks for the question. As it relates to the price increases, as a reminder, it does take either one to two quarters for that price increase to show its results in the quarter. So I think, take a look for that. And then as it relates to any future price increases, you know, we don't comment on those other than to say, we are expecting to see higher potato costs next year, just given the higher costs to grow, fertilizer, etc. And so, there could potentially be future price announcements. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, and then just a second one for me on capital allocation, you accelerated the share repurchases in the second quarter, also increased the dividends. What are your thoughts on uses of capital given that you do have such high, such large capex projects over the next several years in terms of share repurchases? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, so we have announced many expansions that we believe have attractive returns. And so we will continue to have our same capital allocation policy where we're going to invest first in the business. Certainly, as we demonstrated in the second quarter, if there are attractive returns to repurchasing more stock, we will do that. And we just take a look at where those returns are and could potentially opportunistically take advantage of that. But our capital allocation priorities remain the same in terms of investing in the business first, followed by share repurchases and dividends. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, all pass to others. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Good morning, Happy New Year, everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : I missed a little bit of the prepared remarks so I apologize if some of this was covered. But it's good to see that some of the more -- the efforts around trying to make the pricing model around transportation and freight more dynamic, and to see some of that coming through, I know that was a big effort over the last quarter or two. I think you had mentioned at one point that maybe over time that you could start to make some of these multi-year contracts with larger customers as they reprice or come up for renewal. A little bit more dynamic as well, when you're building in some aspects that if there is such significant volatility going forward, that you'd be able to sort of maybe account for that a little bit more effectively. And quickly, then then maybe the contracts allowed for this past go around. And I know you don't operate in a vacuum so this is not something that you would necessarily be able to do if others didn't, but I don't know how many of these contracts that these larger contracts have yet really sort of are priced in any big way or come up for renewal. I know more of that I think happens more later in the spring but is there any evidence yet that any of that\u2019s happened or could happen or are you at least certain having maybe some have those discussions or is the environment right now just having those sorts of discussions just a lot tougher to have yet? I'm just sort of curious about. Tom Werner : Yeah, Andrew, great question. And, it's early on in the contract cycle this year. We get more into it typically mid late spring through summer. Obviously, internally we're having the conversations on with the inflation we've experienced, which has been a long time that that business have experienced this type of input cost increases and potentially broad increases. That's something we're talking about and we're going to certainly adjust to our customers, but it's something that they're experiencing too and I think it's prudent for all of us to sit down and make sure when we get an environment like this, that we have the proper agreements on how to navigate through this a lot better. Andrew Lazar : That's helpful. And then one last one would be, I think, after the first quarter, I think you were pretty hopeful and seemed pretty confident that that margin performance in fiscal 1Q hopefully would kind of represent sort of the bottom if you will, and you can start to make some sequential progress moving forward through the year, albeit maybe not totally in a linear fashion and that certainly came through right in a bigger way than most expected in this fiscal second quarter? And if you have covered this already, I'm sorry, with the margins, would you be able to say that the margin structure this quarter, similarly, maybe represents a base from which you can sequentially improve to as you move forward or is it -- I wouldn't necessarily expect that and a lot of it depends on some of the three factors Bernadette that you just mentioned, which would determine where you fall in for the full year in terms of that 18% to 20% range? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, no. Great question, Andrew. And we talked a bit about in the prepared remarks that we do expect to see large and sequentially increase in the third quarter. And then just seasonally, they'll come down a bit in the fourth quarter. But, that's the pattern that we're expecting to see in the last half of the year. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks everybody for joining today. If you'd like to schedule a follow-up call of course please send me an email. We can schedule one then. Other than that Happy New Year, and I look forward to speaking with you later. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some comments on our performance, as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our third quarter results and updated fiscal 2022 outlook.  With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. First of all, I want to thank all my colleagues for their continued dedication and perseverance to keep Lamb Weston as an industry leader and a strong business partner. Our solid financial results in the third quarter are a direct result of how well our manufacturing, supply chain and commercial teams have remained focused on improving our operations and serving our customers during a challenging macro environment, which includes the impact of an exceptionally poor potato crop.  We continue to be encouraged by strong French fry demand and feel good about our continued progress. Specifically, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales growth and drove sequential and year-over-year gross margin expansion and we did this despite the impact of Omicron variant slowing restaurant traffic and disrupting our production and distribution operations more than we expected.  We benefited from our previously announced pricing actions to mitigate this significant cost inflation across our supply chain. We\u2019ve also been driving improvements in our manufacturing operations as we focus on what\u2019s in our control. This includes mitigating some of the effects of the poor potato crop with product specification changes and portfolio optimization work that we\u2019ve discussed previously.  Factory labor remains challenging as we remain below preferred staffing levels, but we are making steady progress in a highly difficult labor market. We are addressing the labor gap by focusing on retention and new ways of attracting talent. We\u2019ll continue to push hard on our staffing initiatives and are encouraged by the improvements we are seeing. However, it will take time to get all of our factory staff where they need to be. Like others, we are managing through freight challenges including both cost increases and shipping delays. The freight challenges are impacting our top-line as it limits our ability to service full demand. This is caused by lack of containers for international and domestic shipments and truck driver shortages. This combined with higher fuel cost has also increased our cost to deliver products.  We are continuing to navigate through these and other operating challenges and remain on track to deliver our financial commitments for the year. Our capacity expansion investments in Idaho and China also remain on track. It will have us well positioned to support increasing customer demand over the long-term.  Let me provide some brief updates on the operating environment before turning the call over to Bernadette. Let\u2019s start with demand. In the U.S. overall fry demand and restaurant traffic in our third quarter remained solid. Although it weakened temporarily as the Omicron variant spread quickly. Omicron\u2019s impact peaked in January and affected consumer traffic at both quick service and full service restaurants.  In addition, some restaurants closed temporarily or reduced operating hours due to staff shortages which further impacted demand. Restaurant traffic however has rebounded to pre-Omicron levels. The fry attachment rate in the U.S. which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets continue has been fairly consistent since the beginning of the pandemic and remains above pre-pandemic levels. Going forward, we expect restaurant traffic and consumer demand for fries in the U.S. to remains strong. Although it may be more volatile in the near-term as consumers face significant cost inflation. In contrast, fry demand in retail channels may continue to benefit if demand in out of home channels is affected.  Outside the U.S., demand in Asia and Oceana remains stable. However, we have not been able to meet that demand due to the limited availability of shipping containers for export. While we expect overall demand in these regions to return to pre-pandemic levels, widespread COVID-related government restrictions in key markets such as China may lead to demand volatility in the near-term.  Demand in Europe which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture has also been fairly stable, although it was temporarily affected by the spread of Omicron during the quarter. As in the U.S., we expect demand in Europe may be volatile in the upcoming months as cost inflation and COVID variants tamper restaurant traffic.  So, overall we expect that demand in the near-term will be choppy, we remain confident in the long-term resiliency and growth prospects of the category in the U.S. and our key international markets. With respect to pricing, our price mix growth accelerated sequentially in the third quarter as we continue to execute on our previously announced product and freight pricing actions in our food service and retail segments to offset inflation and as we began to implement pricing actions in our global segment. Going forward, if we see further inflation we are prepared to take additional pricing actions as well as drive opportunities to improve product and customer mix. To that end, last week, we began implementing another round of pricing actions in our food service and retail segments and we expect to see the benefits of these actions gradually build over the next six months.  In our Global segment, contracts representing about one-third of the segment\u2019s volume are up for renewal this year. We\u2019ve begun discussions with those customers and expect to have most of the contract terms agreed by early fall.  With respect to this year\u2019s upcoming potato crop, we\u2019ve agreed to a 20% increase in the contracted price per pound in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest. This increase reflects our approach for annual price changes that reflect the cost to grow plus an appropriate return for our growers such that they are viable over the long-term. We\u2019ll begin to see the impact of these higher contracted potato prices during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as we began to process early potato varieties that are harvested in mid-summer. In addition over the past few months, we\u2019ve partnered with our growers to contract for acres that represent nearly all of our projected needs associated with this year\u2019s crop.  The number of acres contracted assumes an average crop year. Planning of this year\u2019s potato crop started in March and typically concludes by the end of April and we\u2019ll provide our usual crop updates during future quarterly earning calls as the growing season progresses.  Finally, our hearts go out to all the people affected by Russia invasion of Ukraine. Our exposure to Russia is indirect as it runs through our 50% ownership at Lamb Weston/Meijer. Last month, the Russia JV began winding down production of Lamb Weston branded products and paused construction of its previously announced capacity expansion.  We continue to monitor the situation and any decisions regarding that operation will be made in conjunction with our partner in Europe.  So in summary, we feel good about our progress in the quarter, especially given the highly challenging operating environment and we remain on track to deliver our financial commitments for the year. Our pricing actions and cost mitigation efforts enabled us to drive sequential and year-over-year gross margin expansion. We\u2019ve agreed on contract price and acres to be planted for this year\u2019s potato crop and we remain confident in the resiliency and long-term growth prospects of the category although demand may be volatile in the near-term.  Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our third quarter results and our updated fiscal 2022 outlook. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Let me start by echoing Tom\u2019s comments thanking our employees. We appreciate your hard work and dedication. As Tom discussed we feel good about the benefits from our pricing actions and cost savings efforts to offset much of the significant cost inflation that we\u2019ve been experiencing and I am confident in our ability to continue to manage through this volatile business environment.  Specifically, in the quarter, our sales increased 7% to $955 million. Price mix was up 12% as we continued to execute our previously announced product and freight pricing actions in each of our business segments to offset input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation. Most of the increase in the quarter reflects these pricing actions, while mix was also favorable.  Sales volumes declined 5% as we were unable to fully serve market demand due to logistics constraints, especially for our international shipments as well as lower production runrates and throughput at our factories resulting from labor shortages. Increased shipments in our food service segment and through our large chain restaurant customers in North America that are served by our global segment, partially offset the volume decline. However, while volume increased in these channels, it was tempered by the Omicron variant\u2019s negative effect on restaurant traffic, on the availability of labor to keep restaurants open and on our production facilities and supply chain.  Gross profit in the quarter increased $24 million. Product and freight price increases, along with favorable mix more than offset the impact of higher costs on a per pound basis and lower sales volumes. We expanded gross margin by 110 basis points versus the prior year quarter and 270 basis points sequentially to more than 23%. Looking at our costs, double-digit inflation drove the increase in cost per pound for the third straight quarter and accounted essentially for all of the increase in the quarter. There were four key areas that drove the increase in cost. First, commodities played the biggest role led by edible oils, ingredients for batter and other coatings and packaging. Labor cost also increased due to competition for factory workers.  Second, transportation rates continued to climb due to the persistent disruption in global logistics networks. We also continued to use an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail to meet service obligations for certain customers.  Third, we began to see higher potato costs resulting from the poor crop that was harvested last fall in our primary growing regions. The increase in potato cost reflects the impact of purchasing potatoes in the open market at a significant premium to contracted prices; higher transportation cost for shipping potatoes from the Midwest and Eastern North America to our plants in the Pacific Northwest; lower potato utilization rates and running production lines at lower speeds to accommodate low quality potatoes.  The increase in our potato costs, decrease in potato utilization rates, and how the crop is performing storage are all in line with the expectations that we shared with you last quarter and we believe we\u2019ve secured enough potatoes to deliver our volume forecast until we begin to harvest the early potato varieties in July.  As a reminder, we will continue to realize the financial impacts of this year\u2019s poor potato crop through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The final key area that drove the increase in costs are operational inefficiencies explained by labor shortages, omicron-related absenteeism, especially in January and into early February and other industry-wide supply chain challenges.  This resulted in lower production runrates and throughput in our factories leading to fewer pounds to cover fixed overhead. As I\u2019ll discuss later, we\u2019ll continue to see the impact of these costs in the fourth quarter. The effect of lower potato utilization and production runrates in the third quarter was largely offset by a range of cost mitigation efforts including eliminating underperforming SKUs, changes to product specifications, and increased productivity savings from our winner's one and other cost saving initiatives.  So in short, we are managing well through the highly inflationary and poor potato crop environment. We feel good about how we are controlling those things that we can control, which led to the year-over-year and sequential gross margin expansion.  Moving on from cost of sales, our SG&A declined $9 million in the quarter, largely due to lower consulting expenses associated with improving our commercial and supply chain operations as those projects ended. Overall compensation and benefits expense and a $2 million decline in advertising and promotion expenses.  The decline in SG&A was partially offset by higher information technology infrastructure cost, including cost to design the next release of a new enterprise resource planning system.  Equity method earnings in the quarter were $30 million and included a $20 million unrealized gain related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts. The large mark-to-market gain in the quarter primarily relates to changes in the value of natural gas derivatives at Lamb Weston/Meijer as commodity markets fare have experienced significant volatility.  Excluding the impact of these mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $1 million versus the prior quarter. Favorable price mix and higher sales volumes were largely offset by input inflation and higher manufacturing and distribution cost in both Europe and U.S.  Moving to our segments, sales in our global segment were up 2% in the quarter. Price mix increased 8% reflecting domestic and international pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals and inflation-driven price escalators. It also reflects higher prices charged for freight. Volume fell 6%. International shipments, which have historically accounted for about 40% of the segment\u2019s total volume were down nearly 20% versus the prior year quarter due to limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks.  Sales volumes to North American large QSR and casual dining restaurant customers increased but at a slower rate than previous quarters due to the Omicron\u2019s negative impact on consumer traffic. Global\u2019s product contribution margins, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expenses declined 8% to $73 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound, as well as the impact of lower sales volumes more than offset the benefit of favorable price mix.  Moving to our food service segment. Sales increased 34% with price mix up 22% and volume up 12%. As expected, the rate of increase in food service\u2019s price mix accelerated sequentially to 22% in the third quarter from 8% in the second quarter as the benefits of the product and freight pricing actions that we began implementing earlier this fiscal year to mitigate inflation continued to build. In addition, the increase reflects favorable product and customer mix. The ongoing recovery in demand from small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants, as well as some non-commercial customers drove a 12% increase in sales volumes. While our shipments to restaurants have essentially returned to pre-pandemic levels, our shipments to non-commercial channels have not yet fully rebounded.  As with our sales to large chain restaurants in our global segment, the food service segment\u2019s volume growth was tempered by Omicron\u2019s negative impact on restaurant traffic and labor availability in those restaurants. In addition, manufacturing labor shortages and the effect of Omicron-related absenteeism limited our ability to fully serve demand due to lower production runrates and throughput in our factories.  Food service\u2019s product contribution margin rose 52% to $107 million with favorable price, volume and mix more than offsetting higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound. In our retail segment, sales declined 12% with volume down 24% and price mix up 12%. The volume decline reflected two factors. First, more than half of the decline was due to incremental losses of certain lower margin private-label products. And second, despite solid category growth, branded product volumes were down as labor and supply chain disruption limited our ability to service demand.  The increase in price mix was driven by product and freight pricing actions across our portfolio to offset inflation as well as favorable mix. Retail\u2019s product contribution margin declined 5% to $32 million. Lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound drove the decline, which was partially offset by favorable price mix and a $2 million decrease in A&P expenses.  Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow, we ended the quarter with nearly $430 million and cash and $1 billion of availability on our undrawn revolver. Through the first three quarters of the year, we generated about $175 million of cash from operations. That\u2019s down about $200 million versus the first three quarters of the prior year due primarily to higher working capital and lower earnings. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve spent more than $225 million in capital expenditures as we continued construction of our capacity expansions in Idaho and China. We\u2019ve also returned nearly $230 million of cash to our shareholders including $103 million in dividends and $126 million in share repurchases. After repurchasing $50 million of shares in the third quarter, we have just under $300 million remaining under our buyback authorization.  Now let\u2019s turn to our updated fiscal 2022 outlook. We expect our full year sales growth to be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be driven by price mix as we continue to execute our previously announced product and transportation pricing actions to offset input and transportation cost inflations.  However, we expect sales volumes will continue to be pressured as export volumes remain constrained due to limited shipping container availability, supply chain volatility and labor shortages, challenge runrates and throughput at our factories and as restaurant traffic and consumer demand may slow due to inflation and the persistent effect of COVID variants in the U.S. and key international markets. In addition, please note that we\u2019ll be lapping a high volume comparison in the prior year.  With respect to earnings, for the full year, we expect our gross margin will be 19% to 20%. This update puts us at the high end of the 18% to 20% range that we provided in our previous outlook. We are comfortable to be at the higher end of that range because of our confidence in the pace and execution of product and freight price increase that we\u2019re currently implementing in the market.  We have more clarity on the net impact and margin from this year\u2019s poor potato crop and we are making steady progress in stabilizing our supply chain operations and driving savings behind our cost mitigation initiatives. Based on our updated full year estimate, we expect our gross margin in the fourth quarter to be 19% to 21%.  That\u2019s down sequentially from the 23% we delivered in the third quarter and reflects in part our usual gross margin seasonality. It also includes the impact of significantly higher cost held in finished goods inventory that were produced during the third quarter. These costs were driven by incremental cost and inefficiencies associated with very high levels of omicron-related factory worker absenteeism in January and February that resulted in broad based production disruptions.  Since we typically hold 50 to 60 days of finished goods inventory, we\u2019ll realize these costs during our fiscal fourth quarter as that inventory is sold. The low gross margins we expect our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter to step up to $105 million to $110 million as we continue to invest in the design and build of our new ERP system.  We expect equity earnings excluding the impacts of any mark-to-market adjustments will remain pressured due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing cost in both Europe and the U.S. For the year, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million excluding the $53 million of cost associated with the senior notes that we redeemed in the second quarter; total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $190 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%.  We\u2019ve reduced our estimate for our capital expenditures to $325 million from our previous target of $450 million to reflect the timing of expenditures related to our capacity expansion projects in Idaho and China.  So in sum, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales growth and expanded our gross margins behind our pricing actions and our cost mitigation efforts. For the year, we are targeting the upper end of our previous gross margin range due to our confidence in our pricing execution to offset inflation. The more clarity that we now have on our potato cost and the steady progress that we are making in stabilizing labor in our supply chain. Now, here is Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bernadette. Let me just quickly reiterate our thoughts on the quarter by saying I am proud of how our Lamb Weston manufacturing, supply chain and commercial teams are continuing to take the right operating steps to manage through this challenging business environment. We are on track to deliver on our targets for the year and we remain committed to investing to support growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long-term.  Thank you for joining us today and we are now ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hey guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Tom Werner : Good morning, Peter. Bernadette Madarieta : Hey. Peter Galbo : Tom, I just wanted to get your thoughts kind of now that the summer 2022 crop has started to go into the ground, just how are you thinking about some of the different puts and takes, obviously, nobody has the perfect crystal ball, but it seems like drought in the Pac Northwest is still kind of relatively high.  You are using the seed crop from last year of a poor crop. Heat last year was obviously an issue; fertilizer, like, how are you thinking about all those puts and takes encompassed in what\u2019s gone in the ground? Tom Werner : Yes, Peter, so it\u2019s early on in the planning and how we look at every crop year. Certainly, we look at history, but we plan it at average historical levels and in terms of the impact that we had last year because of the high heat which is highly abnormal, it\u2019s early innings and we are going to have to really \u2013 we\u2019ll monitor it. No impact from a seed standpoint, but as I said in my prepared remarks, as the crop progresses as we always do in July and October, we\u2019ll give you an update. But we planned for an average yield quality crop year-over-year. So, we\u2019ll adjust it as we learn more as the growing season progresses. Peter Galbo : Got it. No that\u2019s helpful. And Bernadette, maybe if I could ask on gross margins, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the fourth quarter would follow kind of historical seasonality or a more normal historical seasonality. As we continue to process this kind of lower quality crop through the first half of next year, would you still expect, I guess, first quarter or second quarter seasonality to kind of come back into play as other elements of the business start to normalize? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, absolutely, Peter. The first half of next year will continue to be affected by this year\u2019s poor crop. And then once we move into next year\u2019s crop which as Tom mentioned, where planning will be average that\u2019s when we should be able to get closer to those pre-pandemic margins. Tom Werner : Still there, Peter? Peter Galbo : Yes, yes. Sorry, still here. No, thanks very much guys. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Bernadette Madarieta : Morning. Andrew Lazar : Hi. So I think, if I\u2019m not mistaken you just mentioned that your \u2013 I guess, your anticipation will be that you still get back to sort of your more normalized margins in the second half of fiscal 2023. With some of the \u2013 just the recent news and knock on effects, the next wave of inflation for a lot of items even potatoes sort of out of the mix for a minute as those are contracted, I guess, how do you continue to sort have the comfort level and that is \u2013 that just you are seeing obviously the pricing goes through and therefore given what we\u2019ve seen more recently in terms of incremental cost, there is the confidence that that more can be passed through in a timeframe that allows you to get back to those margins as you had initially expected or is there something else? Tom Werner : Yeah, Andrew, it\u2019s couple things. Certainly the average crop is going to help that obviously, significantly. And as we plan our \u2013 we are in the middle of planning our fiscal 2023, we have a point of view on what inflation is going to be which I won\u2019t get into until the next call as we wrap our plan for 2023 up. But we have \u2013 and have been executing our pricing actions and this \u2013 as we are all dealing with inflation is a challenge.  But I am confident in how we\u2019ve been executing and we are in the early innings of contract negotiations with some of our bigger customers and we are going to work \u2013 we\u2019ll work through it and the team is doing a great job. So, I feel very confident we will pass through this inflation and we are going to get some help from the crop next year but if it comes in on an average level.  So, those are really the two things that gives me a lot of confidence that we are going to get back to pre-pandemic margin levels and there is no indication right now that\u2019s telling me that we are not. And so I feel really good about it. Andrew Lazar : Okay. And then, I realize you are in the early innings of some contract negotiations for the third of those large customer contracts that are coming up for renewal. For the remainder of them that aren\u2019t not yet up for renewal, I know you\u2019ve talked about the possibility of sort of, maybe a expanding \u2013 or kind of expanding the definition of what some of those sort of inflation escalators or how they are defined in those contracts to try and get some relief even for contracts where they are not up for renewals just yet? And I am just trying to get a sense of how sort of progress has been made there? Are you able to get some additional pricing through even where there is not, not a contract that\u2019s up for renewal? Tom Werner : Yeah, I mean, we are having very robust conversations with those customers, Andrew. And we are partnering with them. We are working through it. And we are being very transparent with what\u2019s \u2013 what our inflation is, what we are dealing with. And I would say those conversations have been very positive. Everybody understands the environment we are all working in.  And so, again, the team is doing a great job having those conversations being very transparent with the customers, letting them know what we are dealing with and what is potentially coming out and when their contracts are coming due. So it\u2019s a work in progress, but we are making progress. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Tom Werner : Good morning, Tom. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning, Tom. Tom Palmer : So, first I just wanted to ask on the potato side. When you consider yield losses and spot market purchases, what is your potato inflation? I am really just trying to understand how much of the 20% higher contracted rate might be offset by normalized yield per acre in your spot market purchases next year? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, Tom, we won\u2019t get into our yield and our processing performance, those kind of things. We don\u2019t talk about that. But the cost increase is 20%. The big impacts are two things to our P&L this year from a potato processing standpoint. It\u2019s yield per acre, which is down because of the weather conditions. So we\u2019ve had to procure more potatoes on the open market.  And it\u2019s no secret, we truck potatoes from the East Coast like other processors have and that costs more money obviously and it\u2019s also how the quality of the potato is processed through our factories. So, the yield to make a pound of French fries, it takes more potatoes just because of the quality and size and all that.  So, it\u2019s a \u2013 we take the hit in two different areas. It\u2019s yield per acre and it\u2019s processing efficiency in our factories. And we haven\u2019t disclosed what the overall impact is because we are still trying to understand and as we take these potatoes out of storage, typically this time of year, it\u2019s always a cyclical issue because your quality of potatoes coming out of storage is less than when it\u2019s coming out of our field.  So we are still \u2013 we have an estimate on what the overall impact for the year is going to be, but we are still have two months to go here, two, three, four, five months to go in processing these potatoes. Tom Palmer : Okay understood. And then, maybe switching just to the capital expansion plan, CapEx, I mean, quite a bit below your initial outlook. But you indicated in the prepared remarks that both plan expansions remain on track. So, what\u2019s really causing the delays of this year and why is that not affecting the timing? Is it, there is just a ton of catch up coming next year and as long as that takes place you\u2019ll still be on track? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. That\u2019s absolutely right. This is Bernadette. It\u2019s just a matter of timing and when those equipment pieces are coming in. But based on our current projections and what we are seeing from our vendors, we are still on track with the estimated completion date. It\u2019s just a function of timing between this and next year. Tom Palmer : Great. Great. Thank you. Bernadette Madarieta : You bet. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Robert Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. So, Tom, just kind of a question on segment margins and kind of the differencing factors between let\u2019s say food service and the global segment. If we look at food service now, op margin for Q3 actually already higher I believe than pre-pandemic which is very positive and obviously driven by pricing. The global side not so much, right. Thanks for a bit more time there and maybe just kind of ties into Andrew\u2019s question on the contracted side, I guess, first, if we think about the go forward where pricing is now with food service, we are assuming kind of more normalized demand environment. In your perspective that that\u2019s the margin that we \u2013 you hope you can retain but as you get into Q4, maybe next year, all things considered. And on the global side, even as you get into the back half of next year, even if the crop is or if they are more normalized and some of those costs roll off, should that global margin just be going up anyway just because of the external pricing would be getting from your other negotiations in that segment as you get through the summer? So I am just trying to get a sense of kind of margin potential on the go forward, even if the crop bottom well up? Tom Werner : That makes sense. Yeah, well, I \u2013 the plan is, as we look at our inflation, our plan for 2023, we are factoring in pricing actions and cost savings to offset all the inflation and to get our margins back to pre-pandemic levels. That\u2019s where we are headed. And there is going to be puts and takes as we negotiate these contract prices with our customers. But again, the \u2013 it is dependent upon an average crop which we\u2019ll know in the next six months where the crop is going to end up, but that\u2019s where we are driving the business. And again, my confidence level is very high that we are going to continue to execute towards that based on how we\u2019ve been executing with some of the \u2013 with the pricing actions we\u2019ve taken today. And \u2013 but it\u2019s going to take time. The global segments are laagered. We\u2019ll get through the negotiations and you\u2019ll see improvement in the back half in the global segment specifically. Robert Dickerson : Okay. Okay. And then, maybe just so understand this little bit better. Obviously, potatoes are contracted with the growers it\u2019s got if the market but it\u2019s more understood. If we are thinking out multi-year period, right, as you get to the end of this year, and then, let\u2019s say you re-contract with those growers, if they are more some increased costs to the growers, right as we get to the end of this year for the forward. I mean, it\u2019s still challenged that it\u2019s kind of pass through pricing ability in the business would be still alive and well and the potential for further pricing, right, on the multi-year would still be possible? Right, it\u2019s not that you would say, right now we have taken a lot of pricing. We feel like we are in a good spot. We have to be careful about it and it\u2019s still very contingent or kind of what the cost of those potatoes would be on the go forward? Is that right? Tom Werner : Well, yes, it is and you got to \u2013 let me step back, you have to understand what we are doing from a pricing standpoint. We are just \u2013 we are pricing through inflation and it\u2019s \u2013 as pervasive as I\u2019ve ever seen it, a lot of us in the industry. So, when you think about that and you also think about the importance of French fries, our menu promo it\u2019s a proper driver. So, it\u2019s going to be a continuation, cost to grow is potentially going to go up and we\u2019ll continue pricing just as we have in past years. So, it\u2019s a question of, to me, there is an element that at some point as \u2013 if the cost continue to increase to the levels they are, what\u2019s the elasticity of a French fry. And right now we have seen it. So, we\u2019ll continue to run our game plan and we\u2019ll adjust to the market down the road. Robert Dickerson : Alright. Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Thank you. Good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning, Chris. Bernadette Madarieta : Hi, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi. I had a first question that\u2019ll follow on to Rob\u2019s question there. And you have another price increase going through, I guess, I think you have some food service in retail. It sounds like, that would take hold roughly in September or so, if we think about the timing it takes to get that through. I am just curious how to think about, is that related to cost that you are bearing now? Is it any way getting in front of what is going to be a higher potato cost next year and given the timing when this takes hold? So I just want to understand that\u2019s price increase if I could? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, Chris. This is Bernadette. It absolutely is related to the significant cost inflation that Tom was just referring to that we are seeing now and we are passing those costs through. And we\u2019ll continue to monitor the environment and the inflation that we continue to see in packaging ingredients OAO et cetera, and make decisions in terms of when further pricing actions may be necessary to offset that significant inflation that we are seeing. Chris Growe : Did you say what percentage this price increase is? Bernadette Madarieta : No. Chris Growe : Do you want to? Tom Werner : Chris, we don\u2019t disclose that. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you. I had sort of one more question for us if I could, which is that if I am thinking about the piece of your global division that was affected by and you mentioned how was down 20 plus percent in volume. A quick math that says about a 4% drag on volume on the overall company? I just want to make sure, is that math in the right area there? And related to that more importantly, is export volume clearing anymore now? You are getting more on the road and maybe our competitor is coming in? Is anyone else that will come in, in and satisfy that volume? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, so, as it relates to the global volume, the math you did there is right in terms of the impact on the total company. And then, as we look at export volume, it is starting to increase. We are seeing a few more containers be available than what we saw during the third quarter. So that is a positive sign that it\u2019s still much lower than what we\u2019ve seen previously and what we\u2019ve come to expect for that international business. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you for your time today. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Chris. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning, Adam. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually [Indiscernible] stepping in for Adam. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color on few items. If we think about the next 6 to 12 months, what are your expectations on cost inflation and what parts of your COGS basket become more or less inflationary compared to your prior costs? Tom Werner : Yeah, so, we\u2019ve indicated we are up 20% of potato raw price. In terms of the overall basket inflation, we are right in the middle of putting together our 2023 plan. And we\u2019ll give some more color on that in the upcoming earnings calls on what our overall view of inflation is for 2023. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks and if I could ask a follow-up, best performance in your JV compared to your base business, any differences in volume turns or inflationary pressures? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, as it relates to our joint venture, they are seeing very similar inflationary cost increases and then more recently certainly as a result of what\u2019s going on between Russia and Ukraine, there have been large increases in prices for natural gas and then we\u2019ve had to make some changes to the oil that\u2019s used in that joint venture. But, absolutely, they are seeing the same impact on their business as what we are seeing here from an inflation standpoint. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, and congrats on the quarter. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from William Reuter with Bank of America. William Reuter : Good morning. So, I know you contract for your raw material, sort for your raw potatoes, in terms of the other oils that are part of your cost of goods sold, other ingredients and packaging, what level of forward contracting purchases do you do there? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, so as it relates to our oil purchases and contracting as it relates to price, we have contracts in place for first quarter of 2023 and some of second quarter, but a pretty minimal amount. Beyond there, we don\u2019t have any other contracts in place. William Reuter : Perfect. And then, secondarily, given the delay in CapEx associated with the two expansion projects, do you have an early sense of even ballpark where CapEx could be for fiscal year 2023? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, we are in our planning process right now. So, we don\u2019t have anything to share today. But certainly, we\u2019ll provide you an update at our next earnings call. William Reuter : I understand. Okay. Thank you. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : At this time, that will conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks for joining the call today. Happy to take any follow-up questions over next number of days. Please email me, so we can schedule a time. Happy Opening Day everybody, and kind of go from there. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available website lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the Company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some key highlights for fiscal 2022 as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2023 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid results in fiscal 2022, and I want to thank all my Lamb Weston colleagues for navigating through this difficult and volatile environment these past two years. We've worked together as a focused team to weather pandemic, supply chain and macroeconomic headwinds while continuing to support our customers, improve our operations and execute on our long-term strategic objectives. Specifically, in fiscal 2022, we delivered a record year of $4.1 billion in sales, driven by a combination of favorable price/mix and volume growth as restaurant traffic and demand for fries continued to recover from the depths of the pandemic. We implemented pricing actions across each of our sales channels to mitigate some of the highest input and transportation cost inflation that we've experienced in 40 years. This helped to drive year-over-year gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, and we expect to realize a carryover benefit of these pricing actions in fiscal 2023. We simplified our portfolio by eliminating SKUs, drove productivity savings and work with our customers to secure product specification changes to offset much of the cost and operational impact of a historically poor potato crop. We also made tough, but necessary decisions around customers, sales channels, production and service levels and adopted tools and practices to better manage our customer and product portfolio. In our production facilities, we continue to leverage our Lamb Weston operating culture and changed our ways of working, including how we manage crewing schedules. This helped to better attract and retain employees, and we're making progress in getting our facilities fully staffed. We started up a new chopped and formed production line in Idaho and broke ground on our capacity expansion and modernization projects in Idaho and China. While our plant in China remains on track to be operational by mid fiscal 2024, we pushed back the completion of our new fried line in Idaho at least a few months to mid fiscal 2024 as a result of some equipment delays. We completed the design work for the second phase of our new enterprise resource planning system. We'll build and test the new system in fiscal 2023 and implement it in fiscal 2024 in a phased approach. We issued our third environmental, social and governance report, which has been prepared in accordance with leading industry standards such as the global reporting initiative. This report includes our progress towards specific ESG goals for 2030. We refinanced more than $1.7 billion of senior notes, which extended our debt maturities and reduced our weighted average interest rate. And finally, we increased our dividend for the fifth straight year and stepped up share repurchases to boost capital return to shareholders. In our joint ventures, Lamb-Weston/Meijer announced its intention to withdraw from its joint venture in Russia in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the devastating humanitarian crisis, the wars created. In July, we increased our interest in our joint venture in Argentina from 50% to 90% and will now consolidate its sales and earnings in our results. In short, we've been managing through a turbulent market to build good operating and financial momentum by controlling what we can control while continuing to best to support long-term growth. That said, we expect the environment, going forward, will remain very challenging with inflation continuing to pose the biggest threat to our cost structure and fried demand. Although the cost of some inputs, such as edible oils, energy and transportation, have come off their highs in recent weeks, they remain elevated relative to the past few years. Labor availability continues to be an issue while other key inputs, such as ingredients for fried coatings, remain costly and in short supply. As a result, we expect input, transportation and labor costs will be a significant headwind through fiscal 2023. Rising food, energy and housing prices have also affected restaurant traffic and consumer demand in the U.S. in the past few months. While traffic at quick service restaurants, which account for more than 80% of fried servings, has held up fairly well. Traffic at casual dining and other full-service restaurants have softened recently as consumer scale back dining out occasions or shifted to QSRs. Despite pressure on overall restaurant traffic, the demand for fries remain solid as the fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is a rate in which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, remains above pre-pandemic levels. Going forward, we expect restaurant traffic and consumer demand in the U.S. will be choppy and less predictable in the near term as consumers face significant cost inflation. Fry demand in retail channels, however, should continue to benefit if demand in out-of-home channels is pressured. Outside the U.S. Consumer demand trends in Europe have been similar to what we have experienced in the U.S. as a result of inflationary pressures, which will also likely lead to a more unpredictable operating environment in fiscal 2023. Outside of China, demand in Asia has been relatively stable. The recovery in demand in China has been uneven as the government there maintains its Zero COVID policy. In addition, our shipments to Asia continued to be constrained by the limited availability of shipping containers, although that availability did improve somewhat in the fourth quarter. The bottom line is that we're forecasting cost and demand in this near-term inflationary and volatile macroeconomic environment will be difficult and require us to remain flexible in managing our supply chain and commercial operations. Despite these short-term challenges, we're confident in the long-term resiliency and growth prospects of the category in the U.S. and in our key international markets. With respect to pricing, our price/mix growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter as we continue to execute on our product and freight pricing actions. In early July, we began implementing our fourth round of pricing in the past 12 months in our Foodservice and Retail segments. We expect to see the benefit of these pricing actions as well as the one that we took in April to gradually build as we progress through the first half of fiscal 2023. In our Global segment, it's clear that in the back half of fiscal 2022, we benefited from price escalators included in multiyear agreements and had some success in securing price increases outside of these contractual escalators. However, it's equally clear that we have yet to fully offset inflation and other costs given the more rigid structures and terms of customer agreements in this segment resulting in a 110 basis point decline in product contribution margin percentage in the fourth quarter. As you may recall, most of our chain restaurant contracts in our Global segment are multiyear agreements, and we're in the process of negotiating renewals representing about 1/3 of our global segment volume this year. We're being aggressive in discussions with customers to secure price increases to offset inflationary pressures, so that we can gradually restore profitability towards pre-pandemic levels. We're also seeking to modify other key terms to reduce the chances of, again, facing a significant pricing lag to recover rising costs. For those agreements up for renewal this year, we'll generally begin to see the results of these new pricing structures during the second half of fiscal 2023. However, it may take up to a couple of years before we can fully recover costs across our global segment customer portfolio. For those multiyear contracts that were renewed over the past couple of years, we'll continue to realize the price escalators embedded in those agreements. With respect to this year's upcoming potato crop, we expect the crops in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta in the Midwest to be largely in line with historical averages. While cooler than average weather in the spring and early summer slowed the crops progression, it is largely caught up to historical average with warmer temperatures and sunny days in recent weeks. We'll provide more detail on the crop when we report our first quarter results in early October, in line with our past practice. As we've previously discussed, we've agreed to a 20% increase in the contracted price per pound, reflecting our approach for annual price changes that reflect the cost to grow plus an appropriate return for our growers such that they are viable over the long term. We'll begin to see the impact of these higher contracted potato prices during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as we begin to process the early potato varieties that are harvested in mid-summer. So in summary, we delivered solid results in fiscal 2022, including record high sales in the fourth quarter and for the year. We continue to successfully execute pricing actions and cost mitigation efforts as we look to offset input cost inflation and the impact of a historically poor crop. We remain confident in the resiliency and the long-term prospects of the category, although near-term demand will likely be choppy and difficult to predict. And at this time, this year's crop is on track to be in line with historical averages. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2023 outlook. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by echoing Tom's comments and thanking our employees for their hard work and continued dedication to drive our solid operating and financial performance during these challenging times. We delivered fourth quarter sales growth of 14% or a record $1.15 billion with all of the growth coming from price/mix as we continued to execute our previously announced pricing actions in each of our core business segments to offset cost inflation. Sales volumes declined 1%, primarily reflecting lower export volumes due to limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks. Total North American volume grew this quarter behind strong sales to large chain restaurant customers. While consumer demand in our Foodservice and Retail channels also grew, our sales volumes to those customers fell as we were unable to fully serve this demand as a result of lower production run rates and throughput at our production facilities. For the year, sales increased 12% to nearly $4.1 billion, a record high with price/mix up 9% and volume up 3%. Gross profit in the quarter increased $56 million and gross margin expanded 230 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 22%. Product and freight price increases drove the improvement, more than offsetting the impact of higher costs on a per pound basis and lower sales volumes. Cost per pound increased double digits for the fourth straight quarter with inflation accounting for essentially all of the increase. Higher prices for inputs, such as edible oils, ingredients for batter and other coatings and packaging, were the primary drivers. Labor costs were also notably up, reflecting broad competition for production team members. Transportation rates also rose sharply versus the prior year. Transport costs increased as we continue to rely on an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail to meet service obligations for certain customers. And as Tom mentioned, while the cost of some inputs and transportation have come off their highs in recent weeks, they remain elevated relative to the past few years and will continue to pose a headwind through fiscal 2023. We also continue to incur higher potato costs as a consequence of the poor crop that was harvested last fall. We will continue to realize the financial impact of this poor potato crop through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023. And finally, we continue to incur higher costs and operational inefficiencies associated with labor, spare parts, and ingredient shortages, and other industry-wide supply chain challenges. Increased downtimes associated with scheduled maintenance also reduced production run rates, lowering our fixed cost recovery. Partially offsetting these higher costs per pound were benefits from our portfolio simplification, cost mitigation and other productivity efforts. Moving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A increased $19 million in the quarter, largely due to higher incentive compensation expense and a $3.5 million contribution to our charitable foundation. Equity method earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures in Europe, the U.S. and Argentina, declined $57 million. This included a $63 million noncash charge associated with the European joint venture's intent to withdraw from its joint venture that operates a production facility in Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine. Excluding the impact of this charge as well as mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts, equity earnings increased $2 million versus the prior year. So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, increased 21% while adjusted diluted EPS rose 48%. Higher sales and gross margin expansion drove the increases. Moving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 10% in the quarter. Price/mix drove the entire increase, reflecting domestic and international pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals, inflation-driven price escalators, and higher prices charged for freight. Overall segment volume was flat. We drove solid growth in shipments to large QSR and casual dining chains in North America. However, this growth was offset by a more than 10% decline in international shipments, reflecting limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks. While still down versus the prior year, international shipments improved sequentially versus a decline of 20% in the third quarter as more shipping containers were made available. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotion expenses, declined 1% to $56 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix. Sales in our Foodservice segment grew 21%. Price/mix increased 24% as we continue to drive product and freight pricing actions that we announced earlier in the year to mitigate cost inflation. Sales volumes decreased 3% as labor and commodity shortages as well as scheduled maintenance downtimes impacted run rates and throughput at our production facilities, creating the inability to fully serve customer demand. We did see sales volumes slow each successive month during the quarter as restaurant traffic, especially in casual dining, softened as consumers responded to accelerating inflation. Foodservices product contribution margin rose 47% to $142 million as favorable price more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound. In our Retail segment, sales increased 20%. Price was up 22%, reflecting product and freight pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios as well as favorable mix. Volume fell 2%, reflecting incremental losses of certain lower margin private label products. This was partially offset by higher shipments of branded products, although this growth was tempered by our inability to fully serve customer demand due to lower production run rate. Retail's product contribution margin nearly doubled to $42 million behind pricing actions, favorable mix with the sales of more branded products and a $3 million decline in A&P expenses. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound. Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $525 million of cash and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. We had net debt of about $2.2 billion, which corresponds to a 3.1x leverage ratio. For the year, we generated about $420 million of cash from operations, which is down about $135 million versus the prior year, largely due to higher working capital. Capital expenditures for the year were about $305 million. That's up about $145 million as we completed the chopped and formed line in Idaho and began construction of our capacity expansion in China. For the year, we returned nearly $290 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and have just under $275 million of authorization -- this program. Now turning to our updated fiscal 2023 outlook. As Tom noted, we anticipate the overall operating environment to continue to be challenging, with inflation continuing to affect our cost structure as well as consumer demand. Accordingly, we're taking a prudent approach to our fiscal 2023 outlook. We're targeting sales of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, which implies a growth rate of 15% to 17%. We expect that price will be the primary driver of sales growth as we continue to implement our previously announced pricing actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments and secure price increases in contracts up for renewal with customers in our Global segment. With respect to volume, forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult. Overall, we expect U.S. demand to remain solid, but will also likely be affected by significant inflation that consumers are facing. In the event of an economic recession, we expect demand for French fries will be resilient, although with little to no growth. That's consistent with what we experienced during the great recession from 2008 to 2010. Consumer behavior during inflationary or recessionary times may also have an effect on sales channel and product mix. QSRs and retail outlets may benefit, but this may be at the expense of casual dining establishments. We've already seen some indications of this in the past few months. In addition, we expect our volume growth will be limited by near-term production and throughput constraints as we continue to face labor shortages, disruptions in the availability of key product inputs and spare parts and limited access to shipping containers for exports. For earnings, we expect net income of $360 million to $410 million. Diluted EPS of $2.45 to $2.85, and adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, of $840 million to $910 million. Using the midpoint of this EBITDA range implies growth of about 20% or about $150 million versus the prior year. We expect the earnings increase will be driven primarily by sales growth and gross margin expansion. Favorable price/mix and productivity savings should more than offset input, manufacturing and transportation inflation as well as the cost inefficiencies and potato crop challenges that pressured our results last year. During the first half of fiscal '23, we expect our gross margin to improve versus the first half of fiscal '22, but will continue to be pressured as compared to our normalized seasonal rates. This reflects the implementation of our pricing actions, lagging inflation as well as the impact of higher raw potato costs on a per pound basis due to the poor crop that we harvested last fall. We also expect our gross margins will be pressured by ongoing industry-wide labor and logistics challenges. During the second half of fiscal '23, we expect our gross margin will approach our normalized annual rate of 25% to 26%, assuming four key factors. First, an average fall 2022 potato crop. As Tom noted, at this time, we believe the crop in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin and Idaho will be consistent with historical averages. Second, the continued successful implementation of our pricing actions to offset input and transportation cost inflation. As our recent results have shown, we've been able to successfully increase price across our portfolio. Third, the continued easing of labor pressures that have affected our production run rates and throughput. While factory labor availability remains challenging, we feel good about the actions that we've put in place to attract and retain production workers. And finally, the continued easing of logistics pressures that have constrained our shipments, especially our exports, the availability of domestic rail and trucking assets has improved in the past few months, along with access to shipping containers. However, we're closely monitoring the recent expiration of the West Coast dock workers union contract and what impact, if any, may have on our exports. We're projecting the strong increase in sales and gross profit will be partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. We're targeting total SG&A expenses of $475 million to $500 million, which is about $100 million higher than fiscal 2022, using the midpoint of that range. The increase largely reflects higher compensation and benefit costs as we adjust our compensation packages to reflect a very competitive environment to attract and retain talent. Additional headcount, recruiting, training, travel and meeting expenses as we look to fill open positions to support growth over the long term and continue to emerge from pandemic-related restrictions. Higher spending to build and test our new ERP system, in addition to other IT infrastructure upgrades, higher A&P expenses, predominantly in support of our retail segment and finally, overall inflation for third-party services. We expect equity earnings to be $25 million to $30 million, which is up from about $16 million in fiscal 2022 after excluding the $27 million of mark-to-market commodity and currency contract gains as well as the impairment charge and about $10 million of earnings from the Russia joint venture. In addition to our operating targets, we expect total interest expense of around $115 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. Total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $210 million and capital expenditures of $475 million to $525 million, which includes about $285 million for the construction of our capacity expansions in Idaho and China as well as capital associated with our new ERP system and other IT upgrades. Finally, as Tom noted, we recently acquired a controlling interest in our joint venture in Argentina for $42 million and will now consolidate their results. We do not expect the joint venture to have a material contribution to either sales or earnings growth this year. So, looking at our fiscal 2023 outlook at a high level, we're targeting sales of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, largely driven by price/mix, and we're targeting adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, of $840 million to $910 million, largely driven by strong sales growth as well as gross margins that approach a normalized annual run rate of 25% to 26% during the second half of the fiscal year. Now, here's Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bernadette. Let me quickly sum up by saying we delivered solid results in fiscal 2022 by focusing on what we can control and have built good operating momentum as we enter a new year. We've taken a prudent approach to our fiscal 2023 targets as we expect the operating and demand environment to remain highly challenging, and we're confident in the long-term prospects of the category and remain committed to executing on our strategies and investing in our global network to support growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term. Thank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Tom, I just wanted to maybe unpack your comments around volumes for the year and kind of what you're expecting. I think in the press release, it does talk about positive volume growth, marrying that against your comments about maybe a little bit of slowing demand, just how you're thinking about the ability for volumes to grow throughout the year, maybe that means you have more potatoes given a better crop or how we should think about that? And then just the cadence of volume growth throughout the year as well would be helpful. Tom Werner : Yes. So Peter, the indicator is restaurant traffic, and we keep a close eye on that. It's -- in terms of -- QSR traffic looks relatively healthy. As we've seen in the past few months, the casual dining traffic has slowed down a bit, and we'll keep a close eye on that. Retail volumes continue to be pretty resilient. So it's not a matter of potatoes to support the volume, it really comes down to restaurant traffic. And you guys see the syndicated data just like we do. So that's something we keep an eye on really close, but that's going to be a leading indicator of the volume for the year. I'm confident, as I think about the next year, certainly, there's concern about the economy. But the French fry category, even though -- even if we get into a situation where there's some economic slowdown, over time and historically, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, there may be some switching from casual dining to QSR, but the overall category, I'm confident we'll continue to grow. Peter Galbo : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And Bernadette, I just want to ask about the cadence of gross margins for the year. So understanding that the first half, you should still be up year-over-year, maybe down versus your historical levels. But I guess why would the first half gross margins, if at all, kind of step back versus the fourth quarter? I think historically, first quarter and fourth quarter gross margins tend to be relatively similar. 2Q tends to be kind of plus or minus 100 basis points versus the first quarter. So just help us kind of understand the first half as we then think about approaching the second half at a more normalized rate. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. Thanks Peter. First quarter is typically our lowest margin quarter for the entire year. We saw that last year as well. And we will be processing or recognizing the costs associated with the potatoes that we harvested -- or excuse me, that we processed in the fourth quarter, which are those higher costs, and we'll continue to recognize those higher costs throughout the first half of the year until we work through this old crop. Then as we start harvesting and recognizing some of the cost -- higher costs associated with this year's crop, we're not going to see much of a change there in terms of the cost of our potatoes just given, as Tom previously announced, we did have a 20% increase in the cost of that crop this year. However, we expect greater yield and other things that's going to lower those -- improve those margins in the back half of the year. Does that make sense? Peter Galbo : Yes. No, it does. Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : Maybe Just kick off on following up on this cost inflation. I guess, quite simply, you've got a lot of moving parts with especially the crop rolling over into the new one, which has the big step-up in pricing. If we think about that double-digit rate of inflation that you discussed throughout this year, how does that change as we look towards next year? And is there a shift from quarter-to-quarter or maybe one period is more onerous than another? Tom Werner : Yes. So Tom, this is Tom Werner. Here's the way to think about it. Our guidance takes into account the potato cost inflation, all of our input cost inflation, obviously. And as we've think about our pricing strategy and the timing of pricing that gets to the market, there is a lag. There's been a lag in the global business unit, as I commented on. It's going to be building over the course of this fiscal year in terms of regaining our margin structure to pre-pandemic levels. So there's a lot of noise, and you're absolutely right. We've got the old crop we're working through, as Bernadette had just said. So we have a higher cost crop. We're processing right now. We have inflationary in the inputs for this next year. So it's going to be a build, as I've said for the past year. I'm confident where the commercial team has done a tremendous job getting to the market and executing our pricing strategies. So it's going to take until the back half of next year that we're going to get back to our pre-pandemic normalized margin levels, and we're going to build and we will be approaching those levels as we get through the back half of the year. Tom Palmer : Okay. And I wanted to ask on the SG&A side. Pretty big step-up guided this year. I think you've highlighted a few areas, right? Some of it is very ongoing in terms of labor, just getting paid more effectively. But you've also called out investments in IT and in the ERP system. And it sounds like there's kind of two pieces, right? Maybe there's an ongoing piece to that once it's fully rolled out, but there's also implementation costs that are rolling through the P&L. So to what extent is this stepped-up cost space here to stay versus might we actually see a little easing as we look towards future years and those investments aren't needed anymore? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. No, thanks, Tom. As it relates to SG&A, we have stepped up our guidance there, it approximates about 10% of our sales, including advertising and promotion expenses, as we discussed. We're bringing that back more to levels that we had prior to the pandemic. And then we do have these incremental ERP expenses that we are incurring. The piece that's going to be more here to stay is going to be as it relates to the compensation and benefits, as I referred to in my prepared remarks that have increased as we've worked to grow the team as well as attract the talent that are needed to continue to execute our strategies over the long term. Tom Palmer : Okay. So no quantification on maybe what might roll off in coming years? Bernadette Madarieta : No quantification at this time. But having said that, we're always looking for ways to become more efficient, and we'll continue to do that. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I guess the first question is thinking about the margins, and you talked about getting back to that historical 25% to 26% the way approaching it in the back half of the fiscal year? And I guess it would seem like, a, the composition of that is going to be different than history when we think about kind of the contribution in Global relative to Foodservice and Retail, the contribution margins just between the different units and the mix looks very different than it would have pre-pandemic based on kind of where you're exiting fiscal '22. So -- and I guess with the amount of inflation that you're pricing for, it would seem like that would imply per pound margins are going to be actually above pre-pandemic levels by the end of the fiscal year, if you hit those rates. And I guess I'd just love to hear you reflect on kind of what would necessitate higher per pound unit margins over time to -- in this space other than just a greater mix of sales going into the broader Foodservice Retail channel versus larger QSR customers? Tom Werner : Yes, Adam, I'll tell you to think about it this way. It's a pretty complex process. So we spend a maniacal amount of time focusing on our mix management right now and have been for the past 12 to 15 months. There's -- obviously, with all the challenges in supply chain and the run rates have changed in terms of our throughput efficiency, so we have to be very selective on our mix management and making sure that we service our strategic customers, but that does give us opportunity to think through the overall customer mix and we've done a terrific job of that, but it is a process. And Adam, there is -- again, when we execute our pricing actions, there is a lag through our P&L. So it does take some time to build that up. So we've commented that we've taken a number of pricing actions to even try just to catch up in a number of different areas of the Company, but we'll start to see that build, but it does take some time. And again, I'm confident with our commercial teams, what they've been executing. The volume trends look solid, but it will be -- there'll be some choppiness in the volume between channels, but it's a process. And I'm -- again, it's going to be a build, but the back half of the year, we'll get there. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. And Adam, I think it's just critical to recall that with our global contracts, about 1/3 of those come open each year. And so it's going to take time, to Tom's point, as we continue to negotiate those each year. And that's essentially what's driving some of that difference. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And maybe if I could ask -- if I look at fiscal '22 and kind of whether it's kind of where you're exiting the year or just the full year kind of where would you frame capacity utilization for your business today? There's a lot of moving pieces in there between labor and potato crop and different parts of the year, but I'm just trying to get a sense of how much latent kind of volume growth exists in the existing footprint versus how much volume can we kind of then layer in over the next couple of years when the China plant and the Idaho plant eventually come on? Tom Werner : Yes, Adam, I'm not going to give you a specific number on our current capacity utilization. It's below where we've been historically. I'll say that. But we've got -- the China plant will come on in mid-2024. We definitely have opportunities within our current capacity to improve our throughput, and it is improving, and we're continuing to work on that. We opened our chopped and formed line, so that's given us some capacity on those products. But again, as we continue to staff up our plants, labor's improved, sequentially, over the past six months, and that gives me confidence that as the market and the category continues to grow, we get our capacity, our plants running close to historical average, we'll be able to meet demand. And I'm, again, bullish on the category, always have been, as everybody knows, and I'm investing behind it for what we see this category doing in the next five to seven years with our investments in China, American Falls and Europe. So we've got to build and we've got to get more efficient in our current capacity to meet demand, and I'm confident we're going to do that. We have a plan. Adam Samuelson : And if I could squeeze one more. In the quarter, 15% price/mix, I know you started invoicing for freight surcharges, how much was freight surcharges of the price/mix? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. We're not breaking that out from our product price increases. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : I had a question for you a bit of a follow-on to your commentary there on the global contracts. And just to make sure I'm understanding like your expectation for the rate of pricing in those global contracts. And then is it -- do you see a point in fiscal '23, where the pricing in that division offsets the inflation? Or is it going to take longer to get the pricing through? Tom Werner : Chris, this is Tom. Think of it in terms of this. We're, again, focused on pricing to get to pre-pandemic margin levels, and we're having discussions with customers. It is a layering effect. So, all contracts don't go into effect at the same time. So you won't see a full annualized price realization in some of our global contracts because they may start in October or November or December or January. So there's going to be a lag still just like we always have. That's been the case forever in this business. But on the other side, you get the carryover effect. So there is a lag. Again, this is why we've been really consistent to ensure that everybody understands that it's all about getting the discussions, the strategies in place and in the back half of fiscal '23, we'll start seeing the margins approaching pre-pandemic levels. Chris Growe : Okay. And then in relation to the pricing coming through in the Global division today, is that mostly the escalators kicking in that you've built into some of these contracts? Tom Werner : Yes, Chris, that's exactly right. Chris Growe : Okay. And just one other question, which is in relation to the -- in a situation where, say, the yields from this year's potato crop are greater than average or better, how limited are you in producing that product? So if you have more supply, can you grow volumes more once the crop comes in? Is there any still kind of ongoing limitation of what you can make, be it labor, just general supply constraints today? Tom Werner : Yes, Chris. So think of it in terms of this. We contract the majority of our forecasted volume needs every year. And we do have a percentage of open, what we just call open -- just open potatoes that will go out of the market and buy, depending upon how the category is growing, how the volume, what opportunities that may come our way. So we have flexibility and as the crop as we start understanding how the yields acres, how the crop is progressing through the growing season, and we evaluate our overall forecasted demand and needs, then we'll make decisions in the open market to buy or. And so it's -- and it's been a really good balance as long as I've been running this company and been in the business. So -- but it is fluid. But it's not a matter of are you going to have enough potatoes to meet demand? We make those decisions early on in the harvest season if we need to go out in the open market and buy potatoes. Just like we have every year. So I feel really good about how we're balanced, how the crop is doing this year. But we're -- in the next six months, we'll make those decisions -- over the next six weeks, we'll make those decisions on procuring potentially open potatoes in the market. Chris Growe : And to be clear, if you have more potatoes from this crop and therefore, you lost just say you had to buy less in the open market, I guess, I'm really more interested in your capacity. Are you able to make the product and sell the product if you can get more volume in the door -- more supply in the door, sorry? Tom Werner : Yes. I mean -- we'll make our -- so if we have more potatoes because the yields are greater than we'll make our standard Lamb Weston SKUs. But still -- Chris, the other thing to remember is we're still focused on improving our run rate. Operator : We'll now take our next question from William Reuter with Bank of America. William Reuter : I just have two. The first is, is there any way to quantify what the impact of the poor potato crop was on your fiscal year '22 EBITDA? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. We haven't quantified that impact to discuss outside. But it is in excess of what we experienced in 2014. The last time we had a poor crop, which was about $30 million that we disclosed at that time. We're continuing to work through this crop. As we said, we'll continue to recognize the impact of that through the first half of fiscal '23. William Reuter : Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of thinking about your capital allocation and share repurchases, within -- I think your leverage target range is 3x to 4x. I guess when you think about next year, how will you think about share repurchases? Should we assume that basically all free cash flow that will be generated will go towards some shareholder activity such as that? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So as it relates to our buyback program, we've disclosed and discussed previously that it's really in place to offset equity dilution. We've demonstrated, though, that we will be more aggressive if it makes sense. But our plan is in place to offset equity dilution. William Reuter : Okay. And the target leverage range is 3x to 4x. I do have that correct. Is that right? Bernadette Madarieta : 3.5x to 4x. William Reuter : Okay. And is that net or gross? Bernadette Madarieta : That's net. Operator : And it appears there are no telephone questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thank you for joining us today. Any follow-up questions. Please e-mail maybe we can set up a time. And everybody, have a good day. Thank you. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's first quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website lambweston.com.  Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.  With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our first quarter results and our fiscal 2023 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our performance in the quarter. We drove strong sales growth, expanded our gross margin and nearly doubled adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures. Our results reflect our continued focused on implementing pricing actions to offset input and transportation cost inflation, driving productivity and cost saving initiatives, increasing service levels for our customers in each of our sales channels, and supporting our people and talent. We\u2019ve built good operating momentum over the past few quarters by focusing on these near-term objectives. And we're confident in our ability to deliver the upper end of our sales and earning target ranges for the year. I'm especially proud that Lamb Weston team has continued to generate solid results in a very difficult macroeconomic environment. We expect this environment to remain challenging at least through fiscal 2023, as inflation, a growing threat of recession and industry-wide supply chain disruptions continue to pressure demand for fries as well as our cost structure. It's no surprise that inflationary trends for food, energy and housing have affected restaurant traffic in the U.S. over the past six months. We saw similar restaurant traffic trends during The Great Recession as the consumer discretionary income came under pressure. While traffic at quick-service restaurants has held up relatively well, it's come at the expense of casual dining and full-service restaurants as consumers increasingly choose less expensive options when dining away from home. In the past month or so, we've seen casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic tick up from summer lows, but traffic remains below levels achieved just prior to the war in Ukraine. Unlike traffic trends, fry demand continues to be solid when dining out. The fry attachment rate which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other foodservice outlets remains above pre-pandemic levels. Fry demand in retail channels has also benefited as restaurant traffic slows. Overall, we expect volatility in restaurant traffic and demand trends will continue through fiscal 2023. But history has shown that this category is resilient during economic downturns. Although we may see some category weakness in the near-term, we remain confident in the long term growth prospects of the category in the U.S. and in our key international markets. In addition, as category growth returns to historical rates, we should be well positioned to capture at least our share of growth with our investments in new processing capacity in Idaho and China, as well as our newly announced expansion in Argentina. With respect to pricing, our overall price/mix growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. In our Foodservice and Retail segments, we continue to realize the carryover benefit of multiple product pricing actions that we have taken over the past 15 months and expect the benefit of these actions will continue to gradually build through the first half of fiscal 2023.  In our Global segment, we made good progress in increasing price/mix through price escalators included in multiyear contracts, while also securing some price adjustments outside of these agreements. In addition, we nearly completed negotiation -- negotiating contract renewals that represent about 1/3 of our Global segment volume. Overall, we feel good about how the discussions played out and we'll generally begin to see the results of these new pricing structures during the second half of fiscal 2023. Finally, with respect to this year's potato crop. Our preliminary view is the potato crop in our growing regions in the aggregate will be around the lower end of historical average range. Specifically, the overall quality of the crop including shape, color, level of defects and solid content is good and consistent with historical averages. Yields, however, are below average. The unusually hot weather during August affected the growth of the potatoes and resulted in a greater than average proportion of potatoes failing to bulk up to the desired size. In response, we've already begun to secure the additional potatoes needed to meet our production forecast, and expect to purchase most of this from growers in the Columbia Basin and Idaho. That's in contrast to last year when we purchased potatoes at significant premiums to contracted prices and transported them from as far away as the East Coast. As you may recall, our financial targets for the year were predicated in part on an average potato crop. And we believe this crop is broadly consistent with our expectations. While below average yields will result in additional open market purchases at higher than contracted prices, we do not expect this to affect our ability to deliver our financial targets. To be clear, we view this crop as significantly better than last year's which was poor both in terms of yield and quality due to the prolonged extreme summer heat in the Pacific Northwest. We'll provide our final assessment of the crop, including how it performs out of storage when we report our second quarter results in early January.  So in summary, we generated strong sales and earnings growth in the first quarter by executing pricing actions in each of our business segments and driving productivity savings. We expect restaurant traffic and fry demand will be volatile in the near-term, as consumers continue to adjust to the inflationary environment. And on a preliminary basis, we believe that potato crops in our growing regions are at the lower end of historical average range, and that any effect on our operations or financial performance will be manageable. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our first quarter results and our progress towards our fiscal 2023 financial commitments. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, we're pleased with our performance in the quarter, and we are confident in our ability to deliver at the high end of our financial target ranges for the year. In the quarter, our sales grew 14% to more than $1.1 billion. Price/mix was up 19% as we continued to benefit from product and freight pricing actions that we announced last fiscal year and as we began to execute new pricing actions during the fiscal - for the first quarter. Our sales volumes were down 5%, primarily reflecting the softer restaurant traffic trends in U.S. casual dining and full-service outlets that Tom described earlier, as well as the timing of shipments to large chain restaurant customers. In Retail, while branded product volumes were up, overall Retail segment volumes were down with the ongoing effect of losing certain low margin private label business. Sales volumes in Foodservice and Retail also continued to be affected by our inability to fully serve customer demand as a result of constrained production at our facilities. Gross profit increased $122 million to $273 million in the quarter. Gross margin expanded nearly 900 basis points versus the prior year quarter, and 230 basis points sequentially to more than 24%. Pricing actions and productivity savings drove these improvements, more than offsetting the impact of higher costs on a per pound basis and lower sales volumes. Cost per pound increased high-single-digits with inflation, again, accounting for essentially all of the increase. Higher prices for inputs such as edible oils, ingredients for batter and other coatings, labor and transportation were the primary drivers. Potato costs were also up as a result of the poor crop that was harvested last fall. We'll continue to realize the financial impact of this crop through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as we sell the final finished goods produced from the crop. And finally, we continue to incur higher costs and operational inefficiencies associated with labor, spare parts and ingredient shortages and other industry-wide supply chain challenges. Benefits from our portfolio simplification, and other cost mitigation efforts, however, offset some of these higher costs.  Moving on from cost of sales, our SG&A increased $25 million to $116 million, largely due to higher compensation and benefits expense and expenses related to improving our IT infrastructure, including designing a new ERP system. Equity method earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures in Europe and the U.S. increased nearly $170 million. More than $140 million of the increase was related to the change in unrealized gains for mark-to-market adjustments related to changes in natural gas and electricity derivatives, as commodity markets in Europe have experienced significant volatility. Another $15 million of the increase relates to a gain recognized in connection with us acquiring an additional 40% interest in our joint venture in Argentina. Excluding these comparability items as well as other mark-to-market adjustments not associated with natural gas and electricity derivatives, equity earnings increased $13 million. This largely reflects improved results in our joint venture in Europe.  In addition, in September, our European joint venture withdrew from its joint venture in Russia after receiving all regulatory approvals. In the prior year quarter, earnings from the Russia joint venture were not material. So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures nearly doubled to $228 million, while adjusted diluted earnings per share more than tripled to $0.75 per share. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion primarily drove the increases.  Moving on to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 12% in the quarter, price/mix was up 14% reflecting domestic and international pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals, inflation driven price escalators and higher prices charged for freight. Mix was also positive. Overall segment volumes declined 2% as North American volumes fell primarily due to the timing of shipments to large QSR chain customers, including the effect of lapping a notable limited time product offering in the prior year quarter. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotion expenses, nearly doubled to $84 million. Favorable price/mix more than offset the impact of higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound.  Sales in our Foodservice segment grew 14%, price/mix increased 26% as we continue to drive product and freight pricing actions that we announced throughout fiscal 2022 and earlier in the quarter to counter inflation. Sales volumes decreased 12% as casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic softened. While traffic trends progressively softened each month since the war in Ukraine began at the end of February, it began to tick upward in August. Sales volumes were also affected by the timing of incremental losses of certain low margin non-commercial business, as well as our inability to fully serve demand as a result of constrained production. Foodservice's product contribution margin rose more than 40% to $138 million as favorable price more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.  In our Retail segment, sales increased 28%, price/mix was up 32% reflecting pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios, as well as favorable mix with the sale of more branded products. Volume was down 4% reflecting incremental losses of certain lower margin private label products. We will be lapping the last of that lost private label business in the second quarter. Sales volumes were also tempered by our inability to fully serve customer demand due to the constrained production. Retail's product contribution margin more than tripled to $49 million behind pricing actions and favorable mix. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound. Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $485 million of cash and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. While our net debt remained relatively flat at about $2.25 billion, our leverage ratio fell to 2.7x from 3.1x at the end of the fiscal 2022 as earnings grew. We generated more than $190 million of cash from operations, which is up about $30 million versus the prior year quarter, largely due to higher earnings. Capital expenditures were about $120 million, that's up about $40 million as we continue to construct new French fry lines in Idaho and China. In addition, we paid about $42 million to acquire the additional 40% interest in our joint venture in Argentina. We now own 90% of that joint venture. We returned $64 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and have about $240 million of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. Turning to our fiscal 2023 outlook, our financial targets for the year remain unchanged as we continue to build our operating momentum. While the macro environment remains volatile, we're on track to deliver at the high end of our sales target of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion with price driving the growth. We'll continue to realize the carryover benefit of product pricing actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments. And in our Global segment, we expect to see the benefit of pricing actions, including pricing structures for contract renewals build as the year progresses. Forecasting volume continues to remain more difficult due to the near-term volatility in restaurant traffic and demand. As we saw in the first quarter, we believe that consumer behavior during inflationary or recessionary times will continue to affect overall demand, as well as our sales channel and product mix, with QSRs and retail outlets benefiting at the expense of casual dining, and full-service restaurants. In addition, we expect our sales volumes will be affected by near-term production and throughput constraints as we continue to face disruptions in the availability of key product inputs and spare parts. Additionally, while labor and access to shipping containers have improved, we continue to see the impact of shortages.  We're on track to deliver at the high-end of the range of our earnings targets, including adjusted net income of $360 million to $410 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.85 and adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures of $840 million to $910 million. These targets exclude the items impacting comparability that I described earlier.  We expect our earnings increase will be driven primarily by sales growth and gross margin expansion. We continue to expect gross margins during the second half of fiscal '23 that approach our normalized annual rate of 25% to 26% and we feel good about the four key factors underlying this target. First, as Tom noted, we believe that potato crops in our primary growing regions will be at the lower end of the historical average range, and that any effect on our operations and financial performance will be manageable. Second, we're pleased with the continued progress in implementing pricing actions to counter cost inflation. Third, we're making steady progress in adding production workers in order to ease labor pressures in our factories. And finally, the availability of domestic rail and trucking assets as well as access to shipping containers continues to improve. While abroad rail strike has likely been averted, we continue to closely monitor the status of discussions with the West Coast dockworkers' union and the impact of potential work slowdown or stoppage may have on our exports. We continue to target SG&A expenses of $475 million to $500 million, which reflects higher compensation and benefits expenses to attract and retain talent, higher spending for our new ERP system and other IT infrastructure upgrades, higher advertising and promotion expenses as we look to return support back to historical levels, and overall inflation for third-party services.  We continue to expect equity earnings of $25 million to $30 million, excluding items impacting comparability, but also expect increased volatility given the likelihood of a poor crop in Europe, as well as possible limitations on natural gas usage that may affect our production. In addition, we believe that the severe inflation outlook for Europe will likely translate into more pressure on restaurant traffic and demand. Our estimates for our other financial targets are unchanged, including capital expenditures of $475 million to $525 million, excluding acquisitions; interest expense of approximately $115 million; depreciation and amortization expense of about $210 million; and an effective tax rate, excluding items impacting comparability, of about 24%.  Now, here's Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bernadette. Let me quickly sum up by saying we are managing well through this challenging environment and continue to build good operating momentum. We're well positioned to deliver at the upper end of our financial target ranges for the year, and we're making the necessary investments in our production capacity, and operating infrastructure to support long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.  Thank you for joining us today and now we're ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : I just had a quick question for you. And, obviously, a very strong first quarter performance. Congratulations on that. Obviously, you are looking more towards the higher end of your guidance now for the year. With a strong first quarter and this recovery in the gross margin, it would seem like you could see even stronger EBITDA performance, I realize it's early in the year. But I just want to get a sense of items, maybe like in SG&A, if there's investments you can make there or perhaps even in -- as you start to kind of rebuild your production with better labor and availability now, if there's some items like that we should keep in mind as we move through the year that could put a bit of a limit on the EBITDA performance? Tom Werner : Yes, Chris. It\u2019s Tom. I'll just reiterate, we're off to a terrific start this fiscal year. And our focus -- you think about a year ago, our focus has been rebuilding our margin structure back to pre-pandemic levels. That's the focus of the team and they've done a terrific job. And just in terms of SG&A and I'll let Bernadette add on to this, we have some elevated spend due to the ERP, a lot of it. There's some wages, also, that has increased our SG&A based on the market conditions we have, but it's really about focusing on the mix margin management. That's what we've been focused on for the last year, when I started talking about it. Team has done a great job executing that. It\u2019s -- the volumes are a little bit choppy right now. And I think that's going to continue for the balance of this fiscal year, just based on the economic environment we're all operating in, and as well as some of the supply chain issues we continue to experience within freight and containers, those kinds of things. So, it's early, we got to understand how the crop processes through the factories the next 60 days. And on that note, in Q2 we will reassess kind of how we're feeling about the year. Chris Growe : And just a follow-up question on your gross margin. Obviously, it's a much stronger gross margin here in the first quarter than we expected and really more like your historical first quarter gross margin performance. I realize there's a lot going in the gross margin today from pricing and cost inflation and the old crop and all that. I just want to get a sense of the factors that are aiding the gross margin performance this quarter. And maybe along with that, just to get a sense of how much the supply chain challenges are still weighing on the gross margin? Tom Werner : Yes. Chris, the main factor, if you think about a year ago, we were at 15 margin. And so, it's really focused on pricing through inflation. We have absorbed a tremendous amount of cost inflation in this business, just like everybody else has in the space. So it's really driving pricing to offset inflation and we're making obviously great progress against that. We have a lot more to do. It's still from an input cost standpoint, we're going to see more inflation coming at us in the future. So we're adjusting our pricing architecture to offset that as much as we can and we believe we will. So that's kind of -- that's the driver, Chris. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. And we are making steady progress as we add production workers, based on some of the actions that we've taken to attract and retain employees, while there\u2019s still those labor shortages. We are seeing the impact of that, and some of the changes we've made to shift schedules and other things. Just getting back to your run rates and throughput question. Tom Werner : Yes, and just one of the one of the big challenges we still have is container issues for our international business, Chris. And it\u2019s -- while it's getting better, it's still hindering our ability to ship to some of our international markets in a pretty significant way which is impacting the overall volume in our Global business unit. The team is working through it as best we can. But it's still challenging from a container standpoint on the West Coast. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Tom, I just wanted to ask actually, like a more of a technical question, I guess, around the 2022 potato crop. Realizing that the yields are down and maybe the sizing is down a bit but with the quality being good, can you just, I guess educate us a little bit more on why the quality being above average or very good kind of helps pull up maybe a down yield year, what that does for you from a manufacturing standpoint? Tom Werner : Yes. So, the way to think about it is the quality of the potato as we're manufacturing it, or running it through the factories, it will provide good solids and good color, and the length is fine, which last year, we had all kinds of issues with the crop. So, set that aside, so quality is good, you're going to be able to -- the finish product is going to be more normalized I\u2019ll say. The yield impact is literally -- there's just less potatoes on the plant as it grows than what we historically have. So it's just -- you just have less potatoes per acre. And so we're -- I feel great about our ability to procure open potatoes, as we have every year. We do it every year. So while it's not at historical levels, like we said on the call, we will manage through it. We have a great ag team that will help us manage through it and procure the potatoes and we'll be able to deliver our customers the product they need. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, and Tom, if I add on to that. In terms of the quality component being better this year where it was worse last year, last year that lower quality really resulted in lower potato utilization. So it required more potatoes to produce the same amount of finished goods. And we're not going to have that issue this year with a better crop in terms of quality. And then potato quality also affects line speed times in our plants. Again, we won't have that issue this year with a better quality crop. Peter Galbo : Got it. That was going to be my follow-up, so thanks for that Bernadette. And then maybe just as a second question, more of a technical question for modeling purposes. Just can you quantify at all that the shipment timing impact on QSRs in the first quarter? Does that shift to the second quarter at all? And then just again, seasonally, I think historically gross margins tick up from 1Q to 2Q in a normal year. Should we expect some of that normal sequential acceleration into the second quarter? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. As it relates to our gross margin, we'll continue to see the normal seasonality. And then as it relates to the first question and the impact to the QSR, we don't give certain guidance as to relate to specifics, but essentially, that will flow through in the second quarter in terms of timing just given the delay in shipments. Operator : And our next question comes from Tom Palmer with JP Morgan. Tom Palmer : I wanted to ask on COGS inflation expectations. Sounds like based on Bernadette's prepared remarks that maybe it decelerated just a little bit in the first quarter is the assumption that as the year progresses, you see the rate of inflation ease a little bit? Just wondering what's kind of embedded in that? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So we did end the quarter with high-single-digit cost inflation, including transportation. But then we also had some of the increased costs related to inefficiencies for run rates. So those were the two pieces.  As it relates to inflation though going forward, although they've come off their recent highs, they still do remain well elevated compared with pre-pandemic levels. And then it also will be impacted going forward by the timing of when some of our hedges drop off for some of our natural gas. Tom Palmer : And then just maybe get a quick recap of pricing actions at this point. You cited list price increases that flowed through during the first quarter. So I guess presumably, though, there'll be carryover in the second quarter. From a list price standpoint, is there anything beyond that at this point, or is kind of a next step up, as we move into the New Year and Global contracts are adjusted? Tom Werner : So the big thing, Tom is our Global contract negotiations are kind of wrapping up for this next fiscal year. Most of those will start falling through in the back half. And as I said in the remarks, we feel good about where all those ended up. So we'll start seeing realizing those in the back half.  In terms of the other segments, we've been ahead of the curve in terms of the pricing to offset inflation. And we, as we always do, we'll continue to evaluate based on what we're seeing on our cost structure, evaluating when we go to market and change prices going forward in the Retail and Foodservice segment. Bernadette Madarieta : That's right. And then the last pricing crease that we announced in Foodservice, Retail in July, you'll begin to see more benefit of that in Q2, Q3. Tom Werner : You might start to see a little bit of slowdown in transport, though, to say. You have that. So remember, you've been talking about product pricing here. But transport will start to come off a little bit, just as the cost of transport goes down as most people on the call know that we try to make that as a pass-through as possible. It's -- over time, it tends to be gross profit neutral, but it will be a little bit more volatility on the top-line because of that. Operator : And our next question will come from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Rob Dickerson : Maybe just got a follow-up on the gross margin in the back half.Q1gross margin was obviously pretty impressive\u2026 Tom Werner : Hey, Rob, you're breaking up a little bit. Rob Dickerson : Yes. I'm sorry. Yes, sorry. I was just saying, gross margin in the first quarter was obviously impressive, not that far from expectations in the back half. And it sounds like contract negotiations this summer in Global going well. So I guess, as we think kind of just to that Q3 time period with some of the incremental pricing coming through, Tom, what would you consider some of the drivers that might get you at the high-end of that gross margin guide in the back half, maybe some of the drivers to get you to the lower half or to the lower end? It sounds like it\u2019s kind of more of the demand side relative to maybe volatility on cost or pricing or anything around the crop. Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes. Rob, the -- as we've been very consistent, I feel good about where our gross margins are going to progress towards our historical averages in the back half, pre-pandemic. So that's what our focus is on. And we're off to making good progress against that, obviously. And so I feel confident about us returning back to normalized levels. And so I'm not going to talk about high-end, low-end, all those kinds of things, Rob, I just -- it's about making progress. And we're doing that as an organization and the team is executing against that. Rob Dickerson : Got it, fair enough. And then just quickly, Tom, I know you said early on in the call, it sounds like you've been able to secure incremental supply, just given a little, the lower yield on the crop. At this point kind of given where you stand, is it fair to say that you have plenty of supply, right, you have plenty of potatoes? As you kind of get through the fiscal year, this shouldn't be like an issue, or sitting here in March or April such that the markets all out trying to fight for potatoes in the open market? And that's it. Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes. Rob, I feel great. We have great partner growers. We work in tandem with them on our needs and we got a great ag team that has tremendous relationships with our growers. So feel confident that we'll be able to execute against our production plan and sales plan for the year and we have some things we can do to adjust new crop, old crop. So I feel good about where we're positioned going forward. Operator : And our next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : It\u2019s actually [Gary Moore] stepping in for Adam. I was wondering if you could help us understand a little bit better your underlying assumptions as it relates to your guidance you reaffirm it. Now that we have three more months, has anything changed in terms of your underlying price/mix assumptions or volumes? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, I think that, no. There's four key factors that we've alluded to in our prepared remarks as it relates to our guidance that we've been watching and that's crop, pricing, our run rates and then logistics. And we feel good about where we're at on all of those. And therefore, we will be at the higher end of the range of our earnings targets that we have outlined. So feel good about all four of those factors. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful. Thank you. And as a follow-up, as it relates to your investment in Argentina, how does it benchmark in terms of profitability versus the rest of the portfolio? Tom Werner : Well, this is Tom. It's right in line with our long-term strategic growth plans. It gives us in-country production capabilities, alongside of our -- we have a joint venture down there. And it's gives us a footprint in the South America market, which is a huge market and we're under-indexed in terms of share, so -- and it's super cost competitive. So I feel good about our investment. It's right along with our strategic long-term plan that we've been executing against for the past six years. And I'm excited about it. And it's going to give us a tremendous competitive advantage in that market down there going forward. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. And we expect that the return on that expansion to be attractive and in line with our other expansions. Operator : And moving on to William Reuter with Bank of America. William Reuter : I just have two. The first is, with the second year of below average crop yields, has there been any change in the amount of area or land that is being dedicated to the production of potatoes? I'm wondering whether there could be long term implications if some of the growers aren't making as much money as they historically did? Tom Werner : No, I mean -- this is Tom. The acres fluctuate a bit, nothing major. So the acres around our growing areas have been pretty consistent over time. There is some change, but it's really not -- has not been material as long as I've been around this business. William Reuter : Great to hear. And then kind of on a related topic, there is some trade press that suggests that some of your contract negotiations in the Columbia Basin are already complete for calendar year '23. Is there anything you can provide there in terms of color? Tom Werner : Yes. No, we won't provide any color on that the next couple of calls as some of those things finalize. As we always do, we'll communicate that on one of these calls in the near future once everything is done. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And moving on to Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Carla Casella : I'm wondering, you've been making a lot -- you've been spending a lot of your investing on additional capacity. Can you talk about your whether your view towards M&A or further JV investments may change as those facilities are done? Or is that not inhibiting any of your M&A, JV investment opportunities? Tom Werner : It\u2019s Tom. The -- strategically, our investment in expanding capacity has been very consistent. As we see the category growth and we think about the next really two, three, four, five, seven years, as the category continues to grow even at low-single-digits, it's a big growth number in terms of overall volume. So overtime, we're going to continue to invest in the business and invest in the growth of the category. In terms of M&A, I've been very consistent since I've been sitting in this chair that we are as active as we can be in pursuing M&A actions. But the timing of those are always hard to predict. But it is absolutely going forward part of our growth strategic plan, organic capacity, investment and potential M&A as those opportunities present themselves. Carla Casella : Okay, great. And then can you -- did you -- I might have missed it. Did you give a leverage target? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, so our leverage target remains the same at 3.5x to 4x. Certainly, we're considerably below that right now. But we maintain that strong balance sheet during these periods of economic volatility, and it preserves optionality for M&A. Carla Casella : That's great. And then just one last one on hedging. Can you just talk about what you can and are hedging and if your view or policies are changing there just in light of the current environment? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, just high-level we do hedge our natural gas and oil that's used in processing our potatoes. Our policies have not changed. We've always had a risk oversight committee that has monitored the markets and we've entered into those contracts as we've seen appropriate. Carla Casella : Have you said how much you\u2019re hedged in for the year? Bernadette Madarieta : We haven't disclosed that. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks for joining us today. If you want to set up a follow-up call, please email me and we can set up a time to either today or in the following days. Thanks again for joining and I'll talk to you later. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's second quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment, while Bernadette will provide details on our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning. Happy New Year and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter as we continue to drive strong sales and earnings growth across each of our core segments. Our results reflect the successful execution of our strategies to counter the significant input cost inflation over the past couple of years through a combination of pricing actions, improving business and product mix and adapting our manufacturing and supply chain to global challenges. Specifically, we delivered sales of nearly $1.3 billion, a record high quarter, healthy gross margins in each of our core business segments and strong earnings EBITDA and earnings per share growth. Because of our first half results and confidence in our business momentum, we've increased our sales, gross margin and earnings targets for fiscal 2023. I'm proud of our performance in the first half of the year and how the entire Lamb Weston team continues to focus on serving our customers and driving sustainable, profitable growth. Before turning the call over to Bernadette, let me first provide some quick updates on the current operating environment. First, overall French fry demand in the U.S. remained solid although the total restaurant traffic remains below pre-pandemic levels. It's up versus the prior year quarter, and trends are up sequentially off the lows we saw in the summer, as gasoline prices spiked. Demand and traffic trends in the quarter varied by channel, as consumers reacted to broad-based inflation and the threat of a recession. QSR traffic was up versus the prior year, and trends improved sequentially versus our fiscal first quarter as consumers adjusted to less expensive dining options. As expected, casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic in the quarter was down versus the prior year, although trends also improved sequentially versus our fiscal first quarter. This year-over-year decline in casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic had a more pronounced effect on our Foodservice segment, which has a greater exposure to these sales channels and contributed in part to a decline in the segment's volume.  The fry attachment rate, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets remained above pre-pandemic levels. The attachment rate in QSRs actually increased versus the prior year quarter which helped stabilize fry demand. Overall, we feel good about how the category and away-from-home channels is performing in this difficult macro environment, but expect restaurant traffic demand trends will continue to be volatile through fiscal 2023.  In contrast, retail fry demand remained solid in the quarter. It's been strong since the start of the pandemic as consumers pull back spending on dining out. Demand for our retail products sold under licensed restaurant brands, in particular, remained strong over the past year as consumers look to have the restaurant style fries they love while at home. While fry demand across all our channels is holding up well, we continue to struggle to meet that demand due to the impact of supply chain disruptions on run-rate and throughput in our production facilities.  Over the past year, these disruptions have been largely related to the impact of shortages in certain commodities, such as starches and edible oils as well as factory worker shortages and availability. The availability of key commodities has slowly improved over the past couple of quarters as we broadened our supplier base and qualified substitute ingredients when possible. Yet it remains a concern, and we expect it will continue to affect our production volumes at least through the remainder of fiscal 2023.  The availability of production team members has also steadily improved over the past couple of quarters, such that we're back to having staffing levels in most of our processing facilities at desired levels. However, run-rate and throughput constraints will continue until our newly hired colleagues gain experience to optimize production. We've also experienced production constraints after adjusting operating procedures to reflect changes in product mix and consumer demand, including higher demand for retail fries, premium fries and batter-coated products. These products generally carry favorable margins. For example, to produce batter-coated fries, which is a high growth and high margin segment of the category, we typically run our lines at slower speeds than we're producing uncoated straight cut fries. This results in reduced throughput. We also require more frequent and longer downtimes to clean and sanitize lines between production runs when batter is used, which affects our run-rates and line availability. Together, this results in fewer finished pounds produced relative to making uncoated fries, which ultimately leads to pressure on our customer order fill rates.  In short, we expect the impacts of ongoing commodity shortages, the onboarding of recently hired production team members and adjustments to optimize business mix to continue to pressure volume performance, and our ability to meet customer demand through the remainder of fiscal 2023 and until our capacity investments in China, Idaho and Argentina become available over the next couple of years. With respect to pricing, we continue to drive pricing actions across our portfolio to counter input cost inflation. The environment remains generally favorable as a result of the solid category demand that I just described, coupled with constrained industry supply. Our global segment led the way in the quarter with strong pricing through a combination of inflation-driven price escalators, new pricing structures for customer contract renewals and working with certain customers to accelerate pricing actions for contracts up for renewal in the coming years and improvements in customer mix. We feel good about how Global's contract renewal negotiations played out this past year, and expect this segment to continue to deliver strong price/mix growth as more of these updated pricing structures take effect in the second half. We also expect to drive solid price growth in both the foodservice and retail segments in the second half of the year. Although the growth rate should decelerate as we begin to lap some of the pricing actions we took in fiscal 2022.  With respect to the potato crop, we've been processing potatoes from this year's harvest for the past few months and continue to assess the overall quality of the potatoes in our key growing regions, including shape, color, level of defects and solid content as consistent with historical averages. Yields, however, are below historical averages and below the preliminary assessment that we provided during our earnings call in October.  To fill our production needs, we have secured additional potatoes in the Columbia Basin and Idaho and are sourcing potatoes from other regions in North America, including the East Coast. This will add to our potato costs for the remainder of fiscal 2023, and we have included the estimated impact in our updated financial targets for the year. With respect to next year's potato crop, we've agreed to nearly a 20% increase in contract prices for potatoes grown in the Columbia Basin and have secured the targeted number of acres to be planted. Our discussions with growers in Idaho and Alberta on price and acreage are ongoing.  Now with respect to our acquisition of our partner's interest in Lamb Weston/Meijer, we expect the transaction will close during our fiscal fourth quarter after completing the regulatory review process. I'm excited about welcoming 1,500 value team members and beginning to capture strategic commercial and operational benefits from the transaction, including, first, strengthening our global manufacturing footprint by leveraging Europe's low-cost infrastructure to serve key markets around the world as well as adopting best-in-class manufacturing practices to increase efficiency, improve quality and reduce costs. Second, enhancing our customer-centric operating model by offering a single voice to our global customers and seamlessly supporting multinational customers with a truly global supply chain. Third, improving our position to further capitalize on growth opportunities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. And fourth, pursuing our global growth strategies without the operating restrictions associated with the joint venture.  So in summary, we drove strong sales and earnings growth in the second quarter and in the first half by executing on our strategies to price the counter inflation, improve mix, generate productivity savings and drive value for our customers. The category is healthy with solid overall demand behind strength in QSR traffic and constrained industry supply. The quality of the recently harvested potato crop in the Pacific Northwest is good, and the impact from the shortfall in yields is manageable. And finally, we're confident about the strategic, operational and commercial benefits at the Lamb Weston/Meijer transaction has to offer, and we look forward to the transaction closing later this year. Now let me turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook. Bernadette? Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, we're pleased with our financial performance and operating momentum through the first half of the year, which has provided us with a strong foundation to raise our annual sales and earnings targets.  Let me review our second quarter results before discussing our updated outlook. Sales in the second quarter grew 27% to nearly $1.28 billion. That's a record for us. A 30% increase in price mix drove our sales growth as we continued to benefit from product and great pricing actions across each of our business segments. The increase reflects the carryover impact of product pricing actions that we initiated in fiscal 2022 as well as pricing actions that we began implementing during this fiscal year. The increase also reflects benefits from efforts to improve our portfolio mix. Sales volumes declined 3%, as we continued to experience the supply chain constraints and related shortfalls in order fulfillment that Tom described. This primarily affected volumes and service levels in our Foodservice and Retail segments.  To a lesser extent, volumes in the quarter were also impacted by softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic as well as the timing of replacing losses of some low-margin business in our Foodservice and Retail segments. Gross profit in the quarter increased $176 million to $382 million, as a result of our sales growth and strong gross margin performance. Our margin expanded 950 basis points versus the prior year quarter and about 550 basis points sequentially to nearly 30%. Broadly speaking, pricing actions in each of our business segments, efforts to improve customer and product mix, and value created from our productivity programs have caught up to the cumulative effect of input and transportation cost inflation over the past couple of years. Input cost inflation, however, continues to be challenging. Once again, it was the primary driver of a double-digit increase in our manufacturing and distribution cost per pound in the quarter, largely due to higher prices for edible oils, ingredients for batter coatings, labor and transportation. Potato costs were also up as a consequence of the historically poor crop that was harvested last fall. While this is the last quarter that we will realize the financial impact from the 2021 crop, we expect our potato costs to continue to increase in the second half of this year as a result of higher contract prices and the need for significant open market purchases due to poor yields from the 2022 crop. We also continue to incur higher costs and operational inefficiencies associated with shortages of key ingredients and spare parts, onboarding newly hired production team members and other industry-wide supply chain challenges. While the impacts from these constraints have been slowly easing, we expect they will continue to be a headwind through the remainder of the year.  Moving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A, excluding items impacting comparability, increased $45 million to $136 million, largely due to higher compensation and benefit expenses due to improved operating performance and higher expenses relating to improving our IT infrastructure, including designing and building a new ERP system. Equity method earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures increased $16 million, excluding items impacting comparability and mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts. Higher pricing, especially in Europe, drove the increase. Demand continued to hold up relatively well despite the impact of significant consumer inflation and volatile energy costs. This sets Lamb Weston/Meijer up to deliver solid results in the second half of the year.  Moving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 34% in the quarter behind a 31% increase in price/mix. As Tom noted earlier, most of the increase was driven by price escalators and updated pricing structures. With the increase in price/mix, Global's product contribution margin more than doubled to $171 million in the quarter. In addition, Global's product contribution margin percentage approached pre-pandemic levels, which is a key milestone for our overall performance.  While we were always confident that we would restore Global's margins, we knew it would take longer than in other segments due to the structure and terms of the channels' customer contracts. Sales in our Foodservice segment grew 14%, driven by a 25% increase in price/mix as we continue to realize the carryover benefit of pricing actions that we announced throughout fiscal 2022 as well as actions taken earlier this year to counter inflation. Sales volumes decreased 11%, primarily reflecting production constraints and to a lesser extent softer traffic in casual dining and full-service restaurants. In addition, because of these production constraints, we've had to make some tough choices on customer service, which has resulted in the loss of some lower-margin business.  Foodservice's product contribution margin increased 25% as the benefits from pricing actions more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes. Sales in our Retail segment increased 34% behind a 43% increase in price/mix, reflecting pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios. Volume fell 9%, largely as a result of production constraints. It also reflects the incremental losses of certain lower-margin private label products. Through a combination of the team's strong execution of pricing and mix management, Retail's product contribution margin more than tripled to $66 million. Its production contribution margin percentage is now in line with our away-from-home channels.  Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains solid with strong liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with about $420 million of cash and $1 billion undrawn revolver. Our net debt was about $2.3 billion, resulting in a 2.4 times leverage ratio. That's down from 3.1 times at the end of fiscal 2022, reflecting our earnings recovery. In the first half of the year, we generated about $290 million of cash from operations or about $80 million more than the first half of last year, largely due to the higher earnings.  Capital expenditures were about $270 million, which is up about $120 million from the first half of last year. This increase is largely related to construction costs as we continue to expand processing capacity in Idaho, China and Argentina. As a reminder, our annual maintenance capital expenditures have typically been about $120 million to $130 million as we generally target about 3% to 4% of sales. In the first half of the year, we returned nearly $100 million of cash to shareholders, including more than $70 million in dividends and $28 million in share repurchases. As you may have seen a few weeks ago, our board of directors approved a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy to drive strong financial results and cash flow and our confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term. So now let's turn to the updated fiscal 2023 outlook. Please note that our updated targets do not reflect the financial consolidation of Lamb Weston/Meijer as that transaction has not yet closed. We believe the transaction will be completed during our fiscal fourth quarter. So for the year, we've increased our sales target to $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, which implies a growth rate of 17% to 19.5%. That's up from our previous target of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion. We expect that higher price/mix will be the primary driver of sales growth in the second half of the year. Forecasting volumes in the second half remains difficult as we anticipate shipments will continue to be affected by supply chain constraints through fiscal 2023 and because of volatility surrounding a potential slowdown in restaurant traffic and demand as consumers face inflation and a weaker macroeconomic environment. For earnings, we're targeting adjusted net income of $540 million to $580 million. That's up from our previous target of $360 million to $410 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.75 to $4, up from our previous target of $2.45 to $2.85. And finally, adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, up from our previous estimate of $840 million to $910 million. We continue to expect the increase in our earnings will be driven primarily by sales growth and gross margin expansion. We're targeting gross margins during the second half of the year to be between 27% and 28%, which is in line with the more than 27% that we delivered in the first half and up from the 23% that we posted during the back half of fiscal 2022.  We expect the seasonal, sequential quarterly cadence for gross margins will be less pronounced than in previous years. Specifically, we do not foresee much of the typical seasonal step-up in gross margin from Q2 to Q3 or much of the typical step down from Q3 to Q4 for a few reasons. First, beginning in the third quarter, we expect our raw potato costs to increase to reflect the approximately 20% increase in the contracted price of the recently harvested potato crop. In addition, we expect higher potato costs as a result of significant high-cost open market purchases. Second, we expect continued significant inflation for other key inputs during the second half of the year, especially for edible oils and ingredients for batter coatings. Third, we expect a more muted step-up in global pricing from Q2 to Q3 due to the acceleration of pricing actions for contracts up for renewal in the coming years. And finally, we expect the year-over-year price increases in our Foodservice and Retail segments will decelerate as we begin to lap actions taken in fiscal 2022. With respect to SG&A, we expect expenses, excluding items impacting comparability of $525 million to $550 million. That's up from our previous target, largely due to higher compensation and benefit expenses, including increased incentive compensation expense due to improved operating performance as well as expenses for outside services, including support of our IT and ERP upgrades. Our estimates of other financial targets, including interest expense, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization expenses and our effective tax rate are unchanged.  And with that, let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying we're confident in our strategies and business momentum. And as a result, we've significantly increased our financial targets for the year. And we're also confident about the health and prospects of the category. And we believe that our capacity expansion and infrastructure investments will have us well positioned to support sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long-term.  Once again, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for our success this quarter and their ongoing commitment to meet the needs of our customers.  Thank you for joining our call today, and now we're ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Tom Palmer from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir. Tom Palmer : Good morning. And Congratulations on the quarter. Tom Werner : Good morning, Tom. Tom Palmer : Good morning. Just kick off getting maybe a little color on the inflation outlook. I appreciate the comments in the prepared remarks. The release referenced double-digit inflation. It sounds like there's some moving parts, especially with potatoes stepping up in the second half, but you'll also be lapping some higher rates of inflation. So is the messaging that the absolute rate of inflation will step up in the second half of the year? Or would it be more comparable to what we saw in the second quarter? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. Thanks, Tom. This is Bernadette. We don't expect the absolute rate to increase. We will, though, however, continue to see that double-digit inflation for the remainder of the year. And as you said, that's reflecting the higher cost for potatoes and then other key inputs for edible oils, labor and ingredients. So absolutely expect that double-digit cost increase to continue but not increase. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you. And then the bounce back in Europe. Where are we in kind of the return to normal? I mean did we exit the second quarter, what you would call, a normal earnings run-rate for that business? Is there still more work to be done? And as we think about the second half, should we look for another step-up in kind of the earnings power of that business as more pricing takes hold? Tom Werner : Yeah, Tom. So this is Tom. The team in Lamb Weston/Meijer soon to be Lamb Weston has made terrific progress. Marc Schroeder leads that business, and the business has turned the corner. They've implemented a number of actions to stabilize the earnings of that business as we expected. They're showing great progress. And the run-rates are trending positively, and we expect that to continue for the back half of the year. And as we close that transaction, as we stated, we expect that to happen in Q4 to get through all the reviews and regulatory process. We'll provide some more color on that once the transaction is closed in the coming quarters. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys. Happy New Year. Thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning. Peter Galbo : Tom, I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more context around your comment now that the company is sourcing some potatoes, I think, from the East Coast you mentioned. Just kind of maybe where you're seeing that relative to last year, I know when you had to source a decent number from the East Coast?  And then anything just in terms of your plant network. Is there ability to move those potatoes not all the way to the basin, can you process them through the JV in Minnesota? Can you process them through the Delhi plant? Just any additional color would be helpful. Thanks. Tom Werner : Yeah. So the year-over-year this year, it's not as pronounced as it was last year because of the quality of the crop last year and yields. We got out ahead of it, the ag team in Lamb Weston has done a terrific job sourcing potatoes to meet our needs. They're still high cost. You got to freight them across the country and you have some quality issues when you're trucking that far. But it's not as pronounced as it was last year. And all those costs are reflected in our outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year.  And good news, bad news is we had some experience last year, so we were able to rally quickly, and we understand how that all is going to impact the business. But again, that's all forecasted in our outlook. So we're doing everything we can to meet our customer demand, and that's the most important thing. Peter Galbo : Got it. That's helpful. And Bernadette, I just had 1 clarification on the gross margin commentary for the back half of the year. I think you're still expecting a sequential improvement in 3Q, obviously, not as pronounced as it would have been historically but it would still improve in 3Q? And then is there a step down to expect in the fourth quarter? I just wanted to clarify those two things. Thanks very much. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. No, thank you. We do expect to see an increase. But as you said, it will not be as pronounced in the third quarter as we've historically seen. And then there will be a step down in fourth quarter, but again, not as pronounced as what we've historically seen. Peter Galbo : Got it. Thanks very much, guys. Bernadette Madarieta : Yep, thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Chris Growe from Stifel. Chris Growe : Thank you. Good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi. Happy New Year. Hi. Just a bit of a follow-on to that Peter's question and some of your response there. I guess just to understand the gross margin this quarter. I just want to get a sense of how unique the performance was this quarter. And I was sticking around the areas of like mix and perhaps even like limited time offerings to what degree that's influencing the gross margin this quarter that may not be sustainable? And then to what degree you're walking away from lower-margin business, and to what degree that's influencing your margin as well, perhaps there's other issues, too. But those are a couple of things I was thinking about just to get a little sense around and how that could affect the gross margin going forward. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. No, thank you for that question. And as it relates to the gross margin going forward, LTOs, there isn't anything unusual that we would have experienced this quarter relative to prior quarters or going forward. Really, what you're seeing is that we were able to pull forward a lot of the pricing actions in Global earlier than expected. And then we're going to be lapping some of the Foodservice and Retail price increases in the back half of the year. So there'll be more of a muted effect related to that.  So a combination of the higher potato costs, the inflation and then the deceleration of that price/mix growth, that's what you're going to see have an effect on those margins in the back half of the year. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you for that. And actually, I have a follow-on to that, which just be that you talked about pulling forward some of those global contract renewal discussions. So it sounds like you had a good renewal from this past summer, and that should start to kick in now. But it sounds like you also then pulled forward some -- maybe some from next summer. -- or even summers ahead. I guess just to get a sense of where you are then on contract renewals normally. It's like a third every year. Did you -- were you able to get more of that done is the question? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. We were able to go out and have conversations with our customers and pull more of that forward than had been anticipated, more than what we would have typically seen with our contract renewals. So we expect that the global pricing will remain strong in the back half. It's just we've been able to pull that forward earlier than expected. Chris Growe : And can you say how much of your contract renewals, how much more you've done this year? Or how much less you'll have for you going forward? Bernadette Madarieta : No, I can't really speak to that. I'd say, overall, we've got probably about 25% that we'll need to continue to renegotiate. Chris Growe : Okay. Bernadette Madarieta : But again -- Chris Growe : Thanks so much. Bernadette Madarieta : That's based on pounds and not based on business or dollars. Chris Growe : Okay, great. Thank you for that. Operator : Our next question will come from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : Good morning. So I guess first question maybe on the demand environment. Some of this was in the prepared remarks, but I'd love to just hear you expand a little bit on just maybe different parts of Global between the domestic QSRs versus international? Foodservice traffic trends? And just as your customers absorb some pretty sizable kind of price increases, just the confidence that you don't see any changes in fry attach rates from the consumption perspective. Tom Werner : Yeah, Adam, overall, I feel really strong about the health of the category. And we've purposely had to make choices across our segments to support our customer base, and we've really focused on product/mix management across the portfolio and the customers. So the QSR segment continues to be really healthy.  As we stated in our prepared remarks, the fast casual, casual dining is experiencing some weaker traffic. Although it's improving versus where it was in the first quarter, but we're also making choices and in terms of customer and supporting customers based on product mix and our capacity. And there are still challenges within our network to produce and get back to the levels where we were pre-pandemic. And the team, the supply chain team is working on that. And it's going to take us the balance of this year to continue to focus on things to improve that.  So the category is healthy. And yes, our volume is a little soft in some areas. That's traffic driven. But over the long-term, when I look at the category and think about the next two, three, five years, and the investments we're making, we're going to be well positioned in a couple of years to bring on capacity and drive opportunities that right now we're making choices that we don't necessarily like we got to support our key customers going forward. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. And just to add to that, Tom, in addition to the softness that we have in the casual dining. More of that softness though is just related to the supply chain constraints that we've been experiencing. But overall, absolutely, our demand has returned to the pre-pandemic levels on a run-rate basis prior to what we saw with war in Ukraine. Adam Samuelson : Got it. And if I could maybe follow on the point on just capacity a little bit. You talked earlier about some of the product/mix impacting kind of throughput rates and kind of what you could actually produce from an end product perspective? I mean, do you think with the current product mix, if you were properly staffed and there wasn't raw material constraint around potatoes that the current capacity with this mix could produce the same volume of finished product that you did pre-pandemic? Or does the actual mix that you've kind of shifted to as it stands right now actually constrain your -- physically constrain your output going forward? Tom Werner : Yeah, Adam, so I know the team is working on getting to pre-pandemic levels, but the reality is the choices and the mix that we're now producing really oversimplifying it, we have to slow lines down when we're making coated product. So we can't run as fast. And so, there is some capacity disadvantages to running premium products. That's just a fact. However, I think the mix of the portfolio bodes well going forward for the profitability of the company. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And maybe just a final, if I could squeeze in. Of your total price/mix in the quarter, how much was mix? Can you share if you can -- or any reframing? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. We don't break the out mix from price, Adam. It's predominantly price. Adam Samuelson : All right. Okay, I just try. I appreciate all the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from William Reuter from Bank of America. Please go ahead. William Michael : Hi. I just have two. Given the changes in your sourcing from the West Coast to the East Coast that you did last year now again this year, do you anticipate that in future years, if we return to more typical yields, you'll be able to shift that back to the West Coast and therefore, there should be some kind of margin expansion in 2024 and beyond? Tom Werner : Yes. I expect next year's crop to be normalized and then yields good and all the things that we're historically used to. And in terms of is that going to provide margin expansion? No, it won't. Materially, it won't. We're going to have inflation in our commodity costs next year. Again, I believe based on how the commodity markets are shaping up. And as I stated in the prepared remarks, where the potato crop negotiations, we settled with Pacific Northwest, you're going to be up 20% next year.  And you stack that up over two years, that's a big lift. And it's going to be another difficult year, and we'll continue to adjust our thinking on pricing that through the market going forward, but it's not going to be material margin impact year-over-year just based on sourcing out of the East Coast. William Michael : Got it. And then my second is based upon your guidance, even pro forma for the acquisition of the rest of the joint venture, you're still going to be below your leverage target of 3.5 times to 4 times, you're going to be, I think, in the high twos. I guess what is that, I mean, in terms of capital allocation. I know you increased the dividend, but how are you thinking about that? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. No, we're excited about increasing the dividend based on our performance. As we think about capital allocation, we have not changed our priorities in terms of investing in the business for the long term. M&A, if there's M&A that's available and then we will reward our shareholders as well. But certainly, we're going to invest in the business first. William Michael : Okay. So the leverage target remains at 3.5 times to 4 times? Bernadette Madarieta : It does remain in that range. And as we've said before, we're doing that because we want to make sure that we have enough financial firepower for M&A or other items that may come up. William Michael : Got it. All right. That's all for me. Thank you. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to you, Dexter Congbalay for any additional remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks for joining the call this morning. If you want to have any follow-up sessions, please e-mail me so we can spend time and happy New Year, and have a good day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's third quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment, while Bernadette will provide details on our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered strong results in our fiscal third quarter as we continued to build good operating momentum. Specifically, sales grew 31%, while gross margin expanded in each of our core business segments. This in turn drove strong EBITDA and earnings per share growth. I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for their dedication and focus on serving our customers, so that together we delivered another great quarter and positioned us for a strong finish to the year. This thank you is also to our more than 1,500 colleagues in Europe, who are now officially members of the global Lamb Weston team after we've recently completed the purchase of the remaining interest in Lamb-Weston/Meijer. Lamb Weston Europe, Middle East and Africa or Lamb Weston EMEA add six factories and about 2 billion pounds of production capacity to our global manufacturing footprint. It strengthens our ability to serve customers in key markets around the world and it enhances a world-class management, operating and commercial team with deep knowledge of the frozen potato industry. We've kicked off the process to integrate Lamb Weston EMEA's operations and are excited to see that what we can deliver together both now and over the long-term. Before turning the call over to Bernadette, let me first provide some quick updates on the current operating environment. While the macro environment remains highly challenging overall french fry demand remains healthy. Total restaurant traffic improved versus the prior year quarter when traffic was negatively affected by the Omicron variant. QSR is essentially accounted for the entire growth in traffic, including strong growth across burger and chicken restaurant chains, which are significant contributors to driving fry demand. In contrast, traffic at casual dining and full service restaurants fell versus the prior year. This has a more pronounced effect on our Foodservice segment and contributed in part to a decline in that segment's volume. The fry attachment rate, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other Foodservice outlets remain solid. As we previously noted, we're encouraged by how the category is currently performing and away from home channels, but continue to expect restaurant traffic and demand trends will be volatile through fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024 as consumers continues to deal with a challenging macro environment. Demand for fries and food-at-home channels remained solid. Shipments by our retail segment grew in the third quarter led by strong performance in products sold under licensed restaurant brands. We expect demand in this channel will remain solid into fiscal 2024. With overall category demand holding up relatively well and as industry supply expected to be constrained for at least the next couple of years, we believe the environment for pricing actions to counter input cost inflation may remain generally favorable. In addition, we've been building our revenue growth management and execution capabilities. We made good progress as shown by our ability to offset input cost inflation to drive the recovery in our gross margins over the past year in each of our core business segments. Nonetheless, we're continuing to work on maximizing revenue and margin by further evaluating markets and sales channels by using a broader set of variables and leveraging data backed insights on our customers and consumers. Pricing in the quarter in our Global segment was in line with our expectation as we continued to incorporate new pricing structures for customer contract renewals, inflation-driven price escalators and benefits from pulling forward pricing actions for contracts up for renewal in the coming years. Despite lapping some of the pricing actions we took in fiscal 2022, price/mix in both the Foodservice and Retail segments in the quarter was better than we anticipated as we continued efforts to rationalize pricing structures and strategically improve customer and product mix across the respective portfolios. During the remainder of fiscal 2023, in our Global segment, we don't expect any additional notable pricing actions to take effect. In Foodservice, we expect the year-over-year growth rate and price/mix will decelerate as we continue to lap more of the fiscal 2022 pricing and mix improvement actions. And in Retail, we expect the year-over-year growth rate and price/mix will also decelerate as we continue to lap last year's pricing actions. Although this will be tempered by recent price increase, that took effect towards the end of the third quarter. With respect to the potato crop in North America, we believe we have secured enough open market potatoes to meet our production forecast until the early potato varieties are harvested in July. We purchased open potatoes from growers in the Columbia Basin and Idaho, but also secured supply from as far away as the East Coast. This adds up to our potato costs through the first-half of fiscal 2024. With respect to the upcoming potato crop, as previously discussed, we've agreed to a nearly 20% increase in the contract prices for potatoes grown in the Columbia basin and have locked in the targeted contracted acres to be planted in that region. We're in the process of securing most of the acres in our other growing regions in North America, and expect to have this process completed shortly with contract prices largely in line with the 20% increase in the basin. In Europe, we have secured the acres in our key growing regions and expect to complete the contracting process shortly. Like North America, contract prices are up significantly to reflect input cost inflation for growers. So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of sales and earnings growth, which has enabled us to raise our financial targets for the year and continue to build good operating momentum across each of our core segments. We're excited about more than 1,500 new Lamb Weston EMEA colleagues that have joined the global team and believe that leveraging EMEA's capabilities will help us better serve customers around the world. And finally, category demand remains healthy and we believe that industry Q3 supply should remain constrained for at least the next couple of years. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our third quarter results and our updated financial fiscal 2023 outlook. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to also thank the Lamb Weston team for delivering another quarter of strong results and continuing to build good operating momentum across the company. This momentum has enabled us to raise our financial targets for the remainder of the year. I also want to add a warm welcome to the Lamb Weston EMEA team. Let's begin with our third quarter results. Sales in the third quarter were up 31% to $1.25 billion. Price/mix was up 31% as we continue to benefit from pricing actions across each of our core business segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation. The increase reflects the carryover impact of product pricing actions that we initiated in fiscal 2022, as well as pricing actions that we began implementing during this fiscal year. Our overall sales volumes were flat. While we increased shipments to our large QSR chain customers and to retail customers in North America, which generally reflects demand and restaurant traffic trends that Tom described earlier, our growth in volume was offset by a couple of factors. First, we continued efforts to strategically improve our product and customer mix by exiting certain lower price, lower-margin business. Second, and to a lesser extent, softer casual dining and full service restaurant traffic also affected volumes in the quarter, which is largely reflected in our Foodservice shipments. It's worth noting that in the quarter, we also continue to make progress in stabilizing our supply chain with better availability of production team members and key ingredients, as well as improved production forecasting. As a result, the impact on production in the quarter was relatively modest, which helped drive improvements in our customer fill rates versus our first and second quarters. This improvement is more apparent in our Retail and Foodservice segments as we have largely maintained high fill rates in our global segment, since the start of the pandemic. That said, we expect changes in product mix and consumer demand will continue to pressure our near-term production. And therefore shipments of high demand products, including retail fries, premium fries and batter-coated products. We expect this volume pressure and our ability to meet growing consumer demand will continue until our capacity investments in China, Idaho, Argentina and the Netherlands become available over the next couple of years. Gross profit in the quarter increased $177 million to nearly $400 million as a result of our sales growth and gross margins expanding 860 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 31.7%. Our strong gross margin performance reflects the cumulative benefit of executing pricing actions in each of our business segments, to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation, as well as leveraging efforts to improve customer and product mix and supply chain productivity. On the cost side in the quarter, we again realized a double-digit increase in input and manufacturing cost per pound. This was largely driven by about a 20% increase in contracted prices for potatoes in North America, significantly higher prices for open market potato purchases, due to poor yields from the calendar year 2022 crop and continued increases in the cost of edible oils, ingredients for batter coatings, labor and energy. In contrast, our transportation costs fell in the quarter as industry rates for rail, trucking and ocean freight services continued their steady decline over the past couple of quarters. We're continuing to reduce our freight charges to customers to match the decline in costs, which will steadily reduce the tailwind from transport prices in our sales line. However, the impact on our gross profit over time will be largely neutral. Moving on from gross profit. Our SG&A excluding items impacting comparability increased $49 million to $136 million, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit expenses due to improved operating performance, as well as actions to maintain competitive pay levels across our organization. We also had higher expenses related to improving our IT infrastructure, including designing and building a new ERP system and a $6 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses largely behind support of our branded products in our retail segment. Equity method earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures increased $12 million, excluding items impacting comparability and mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts. Favorable price/mix, largely reflecting pricing actions in Europe drove the increase. Moving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 33% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 33%, reflecting the revenue growth management initiatives and pricing actions to counter inflation that Tom described earlier. Global volume was flat, solid growth of shipments to large QSR chain customers in North America was offset by the impact of exiting certain lower priced and lower margin business in international and domestic markets as we actively manage our customer mix. Global's product contribution margin increased to $168 million from a relatively weak prior year quarter, which at the time reflected significant input in manufacturing cost increases and only a modest benefit from product pricing actions. Global segment's product contribution margin percentage in the quarter was 25.8%, which is back to a seasonal pre-pandemic level and was also a bit better-than-expected as we realize more benefits from pulling forward pricing actions for some customers than we originally anticipated. Sales in our Foodservice segment grew 22%, driven by a 25% increase in price/mix as we continue to realize the carryover benefit of product pricing actions that we announced throughout fiscal 2022, as well as the actions taken in fiscal 2023 to counter inflation. Sales volumes were down about 3%, primarily reflecting -- exiting of some lower price, lower margin business to manage our customer and product mix, as well as softer traffic in casual dining and full service restaurants. Foodservices product contribution margin increased to $143 million or up 34% as a cumulative benefit from pricing actions more than offset higher manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes. Our retail segment delivered another strong quarter with sales up 50%, price/mix increased 44%, reflecting pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios to counter inflation. This was aided in part by limited trade support given the strong category demand and constrained supply environment. Volume in this segment was up 6% behind better customer fill rates for our branded products. Private label volume was also up as we lap the incremental losses of certain lower priced and lower margin products over the past couple of years. Retail's product contribution margin increased to $83 million and its margin percentage topped 38%, as the cumulative benefits from pricing actions more than offset higher manufacturing costs per pound. We're very pleased with how our retail team has strengthened our market share, profitability and portfolio mix over the past couple of years and we remain confident in our ability to remain the overall category leader. Moving to our liquidity position and our cash flow. Our balance sheet remains solid with strong liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with about $675 million of cash and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. Our cash balance was inflated as we did take on a new $450 million term loan at the end of January to fund most of the cash consideration for the EMEA transaction, which closed a couple days into our fiscal fourth quarter. Our net debt was more than $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, resulting in a 2.3 times leverage ratio on a trailing 12-month basis. After accounting for the EMEA transaction, the estimated net debt at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter would be about $3.3 billion, resulting in a 2.6 times leverage ratio using our updated fiscal 2023 earnings target and an annualized contribution from our EMEA operations. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long-term growth, as well as delivering dividend growth for our shareholders and share repurchases to offset management dilution. In the first three quarters of the year, we generated about $335 million of cash from operations, that's about $160 million more than the first three quarters of last year. This is largely due to the higher earnings, partially offset by increased working capital. Capital expenditures were nearly $500 million, which is up about $270 million from the first three quarters of last year. This increase is largely related to construction costs as we continue to expand processing capacity in Idaho, China and Argentina. In the first three quarters, we returned nearly $146 million of cash to shareholders, including $106 million in dividends and about $41 million in share repurchases. Now let's turn to our 2023 outlook. Our updated targets include the financial consolidation of Lamb Weston EMEA beginning in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the year, we've increased our sales target to $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion, up from our previous target of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, about $300 million to $325 million of the increase reflects the consolidation of Lamb Weston EMEA. The additional $100 million to $150 million increase reflects our strong results in our fiscal third quarter and our expected continued momentum in the fourth quarter. Excluding the contribution from EMEA, we expect our net sales growth in the fourth quarter to be driven by price/mix as volumes will continue to be affected by certain -- exiting certain lower price and lower margin volume business to strategically manage customer and product mix and the potential for a slowdown in restaurant traffic and consumer demand. For earnings, we're targeting adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.50, that's up from our previous target of $3.75 to $4. And adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures of $1.18 billion to $1.21 billion, up from our previous estimate of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. Of the $110 million to $130 million increase in our adjusted EBITDA target, we estimate that EMEA will contribute an incremental $10 million to $15 million of that amount. That implies then that EMEA's total EBITDA contribution of $20 million to $30 million in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the normalized full-year pre-pandemic EBITDA of about EUR100. The additional $100 million to $115 million increase in our full-year EBITDA target reflects our strong results in our fiscal third quarter and our expected strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Including the consolidation of EMEA, we're targeting a full-year gross margin of 27% to 27.5%, implying a fourth quarter gross margin of 23% to 24.5%. Excluding EMEA, we've raised our full-year gross margin target to 28% to 28.5%, up from our previous target of 27% to 28%. This implies a fourth quarter gross margin target excluding EMEA of 25% to 27%. While this would be a healthy gross margin expansion versus the prior year quarter, it also implies a notable step down from our fiscal third quarter gross margin of 31.7%. We believe this estimate is prudent, reflecting typical seasonal patterns in our cost structure. Significantly higher cost open market potatoes, continued inflation for key inputs, and the impact of volume declines as a result of inflationary pressures on consumers. With respect to SG&A, we expect expenses excluding items impacting comparability of $550 million to $570 million, that's up from our previous target of $525 million to $550 million. The increase largely reflects the consolidation of Lamb Weston EMEA. In addition, we increased our estimate for capital expenditures to between $700 million to $725 million, up from our previous estimate of $475 million to $525 million. This increase reflects accelerated spending behind capital expansion investments, as well as capital spending associated with the consolidation of EMEA. We also made adjustments to other financial targets, which you can find in our earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying we are executing in this challenging operating environment and are confident in our increased financial targets for the year. We also continue to feel good about growth trends in the category and believe that the investments we're making in our people, new production capacity and infrastructure will have us well positioned to support sustainable profitable growth over the long-term. Thank you for joining us today, and we're now ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take your first question from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Yes. To start off, I know that Lamb Weston did not necessarily see pre-pandemic gross margins as a ceiling. But with margins now above pre-pandemic levels, excluding the recent transaction, of course, I guess what are the key factors that provide visibility to further margin expansion moving forward to the extent that, that's how you see it? And then I've just got a follow-up. Thanks. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. Good morning, Andrew. This is Bernadette. As we look at our margins, I think the key piece that we're focused on now is our revenue growth management and our execution capabilities that Tom mentioned. We're focused on continuing to work on maximizing revenue, as well as margin and we'll continue to do that as we look across our markets and our sales channel to make sure that we're managing those. Andrew Lazar : I think you said in the fourth quarter, we shouldn't expect any incremental pricing actions. With grower costs expected to be up as you mentioned another 20% for the current coming crop, should we expect some incremental pricing going forward as I guess as we roll into fiscal \u201924? Or have you implemented all that you need for the coming year? And with capacity constraints starting to ease, I guess what I'm getting at is, could we have a scenario in the coming fiscal year where you have both some incremental pricing and some positive volume growth as well, given constraints have been one of the main reasons for volume being flattish to down the last couple of quarters? Thank you. Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew, this is Tom. So a couple of things. As we noted, we have taken some pricing actions here at the end of the third quarter. The -- we're going to continue to evaluate as we roll up our plan for fiscal 2024, which starts in June, kind of, what the overall inflation number is going to be. And we are not at all in a deflationary period. Our crop cost is going to be up 20%. And so as we start evaluating the overall input cost complex, as we do every year, we're going to determine the pricing actions we may have to take. And the team and the marketing orders, we've done a very good job to offset inflation, we're going to continue to do that. And so as we noted in the prepared remarks, we've had to over the last 12, 15 months, do a lot of catch-up pricing just based on the nature of what our contract constraints were. And so I feel good about where we're at in terms of really getting back to more normalized margin levels before the pandemic. And we're going to continue to execute and evaluate what's going on in the inflationary input environment going forward, so that's first part. Second part, in terms of the overall volume, I feel good about where the category is. It's -- as we noted, QSRs are performing tremendously well in terms of traffic. Our Foodservice, so the casual dining segment, we're seeing some softness as we do when you have some economic things happening like is going on today, so people are trading down. We have rationalized our customer and product mix over the last 12 to 15 months, which is part of our revenue growth management initiative. And as we continue to evaluate opportunities in the marketplace, Andrew, I think, and get our operations running back to a higher throughput level, that's going to give us opportunities to take on business or going forward. So the other thing to remember is we've got a lot of capacity coming on. Our first capacity turn off is going to be this fall in China, so we're evaluating how that's going to look in terms of production shifts from North America to China. And then shortly after that, we'll have American falls, Argentina [Indiscernible] again over the next directionally 18 to 24 months. So we're getting prepared as we turn that capacity on to evaluate opportunities around the globe. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thank you so much. Tom Werner : Yes. Operator : We'll hear next from Tom Palmer from JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : Good morning, and thanks for the question. Tom Werner : Good morning, Tom. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Tom Palmer : Maybe I could just start off clarifying expectations for the Europe business. You noted normal EBITDA of about $100 million and then the fourth quarter guidance is pretty consistent with that. But I think the business has been doing a bit better than this over the past couple of quarters at least. Are there reasons such as certain costs that are not excluded from adjusted earnings or other cost headwinds or seasonality that might make this figure a bit lower in the fourth quarter? And then when we look at results this year, would the general assumption be that next year EBITDA grows year-over-year on top of that? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. Good morning, Tom. As we take a look at our fourth quarter guidance that we provided, excluding EMEA, you will typically see a step down in our gross margins as you move from third quarter to fourth quarter just based on seasonality. And then we're also going to be lapping prior year price increases. And so we're going to see a deceleration of the effects of that as we continue to move forward. Again, we also mentioned that we did see some pricing pull forward as well. And so there's some effect of that, that you're noting in third quarter that we wouldn't see in fourth quarter. And as we always do, we take a step back and take a prudent approach as we guide to where we think we're going to end at the end of the fourth quarter. But those are the main triggers that are going to affect what you're seeing in guidance for the fourth quarter. Tom Palmer : Understood. Thank you. And then just maybe on the gross margin, I know you noted, kind of, a more normal seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. I think a quarter ago, you were talking about maybe less than a normal quarterly decline in the fourth quarter. I know Bernadette, you mentioned it being prudent in your prepared remarks. Is there anything to consider that has shifted that expected cadence beyond that? I mean, for instance, was 3Q much better than you expected and therefore you're expecting more than normalization or anything with the timing of pricing, because it would seem like you're getting a bit of help at least on the retail side given the late quarter pricing action? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, I think there was a couple of things. There was a little bit more pull forward and benefit in the prior quarter and then also we are seeing more open market purchases that we ended up bringing in at much higher prices just given the way that the crop ended up this year from a yield perspective. So those are the two items that I would say are impacting that the greatest. Tom Palmer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning, Adam. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : Good morning. So, the first question is on Europe and as you can kind of roll that now into the consolidated business. Bernadette, you alluded to the fourth quarter guidance for the business, kind of, reflecting, kind of, learning consistent with that pre-pandemic EUR100 million given our run rate. Do you have the actual trailing 12-months or what the fiscal \u201823 EBITDA would be for the JV on a 100% basis just as a point of reference? And as we think about moving into fiscal \u201824, seem like fiscal \u201823 is above that pre-pandemic run rate, kind of, reasons why, kind of, profitability would -- could be lower year-on-year or higher? Just help us think about, kind of, some of the key moving pieces you're thinking about the European business over the next 12-months? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, thanks for the question, Adam. A couple of responses to that, I would say first, as we look at the fourth quarter guidance, that's what I would take to look at the normalized amount for this year in terms of being that EUR100 million on a run rate basis. And then certainly there's going to be a number of things as we bring EMEA into our operations that we're looking forward to having that one phase to the customer, introducing our revenue growth management capabilities and bringing in our supply chain common methodologies and ways of working that we're looking to work on over time as we integrate this business with ours to bring in more upside as we continue to progress. But it\u2019s not going to happen overnight, it\u2019s going to happen over time. But those are some of the opportunities that we see to be able to continue to grow this business. Tom Werner : Yes. And I'll just add, Adam. We have a tremendous management team running that business and they've managed it through a tremendous amount of volatility over the last 15 months with all the things that are going on. And we -- I'm more confident now with the trajectory of EMEA in that business and the foundation that the management team has put in place and the overall global reach we now have to serve our customers in all the international markets. So we have a lot to do to get that business integrated into one global team. And over time, I'm super confident where the capabilities is going to allow us to really serve our customers in a different manner than we ever have. So it's a tremendous accomplishment what the team has done with that business. I can't emphasize that enough. We got a great leadership team over there and I'm excited and looking forward to what we're going to do as we integrate that business going forward. Adam Samuelson : All right. That's helpful color. And then just on the CapEx, which with one quarter left in the year was a pretty sizable, kind of, increase in the outlook even inclusive of the Groningen CapEx at the JV that you are now, kind of, consolidating. Does this change any of the timing around the Argentine, Idaho or Chinese capacity or the things you're doing in the rest of the network or capabilities around coatings or battering that, kind of, you're pulling forward. Just help us think about, kind of, magnitude of that CapEx step up? Well, how it's been, kind of, timing of new capacity and what should we think about as a range for the consolidated CapEx for next year even at a low high level? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, no so as we take a look at our capital spending, there were a number of items where we have long lead times just given the supply chain dynamics that are out there. And we've been able to accelerate some of those things in terms of equipment and other pieces to come in, which is being reflected in our overall capital spending for this year. Really happy with that, but that's not going to bring on this capacity any sooner as we continue to build those factories. We just wanted to make sure that we have the items when needed to make sure that we would bring these up on time. So no change when we're going to bring that capacity online. As we look to next year, certainly as we do every year-end, when we give our fourth quarter guidance, we'll update with our capital spending at that time, but we'll have another year of significant capital expenditures given bringing on over 1 billion pounds in the next 18 to 24 months with all of the capacity expansions that we referred to. Adam Samuelson : All right. That's all really helpful, I'll pass it on. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes. Hey, Adam, it's [Indiscernible], just kind of for everybody. Just kind of here's the timing of the capacity coming online. China is going to be sometime fall of \u201823, American falls, Idaho is going to be spring of \u201824, Argentina is fall of \u201824, right? And then quite again in the Netherlands initial thoughts right now are going to be early calendar \u201825. Is, kind of -- yes, early to mid, that one's a little bit more influx. But that's kind of where the timing is right now. Adam Samuelson : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll hear next from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tom Werner : Good morning, Peter. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning, Peter. Peter Galbo : Tom, I think in your comments you mentioned the incremental pricing in retail that you took, kind of, towards the end of 3Q. In global, it seems like there was no more incremental that was at least expected to come this year, but maybe you could opine a little bit just on Foodservice maybe in one area where we didn't hear about, if there's any incremental pricing actions? And then in addition to that, just would love any, kind of, first thoughts as plantings have gone into the ground here in early April? Tom Werner : Yes. So in terms of the Foodservice segment, we've done a really good job over the past year or two, kind of, catch up to our inflation. And so I feel comfortable where we're at on that. We're -- as I said earlier, we're evaluating as we look to our fiscal 2024, our input cost inflation and how that's going to materialize. And then as we do every year, then we'll get together and think about what we need to do to offset inflation. And I can't say this enough, we're still in an inflationary environment in our business. And so as we have in the past and we'll continue to do, we're going to evaluate our pricing actions in all segments to offset inflation and that's, kind of, what we're going to do. So\u2026 Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, so with the Foodservice increase, there'll just be a small impact in the fourth quarter given the timing of that announcement. And then the only other thing is, as it relates to the crop, we are currently in the process of planting there, the Columbia Basin in Idaho, so we'll provide more of an update on our next call. Peter Galbo : Okay, no that's helpful. And then maybe just to follow-up on Adam's question on CapEx. Obviously, kind of, from a position of strength, you guys are accelerating some of the spend. Bernadette, it didn't sound like you were, kind of, pulling forward any spend from next year, but maybe just wanted to clarify that? And then just in a broader context on, kind of, capital allocation with the CapEx spend being as high as it is and maybe you're going to move past through a lot of that. The debt's turned out pretty far at this point. You started to buy back a little bit of stock in the quarter. The dividend yield is pretty low relative to peers, just maybe you can kind of comment on how you're seeing the setup for some of the other pillars within capital allocation? Thanks very much. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So if I take the latter question first, As Tom mentioned, we're still really confident in the strength of this category and we're going to continue to invest for the long-term. As it relates to our cash position and our overall low debt to equity ratio, we want to maintain flexibility for the long-term should certain things happen or open up for us from an M&A or other perspective. And so we feel good about where we're at. So our capital allocation hasn't changed, and we're going to continue to take into consideration share buybacks as we have in the past to offset management dilution. But as we've also shown, we will opportunistically buyback when it makes sense. And then just to confirm your first question on the capital spending, we haven't necessarily pulled much forward in terms of total capital spending. We've got a lot of large projects happening over the next 18 to 24 months. And some of that was just on some long lead time equipment. Peter Galbo : Got it. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Rob Dickerson from Jefferies. Your line is open. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just my first question, more mechanical [Indiscernible]. It looks like the interest expense expectation for the year hasn't changed, but clearly taking on the term loan and then maybe some assumed pre-existing debt I would think from Meijer. Maybe just, kind of, quickly explain, so maybe I just missed it in the prepared remarks, kind of how that interest expense doesn't change with the assumption of debt? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. No, that's a great question. What we're finding is that we're having more capitalized interest related to some of these heavy capital projects, which is putting more of that -- which is offsetting some of that interest expense overall. So that's all that you're seeing there. Rob Dickerson : Got it. So that -- but that would probably more like a Q4 event like we would still assume that even though you're not guiding that there would be incremental debt and interest given the deal. Just thinking about the mechanics of the actual acquisition? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, you're exactly right. You're thinking about it right. Rob Dickerson : Okay, super. And then maybe just Tom and Bern, just kind of we're talking about a lot of commentary around that $100 million on the Meijer -- sorry, yes, on the Meijer JV and kind of what the potential run rate could be? Maybe just another kind of way to ask it is just that seed number we've been -- we've all been talking about vis-\u00e0-vis, kind of, pre-pandemic? But then also there are all these synergies or some synergies that should come through. So I'm just curious like over the past few months, you've actually closed the transaction, do you feel like you have better line of sight on, kind of, synergy potential without having to quantify them over the next two to three years? Tom Werner : Yes. So, again, we -- the business is on a much better trajectory than it has been over the last 12-months and that's a testament to terrific management team we have that have implemented a number of different strategies to get that business back on track. I fully expect over the next 12-months that we will improve our run rate that we've indicated prior, and I'm not going to give a specific number, but I'm more confident now than ever that this -- where that business is going and the trajectory that the team and has got that business on and the synergies and integration that we're going to do over the next 12-months is going to well position EMEA better than it ever has. And we're not going to give specific numbers, but I will tell you I'm confident that we will move that business in a direction that that I believe is much better than what we've indicated. Rob Dickerson : Got it. super. And then just quickly, maybe a little bit more fun to talk about. I saw your -- let's say your ability to enter Domino's with product, I guess, is not fried. It seems like it's more baked. Maybe if you could just spend a minute, kind of, speaking, kind of, to the technology that maybe you have on a proprietary basis that allows you to do that? And then is that something that I would assume you would clearly try to attack with other customers that let's say don't have fryers? That's it. Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes. So I'm not going to get into all the product technology, but we're super excited about that product. And how it's performing, it's performing better-than-expected. I've been talking about that for a long time in terms of getting into non-fry channels and that was a big first step. We've done that with other well-known chains also, and we're going continue to monitor it, we're going to work with non-fry channel customers. As we do today, we'll continue to do that and we have a great innovation team working on non-fried potato products, but those are long lead time items. But I will tell you what is happening with that particular product is exciting and it's performing amazingly. So, we'll continue to monitor it. But it's been a long time comment and hats off to the team that put a lot of years of work into getting that to market and it's great to see it pay off and really do well in the marketplace. Rob Dickerson : Got it, super. Thanks so much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll hear next from William Reuter from Bank of America. William Reuter : Good morning. I just -- I have two questions, the first is you mentioned M&A, you also are active in building a handful of new facilities. You're going to be consolidating the JV and you talked about a lot of the operational changes you're going to make there? I guess, do you feel like you're at the point now where you still could be active? And I guess, what types of businesses or where within the supply chain do you expect that you would be more active? Tom Werner : Yes. So, the intent and part of our strategic playbook is we're always going to be evaluating potential acquisitions within the potato category, that's the number one focus. Category strong, it's good returns, great investment, it's growing and we have not only invested in expanding our current manufacturing footprint around the globe as we're doing with the four projects we have going on. But to the point Bernadette made earlier, it's important for me and the company to make sure we have a strong balance sheet, so if an opportunity comes up, we'll be able to execute it. And so that's always going to be on the table. And I've been consistent in that over the past six years. So, I feel good about where our capital -- our balance sheet is. We're investing to expand our footprint, it\u2019s right on strategy. We're positioning ourselves in the industry to support our customers in all the markets around the world. I feel good about where we're at. William Reuter : Okay. And then my second question, is there any way for you to provide some additional colour around what the impact of open market purchases were this year? Just trying to think about in the event that you're able to fill that with contracted purchases next year, what that tailwind could be? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, we haven't quantified the impact of those open market purchases. A little bit different this year in that we were short on yield versus last year there was an impact for yield and quality. While we are needing to bring in fewer open market purchases, the cost this year is significantly higher. So we have not quantified that, but there is a meaningful impact this year similar to last year. William Reuter : Great. Okay. That's all for me. Thank you. Tom Werner : Hey, Bill, one other thing. I mean, the reason that we had to go to the open market is because crop yields weren't good this year. And typically, we have an average crop and you really don't have to go into the open market that much at all. William Reuter : Great. Thank you. Operator : We do have a follow-up from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Just a super quick one. Tom, when you announced the joint venture acquisition, with Meijer. I think one of the things you'd mentioned was that you also hope that or intended that this action would, kind of, send a message right to the broader, sort of, European, sort of, competitive environment there that you were certainly looking for there to be over time the potential for further consolidation in what is a much more fragmented, right operating theatre in Europe? And I'm just curious if this transaction now that you've closed it in a couple of months or since announcing it, whether the -- I don't know, the dialogue or pace of conversations maybe with others has picked up more generally. We saw another one outside of you, right, the transaction that happened, whatever it was a couple of months ago in Belgium. I'm just curious if your expectation would be that we're likely to see more somewhat sooner or not and if you're hearing more chatter and dialogue? Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew, great question. Obviously, I can't get into what conversations are or not happening, but consistent, Andrew, with how I position this over the last several years is we\u2019re continuing to be as active as we can. I think the intention of what I would love to do from an industry standpoint is known and certainly transaction with Lamb Weston Meijer, people took notice, but we'll -- I'll leave it at that and hopefully the fragmentation of the market it's a private sector and you got to -- people got to come to the table and but I'm pretty sure they're clear they know what I want to do. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today's Q&A portion of today's conference. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dexter for any additional or closing comments. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks for joining the call this morning. If you want to have any follow-up sessions, please feel to send an e-mail and [Technical Difficulty] time. Thanks for everybody for joining the call. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some highlights from the past year as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our fourth quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal 2024. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered strong financial results in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023. I want to start by thanking the entire Lamb Weston team for driving these results and their incredible commitment to supporting our customers. I'm proud of the work we did and continue to do to grow our business and build momentum as we enter a new year. Specifically, in fiscal 2023, we delivered record sales of nearly $5.4 billion and drove strong profit growth in each of our core business segments through a combination of pricing actions, mix improvement, and supply chain productivity. We acquired the remaining interest in our European joint venture, which added 1,500 new colleagues, six processing facilities and nearly 2 billion pounds of capacity. The business integration is well underway, and we believe this strategic transaction strengthens our capabilities to serve customers as a unified global Lamb Weston. We acquired a controlling interest in our joint venture in Argentina, and we broke ground on a 250 million-pound capacity expansion, which will improve our ability to serve the growing South American market. We also made progress on major capital expansion projects in China, Idaho, and The Netherlands, all of which are on track to be completed within the next 18 months. We opened an innovation center in Bergen Op Zoom in The Netherlands, wherein close partnership with our innovation center in Richland, Washington, will develop and test new product and processing ideas for customers in Europe and around the world. We launched new groundbreaking products with proprietary technologies that address customer and consumer needs in non-traditional frozen potato channels, such as pizza outlets, expanding our total addressable market. We further stabilized our supply chain by targeting staffing levels and managing through a second consecutive challenging crop cycle, all while executing productivity initiatives and upgrading capabilities at our processing facilities. We continue to strengthen our operational infrastructure by completing the design work for the next phase of our new enterprise resource planning system. We'll begin implementing this new system across a portion of our supply chain in North America later this year. And finally, we returned more than $190 million to shareholders, including increasing our dividend for the sixth straight year and continuing to execute against our share repurchase plan. I'm especially proud that we delivered this performance in a highly challenging operating environment and I'm excited to see what our Lamb Weston team can deliver in fiscal 2024 and beyond. Let me now turn to the current operating environment. The overall global frozen potato category remains healthy. The fry attachment rate in the US, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, was largely steady throughout fiscal 2023 and remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Servings in Europe and our other key international markets also held up well. However, the cumulative effect of inflation and other macro pressures on the consumer over the past few years have continued to temper traffic in certain restaurant channels. In the quarter, total restaurant traffic in the US grew versus the prior year quarter as QSR traffic growth more than offset declines in casual dining and full-service restaurants. However, total traffic growth decelerated sequentially each month during the fourth quarter as QSR traffic growth slowed and as traffic declines at casual dining and full-service restaurants softened further. Overall, restaurant traffic picked up in June behind strength in QSRs. However, traffic at casual dining and full service remain soft. We expect that near-term demand may be somewhat choppy because of the variabilities of restaurant traffic trends and continued macro pressures on the consumer, which makes forecasting global demand for frozen potatoes very difficult. As a result, we incorporated a cautious view of demand and volume when developing our fiscal 2024 financial targets. Despite this added volatility, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the global category and we'll continue to invest behind the capabilities to support that growth across our key markets. With respect to costs and pricing, while we expect input cost inflation to moderate relative to the double-digit rates that we experienced in each of the last two fiscal years, we believe it will continue to have a meaningful impact on our cost structure. We expect most of our input cost inflation will be driven by higher contract prices for potatoes. In North America, we've agreed to a 20% increase for this crop -- this year's crop, while in Europe, we have agreed to an increase of 35% to 40%. We believe the overall environment for inflation-driven pricing actions remains generally favorable. However, it's important to note that any price actions that we may take this year will likely be more modest than what we implemented in fiscal 2023. Given that, first, our pricing actions last year were intended to catch up to the effect of multiple years of high inflation. And second, we expect total input cost inflation to grow at a lower rate. Although we expect pricing actions will continue to be the primary lever to offset inflation over the long-term, we'll continue to drive improvements in product and customer mix resulting from our revenue growth management initiatives as well as supply chain productivity to benefit sales growth and profitability. With respect to the upcoming potato crop, we're harvesting and processing the early potato varieties and initial indications are that this portion of the crop, which represents about 10% of our potato needs in North America this year, is broadly consistent with historical averages. At this time, the crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta, and the Midwest, that will be harvested in the fall appear to be largely in line with historical averages, as growing conditions in these regions have been generally favorable. In Europe, a wet and cold spring impacted planning, which may delay the timing of the harvest in some of our growing regions. We'll provide more detail on the crop when we report our first quarter results in early October, in line with our past practice. Before Bernadette shares details on our fourth quarter financial performance and fiscal 2024 outlook, I'd like to update you on a change we're making to our reportable segments. Effective at the start of fiscal 2024, in connection with our recent acquisition and to align with our expanded global footprint, we began managing our business in two reportable segments; North America and International. The North America segment includes products sold in Restaurant, Foodservice and Retail channels in the US, Canada, and Mexico, including our large multinational chain customers. The International segment includes products sold in Restaurant, Foodservice and Retail channels outside of North America. These two segments as well as our global supply chain will report to Mike Smith, our Chief Operating Officer. Mike's role is focused on execution and is designed to help us drive growth and unlock efficiencies by providing a truly end-to-end view of our global business. I'll continue to maintain responsibility for driving our long-term strategies and priorities, including allocating capital and resources to support sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our stakeholders. We'll begin to provide our financial results under the new reportable segments with our first quarter results. So, in summary, we delivered a record year of sales and earnings growth, and continue to build operating momentum across each of our core segments. While near-term demand may be difficult to predict, the category remains healthy, and we remain confident about its long-term growth prospects. And finally, at this time, the potato crop in North America is largely in line with historical averages, while late planning may delay the harvest in Europe. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. I want to also thank the Lamb Weston team for finishing the year strong and setting us up well for fiscal 2024. Let's begin with our fourth quarter results. Sales were up more than $540 million versus the prior year quarter or 47% to a quarterly record of just under $1.7 billion. That's at the high end of our targeted range for the quarter. About $380 million of the increase was attributable to the consolidation of our EMEA and Argentina operations. The EMEA amount is above the high end of the targeted $300 million to $325 million range for the quarter, reflecting a strong benefit from pricing actions. Excluding incremental sales from these acquisitions, net sales grew 14%. Price/mix was up 24% as we continued to benefit from pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 across each of our business segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation. As expected, price/mix in the quarter decelerated sequentially from the 30% or more increase that we delivered in our second and third quarters as we largely lapped all the pricing actions taken in fiscal 2022. In addition, we received no year-over-year benefits from freight rates charged to customers as we reduced these rates further to match the decline in our transportation costs. While we expect lower customer freight rates will soon become a year-over-year headwind for price/mix, our goal is to match these to our transportation costs so that their effect on our profits is neutral over time. Our overall sales volumes in the quarter declined 10% due to four factors. The first and primary driver was our continued effort to strategically improve our product and customer mix by exiting certain lower-priced and lower-margin business across our Domestic and International portfolio. Second, demand was tempered despite softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic in the US. This had a more pronounced effect on our Foodservice segment and drove much of the decline in that segment's volume in the quarter. Third, certain customers in international markets began to right-size inventories after carrying unusually high levels of inventory to derisk their supply chains during the pandemic. And fourth, certain large retail customers temporarily lowered prices to right-size inventories of private label products, delaying shipments of products that we produced on their behalf. In addition, we realized some acceptable levels of branded product volume elasticity in response to the inflation-driven pricing actions that we implemented over the past year. Moving on from sales. Our gross profit in the quarter, excluding comparability items, increased more than $170 million to nearly $425 million. About 40% of the increase was attributable to the incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. The remainder was driven by the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity in our legacy Lamb Weston business, which more than offset higher input and manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes. Gross margin was up more than 300 basis points to 25.1% despite absorbing the dilutive impact on margin of the EMEA acquisition. Input costs increased high single-digits on a per pound basis, easing somewhat from the double-digit inflation rate earlier in the year. The increase in cost per pound were again largely driven by a 20% increase in the contracted price for potatoes in North America, significantly higher prices for open market potatoes due to poor yields from the 2022 crop and continued increases in the cost of labor, energy, edible oils, and ingredients for batter coatings. Our higher per pound cost also reflected reduced fixed cost coverage due to lower throughput, as we did take some extended downtime for planned maintenance in some of our production facilities; and increased write-downs of inventories, primarily consisting of bulk and obsolete finished goods. Our SG&A expenses, excluding comparability items, increased $65 million to $183 million. About half of the increase was from incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA, while the other half was primarily driven by three factors. First, higher compensation and benefit expenses due to improved operating performance. Second, an $8 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses as we restore support behind our branded products in our Retail segment to historical levels. And third, higher expenses related to improving our IT and ERP infrastructure. Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, increased $117 million or 59% to $318 million, with higher sales and gross profit driving the growth. Moving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 85% in the quarter and included the $380 million of incremental sales from the EMEA and Argentina acquisitions. Net sales, excluding the acquisitions, grew 17%. Price/mix was up 28%, which is largely comparable to the increases in the previous two quarters. The increase in price/mix reflects the carryover benefit of the domestic and international pricing actions that took effect in our fiscal second and third quarters. Volume declined 11%, and primarily reflecting the impact of exiting certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in international and domestic markets, and the inventory destocking by certain customers and international markets that I mentioned earlier. Global's product contribution margin, excluding comparability items, increased about $145 million. More than half of the increase was from the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity, more than offsetting higher cost per pound and lower volumes. Incremental earnings from EMEA, which was above our target for the quarter, drove the remainder of the increase. Sales in our Foodservice segment grew 4%, a notable deceleration versus the 17% that we delivered through the first three quarters of the year. Price/mix was up a healthy 13%, but lower than the 26% that we posted through the first three quarters, as we fully lapped our pricing actions taken in fiscal 2022 and realized no tailwind from transportation rates. As expected, the price increase that we began to implement in May only had a modest impact in the quarter, so we'll see more benefit come through in early fiscal 2024. Sales volumes were down 9%, which is consistent with the prior three quarters. We attribute most of the decline to the impact of softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic, although we also continue to realize the impact of exiting some lower-priced and lower-margin business. Foodservice's product contribution margin fell about $3 million. Lower volumes drove the decline as higher price mix more than offset the impact of higher cost per pound. Sales in our Retail segment increased 25%. Price/mix increased 35%, driven by pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios that we began to implement in February to counter input cost inflation. Trade support during the quarter remained below historical levels given category demand. Volume fell 10%, largely reflecting the challenges that I described earlier for private label products. Retail's product contribution margin increased more than $40 million and its margin percentage expanded 140 basis points to nearly 38%, as the cumulative benefit from pricing and mix improvement actions over the past couple of fiscal years more than offset higher cost per pound. Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet with ample liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with about $305 million of cash and no borrowings under our $1 billion US revolver. Our net debt was nearly $3.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Using EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, which only includes a single quarter of EMEA's earnings, our leverage ratio is 2.6 times. We remain focused on creating value for our shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same and we continue to prioritize investing in our business to drive long-term growth as well as returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases to offset management dilution. In fiscal 2023, we generated more than $760 million of cash from operations or $340 million above last year, largely due to higher earnings. Capital expenditures were about $735 million, which is up $430 million from the prior year. This increase is largely related to construction costs as we continue to expand processing capacity. For the year, we returned more than $190 million of cash to shareholders, including $146 million in dividends and $45 million in share repurchases. Now, let's turn to our fiscal 2024 outlook. We're taking a prudent approach to our financial targets for the year. Overall, we anticipate that the operating environment will continue to be challenging, with inflation and other macro factors affecting our cost structure, restaurant traffic, and consumer demand. In addition, we expect our capacity to produce coated fries, specialty cuts, and chopped in form varieties, such as puffs and hash browns, will remain constrained until our new production facilities in China and Idaho become available late in fiscal 2024. For the year, we are targeting sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion. This includes $1 billion to $1.1 billion of incremental sales attributable to the EMEA transaction during the first three quarters of the year. And net sales growth, excluding acquisitions, of 6.5% to 8.5%, which is above our long-term sales growth algorithm of low to mid-single-digits. Note that since we began to consolidate EMEA's sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, those results are included in our last year's sales baseline when calculating our sales growth. We expect sales growth, excluding acquisitions, to be largely driven by pricing actions, including both the carryover impact of actions taken in fiscal 2023 as well as any actions that we may take this year to counter input cost inflation. We also expect to deliver favorable customer and product mix as we continue to benefit from our revenue growth management initiatives. As Tom noted, while we expect a solid contribution from price, we do not expect pricing actions to be at the same level as fiscal 2023. Outside of those customer contracts in our Global segment that have yet to be fully priced, we expect any future pricing actions will be largely in line with the more modest rate of input cost inflation than what we've experienced in the past two fiscal years. In addition, transportation rates that we charge to customers will likely serve as a price headwind as we continue to adjust rates to reflect lower freight costs. In fiscal 2024, we expect volume, excluding acquisitions will continue to be pressured by our ongoing efforts to strategically manage product mix by exiting certain lower-priced and lower-margin business. This strategy has proven to be beneficial to earnings, and we continue to see opportunities across our domestic and international channels. In addition, we're taking a cautious approach to consumer demand for two primary reasons. First, while QSR traffic has held up relatively well, casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic trends have softened in the US over the past few months. Second, forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult due to conflicting data about the health of the consumer in the US, Europe, and our key markets as a consequence of inflation, especially for food away from home, the expiration of temporary government assistance and other consumer support programs put in place during the pandemic, employment trends, and other macroeconomic headwinds. Despite these near-term factors, we remain confident in the health and long-term growth prospects of the Global category and we remain committed to investing in our people, production capacity and operations to support that growth. For earnings in fiscal 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, of $1.45 billion to $1.525 billion, assuming potato crops in our primary growing regions are in line with historical averages. Using the midpoint of this EBITDA range implies growth of more than 20% or about $260 million versus the prior year. Looking at it another way, it's up $200 million more than our annualized second half of fiscal 2023 run rate of $1.325 billion. In addition to incremental earnings from the Lamb Weston EMEA acquisition, we expect our earnings growth will be largely driven by higher sales and gross profit as we benefit from pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity. We're projecting that the increase in sales and gross profit will be partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. We're targeting total SG&A of $765 million to $775 million, which is up about $200 million. In addition to inflation, the increase largely reflects incremental expenses attributable to the consolidation of our EMEA operations, increased investments to upgrade our information systems and ERP infrastructure, non-cash amortization of intangible assets associated with the EMEA acquisition, as well as ERP investments we expect to place in service during the year, and higher compensation and benefit costs due to increased headcount to support our growing business. In addition to our operating targets, we expect equity earnings, which includes our Lamb Weston RDO joint venture in Minnesota to be $30 million to $35 million. We expect capital expenditures of $800 million to $900 million as we continue construction of our previously announced capacity expansion efforts, as well as capital associated with our new ERP system and other IT upgrades. So, to summarize our fiscal 2024 outlook, we're targeting sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion, including $1 billion to $1.1 billion of incremental sales attributable to the consolidation of our EMEA operations. We expect our sales growth, excluding acquisitions, will be largely driven by price/mix, with volume pressure due to our ongoing efforts to strategically manage customer and product mix and a cautious view of demand. And finally, we're targeting adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of nearly $1.5 billion using the midpoint of our guidance, which is an increase of 20%, and largely driven by sales and gross profit growth. Lastly, as Tom mentioned, effective the beginning of fiscal 2024, we began managing our operations as two business segments, North America and International. In the coming weeks, we'll provide recast financial information for fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023 that is consistent with our new reporting segment structure, including quarterly results for the last two years. And with that, let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying we are super proud of the team's strong performance in fiscal 2023 and believe that we're well-positioned to execute our strategies to deliver our financial targets for fiscal 2024. We also remain committed to investing in our business to support customers around the world and drive people, new production capacity and operations to support sustainable profitable growth over the long-term. Thank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Thanks very much. Good morning everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Lazar : I guess just a starting point, as you talked about volume declines accelerated pretty significantly in fiscal 4Q versus 3Q, and are expected to be pressured again in 2024, I know a lot of that or even the majority is some of the actions that you're taking is sort of purposely around product mix. But how much of the sequential change in volumes was due to the inventory destocking you mentioned? And what I'm trying to get a sense of is, like, how does that square with the fact that -- my sense was most customers are still clamoring for really more supply rather than less. And I guess, do you see this destocking behind you at this point? And then I've just got a follow-up. Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew, this is Tom. As we look at the Q4 trends, we did have softness as we remarked in our comments in the Foodservice channel, and QSR held up well. We did have some destocking in the Retail channel that we experienced. And so the -- we're watching it closely. And we also walked away from some volume over the last contract season that we're now starting to see in our results. So, it's -- but I will say in -- early on in June, we saw restaurant traffic pick up a little bit. So, that's a positive. But we're watching it closely. And it's kind of a mixed bag, as we commented on our prepared remarks, on what's happening with restaurant traffic and it just depends on the channel right now. So, we're watching it closely. And we do -- that said, we have line of sight to some opportunities in the market and we'll evaluate those going forward. But that does take some time to transfer into our business that we choose to pursue some of those accounts. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, Tom. And Andrew, if I could just add. The destocking was more in our global segment in the international markets as they got more comfortable with ocean freight carriers and service rates and more timely on-time distribution there. So, that was more in the Global segment there. Andrew Lazar : Got you. And then, Tom, I think you mentioned potentially some additional opportunities. For those, would those be sort of new accounts for you or potentially more business with current accounts? Tom Werner : It's a mixed bag, Andrew. I'm not going to get into specifics. I don't talk about particular accounts and customers, but it's a mixed bag. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. And Andrew, I think it's important, as we talk about, as restaurant trends have softened some, the overall demand continues to really be aided by that French fry attachment rate, which continues to be above pre-pandemic levels. Andrew Lazar : Got it. And then separately, for doing our math correctly, your 24% guidance at the midpoint suggests gross margins maybe around the 25% level. I guess, first, do we have that sort of right? It was back on the envelope. And if it is, it certainly obviously would be a level well above historical levels, right, even though that would include the likely dilutive impact from the JV. I'm just trying to get a sense of how much maybe gross margin dilution do you see from the JV, and then is this level of gross margin, one that -- obviously I think it is, but you view as sustainable moving forward? Tom Werner : So, Andrew, we -- I'm not going to get into specifics on your mathematics, but we are focused on margin improvement as we have been historically over time. We also evaluate overall profit pool when we evaluate additional accounts and opportunities to drive volume and service our customers. I'm extremely pleased with where and what the team has done over the last year in terms of returning our margin structure to normalized level, and we're going to continue to improve it. But we're going to evaluate opportunities going forward to improve the overall profit pool. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Dexter Congbalay : Andrew, did you say 25%? Andrew Lazar : I meant 28%. Dexter Congbalay : Okay. We're not -- yes, we can't give specifics on the gross margin. We can cut on the model, but I just want to make sure I didn't hear 25%. Andrew Lazar : Yes. Sorry. You may have. 28%. I did say 25%, sorry. Dexter Congbalay : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Tom Palmer from JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir. Tom Palmer : Hi, good morning and thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask on the cadence of 2024. I think normal seasonality might have sent increases in the first three quarters and a dip in 4Q. Just given the expected timing of pricing actions relative to cost inflation, is there anything to consider this year on that cadence that might cause it to deviate? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, the only thing, Tom, that I've mentioned there is generally, overall, margins and profitability declined sequentially in the first quarter and that's largely driven by seasonality. Q1 is generally our lowest margin quarter. Tom Palmer : Okay. Understood. And I just wanted to ask on Europe. I mean we can see frozen potato prices up quite a bit. How does this affect you guys from a timing standpoint? Is this -- are you already addressing it with pricing? Is this still more work to be done? It does seem to be maybe a bit more info there than what we're seeing in the US. Tom Werner : Yes. So, Tom, we have the team in Europe, Marc Schroeder, who runs our International business, they're addressing it. They're doing a terrific job. They're getting ahead of it as much as they can. And we have contracted traditionally higher than what we have in terms of locking in potato prices. But we still have a little bit of open potatoes, but we're going to price through it, manage it as we had -- as we did last year and the year before. So the team is doing a great job. They've got a plan in place. And I'm confident on how they're managing the challenges we're having with that crop right now. Tom Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead sir. Peter Galbo : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tom Werner : Good morning. Bernadette Madarieta : Hey Peter. Peter Galbo : If I could just come back to Andrew's question around the gross margin. I guess the first just clarification point. Bernadette, on the quarter itself, I think if you put some of the adjustments back, it's like a 25%. But you -- I think there was an additional hedging loss or mark-to-market loss that wasn't adjusted out, that would have actually resulted in an exit rate of the year that was much higher and maybe would have squared against that 28% number that Andrew had mentioned that we were kind of also coming up with. So, I just wanted to clarify that, the statement to start off. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. No, thanks for the question, Peter. First, I'd just say that we really are pleased with our gross margin performance this quarter. It's plus 300 basis points to about 25.1%, and that's despite absorbing the lower-margin EMEA business and we talked about a couple of things. In addition to inflation, the other impact was that reduced fixed cost coverage that we had due to some of that extended maintenance downtime that was planned, and then the other piece was the inventory write-off. So, it's those components that are affecting our fourth quarter margins in addition to the regular inflation that we've been seeing. Peter Galbo : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe, Tom, just a broader question. I started to field some inbound, hey, if the crop comes in normal this year, doesn't that mean depth of potatoes? And I mean that's never historically been an issue in the past for pricing dynamics in the industry. So, one, I just was hoping you could address that kind of upfront? And two, you spoke about, I think, some of the capacity constraints you're still expecting through the course of the year for things like coated fries. I would think that would keep industry supply/demand dynamics pretty tight, but just wanted to give you a chance to talk on those topics? Thanks very much. Tom Werner : Yes. So, the thing that we manage every year is -- and we do it really well, is what happens with the yields on the potato crop. And right now, knock on wood, things look pretty good in terms of, like I've said in my prepared remarks, how the crop is progressing. And we keep a close eye on our contracted amount versus forecast, versus what the markets do, and we do this globally. So, we're tuned into it. And we can make adjustments over the course of the next 90 to 120 days to six months, and adjust even our new crop to balance the overall supply of potatoes out. We do it every year. The team, the ag team does a great job doing that. So, I'm comfortable with where we're at in terms of contracted potatoes. And as we do every year over the next several months, we'll make some adjustments to acres and I'll report out more in October on the balance of the crop and the quality of the main crop. So, that's really the key in terms of ag management that we're really good at and the team does a great job. And then in terms of capacity, we got some -- we're bringing on some capacity over the next 18 months. And it's a testament to our belief in the category going forward. While in the near-term, we're seeing some softness in some areas. Over the long-term, I think the category is going to continue to be resilient as it has over historical timeframe. And I feel great about how we're positioned. Our capacity coming online, competition has some capacity coming online. But I think overall, the category is going to absorb what's coming at it. So, I feel good about where the near-term and long-term supply and demand is going to be -- continue to be balanced. Operator : And our next question will come from Rob Dickerson from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. Just a quick question from the business exits, right, the lower margin businesses. Is there any kind of visibility as to when you think that actually might start to decelerate or actually stop? Like are you in the seventh inning or third inning? Just curious. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. No, as it relates to our lower-margin exits of the businesses, we've been doing that now and we're very close to being through the brunt of that work. We do continue to take a look at that, though, as our contracts come due, and we make decisions to improve our customer and product mix as we look at the availability in our manufacturing footprint and the flexibility that we need to continue to serve our customers optimally. Rob Dickerson : Okay, great. And then, I guess, secondly, in terms of expectations for the facility China, it sounds like one that is still on track for hopefully maybe sometime Q4 this fiscal year? And then secondly, just in terms of the amount of capital pool on the CapEx side for all the facilities, I mean, $850 million this year, the midpoint still clearly elevated relative to history. But again, just to clarify, if we're thinking about next fiscal year, right, in 2025, I mean, most of that incremental should float or should kind of come off the cash flow statement. Is that right? Tom Werner : Yes, Rob. So, all of our capital projects are on track. Obviously, we have an elevated number this year and that's all been preannounced. So, as we think about the go forward, as we have line of sight to some other strategic capitals, what I will say is we'll give additional guidance in the coming quarters on what the outyears look like going forward. So, I'm not going to get into all that on this call. But we are taking a look at a couple of different strategic capital projects that I won't go into detail. But we'll reevaluate guidance going forward here in the next quarter. Rob Dickerson : Got it. Okay, cool. And then I guess just lastly, to kind of round up the commentary on volume and pricing for the year. There are usually numerous datasets that we can all look at in terms of industry restaurant traffic like all things considered, right? Even though there's risk, even though we're feeling the pressure, it doesn't look as if overall the pressure right now is that bad, right? I mean there's some pressure, but pricing is not that bad. So, as you kind of think through the year, given you had baked this into the guide, assuming these trends kind of stay where they are, right, they don't get worse, I mean, it seems like it's still a safe assumption, especially given what you've done historically, that we're not thinking about increased LTOs or pricing give back, right? If the prices are where they are, trends are where they are in the industry as long, as things kind of don't get materially worse, the pricing is sticky? That's it. Thanks. Tom Werner : Yes. Rob, look, the -- we've done a terrific job rebasing our business this past year. And now we're at a point where we have selectively walked away from business. And based on our capacity constraints, and now we're going to evaluate. As I said earlier, we're going to evaluate accounts and businesses globally going forward. And the impact of that, as I look at it and how I've always managed this business, is we're going to look where we can expand the overall profit pool of this company and drive adjusted EBITDA going forward. And we may make some decisions where it may be additive to our earnings and it may be accretive to our margin percentage. But we're going to make selective strategic choices going forward to do that, just like we have in the past. As we had -- now we're at historic margin levels and we worked hard over the last 15 months to get us to this level, and now we're in a good spot in terms of growing our company going forward and driving volume and that's what we're going to do. And so it's going to be a bit of an adjustment over the coming year to drive account volume. Rob Dickerson : Makes sense. Thanks Tom. Thanks team. Tom Werner : Yes. Operator : And Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs is next. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning Adam. Adam Samuelson : Good morning. Maybe first, a clarification question, and I think it kind of dovetails into the perspective kind of build out. In the 2024 guidance, the $1 billion to $1.1 billion of incremental sales from the acquired businesses, what's the assumed EBITDA contribution from acquisitions on a year-on-year basis in 2024 for the nine months you've been consolidating EBITDA? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, Adam, we haven't given any specific earnings contribution related to those businesses, we've just given topline. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That was worth a shot. So, I guess, though, maybe holistically, if we think about where EMEA is relative to the legacy North America business on margins, kind of our understanding was that it was coming in -- it was a lot lower, kind of at a lot -- more profitability levels meaningfully below the US. Can you help us think about kind of the line of sight you have to narrowing that gap? How much of that can you do through your own mix management, productivity actions? And how much is probably going to be dependent on changes in industry contracting for potatoes, changes in market structure from consolidation that will take probably longer? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, Adam, the way I'd explain that is we're not giving specific earnings contribution, but the adjusted EBITDA from the acquired businesses were well above the $20 million to $30 million target that we provided. As it relates to going forward, as Tom said, Marc Schroeder is running that business, and we're doing a lot of things there as we do look at mix management and pricing, and we're confident in the actions that we've taken thus far and that we'll continue to deliver it going forward. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the parent business. And again, as you look at your own capacity utilization, especially with the new potato coming in the fall, and you look at the industry, I mean, the industry has been constrained from a raw material supply perspective? And Tom, earlier you alluded to the need to drive volume growth in the business. How would you -- first, how would you look at your own capacity utilization and the industry's capacity utilization as you kind of go into the calendar 2023 kind of crop years? Tom Werner : Yes, I mean, as I've said previously, our target is to run the assets around 95% capacity, and we continue to trend towards that. We've much improved over the prior year, and that's really the sweet spot, I think, for us. And I can't comment on the industry and what the other guys are doing, but that's kind of where we're targeted, and we're trending towards that. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That\u2019s all really helpful. I'll pass on thanks. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Matt Smith with Stifel. Please go ahead. Matt Smith : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Matt Smith : Good morning. Thank you. I had a follow-up on the outlook, specifically around SG&A, which is increasing, obviously including the EMEA consolidation. But I was wondering if you could provide some color on perhaps some unique factors impacting fiscal 2024? Is -- for instance, is the ERP spending peaking here in fiscal 2024? And any insight into the level of the amortization expense related to that EMEA would be helpful. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. No, as I said in my prepared remarks, SG&A is expected to increase about $200 million this year. We are replacing, again, decades of underspending in IT with the ERP, but also in other areas of the business as it relates to IT, that's going to be about a third of it. But then we've also got another impact of the incremental EMEA SG&A for the three quarters that they weren't included in our previous year results. And then I did mention that we are going to have a step-up in that noncash amortization related to the intangibles we took on, as well as once we placed some of the ERP project in service, we're going to see incremental amortization there. So, it's those factors as well as incremental costs related to some headcount that we'll be adding to support the growing business that's making up that increase. Matt Smith : Okay. Thank you for that. And in terms of the IT spending and the ERP investments, it's obviously a multiyear project. Is this a normal level of expense we should think about for the coming years? Or is this a peak level of expense depending on where you are in the process of replacing your system? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So, the level of expense is going to increase as it relates to the noncash component, because as that continues to build and we go live with the different areas of the system, we're going to see more amortization expense. The system is going to be amortized over five to seven years and so that's more what you're going to see is that non-cash component. Matt Smith : Okay. Thanks for that detail. I'll pass it on. Operator : [Operator Instructions] William Reuter from Bank of America is next. Please go ahead. William Reuter : Hi. My first question is you talked about the French fry attachment rate being above pre-pandemic levels. I couldn't tell from the tone whether you're seeing a sequential decline in the French fry attachment rate, maybe based upon some weakness in casual and other full-service dining. Has there been a sequential change? Bernadette Madarieta : No. No sequential change. Continue to remain well above pre-pandemic levels. William Reuter : Okay. And then in the question around CapEx and it being elevated this year and the majority of the current projects being completed, it sounds like there are some additional projects for future years. Could some of those include acquisitions? Or are most of these going to be just organic investments? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, most of those are going to be organic investments. Again, as we take a look at our manufacturing footprint and the possibility for needs to add incremental flexibility for other products. William Reuter : Great. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Carla Casella from JPMorgan is next. Please go ahead. Carla Casella : Hi. Just two quick clarifications. I think you said you ended the year with no revolver borrowings and -- but still that's up by about $243 million. What was the draw? Was that a draw from China or elsewhere? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So, the net debt in terms of the cash position and then the other piece that we had was related to the incremental debt we brought on for the EMEA acquisition. Carla Casella : Okay, great. And then just on the overall cost, you mentioned the 20% to 30% increase in the potato cost across the different regions. What's the timeframe in that stance? Like when do we start to lap that full cost increase? And when did it go in place? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So, the incremental cost relates to the crop that we are harvesting now. And we'll continue to harvest the main crop through September, October and use those potatoes until we get into next year's crop, which the early crop will start at a similar time frame around July of next calendar year. Carla Casella : Okay. So, we'll see in the costs next quarter? Dexter Congbalay : Yes. Starts to our P&L in -- from a P&L standpoint, starts is a little bit in the second quarter. And then towards the end of the second quarter, it's going to be about -- with FIFO inventory and we carry about 45, 60 days of inventory. Carla Casella : Awesome. Thank you so much. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : And I have no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks for joining the call today. A couple of things. One, we're going to plan to have our scheduled Investor Day for Wednesday, October 11th at the New York Stock Exchange in the morning. So, please hold that on your calendars. Our official invites and RSVP logistics will go out sometime over probably in the next month or so. Second, if you want to schedule any follow-up calls with me, please send me an e-mail and we can set a time for a call during the next few days. Thank you for joining today. Operator : And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, VP of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's first quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings press release which is available on our website lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our first quarter results, as well as our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered a strong start to the year as we continued to execute on our strategies to drive sustainable profitable growth. Our integration of our EMEA operations is progressing well. Our capacity expansion in China is now up and running and our other expansion and modernization efforts around the globe remain on track. Our supply chain teams continued to drive productivity savings and our commercial teams remain focused on serving our customers and driving innovation across all channels. While our volume was down versus the prior year, it was in line with our expectations and was primarily driven by our decisions to exit lower-priced, lower-margin business. We should see our year-over-year volume trends improve as the year progresses as we begin to lap and backfill exited volumes with higher-margin business. Overall, we feel good about the health of the category, our first quarter financial results, and our operating momentum, and have raised our sales and earning targets for the year. Let me now turn to the current operating environment. The global frozen potato category continues to be solid with overall demand and supply balanced. Fry attachment rates, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets across our key markets have remained largely steady and above pre-pandemic levels. Restaurant traffic in our key markets was generally solid. In the US overall restaurant traffic was flat versus the prior year quarter as QSR traffic growth offset further traffic declines in full-service restaurant channels. We believe that this is the cumulative effect of inflation and other macro pressures on the consumer over the past few years favoring QSR traffic and tampering full-service and casual dining traffic. While overall traffic growth did slow sequentially from about 1% in our fiscal fourth quarter as quick-service restaurant traffic growth cooled much of that weakness was in June and we are encouraged that both QSR and full-service restaurant traffic trends improved as the quarter progressed. In Europe, restaurant traffic grew in many of our key markets. In the UK, traffic was up mid-single-digits with growth in both QSR and full-service restaurants. Growth was also solid in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. In Asia, China restaurant traffic growth was very strong, but of depressed levels as a country rebounded from the severe COVID-related restrictions. Traffic in Japan was solid in both QSR and full-service restaurants. We suspect that restaurant traffic trends will be volatile in the near term as high interest rates, high inflation and uncertainty continues to affect consumers. That said, frozen potato demand has proven resilient during the most challenging economic times and we continue to be confident in the long-term growth prospects of the global category. Now with respect to cost, we continue to expect input cost inflation in the mid-to-high single-digits, largely driven by higher contract prices for potatoes, including a 20% increase in North America and a 35% to 40% increase in Europe. Much of our inflation-driven pricing across our channels has either already been announced or included in price escalators within existing contracts. Customer contracts representing about 20% of our North American business are in the process of being finalized and we feel good in the aggregate about the likely pricing and terms. Over the long term, we continue to expect pricing actions and supply chain productivity improvements will be the primary levers to offset inflation. We will also continue to drive improvements in product and customer mix to benefit sales growth and profitability. Now with respect to the upcoming potato crop. We are harvesting and processing the crops in our growing regions in both North America and Europe and we believe the crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest are in line with pre-pandemic historical averages. In Europe, we believe that the crop will also be in line with historical averages as a result of improved growing conditions. We will provide our final assessment of the crop, including how it performs out of stores when we report our second quarter results in early January. So in summary, we delivered solid results in the first quarter and continue to have good operating momentum. The overall category remains healthy with demand and supply largely balanced. And finally, at this time we believe the potato crops in our growing regions in North America or in Europe will be in line with pre-pandemic averages. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to start off by thanking the entire Lamb Weston team for the strong start to the year. Our performance speaks for itself and it's a testament to the passion and dedication of our entire Lamb Weston team. We recognize that we are operating in a challenging macro-environment, but the strong first quarter performance has allowed us to raise our fiscal 2024 financial targets. Let's start with reviewing our first quarter results. Compared with the prior year, sales increased $540 million or 48% to about $1.7 billion. About $375 million or 70% of the increase was attributable to the incremental sales from acquisitions with most coming from our EMEA business. We lapped our Argentina acquisition this quarter, but we'll continue to receive the incremental benefit from the consolidation of the EMEA operations in the second and third quarters. As a reminder, since we began to consolidate EMEA's sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, those results are included in our last year's sales baseline. Excluding the incremental sales from our acquisitions net sales grew 15%; price-mix was up 23% as we benefited from the pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 in both our North-America and International segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation. Mix was also favorable, as we continue to strategically manage our product and customer portfolio. In addition, we estimate the price-mix in the quarter benefited by a couple of percentage points from lower-than-expected trade spending associated with pricing actions that we began implementing in the last month of fiscal 2023. This may be largely timing-related. And as a result, could be a slight headwind as the year progresses. The trade spend benefit in the quarter, however, was mostly offset by roughly two point headwind related to lower freight charges passed on to customers as transportation costs have come down from the prior year period. As a reminder, our goal is to match freight charges to our customers with our transportation costs, so that their effect on our profits is neutral over time. In-line with expectations overall sales volumes declined 8%. The decline was primarily due to our decisions to exit volume-related primarily to four of our lower-priced and lower-margin contracts as part of our revenue growth management initiatives and to a lesser extent continued inventory destocking by certain customers in international markets and in select US retail channels also impacted volume. We believe the effect of these destocking actions is largely behind us and should have little impact, if any, on our results going-forward. It's important to note that volume elasticities or the amount of volume lost in response to inflation-based pricing actions have been generally low. We expect our year-over-year volume trends to improve as the year progresses as we lap the volume we exited and backfill volume with higher-margin business. Moving on from sales. Gross profit in the quarter excluding comparability items increased $213 million to $490 million. Nearly three-quarters of the increase was driven by the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, the timing of trade spending, mix improvement, and supply chain productivity in our legacy Lamb Weston business, which more than offset higher input and manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes. The remaining roughly one-quarter of the increase was attributable to incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. Including the dilutive impact of the EMEA acquisition, our gross margin percentage, excluding comparability items, increased 480 basis points to 29.4%. While first quarter margins have historically been our lowest margin quarter, we estimate that the timing of trade spending that I mentioned earlier, accounted for approximately 200 basis points of the increase, which would put our normalized first quarter gross margin, including acquisitions, approaching 28%. Input costs continued to increase mid-to-high single-digits on a per pound basis. The increases were largely driven by a 20% increase in the contracted price for potatoes in North America. Higher prices for open market potatoes due to poor yields from the 2022 crop and continued increases in the cost of labor, energy, and ingredients for batter coatings. The increase was partially offset by supply chain productivity savings, lower costs for edible oils, and lower freight costs. SG&A, excluding comparability items, increased $45 million to $160 million. More than half of the increase was from incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA. The remainder was largely driven by higher expenses related to improving our IT and ERP infrastructure, and to a lesser extent higher compensation and benefit expenses and higher advertising and promotion expenses. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA increasing 76% to $413 million. Higher sales and gross profit in the base business drove most of the growth with the remainder attributable to incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. Moving to our segments. This is the first quarter that we operated in our two new reporting segments, North America and International. Beginning with our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the US, Canada and Mexico, sales were up 19% in the quarter. Price mix was up 24%, which was driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions that took effect in fiscal 2023, across each of our primary sales channels, the timing of trade spending, and favorable mix as we benefit from our revenue growth management initiatives. Lower freight revenue partially offset the increase. Volume in North America declined 5%. This primarily reflects our decision to exit volumes related primarily to two lower-priced and lower-margin contracts that largely began to impact our sales in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023. To a lesser extent, inventory destocking by certain customers in retail channels also pressured volumes. We don't anticipate further effects from the retail destocking after the first quarter. North America segment adjusted EBITDA increased $148 million to $379 million as the carryover benefit of pricing actions, the timing of trade spending, and favorable mix more than offset higher cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes. Moving to our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America. Sales grew $360 million or 212% and included $375 million of incremental sales from the EMEA and Argentina acquisitions. Excluding these acquisitions, net sales declined 9% while price mix was up 18% driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023, as well as favorable mix, lower volume, and freight revenue offset the increase. As expected, volume, excluding acquisitions declined 27%. The decrease primarily reflects our decision to exit two very low-price, low-margin accounts that largely began to impact our international sales volumes in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. To a lesser extent, continued inventory destocking also impacted volumes in the quarter, but as I mentioned earlier, we believe the effect of destocking is largely over. Despite a 27% decline in our International segment's volume, segment adjusted EBITDA increased $57 million to $90 million. Incremental earnings from the consolidation of EMEA's financial results as well as favorable price mix drove most of the increase, more than offsetting the impact of higher cost per pound and lower volumes in our legacy Lamb Weston business. Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet with ample liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with more than $160 million of cash and no borrowings under our $1 billion US revolver. Our net debt was about $3.3 billion, which puts our leverage ratio at 2.3 times. We generated about $335 million of cash from operations, or about $140 million more than the prior-year quarter, largely due to the higher earnings. Capital expenditures were about $305 million, which is up about $180 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to construction costs as we continue to expand processing capacity in China, Idaho, Argentina, and the Netherlands. During the quarter, we returned more than $140 million of cash to our shareholders, including $41 million in dividends. Most of the cash return was from repurchasing $100 million of shares. That's more than double what we repurchased in all of 2023 as we acted opportunistically based on our stock price performance during our August open trading window. While our share buyback program is targeted to offset annual equity compensation dilution, we will continue to be opportunistic based on other capital allocation needs and the potential for generated solid returns based on our stock's trading value. Turning to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Based on our strong first quarter performance, we raised our financial targets for the year. While we continue to expect macro operating conditions to remain challenging, the overall current demand and pricing environment remains solid. In addition, as Tom mentioned, we believe the potato crops in our growing regions in North America and Europe will be consistent with pre-pandemic historical averages and we are generally pleased with how the discussions to renew remaining contracts are progressing in aggregate. Specifically, we continue to expect strong net sales gains for the year and have increased our annual net sales target to $6.8 billion to $7 billion, which is up from our previous target of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion. This includes $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of incremental sales attributable to EMEA during the first three quarters of the year, which is up $100 million from our previous estimate. This represents a 6.5% to 8.5% net sales growth, excluding acquisitions. For the year, we are targeting price mix to be up low-double-digits, which means that we expect price mix will slow sequentially from the 23% increase that we delivered in the first quarter as we begin to lap some of our price actions that we began implementing in the second quarter of last year. While the overall potato category continues to be solid, due to the timing of contract openers, we are targeting our full year volume excluding acquisitions to be down mid-single-digits compared with the prior year. And we expect year-over-year volume trends will continue to improve as the year progresses, as we lap some of the significant low-margin, low product profit volume that we chose to exit in the second half of last year and as we gradually backfill the exited lower-margin business with more profitable business. For earnings, we've raised our adjusted EBITDA target by about $90 million to $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion, up from our previous estimate of $1.45 billion to $1.525 billion. Using the midpoint of this updated range implies growth of about 26%, or about $330 million versus the prior year. We left our target for SG&A unchanged at $765 million to $775 million. While our first quarter run rate suggests a lower target, we continue to anticipate spending will build as the year progresses. We reduced our interest expense target by $10 million to $155 million as we expect to partially offset cash interest with more capitalized interest associated with our capacity expansions. Our other financial targets remain the same, including depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $325 million and capital expenditures of $800 million to $900 million. In summary, we are executing our strategies to deliver strong top and bottom-line growth by improving our customer and product portfolio mix and offsetting input cost inflation through pricing actions and driving productivity savings across our supply chain. Volume elasticities in response to inflation-based pricing actions have been generally low, and we expect volume trends to improve as the year progresses. While we remain cautious about the effect of inflation on the consumer, we feel good about the start of the year and the health of the category, which gives us the confidence to raise our full year sales and earnings targets. And with that, let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bernadette. We delivered a strong quarter, and our operating momentum has us well-positioned to deliver another year of solid sales and earnings growth. In addition, we are confident in the health of the global category and remain committed to investing in our business to drive sustainable profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long-term. And, finally, as you may know, we will be hosting an Investor Day on Wednesday, October 11th at the New York Stock Exchange. During the presentation, we'll discuss our view of the industry, our strategies for growth, and our long-term financial targets and capital allocation policies. If you haven't already, please register if you plan on attending in-person as space is limited. Otherwise, you can view our presentation via our webcast, which you will be able to access through our website. Thank you for joining us today. Now, we are ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom Werner : Good morning. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Peter Galbo : Tom and Bernadette, thank you both very much for the color around price mix and volume for the year. Tom, I was hoping to ask maybe a two-part question on volume. One, just maybe help us a little bit with cadence on when some of these backfill higher-margin customers potentially start to come online for you? And then, Bernadette, I know you kind of gave order of magnitude on International, but if there's anything more a finer point on volumes between just what was intentional walk away versus the destocking impact in a quarter would be helpful? Thanks very much. Tom Werner : Yes. So, Peter, this is Tom. So, as Bernadette alluded to, it was limited to four accounts, and you know it was important for us to maintain our pricing discipline. One of the accounts in International specifically, we are losing money on. So it was time just to part ways and that had a big impact on our International volume. So, it was a measured discipline action we did and the thing in terms of your -- the first part of your question, we have line-of-sight to backfilling that volume, it does take time, it's not a linear match when you walk away. Been through this before, but we have a great commercial team that has identified a number of opportunities in the market in both North America and International, and we are actively working at. And as we stated in the prepared remarks, volume is going to be sequentially getting better over the next quarter and the back half of the year. We expect the categories -- and, really, it's in good shape. So between organic growth and some things that we have identified, I feel great about where we are at and how we are going to execute and continue to grow the volume in the back half of the year and over the course of the next several quarters. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. And Peter just to the -- Peter Galbo : Got it. Bernadette Madarieta : To the second question you asked, you know that those volume exits started impacting our International sales in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, and the business that we chose to walk away from, I would say about 90% of that relates to that in terms of volume decline with the remainder of being the destocking. Peter Galbo : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. And then, Tom, one question I have just been getting on the crop itself. Obviously, the crop in your main regions is coming pretty well. I think, there has been some issues in the East Coast Canada crop. Just curious kind of how you think that might impact the overall category here over the course of the next year in terms of the industry tightness? Thanks very much. Tom Werner : Yes. Peter, I think, the crops -- and we will have a -- as we do every January on our earnings call, kind of a debrief on how we are feeling about the overall crop and storage, crop is in great shape worldwide. So, I don't expect any impacts in any region in terms of challenges with the crop at this point. Peter Galbo : Thanks very much, guys. Tom Werner : Yes. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Tom Palmer with J.P. Morgan. Tom Palmer : Good morning, and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the guidance boost. I would assume some flow-through of the higher EMEA sales, but the bulk of the increase on earnings seems to be more related to the gross margin outlook. Is this mainly a reflection of pricing or a lower COGS inflation outlook? I realize there might have been some conservatism in the prior number, but just trying to understand the moving parts. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So we feel good about the operating momentum that we have had. It's been primarily related to pricing. When we think that those financial targets are really prudent given the macro-environment that we are faced -- facing, as well as just uncertainty regarding consumer health. So most of that's pricing and we feel really good about the operating momentum of the business. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you. And then I wanted to just follow-up on that gross margin piece. Traditionally you had seen second quarter gross margin coming above the first quarter and then third quarter coming above the second quarter. Is this cadence reasonable when we think about the build for this year? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, so you're right, typically we do see a sequential step up in Q2. I think we will still a see sequential step up, but it may be more muted because we are going to be lapping some of those pricing actions that were taken last year, as well as the timing of the customer trade claims that I talked about. Tom Palmer : Understood. Thank you. Tom Werner : Yes. Hey, Tom, remember that what Bernad had mentioned before, yes, we printed 29.4%, but if you take away some of the timing impacts of that trade spend probably a little bit south of 28% as a base. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, that's right, Tom. So when I am speaking to the step up, I'm speaking up to more normalized 28% that I referred to. Tom Palmer : Okay. Understood. Thanks. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Tom Werner : Good morning. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Good morning. So, I guess the first question is related maybe to mix, and clearly you are making some conscious decisions on moving away from low margin -- from some lower margin business. But just more broadly, can you speak to maybe the -- if we try to cut your volumes between kind of more traditional straight run fries versus some of the more upgraded products and battered encoded and the like that you're now producing? Help -- can you help quantify kind of what that represents as a proportion of the business today? And where that can be getting to, whether it's with some of these business exits more recently, or over the next couple of years consider that's the mix has been a very powerful margin driver margin driver for the business and trying to dimensionalize how much more room there's there to go. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, Adam, strong price mix performance was the key driver of our better-than-expected financial results. As it relates to mix and how that relates to growth going forward, we will be covering that in our industry -- investor call next week. And so, we will cover that more then, but again, strong price mix was the key driver of our better-than-expected performance. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then if I could just ask a second one. I know you talked about kind of customer trends in Europe. What the EMEA -- the acquired EMEA business, what was their organic volume growth in the quarter? And the increased revenue contribution in EMEA, is that a more positive volume outlook, more positive price mix outlook, or both? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So we feel really good about EMEA performance. We have not given the prior year comp because as you know the EMEA sales were not reported in the prior year in our sales number. It was recorded in our equity-method earnings. But our estimates is largely in line for the remainder of the year at the run rate that we saw for EMEA in Q4 and Q1 from a sales perspective of about $360 million. Adam Samuelson : Okay. All right. I appreciate that color. I will pass it on. Thanks. Operator : We will now take our next question from Matt Smith with Stifel. Matt Smith : Hi. Good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning. Matt Smith : I wanted to ask about the impact of walking away from low-margin contracts in this mix management you have been pursuing. That's weight on volumes over the past couple of quarters, and you mentioned that the actions in the International segment and the US segment will be fully lapped by the fourth quarter. So, do you expect to be in a position to be growing volumes as you exit this year? Meaning you've lapped those -- you've lapped the drag from walking away from those contracts and you've made some progress on the backfill with higher margin business? Tom Werner : Yes. Matt, I fully expect as I said earlier that, in the back half of the year we should start to see positive volume trends and that's a function of lapping the exited business, but also we have line-of-sight to additional business that we are going to start to backfill with, and it takes time, but I fully expect based on how we've got the business forecast and the opportunities we have that we are going to start seeing positive volume trends in the back half. Matt Smith : Okay. Thank you for that. And maybe if I could ask one more question here. You mentioned that the capacity in China came online in the quarter. Do you have any update to the timing for the American Falls facility? Is that still expected to be on time for beginning production early in 2024? Tom Werner : Yes. We still expect in the late spring of 2024, early summer for American Falls to transition to our vertical start-up and it takes some time to get the plant up and running, but absolutely, late spring or early summer. Matt Smith : Thank you, Tom. I'll leave it there, and pass it on. Tom Werner : Thanks. Operator : We will now take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Tom Werner : Hey, Rob, you might be on mute. Operator : Due to no response, we'll move on to -- Tom Werner : We'll move on to next the question. Operator : Would you like to move on? Tom Werner : Yes, please. Operator : Okay. We will now move on to Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Robert Moskow : Yes. Hi there. Thanks for the question. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Robert Moskow : I hate to keep the magnifying glass on volume, but Tom, when you talk about positive volume in the back half, the way we had modeled it was that the easy comparisons to the volume you walked away from really started in size in fourth and not in third. So, is that correct? And if so, can we expect positive volume in third as well even though the volume you walked away from may not have been as much? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. Tom Werner : Go ahead, Bernadette. Go. Bernadette Madarieta : As it relates to the volume in our North America segment, I think I alluded to the fact that we started to walk away from that in third and fourth quarter. In our International segment, we started to see the effect of what we exited in the fourth quarter of last year. So, as we said, we do expect to see volume continue to improve both as we lap that business we exited and as we bring on new business. Robert Moskow : Okay. So, is it premature to start [Technical Difficulty] dicing it up by quarter? And just -- should we just think of it as the second half, or can we say third quarter half as well? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. No. I would just think of it as the second half of the year. Robert Moskow : Okay. Got it. And then my other question, and it's -- I was hoping you could give a little more color on like what percent of your contracts come up for renewal seasonally? And also, as it relates to, like, I think a lot of the industry is on three-year contracts instead of one. So like, how much is up for grabs in the next three to six months, just roughly speaking? Is there a way to quantify that? Tom Werner : Yes. Sure, Robert, in our remarks, we got about 20% in play. We feel confident about where we are at, where we are at in those discussions, how things are progressing for us this year. So, we will get through all that over the course of the rest of this year. And at a later time, as we always do, we will give some color on what we've got coming up in terms of contracting for our next fiscal year and how that's progressing. But, right now, we've worked through most of it. Feel good about where we are at. Obviously, it's all baked into our guidance. We have 20% in play. Feel good about where it's at. Commercial team is executing at a high level, great discussions and more to come on that. And then, the next -- like we do usually in our July call, we will talk about what's coming up for contract renewal in the next fiscal year. Robert Moskow : Yes. Sorry, I was on the Conagra call. So, 20% in play, and does it all kind of adding up in the first [Multiple Speakers] pardon me. Tom Werner : Nothing. Robert Moskow : All right. Dexter Congbalay : That's fine. No problem. Robert Moskow : Is it all in the first half or is it, like, seasonally or is it just like kind of spread out across the year, this year? Tom Werner : Typically, it's -- we start late spring through early fall when we start the contracting discussions. Robert Moskow : Early fall. Okay. All right. Thanks so much. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Robert. Operator : We will now take our next question from Johnny Shamir with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks. Hey, guys. It's Andrew Lazar. Hope all is well. And I joined late as well. So, I apologize if some of this was covered. But, I think, Tom, I remember -- I think, last quarter, you started to talk a little bit about the planned sort of pivot, right, to a little bit more of a focus on profit dollars going forward as that's the way you obviously grow the business and you've had the significant margin recovery, you know, kind of, much of which has already taken place and that kind of makes sense, right, as you think about what you are looking to do. But I think there was some confusion and maybe some might have taken that to mean that, you know, as you move towards profit dollars that somehow you were expecting, you know, sort of ongoing or structural margin erosion going forward as some of the new capacity comes online and you know that you would have to sort of go after lower-margin business somehow to, you know, fill that capacity. I was just hoping you could maybe and maybe you'll get into this a lot more obviously next week, but maybe just to clarify a little bit of that, because I do think there was some confusion around that. You know, I logically understand, right, the shift now that margins have kind of recovered to much more of a profit dollar focus. Thanks so much. Tom Werner : Yes. Andrew, we are going to stay disciplined with our revenue growth management initiative. And so, as we think about opportunities going forward, we are going to look at maintaining our margin profile and we are going to stay disciplined. And, you know, a testament of that is our decision to walk away from some of this lower margin business that we have been talking about. So, it's all about maintaining the discipline and what we are going to focus on. We have worked really hard to rebuild our margin profile in this business and we are going to continue to focus on that and maintain our discipline around the margin structure. Robert Moskow : Great. Thanks. See you next week. Tom Werner : Yes. See you next week, Andrew. Operator : We will now take a question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. I was on mute. I guess, quick question for you, Tom. Just, I guess, with respect to the China plant, right, that's sort of up and running, maybe coming back to Andrew's question a little bit, but asked a different way. I'm just curious. Exiting this business back in Q4, but now you have a new facility. Is there now this conversation that you've been having, and now can be activated, kind of, with the salesforce such that you say, okay, there [Technical Difficulty] opportunity here, right, the trends [Technical Difficulty] is up, maybe off a lower base, but still up. There's not real demand destruction you know going forward. It sounds like really expected such that that salesforce can actually go try to take material share, let's say, even in non-US market just kind of given the new facility. First question. Tom Werner : Yes. So, the China facility, we are in early stages of our start-up. So it takes some time to get it up and running. We are running production there today. It's going to be specifically targeted for that market. We have got things identified in -- in China market from an opportunity business standpoint, but it takes some time to get the plant up and running and efficient and kind of work the kinks out. But we are early on. So it's going to be several more quarters before we see the impact of that coming online. Rob Dickerson : All right. Fair enough. And then I just think you probably said, correct me if I'm wrong, that traffic was up, I believe, mid-single-digit in Europe [Technical Difficulty] QSRs, but I know traffic was up in Europe, it sounds like better than the US. Maybe just any kind of general perspective as to why that might be the case kind of market -- [B2B] (ph) market. Tom Werner : Hey, Rob. It's probably a little bit of, might have a little bit of softness last year, just coming out of COVID and everything like that. But overall trends seem to be pretty good. I think with inflation still a factor, but it's cooling or at least a little bit better than people were expecting at least from the energy cost standpoint. [indiscernible] income helping traffic generate or we're holding up pretty well. Rob Dickerson : All right. Great. And then just quickly, obviously harvest coming in line with historic averages, coming off two bad years. Maybe just as a reminder, kind of, you know when we start to see that, you know, 35% of COGS maybe starts to disinflate or let's call it deflate year-over-year. It sounds like that might be like a back half fiscal 2025 dynamic. Tom Werner : Yeah, Rob, so just a reminder, our cost and contract raw input structure is baked. So, wherever the crop yields and all that comes out, it really isn't going to impact our overall input cost for the balance of this fiscal year. So it's -- you're not going to see any, any decline in our cost structure, because the crop is great. It's just we have agreed to a contract last year ago and it is what it is. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, I think that's right, Tom. And the only piece that's different in the European market is that generally we'll contract for about 75%, whereas there is the open market for the remaining 25%, and we've seen, of late, that the open market prices have started to come down. Rob Dickerson : Right. But I'm thinking all the way forward to, let's say, the end of back half of next fiscal year, right, I'm assuming as we go into these contract negotiations go kind of toward the end of this calendar year, right, harvesting could this year probably put you in a pretty good position in those discussions. Tom Werner : We are not going to comment on negotiating discussions publicly. We don't do that. And it will be -- we'll let it play out the way it plays out. We will be disciplined in the process we follow every year. And at the appropriate time, when we come to some agreement, as we always do, and the market knows, you will see what our raw price is going to be for the next year. Rob Dickerson : All right. Great. Thank you. See you next week. Tom Werner : Yes. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now take a question from William Reuter with Bank of America. William Reuter : Hi. Bernadette Madarieta : Hi. William Reuter : Just quickly to make sure on the last question, you contract for 75% in Europe, but that's 100% in North America. Is that right? Bernadette Madarieta : That's correct. William Reuter : Okay. And then, you have 20% of your contracts that are up for renewal. How does that compare to where you would have been last year or in a typical year? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, typically, we have about 25% up for renewal. So, slightly down, but around average. William Reuter : Okay. And then just lastly for me. The elevated CapEx of $800 million to $900 million, how should we think about that CapEx number over the next handful of years? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So, CapEx fluctuates year to year. As we have discussed in the past, we had a pent-up demand after COVID where we had a couple of years of higher spending. I'm going to speak more to that during Investor Day, in terms of how to think about that over the next few years. So I will go ahead and leave it for Investor Day. William Reuter : I assume that might have been the answer. Okay. That's all from me. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Congbalay for any additional or closing comments. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks for joining the call today. If you do plan on or want to come to our Investor Day, please shoot me an email and I can send you the invite if you haven't gotten it already. If you do -- if you have gotten it and you do want to attend since it's at the New York Stock Exchange, you do have to register in advance so you can put you on the list to get in. Any questions on the call today or kind of going forward, shoot me a note, we can set up some time. But, again thanks for joining the call and we'll talk to you next week. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's second quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the potato crop and the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our second quarter results as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our call today. The entire Lamb Weston team delivered another solid quarter, and I want to thank them for these results and continuing to execute the strategies that we outlined in our Investor Day presentation in October. We strongly believe that our investments to expand capacity organically and through acquisitions, improve manufacturing and system capabilities, penetrate new channels and markets around the world, strengthen product, customer and channel mix, and develop our people have generated good near-term operating momentum and have us well positioned to capture our share of growth and profitability over the long term. In the second quarter, we delivered record sales, reflecting the consolidation of our EMEA business and solid price/mix growth. Sales volumes, excluding acquisitions, declined, primarily driven by our decision to exit lower price and lower-margin business. But as we expect, the year-over-year trend improved sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA growth was also solid behind incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA, as well as higher sales and gross profit in the base business. However, the increase was tempered by a $71 million charge to write-off excess raw potatoes, $65 million of which was recorded in cost of sales and $6 million in equity method investment earnings. The reason and magnitude of this charge is very unusual, so let me give you a little more color on it. In January 2023, we developed an initial sales forecast for the following fiscal year that reflected a gradually strengthening consumer and recovering global demand. That forecast was developed based on the information available at that time. We use this initial sales forecast to determine the number of contracted acres to grow the raw potatoes needed to deliver that sales forecast. Per our agreements with our growers, we're obligated to purchase all the potatoes grown on these contracted acres. However, our initial sales forecast has turned out to be more aggressive than our current estimate, reflecting recent restaurant traffic demand trends as consumers continue to absorb the cumulative effect of inflation. As a result, we have purchased more potatoes than we need to meet our current sales targets and have taken a charge to write-off the estimated excess. Although overall demand growth is slower than we anticipated a year ago, it remains resilient. Fry attachment rates in the U.S. are stable and in-line with what we projected in January 2023. Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic in most of our key international markets continues to grow, including double-digit growth in China. We remain confident that our volume trends will continue to improve in the back half of fiscal 2024 as we begin to lap and backfill exited volumes with higher margin business. This includes our target for year-over-year volume growth in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect our volumes will continue to recover in fiscal 2025 and have planned to contract for acres accordingly. While we are disappointed with the write-offs, the underlying fundamentals of the business, our operations and the category remain solid. Our volume trends are improving in-line with our expectations. Global demand is resilient as consumers continue to face stiff food-away-from-home inflation. Our new greenfield processing facility in China is now operational. Price/mix trends in the U.S. and most of our key international markets remain solid, while input cost inflation is decelerating. We delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth and gross margin expansion excluding the potato write-off. And as Bernadette will explain in greater detail, we're reaffirming our fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance range despite absorbing the write-off while raising our EPS estimates. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our operating momentum and confident in our ability to deliver our full-year financial targets. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette for a more detailed discussion on our second quarter results and updated outlook. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Tom, and Happy New Year everyone. I also want to start off by thanking the entire Lamb Weston team for their continued execution of our strategies and for delivering another quarter of strong financial results. For our second quarter, sales increased about $455 million, or 36%, to more than $1.7 billion. About $375 million or more than 80% of the increase was attributable to the incremental sales from the acquisition of the EMEA business. We'll continue to receive the incremental benefit from the consolidation of the EMEA business in the third quarter. And as a reminder, since we began to consolidate EMEA sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, those results are included in our last year's sales baseline. Excluding the incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition, net sales grew 6%. Price/mix was up 12%, as we continued to benefit from the inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 along with the pricing actions taken this year in both our North America and International segments. Mix was also favorable as we continued to strategically manage our product and customer portfolio. Lower freight charges to customers were about a 1 point headwind. Total sales volumes declined 6%, which was in-line with our expectations. The decline was primarily due to the carryover impact of exiting the lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. Volume elasticities or the amount of volume lost in response to inflation-based pricing actions remain low. While sales volumes declined compared to the prior-year period, it's a sequential improvement from the 8% decline that we delivered in our fiscal first quarter. The improving trend largely reflects no further impact of the inventory de-stocking in Asia and North America that we experienced in the first quarter and the gradual backfilling of the business that we chose to exit. Moving on from sales, gross profit, excluding unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to derivatives and items impacting comparability, increased $97 million to nearly $480 million. Our gross profit growth was tempered by a $65 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes. Excluding this charge, as well as the mark-to-market and comparability items, gross profit increased $162 million to more than $540 million. About half of this increase was driven by the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, mixed improvement and supply chain productivity in our legacy Lamb Weston business, which more than offset higher input and manufacturing costs per pound and the impact of lower volumes. The other half of the increase was from incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. Input costs increased mid-single digits on a per pound basis, which is a bit lower than the mid- to high-single digits that we saw in the first quarter. The increases were largely driven by a 20% increase in the contracted price for potatoes in North America and continued increases in the cost of ingredients for batter coatings, labor, and other key inputs. The inflation was partially offset by supply chain productivity savings, lower cost for edible oils, and lower freight costs. SG&A, excluding comparability items, increased $42 million to $177 million. More than two-thirds of the increase was from incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA, with the remainder largely driven by higher expenses related to improving our IT and ERP infrastructure, as well as compensation and benefit expenses. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA increasing 15% to $377 million. Excluding the write-off for excess raw potatoes, adjusted EBITDA increased 36% to $448 million. Higher sales and gross profit in the base business drove most of the growth, with the remainder attributable to the incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. Moving to our segments. Sales in our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, increased 10% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 14%, which was driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions that took effect in fiscal 2023 across each of our primary sales channels as well as some pricing actions taken this year and favorable mix as we continue to benefit from our revenue growth management and other mix improvement initiatives. Lower freight revenue partially offset the increase by about 1.5 points. Volume in North America declined 4%, reflecting the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. This is a sequential improvement from the 5% decline in our fiscal first quarter. North America segment adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $321 million. The carryover benefit of pricing actions and favorable mix more than offset a $63 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes, higher cost per pound, and the impact of lower volumes. Sales in our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America, grew about $350 million, of which $376 million were incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition. Excluding the EMEA acquisition, net sales declined 12%. Price/mix was up 10%, driven primarily by the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year, discrete pricing actions taken this year, and favorable mix. Sales volume fell 22%, primarily reflecting the carryover impact of exiting the lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. International segment adjusted EBITDA increased 66% to $100 million, with incremental earnings from the consolidation of EMEA's financial results driving the increase. Excluding the EMEA acquisition, higher cost per pound along with the impact of lower volume more than offset the favorable price/mix. The higher cost per pound included an $8 million charge allocated to the International segment for the write-off of excess raw potatoes, which was based on the percentage of finished goods shipments to international markets. Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with our net debt leverage at 2.4 times adjusted EBITDA, up from 2.3 times at the end of our fiscal first quarter. Our net debt ticked up a couple hundred million dollars to more than $3.5 billion as we drew on our U.S. revolver to largely finance seasonal working capital needs and increase capital expenditures. We also accelerated some payments to suppliers in advance of our ERP system go live at the beginning of the third quarter. In the first half of the year, we generated $455 million of cash from operations, or nearly $170 million more than the first half of last year, largely due to higher earnings. Capital expenditures in the first half were about $565 million, which is up about $300 million from the prior-year period, primarily due to construction and equipment purchases as we continue to expand processing capacity in Idaho, Argentina, and the Netherlands. As Tom mentioned, we started up our new facility in China a couple of months ago. As we discussed during our Investor Day in October, our first priority is investing in our business, which we are doing organically with our capacity expansions. We also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. During the first half of the year, we returned more than $230 million of cash to our shareholders, comprised of $82 million in dividends and $150 million in share repurchases. This includes $50 million of stock repurchased in the second quarter at an average price of $87.41 as we acted opportunistically based on our stock price. In addition, in October, we raised our share repurchase authorization to $500 million, and in December, we announced a 29% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. Turning now to our fiscal 2024 outlook. We reaffirmed our full-year sales and EBITDA targets and raised our EPS estimate despite the charge to write-off excess raw potatoes. Specifically, we reaffirmed our annual net sales target of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. This includes $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of incremental sales attributable to the EMEA acquisition during the first three quarters of the year, and 6.5% to 8.5% net sales growth excluding our acquisitions. For the year, we continue to target price/mix to be up low-double digits, with price/mix in the second half slowing sequentially from the 17% increase that we delivered in the first half as we lap more of last year's price actions. We continue to target our full-year volume, excluding acquisitions, to be down mid-single digits compared with the prior year as we maintain our cautious view of the consumer. That said, we expect year-over-year volume trends in each of our segments will continue to improve in the second half of the year as we lapse some of the significant low-margin, low-profit volume that we chose to exit in the second half of last year, and as we gradually backfill the exited lower-margin business with more profitable business. We expect volume growth to be positive in the fourth quarter. For earnings, we're reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. We're maintaining our EBITDA range target despite absorbing a $71 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes. We're raising our adjusted diluted EPS estimate to $5.70 to $6.15 from our previous range of $5.50 to $5.95. The increase, which also includes the impact of the raw potato write-off, is largely due to two items. First, we're reducing our SG&A target by $20 million to a range of $745 million to $755 million as we continue to manage our operating costs. And second, we're reducing our interest expense target by $15 million to $140 million as we expect to capitalize more interest associated with our capacity expansions. We're also updating a couple of other financial targets. We reduced our depreciation and amortization expense by $20 million to $305 million. We also increased our capital expenditures target to $900 million to $950 million, up from our previous estimate of $800 million to $900 million to account for the timing of spending for our capacity expansion projects. Before I turn the call back over to Tom, let me give you a quick update on our ERP implementation. At the beginning of our fiscal third quarter, we transitioned some of our central systems in North America that manage supplier payments, inventories, warehousing, customer invoicing, and customer shipments to SAP. We're experiencing the usual bumps associated with these highly challenging large-scale projects, but don't expect that the cutover will have a material impact on our full-year business or operating results. The estimated financial impact of the system's go live is included in our fiscal 2024 targets, including the impact of pausing production and increasing planned downtime at our processing facilities, followed by a gradual ramp-up of production, and reduced shipments due to short-term inventory visibility challenges at our third-party finished goods warehouses in the period immediately following the cutover. As a result of the increased production downtime, our third quarter gross margin, which is typically our strongest, will be pressured by higher manufacturing costs, reflecting reduced fixed cost coverage and other cost inefficiencies. With respect to sales, we expect the inventory visibility challenges that we experienced at the third-party warehouses to affect shipments and temper the sequential improvement in our third-quarter volume trends. But as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect positive year-over-year volume growth in our fiscal fourth quarter. I want to thank our customers and our warehousing and logistics service partners for working with us to manage through the transition. And most importantly, I want to thank our Lamb Weston team members that have been working tirelessly on this project, including throughout the holiday season. We will provide a further update on the transition of the central systems and processes, as well as a general timeline for implementing the new ERP system throughout our manufacturing network during our third quarter earnings call in April. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of top- and bottom-line growth as we continued to execute our strategies, manage our portfolio mix, and manage costs. We continue to expect volume trends to improve in the second half of the year, while remaining cautious about the effect of inflation on the consumer. And finally, we updated our earnings estimates for the year, including reaffirming our annual EBITDA range despite absorbing a write-off for excess raw potatoes and raising our annual EPS estimates to reflect lower SG&A and interest expense. Let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thank you, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying we feel good about the overall health of the global category and the drivers for demand growth. We also feel good about our operating momentum and are confident in our ability to deliver our updated financial targets for the year. And finally, we believe that our focus on executing our strategies will continue to have us well positioned to drive sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term. Thank you for joining us today. And now, we're ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Smith with Stifel. Matt Smith : Hi, good morning. Tom Werner : Hi. Good morning, Matt. Matt Smith : I want to ask a question about your reiteration of guidance despite the $71 million potato charge. If you could talk about what led to the potato charge? It sounds like your initial contracted acres were based on your outlook from January of the past year. So, have you changed your shipment volume expectations relative to the guidance that you initially provided us in July? And then, with the excess potato charge, does that represent the full amount of excess potatoes? Or were you able to utilize some of the higher-than-expected yields either through processing finished goods or holding more raw potatoes into next year? And how does that impact how you go about contracting acres for next year based on your current expectation for volumes into next year? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, Matt, thank you for the question. I think it relates to the first one and it relates to guidance, the amount of shipments and volumes that we had in our guidance in July has not changed from what we have now. Again, that was -- we had to determine the number of acres to plants back in January of 2023. But the last time we gave guidance, there's been no changes. And then the second question, as we think through the crop this year, there are mitigants that we would have taken into consideration in terms of carrying some higher finished goods inventory for products that we know that we're going to sell. And then, as we always do, we will take that into consideration as we determine the number of acres that we're going to plant for the upcoming year. Matt Smith : Thank you, Bernadette. And maybe as a follow-up, could you talk about how your contract negotiations are progressing with farmers into next year, given it sounds like maybe you're going to contract for fewer acres? How does that change the pricing conversation? Tom Werner : Matt, this is Tom. I'll -- as we do every year, we're right in the middle of negotiations, so we're not going to get into where we're at in that process. As we always do in July, October, we'll give you an overview of kind of where we ended up and talk about that in more detail. But right now, we're right in the middle of it, so we're going to respect that process. Matt Smith : Thank you, Tom and Bernadette. I'll pass it on. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Hi. Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : So, maybe just -- good morning. So, on the charge, and I want to just be clear as we think about, otherwise your gross profit margin in this quarter would have been 350-or-so basis points higher and your full-year gross margins would have been -- the impact of the full year is about 100 basis -- 90 to 100 basis points. And so, as we think about the absence of this charge or assuming it wouldn't repeat in 2025, all else equal, your gross profit margins are tracking kind of pretty comfortably ahead of how you frame your business outlook at the Investor Day in October. Or am I mischaracterizing the outlook? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. No, thanks, Adam. You're correct. Our Q2 gross margin implies a 31.3% margin, excluding the write-off of the potatoes. And as we've been talking about, that increase is related to the pricing actions and then catching up to the multiyear impact of inflation, and also allowing the benefit of the productivity and mix that'll fall through. So, those are some of the things that you're seeing. As it relates to the third quarter, keep in mind that it's going to be down sequentially from that and that is going to reflect that reduced fixed cost coverage that we're going to have as we started up our ERP and we needed to take some downtime and ramp our plants up slowly. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe, Tom or Bernadette, provide a little bit more detail on the progress on integrating EMEA? And just how do we think about where you are with that group on some of the revenue growth management tools that you've been implementing successfully in North America? And how kind of that business has been performing on an organic basis? Well, it'll start to be in the year-on-year comparisons organically in fourth quarter, but just are you tracking ahead of where you thought or what inning do you think those RGM tools are in terms of being deployed? Tom Werner : Yeah, Adam, this is Tom. And I'll tell you, I'm really pleased on where we're at in terms of the integration of EMEA at this point. We're towards the tail end of that, and the team has done a terrific job across the organization functionally, commercially, really connecting up. And we've reorganized the organization to reflect the global company that we are now. So, I'm pleased with where we're at. In terms of initiatives, your specific question on RGM, that's definitely on the radar, but that's going to be down the road based on a number of other initiatives we have going on in the company that we really need to keep our focus on executing specifically the ERP implementation right now. So, we're at the tail end of it. Feel great. The team is doing a magnificent job getting integrated, and I'm pleased with where we're at today. Adam Samuelson : Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks for the question. In a lot of other food industries, when raw material supplies far exceed what the demand expectations were, you'd expect some impact on pricing, some negative impact on pricing. But your industry is not like a lot of those others. So, Tom, maybe you could talk a little bit about your pricing power and the industry's pricing, and why the excess potatoes are not a concern? Tom Werner : Yeah. Robert, the thing to remember is the commodity in our business, the potato, it's a one-year crop. And so, you have to process it. And certainly, like Bernadette alluded to, we looked at all of the mitigating factors like we do every year. And it's just an unusual circumstances to the order of magnitude. Typically, we manage through different positions based on our forecast. And this year is different. And the crop overall is really, really good, and it's just a matter of -- you got to make some decisions based on the demand forecast, utilizing your plants, running the crop longer. And economically, this is the best decision to move forward based on as we're going through the end of this crop and moving into the next crop in kind of June, July. So, it's a different commodity. It has a shelf life that's rather short than a lot of the other commodity businesses I've been around. And so, it's something we manage through every year. And unfortunately, how the operating environment and the environment with this particular crop shaped up, the quality of the crop yields just put a lot of pressure on availability, which there's plenty of potatoes around. Robert Moskow : Got it. I guess a follow-up. I think you said on the last call that about 20% of your North American business was still in contract discussions. Is all of that done now? And did you get the pricing that you expected to get in those discussions? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. So, the contract renewal process is complete now, and we feel really good about where, in the aggregate, we ended on both pricing and terms. A lot of that relates to the large chain restaurants that we typically will finalize in the back half of the year, and that's what makes up that 20% that you're referencing. Robert Moskow : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Rob Dickerson : Great. Sorry about that. Thank you. Just a quick clarification question. I want to come back to the kind of sequential, I guess, implied gross margin trajectory for Q3. I guess it's more for Bernadette. I think you said there are some plants that maybe were kind of being shut down kind of temporarily by implementing some of the ERP initiatives. But then, at the same time, right, Q3 is usually the highest gross margin quarter and at the same time, we're comparing it to Q2, inclusive of the write-down, but then extra write-down or like closer to 31%. So, the very basic question with the long buildup was, if you were saying that the gross margin would be down sequentially a little bit from the normalized gross margin in Q2 once we ex out the inventory, is that how you were speaking to that? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, exactly. So, I'd say it's going to be down sequentially from the 31%, that's excluding that write-off, and that's really reflecting the reduced fixed cost coverage that we're going to have as a result of taking those plants down, while we cutover. Rob Dickerson : Got it. And then, in terms of the EBITDA margin, the same logic flows through? Bernadette Madarieta : Absolutely. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Cool. And then, I guess, just back to the volume piece, no change there. Still expected for volume to be down mid-single digits for the year. I remember coming out of the last call, there were some questions around that because getting like down, like real down, like mid-single digits. Seem kind of challenging if we're thinking Q4 is up even if it's up a little bit and now we have the first half. So, if we kind of put it all together and think, well, what about Q3, you're still saying that kind of overall volume should improve year-over-year sequentially relative to Q2 and then Q4 is up a little bit that still gets you down to at least a 4% decline. And I'm just asking that kind of in a detailed way because it is kind of challenging to get down any more than 4%, right? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. So, Rob -- yeah. So, the way to look at it is, first, we're really pleased with what we're seeing from a volume perspective and the sequential improvement that we've continued to post. We will be positive in the fourth quarter, but the thing we've got to keep in mind is that we are having reduced shipments as a result of converting over to our new ERP. I spoke about the inventory visibility challenges that we have with our third-party warehouses. I'm confident and -- that we're correcting those, but we are going to temper our volume increases in the third quarter as a result of that. Rob Dickerson : Okay. So, kind of in theory, like, volumes could be down in Q3, maybe in a similar way relative to Q2, hopefully a little bit better, but there are a bunch of moving pieces that we shouldn't be expecting, like, a nice sequential improvement in Q3? Bernadette Madarieta : That's right. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Cool. And then, thirdly, I just want to touch on China quickly, Tom, I think you said China is growing double digit kind of normalized, I guess, once we ex out some of the business exits. Maybe just kind of touch on kind of overall environment in China, kind of what you're seeing, given all the news flow over the past few months? And then, maybe just if you could touch on kind of your ability, let's say, to continue to partner with McDonald's over the next couple of years, clearly, as they look to truly expand within the country? That's it. Thank you. Tom Werner : Yeah, Rob. So, as we stated earlier that China is growing at double digits. We're well positioned. We just opened up our second factory over there. It's up and running and operating. It gives us considerable flexibility as we're thinking about the next year's contracting coming up. And so, we're -- there's a lot of news feed on China and the economy and all that's going on. But in terms of the category, we feel good about where that's at based on the data we look at, which is telling us it's growing double digits. We've got our plant up and coming. We've got line of sight to how we're going to look at that market and potential customers that we can support and more to come on that. But as we go through this contracting season in that international market, we're well positioned to gain some business. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. And then just to clarify, the double-digit growth has been in restaurant traffic that we're seeing in China. Rob Dickerson : All right, super. All right, that's all. Thanks, team. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning, Pete. Tom Werner : Good morning, Pete. Peter Galbo : I guess, just -- on the pricing front, obviously, you're going through some contract negotiations. But if I remember correctly, you have some contracts, I think, with your global customers that actually kicked in a couple of days ago or I guess the start of Q3. So, just can you remind us kind of what the dynamic looks like there or that embed in price that we should be thinking about -- price/mix that we should be thinking about in the back half of the year? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. So, we did have some contracts where that pricing took effect in the back half of the year. I think it's key, though, to -- as you look at the back half of the year to expect to see a deceleration from the 17% that we delivered in the first half as we continue to lap those price increases. But yes, we will see the impact of those contracts that are coming up to -- are affecting our pricing in the back half of the year, just like we always have. Peter Galbo : Got it. Okay. And then, Tom, maybe just back to the Investor Day, I know there was a conversation around getting back to algorithm kind of in fiscal '25 and noting some of the volume challenges that you'll begin to lap by then and maybe into Q4. I mean is that kind of still the expectation where we sit today relative to October that as we get into '25, the volume trends could at least get back to what you stated as kind of the long-term algorithm? Thanks very much. Tom Werner : Yeah, Peter, we fully expect to continue to drive and deliver our algorithm over the long term as we stated in October. And we're working all the channels to deliver that. And as we have in the past, we've been very consistent on meeting those commitments. And I expect and as we look forward, with the category and how we're getting positioned with some of the capacity additions, I fully expect us to drive volume and meet our commitments as we talked about in October. Peter Galbo : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Great. Good morning, everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : I guess to start with, I was wondering if you're able to sort of help us quantify a little bit, maybe how much sort of volume gets pushed from Q3 to Q4 based on some of the cutover dynamics that you mentioned. I'm really trying to get a sense of about what like the underlying sort of volume picture looks like for Q4, particularly as it relates to as we move into next year. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, Andrew, I think the way to think about that is we're not going to quantify any amount. But certainly, there are some shipments that would be retail and food service that would be lost in third quarter, whereas the chain would be more of a carryover. So, again, down or it's going to be tempered in terms of the any increase as it relates to volume in the third quarter, but definitely positive in the fourth quarter as we had originally projected. Andrew Lazar : If we excluded some of the cutover dynamics, do you think volume in 4Q would have been positive anyway or maybe closer to flattish or even down a little bit, maybe... Bernadette Madarieta : No, absolutely positive in the fourth quarter. That's what we've been anticipating since we gave our July guidance and it continues to remain sound. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks for that. And then, Tom, I'm curious, you obviously walked away from some lower-margin customers in the back half of last year that you're going to start to lap as we go into the back half of this year. And as you start to replace or start to add in new customers with some of the new capacity coming in, I'm curious where were those maybe some of these new customers that you're gaining? Where were they or have they been getting supply from before? And are you displacing others now that you have some capacity? Or -- I'm trying to get a sense of -- because it doesn't seem like you've ever gone anywhere and not been able to get French fries. So, I'm just wondering where some of these new customers were sourcing product maybe before you became a supplier to them, if that makes sense? Tom Werner : Yeah, Andrew, I understand the question. I'm not going to get into very specifics on customers or where it's coming from. But ideally, we have line of sight to markets, opportunities as we go through our normal contracting season coming up, ideally, it'd be perfect timing, but it doesn't always match when you potentially win business. But we do have a plan. We have line of sight, and I'm not going to get into specifics of where and who and with respect to our customers, and I'll just leave it at that, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Marc Torrente with Wells Fargo Securities. Marc Torrente : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. It sounds like trends are a little softer than the initial plan from January '23, but you noted demand remained solid relative to the initial guide. Could you maybe reconcile some of that commentary [indiscernible] some of those trends and traffic that you're seeing that gives you confidence on volumes improving on an underlying basis? Tom Werner : Yeah. As I stated, the crop acres, potato yields, based on what we always -- what we plan for in the initial front end of the crop cycle, certainly was better than what we expected and have seen in the last several years. And the overall forecast, as I stated earlier, that we had in terms of overall volume and sales was a little softer than what we had originally planned. As we've been consistent, the guidance we gave in July and continue -- and we upped it in October was based on the forecast we were seeing at the time. And so, certainly, there's -- it was not as good as we had planned when we planted the crop. But again, to Bernadette, as she reiterated, we see our forecast from July in terms of sales and volume has not really changed for the balance of the year. So, it's really just crop acre yield issue that caused a write-off based on what we initially forecasted in July for FY '24. So again, we feel confident about the underlying fundamentals of the business, where we're at our guidance from last time has not changed, and we see line of sight to Q4 volume improving, as we've stated on this call. So, all things are pointing towards sequential improvement for the balance of the year, albeit just keep in mind that Q3 is going to have some challenges with the ERP cutover. Bernadette Madarieta : And Tom, if I could add to that, when we made the initial estimate and planted those acres, you guys see the same data that we do. And U.S. restaurant traffic trends have slowed since that time, and that was included in our updated July forecast. But the fry attachment rate continues to be about pre-pandemic levels and continues to be strong, as Tom mentioned. Marc Torrente : Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then you lowered the SG&A outlook for the year. A little more color here? Is that timing around some of those special projects? Are you pulling back on any of the underlying expenses? Or is that better leverage on the core? Bernadette Madarieta : It's going to be some better leverage, but just overall cost management that we're doing as we look forward to the second half of the year. Marc Torrente : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Congbalay for any additional or closing comments. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Any follow-up discussion, please send me an e-mail. We can schedule some time. Other than that, have a great day, and Happy New Year. Thank you. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's third quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the ERP transition, the current demand environment and the status of this year's potato crop. Bernadette will then provide details on our third quarter results as well as our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. This was a challenging quarter as we transition certain central systems and functions in North America from a decades-old legacy enterprise resource planning system to SAP. The transition is the first step towards a multiyear global rollout. Among other areas, the scope of this transition affected receiving and processing customer orders, trade pricing and promotion management, managing inventories and warehousing, scheduling, transportation and shipments, invoicing customers and treasury and cash management. While the transition went well in many areas, it proved more difficult than we expected despite the countless hours we spent planning, testing and preparing for the transition. Specifically, we experienced significant challenges with inventory visibility at distribution centers which led to shipment delays, canceled orders and ultimately, lower-than-expected volumes in the quarter. In particular, we had more difficulty filling shipments of mixed product loads which are generally higher margin than shipments of single product loads. This pressured margins in the quarter. We partnered closely with our third-party and company-owned distribution centers to minimize the impact of these challenges. This included co-locating Lamb Weston team members at our distribution centers to resolve data errors and processing issues in real time and adjusting systems and processes for balancing inventory between distribution centers and SAP. We also work closely with our customers to limit the impact on their operations and I want to thank them for their patience and commitment as we manage through the transition. Importantly, I also want to thank our Lamb Weston team members who worked around the clock to help restore customer shipments and service back to pre-transition levels. As Bernadette will cover in more detail later, we estimate that the ERP transition reduced net sales by about $135 million and volume growth by approximately 8 percentage points in the third quarter. We also estimate that adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by approximately $95 million, with more than half of that due to lower sales and unfulfilled customer orders and the remainder due to incremental costs and expenses directly related to the transition. As with any transition, our teams are still adapting to the new system. I'm pleased that we have contained the effect of the inventory visibility issues to our fiscal third quarter and restored customer order fulfillment rates to pre-transition levels. We understand that some customers effected by either delayed or canceled shipments may have temporarily secured supply from alternative sources until they gain confidence in our service levels. With healthy warehouse inventory levels and flows throughout the system, we're actively engaging customers with our direct sales force to earn their trust and their business. Turning now to the demand environment, overall, global French fry demand remains resilient but we believe it's currently at or below the historical annual growth rate of about 2% to 4%. According to restaurant industry data providers, restaurant traffic trends in the U.S. have been generally flat to slightly down during the past 6 to 9 months as consumers continue to adjust to the cumulative effect of inflation on menus. QSR traffic during the third quarter was flat versus the prior year after growing modestly during the first half of fiscal 2024. Several QSRs have attributed this to less visits by lower-income consumers as their disposable income has been more affected by the overall inflationary environment. Meanwhile, traffic at full-service restaurants has declined each quarter during fiscal 2024. Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic continued to increase versus the prior year in most of our key markets. But growth has also slowed sequentially from our fiscal second quarter. Similar to the U.S., we believe traffic in these markets is also affected by consumers adjusting to the cumulative effect of inflation as well as other macro headwinds. Restaurant traffic growth in our larger markets in Europe in the third quarter was mixed. Traffic was up in France, Germany and Italy but at notably slower rates than during the first half of fiscal 2024. Traffic was down in the U.K. and Spain. In Asia, traffic growth in both China and Japan was solid, while in the Middle East, traffic was down. While global restaurant traffic has slowed, the fry attachment rates in North America and in our key international markets have been generally stable. So on the one hand, fries remain as popular as ever with consumers. But on the other hand, consumers are going out to eat less often. Because of these recent trends, we're taking a more cautious view of the consumer. In our previous financial outlook, we expect the restaurant traffic and demand would pick up in the fourth quarter. As Bernadette will cover in more detail, we're now taking a more prudent approach to our expected sales and volume performance in the near term. We currently anticipate volume will decline mid-single digits as opposed to our previous expectation of modest volume growth in the fourth quarter. Despite this near-term caution, we believe the pressure on restaurant traffic and demand is temporary and we remain confident that the global fry category will return to its historical growth rates as consumers continue to adjust to higher menu prices. Turning now to the upcoming potato crop. In North America, we've agreed to a 3% decline in the aggregate and contract prices for the 2024 potato crop and have largely secured the targeted number of acres to be planted across our primary growing regions. Planting is on schedule for the early potato varieties and we expect planning for the main harvest to be completed by the end of April. Although we expect our potato costs in North America to decline somewhat during the second half of fiscal 2025, assuming an average crop, they will likely be offset by a rise in our other input costs. In Europe, prices governed under fixed price contracts are up mid- to high single digits and we've contracted for our targeted amount of acres. We'll provide our typical update on the outlook for potato crops in North America and Europe when we issue our fourth quarter earnings in late July. So in summary, we believe the impact of the order fulfillment issues has been contained in the third quarter as service levels have been restored to pre-transition levels. Overall, global fry demand remains resilient, although restaurant traffic trends continue to be challenged as consumers adjust to higher menu prices. We have reduced our fiscal 2024 financial targets to reflect these softer traffic trends and the higher-than-expected financial impact of the ERP transition. And finally, we have largely locked in the pricing and acreage needed for this year's crop in North America and Europe. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette for a more detailed discussion on our third quarter results and updated outlook. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we're not happy with the magnitude of the impact to the ERP transition on our customers, our business and our P&L. However, I do want to take a moment and say how proud I am of our Lamb Weston team members who did work tirelessly to remedy the issues we experienced and bring our customer order fulfillment rates back to pre-transition levels within the quarter. I also want to thank our sales team members who stayed close to our customers to limit the impact as much as possible on their businesses. Let's review our third quarter results. Sales increased $205 million or 16% to $1.46 billion. The entire increase was driven by $357 million of incremental sales from the acquisition of the EMEA business. This is the last quarter that we'll receive the incremental benefit from the EMEA consolidation since we began to consolidate EMEA sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. If we exclude the incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition, net sales declined $152 million or 12%. We estimate that the majority of the decline or approximately $135 million was due to unfilled orders attributable to the ERP transition. Price/mix was up 4% as we continued to benefit from the inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 and pricing actions taken this year in both our North America and international segments. However, unfavorable mix related to the type of orders we were able to fill during the ERP transition partially offset the benefit of the pricing actions. In addition, lower freight charges to customers were nearly a 5-point headwind which was driven by lower volume shipped and the pass-through of lower freight rates when shipping products to customers. Total sales volumes declined 16%, with about 8 points of the decline associated with unfilled customer orders due to the ERP system transition. The other 8 points of the decline was primarily driven by 2 factors : first, more than half reflected softer-than-expected restaurant traffic trends in North America and key international markets. As Tom mentioned, we believe the traffic trends remain challenging as consumers continue to adapt to higher menu prices. In addition, unusually poor weather in January negatively affected traffic in the U.S. Second, the remainder of the volume decline reflected the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. This is the last quarter in which we will see any meaningful headwind from the 4 notable contracts that we exited last year to strategically manage customer and product mix. Moving on from sales. Adjusted gross profit increased $24 million to $427 million which was driven by the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions and incremental earnings from the consolidation of the EMEA business. The increase was partially offset by mid-single-digit input cost inflation on a per pound basis and a $20 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes as we considered the softer restaurant traffic trends in North America as well as the higher-than-expected impact on volume from the ERP transition. In addition, we estimate that the ERP transition negatively impacted adjusted gross profit by approximately $88 million. We estimate that approximately $55 million was due to lower volumes and negative mix. And that the remaining $33 million was due to about $26 million from reduced fixed cost coverage and inefficiencies arising from planned downtime for the ERP transition in our factories as well as additional freight charges as we sought to reduce the impact of shipment delays on our customers and about $7 million for penalties associated with delayed shipments or the inability to fill customer orders. Adjusted SG&A increased $30 million to $164 million, primarily due to incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA as well as higher expenses associated with the ERP system transition, including noncash amortization. The increase includes approximately $7 million of incremental costs to support the system post go-live, including efforts to restore customer order fulfillment rates to pre-transition levels. A reduction in compensation and benefit accruals tempered the increase in SG&A. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA of $344 million which is down 2% versus the prior year. Lower income in the Lamb Weston base business which includes an estimated $95 million impact from the ERP transition and a $25 million write-off of excess potatoes more than offset incremental earnings from consolidating the EMEA business and the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions. So on an underlying basis, excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA would have been around $465 million, while sales excluding acquisitions and the impact of the ERP transition would have been down 1% to 2%. Moving to our segments. Sales in our North America segment which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada and Mexico declined $123 million or 12% in the quarter. We estimate that essentially all of that decline was due to unfilled orders and unfavorable mix attributable to the ERP transition. Price/mix was up 5% driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions that took effect in fiscal 2023 across each of our primary sales channels as well as some pricing actions taken this year. Mix was unfavorable as higher margin, lower volume customers which typically have more complex mixed product orders were harder to fill until the inventory visibility issues related to the ERP transition were resolved. In addition, lower freight charges to customers partially offset the increase in price/mix by more than 4 percentage points. Volume declined 17% with more than half of the decline reflecting unfilled customer orders resulting from the ERP transition. The remainder of the decline primarily reflects soft restaurant traffic and retail trends as well as the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. North America segment adjusted EBITDA declined 14% to $286 million. The decline was largely driven by an estimated $83 million impact from the ERP transition and $23 million charge for the write-off of excess potatoes, of which about $5 million of the excess potato write-off was incurred at our North American joint venture. The impact of lower volumes and higher cost per pound also contributed to the decline. These factors more than offset the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions. Sales in our International segment which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America, grew nearly $330 million, of which $357 million were incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition. Excluding the EMEA acquisition, net sales declined $29 million or 16%. We estimate approximately $12 million of that decline relates to unfilled orders attributable to the ERP transition. Price/mix was up 1%, driven primarily by the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year as well as pricing actions taken this year. Lower freight charges to customers partially offset the increase in price/mix by about 5 percentage points. Sales volume declined 17% with more than half of the decline, reflecting the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. The remainder of the volume decline reflects unfilled customer orders served by North American exports as a result of the ERP transition. International segment's adjusted EBITDA increased 88% to $102 billion. Incremental earnings from the consolidation of EMEA's financial results drove the increase. Excluding the EMEA acquisition, higher cost per pound, an estimated $5 million impact from the ERP transition, lower volumes and a $2 million allocated charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes more than offset favorable price/mix. Let's move to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of 2.6x adjusted EBITDA, up from 2.4x at the end of the fiscal second quarter. Our net debt increased about $270 million to $3.8 billion as we drew on our revolver to largely finance increased working capital needs during the ERP system transition as well as increased capital expenditures. We continue to have ample liquidity, including more than $900 million available under our revolving credit facilities. In the first 9 months of the year, we generated more than $480 million of cash from operations, up about $145 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to higher earnings. We spent nearly $830 million in capital expenditures which is up about $330 million from the prior year period. The increase primarily reflects construction and equipment costs for our new China factory that started up in November as well as costs related to our capacity expansion projects in Idaho, Netherlands and Argentina. And finally, we've returned more than $270 million of cash to our shareholders, comprised of $122 million in dividends and $150 million in share repurchases. Turning to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. We updated our full year sales and earnings targets to reflect the impact of the ERP system transition as well as near-term demand trends. Specifically, we reduced our annual net sales target to $6.54 billion to $6.6 billion from our previous target range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. The updated range includes $1.1 billion of incremental sales attributable to the EMEA acquisition during the first 3 quarters of the year. Our updated sales target implies sales of $1.69 billion to $1.75 billion in our fiscal fourth quarter which is flat to up 3% compared with the same period a year ago. We expect price/mix will drive our sales growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting the continued carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 and actions we've taken in fiscal 2024. We expect lower freight charges to customers will continue to partially offset the increase in price/mix. As Tom noted, we expect volumes in the fourth quarter will decline mid-single digits which is down from our previous target of positive volume growth. The primary reasons for the change include our expectation that soft restaurant traffic trends in North America will continue longer than we initially anticipated. And that restaurant traffic trends in several of our key international markets have also softened more than expected. We point to softer restaurant traffic trends as the driver affecting our volume performance since our fry attachment rates in North America and our key international markets have generally been stable and that our customer order fulfillment rates that were affected as part of the ERP transition in North America are back to pre-transition levels. In addition, we expect volume in the fourth quarter may be impacted by some customers in North America that were affected by the ERP transition seeking supply at least temporarily from alternative sources. For earnings, we reduced our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion from a previous range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. That's down about $85 million using the midpoints of the 2 ranges. The decrease largely reflects an estimated $95 million impact from the ERP transition, a $25 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes and the impact of softer restaurant traffic trends in North America and our key international markets. We partially offset the decrease by absorbing some of the financial impact of the ERP transition as well as reducing compensation and benefit accruals. Our updated target implies adjusted EBITDA of $350 million to $375 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 9% versus the prior year quarter using the midpoint of the range. We expect higher sales and adjusted gross profit to drive the growth, partially offset by adjusted SG&A of $190 million to $195 million. With respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share, we lowered our full year target to $5.50 to $5.65. We're also updating a couple of other financial targets. We expect capital expenditures of $950 million which is the upper end of our previous range of $900 million to $950 million. We also expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 23% which is at the low end of our targeted range of 23% to 24%. Our targets for depreciation and amortization expense of $300 million and interest expense of $140 million are unchanged. Let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bernadette. With the impact of the order fulfillment issues behind us, we remain focused on serving our customers as we close out fiscal 2024. While near-term demand trends may be soft, we remain confident in the long-term growth outlook and the health of the category. And by continuing to execute our strategies, we believe that we will remain well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term. Thank you for joining us today and now we're ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : I think one of the questions I'm getting probably most this morning, frankly, separate from all things sort of ERP related, really has to do much more with your comments around slowing restaurant traffic all the time when sort of industry capacity is set to start building once again and what that could portend for pricing going forward, particularly with cost pressure not being anywhere near what it was in the last couple of years. So I guess, as a starting point, I'd really be curious to get your perspective on how you would address sort of that concern at this point. Tom Werner : Yes Andrew, thank you for the question. Certainly, the restaurant traffic trends have been soft as we stated in our comments and everybody knows we've got capacity coming on in the industry. And the thing to remember is as the capacity comes on, it's not all created equal. So the capabilities of the capacity are different. And as we have in the past, when we've had capacity coming online, we're going to be very -- we're going to manage it very closely and be -- and look at the opportunities we have in the different markets based on the capacity coming online as we have in the past. And so the difference is, obviously, the trends in the restaurant traffic are softer. We expect that to be a temporary outlier at this point. Time will tell but we'll manage the capacity coming online like we have in the past with ourselves and competitors and the category has been resilient and we remain confident and the long-term trajectory of this category which we expect to get back to 2% to 4% growth at a minimum. Andrew Lazar : And then I know there are a number of costs, right, that Lamb Weston absorbed in fiscal '24, that I don't think you would expect to necessarily repeat next year. So some of the inventory write-offs, the costs associated with, obviously, this ERP disruption and such. I mean, just back of the envelope, it would seem like, again, if it weren't for those things, maybe EBITDA would be closer to -- even closer to like $1.7 billion this year as sort of a base. And I'm just trying to get a sense if we exclude those costs, would that kind of be -- how we think about a baseline for EBITDA for '24 off of which you would expect to grow EBITDA hopefully closer to your algorithm, let's say, in fiscal '25? Or am I missing something in that sort of math? Bernadette Madarieta : Andrew, this is Bernadette. You're absolutely thinking about it correctly. We did absorb those costs and I think you would add those back as you look to fiscal '25. I think what's going to be key is we'll need to take a look at the restaurant traffic trends and impact on volume as we move forward and how that translates to fiscal '25. And we're in the process of rolling that up right now and we'll have more information when we give our outlook in July. Operator : We'll go next to Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : I wanted to unpack maybe just the underlying volume comment that you made, Bernadette. So I mean at the total company level, right, if we strip out the 8 points from ERP and there's obviously a piece that was walkaway business it seems like underlying volumes would have been down, I don't know, 4% or 5%. And that's kind of what you're extrapolating into 4Q. Just want to understand if that's kind of the logic as to how you're applying whatever the 3Q rate was forward? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So you're exactly right. It was a 16% decline in the quarter, 8 points related to the ERP transition and then the underlying volume we had expected it to improve sequentially but that the softer traffic trends that we did see, we do expect those to remain soft in Q4 of this year and that's what we're updating in our outlook. That continued softness. Peter Galbo : Okay. Got it. And I think what's implied again in the fourth quarter guidance, again just thinking about this as it starts rolling forward into next year, is that price/mix kind of steps back up at least sequentially or the contribution rate based on kind of the updated guidance? And I wasn't sure how much of that is just mix as you get back to fulfillment versus anything else that we might be considering. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, you're going to see a couple of things. Mix will be part of it. As we said, in the third quarter, we weren't able to fill a lot of those orders that are more higher margin, just given the more mixed loads and the order fulfillment issues we were having. So you will see that impact then into the fourth quarter. But there's generally a sequential change between third and fourth quarter and you'll continue to see that as you have in previous periods. Operator : We'll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I guess, first, kind of continuing on Peter's line of questioning. I want to think about the volume impact of customers who are seeking alternative sources of supply and where -- I mean, definitionally, that's market share. Now one could say that, that is temporary. But just get your perspective on your ability to get that volume and that share back? And on a related point, kind of we've talked about the headwinds from foregone volumes, from business you walked away from, kind at the time, the explanation was that you were going to be trying to backfill that with higher margin and higher mix products, does it seem like we're getting that incremental uplift on the back end? And I'm just trying to get a update on where you are with those targeted volumes and targeted customers and categories. Tom Werner : Yes, this is Tom. So a couple of things. We're getting ready to go through our contracting season as we do every year at this time. We're on the front end of it. So we have a robust plan on how we're going to work through that. And so I'm confident the team and our direct sales force and Mike Smith and his commercial leaders are focused on that. So more to come on that but it's going to take some time. It's not perfectly matched as we've stated in the past in terms of the volume, we've exited versus what we're targeting in the marketplace and we're going to do it at the right margin levels. So that's number one. Number two, this is a tough transition. There's no question about it. And it materially impacted the company and we're not happy about it. And so we have to win back the trust of a lot of -- some of our smaller customers and we're working hard to do that with our direct sales force. But it's going to take some time and that's an unfortunate thing that has happened but I'm confident we have a plan. We've got everybody activated our direct sales force, 300 salespeople on the street but it's going to take some time. And your question about -- your point about market share is absolutely true. And so we're going to have to work hard to get it back and we will. We have a resilient sales force but it's going to take some time and I'm confident that the team, we got a great plan in place but it will take some time and we're going to get there. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. And then a second question I had on capital allocation and CapEx. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for higher -- at the high end of the range on capital spend this year and that's just the timing of payments on projects. Has there been a -- with a slower demand environment in the near term, is there any thoughts about timing of capital spend in '25 and '26 as it relate to the Netherlands and Argentina facilities and how quickly those need to be brought on or how quickly upgrading of other facilities needs to happen? And should we still be thinking about CapEx in -- how should we think about CapEx in '25 given slightly higher spend this year? Tom Werner : Yes. So Adam, as we communicated in our Investor Day in October, we're going to have an elevated level this year, next year. The projects that you mentioned, those are baked and we're committed to it. And so we expect '25 will be elevated as we stated. And as we continue to evaluate the market and what's happening we'll evaluate all of our capital expenditures going forward in terms of base capital levels that are needed. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, the guidance would be consistent with what we shared at Investor Day, 12% to 13% of sales in fiscal '25. Operator : We'll go next to Tom Palmer with Citi. Tom Palmer : I wanted to follow up, I guess, a little on Peter and Adam's question, just on some of these customers. When might you have clarity whether these customers have kind of dropped you on a more sustained basis or whether you're starting to kind of win them back. Is this -- it's really going to play out over 4Q and by next quarter, we'll have real visibility over that trajectory? Or could it take even longer? Tom Werner : No. Right now, as we sit, my belief is over the next 3 to 5 months, we'll have some clarity on it. That's going to be in conjunction to a lot of the contracting that we go through with the customers this cycle. So Tom, I think we'll have good visibility by the time we get to our next call in July and we'll get some more color on it by then. Tom Palmer : Okay. And then just the mid-single-digit volume decline in 4Q. If we were to kind of break that down between industry and then versus Lamb Weston specific, I mean just any help here, I mean is it industry is a smaller piece to consider and the Lamb Weston piece is more meaningful? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. No, I would say that it's more industry is where you're going to be seeing that with the softer traffic trends. And then the other piece will be any hangover that we have from the ERP transition but definitely more traffic trends softening that's impacting that. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Robert Moskow : A few small ones. I don't know, maybe you wait a few months before you tell us this. But you said you've contracted with growers already for potatoes. I would imagine you have a volume assumption like internally related to that in terms of demand for fiscal '25. Is there anything or you can give us on how much volume you're contracting with those growers? And then secondly, you say that the ERP project is a multiyear and I guess I need to know more about it. But are there any other steps along the way that you think will possibly impact your execution with customers. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Robert. First, I'll take your last question first in terms of the ERP. The next phase of the ERP will be in North America and that will be at our plants. We will do a pilot plant first where we will test all of its capabilities before we earn the right to move to the other plants and we'll do that in waves. So we're right now in the middle of completing design build for the plants and then we'll roll that out in phases but it will have much less of an impact given our deployment strategy. Whereas this one was much larger in scope. And then as it relates to the potato crop that we contracted for 2024, yes, we do use volume estimates just like we do every year. We have taken down the number of acres that we did contract this year just given the elevated level of inventories that we're going to have at the end of this year with the excess crop. But we don't share any of the information in terms of number of acres but have taken into consideration what we're seeing from restaurant traffic trends. Robert Moskow : Okay. And maybe a follow-up to that. Just mathematically, I think you said traffic is kind of flattish at restaurants and attachment rates are still pretty good. How does that translate to a mid-single-digit volume decline? If I just qualitatively put those two numbers together, I would think volume would have held up a little bit better. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. I think from a volume perspective, our QSRs, we are seeing sequential declines in volume and that's what's driving a lot of the volume decreases that you're seeing. Robert Moskow : Sequential declines? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. Robert Moskow : Yes. Is that a year-over-year decline also? Or is it kind of... Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, it is. Absolutely, it's a year-over-year as well as sequential. We've continued to see QSR traffic decline. When we were saying about flat that was more in the Foodservice space. Robert Moskow : Foodservice. Okay, separate. Got it. Operator : We'll go next to Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Rob Dickerson : Great. Just a couple of quick ones for me. I guess, kind of more broadly speaking, kind of given the, I guess, shift in, let's say, at least the near-term traffic outlook. Is there anything broadly speaking, the kind of changes kind of everything you walked through at the Investor Day in October just regarding kind of the long-term outlook, like long-term outlook like based with 2% to 4%, you are saying, you think temporary -- I'm not sure kind of how temporary that is. But then there was also an implied margin uptick each year over the next few years. Just trying to gauge kind of all the moving pieces as we think longer term. Tom Werner : Yes, Rob, as I sit here right now, yes, we've been talking about softer traffic and that's been in the market for a while. I don't have any -- as I sit here right now, our long-term algorithm, I'm confident in. And if this is prolonged, we have certain things that we can activate to adjust the company and the footprint. But right now, we've made some investment decisions 2 years ago based on what we believe the category is going to continue to do. I believe it's going to continue to grow, even though -- we've got a softer period. And so I don't have any reason to believe that over the long term, we need to adjust our algorithm at this point. Rob Dickerson : Got it. Super. That's clear. And then just very quickly, I also think you had stated back in October, right, increasing the dividend over time but then potentially some incremental repurchase activity outside of employee option exercises. So I'm just curious, I mean we can all see clearly, stock looks a little pressured today. I'm trying to gauge your appetite on buyback potential as you think forward to the next 12 months. Tom Werner : Yes. So we're committed to the dividend. And as we evaluate our CapEx, we'll certainly take a look at our share buyback as we always do. And we'll stay committed to our dividend over time. And so yes, absolutely, based on what's going on today with our equity price, we're going to evaluate that. Operator : We'll go next to Matt Smith with Stifel. Matt Smith : When you look at the slowdown in restaurant traffic, one of the factors have been the level of pricing. We've continued to see away from home inflation moving higher. So a couple of questions here. Any thoughts on what's needed to firm traffic up? Is that consumers adjusting to inflation? Or would you expect operators to lean more heavily into value offerings and promotions related to that? One of the considerations in the past, you've talked about in periods of economic softness and pressure on QSRs, fry performance has been fairly resilient benefiting from value menus featuring fries heavily. Are you seeing that level of activity today? Tom Werner : As we sit here today, I think there's 2 things. I think the consumers has to adjust to the menu pricing in terms of the inflation. I believe we're going to start seeing more menu value meal offerings going forward to drive traffic trends. That's been typically the case in the past when things have slowed down a bit. So I think it's a combination of both going forward but it's going to take some time. Matt Smith : And then just a follow-up question on potato cost. It sounds like they're expected to be down low single digits in North America for the 2024 crop. That's one of the few instances where potato costs are actually down year-over-year. Is the pressure from the potential of lower pricing to your customers, is that offset by higher input costs across the rest of your basket? Or would you expect some pressure on your pricing going forward from lower potato costs? Tom Werner : Yes. So just to reset, even though it's down like we stated 2% to 3%. If you go back and stack it up the last 2 years, it's been up significantly. And when -- we're in the middle of rolling up our entire input basket right now for '25, as we've stated, there are commodity inflationary pressures in other areas of our input basket. So while our inflation, we don't expect it to be double digits like it has been in the last 2 to 3 years. We're still going to be dealing with some inflation at this point. I'm not going to give you a specific number, we'll talk about that in July because we're in the middle of kind of rolling up our '25 operating plan right now. Operator : we'll move next to Marc Torrente with Wells Fargo Securities. Marc Torrente : You touched on sort of the net -- on the ERP process. The recent implementation was a heavy lift. It sounds as though you are more confident in ability to limit the transition impact for the next steps. Maybe how are those next steps different and some of the learnings you have gained from the recent transition? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, sure. So some of the next steps are different in that we're able to go live at one plant and isolate and therefore, limiting the impact, whereas with all of the central systems that were affecting customer ordering, inventory management and others this time that was more difficult. I think that as we've shared from an inventory visibility perspective and lessons learned, there's always more things that you're going to be able to do in terms of change management and other things. And those are the things that we will continue to focus on as we move forward into our plant phases. Marc Torrente : Okay. And then in the third quarter due to the transition, as fulfillment normalizes, how should we think about, I guess, price/mix trends flowing through the next several quarters, considering both wraparound pricing, potentially more muted new pricing and then actual underlying mix? And how much of a contributor will be that underlying mix going forward? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So as it relates to mix, we talked about the impact in fourth quarter and coming off of the ERP transition. As we go to fiscal '25, we will continue to see more favorable mix impact as we bring on our new capacity in American Falls, for example, where we are able to offer more premium products. So those are some of the things that you'll see by way of changes in mix. And then next year, we won't be lapping some of those lower-margin exits that we had made in fiscal '23. Operator : We'll go next to Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Max Gumport : Turning back to the comments on slower restaurant traffic trends and your expectation that they'll be temporary in nature. I'm just curious what type of visibility you have right now that's giving you the confidence in seeing some improvement in restaurant trends in the horizon. I know you talked about the impact of the higher menu prices and how consumers will adjust to that eventually. But just curious what's impacting that confidence? And any sort of sense of time line for how we can see it play out? Tom Werner : Yes. So number one, we got the fry attachment rate has stayed pretty consistent. It's been above historical levels for the past 2, 3 years. So that's one thing. The other thing that we monitor continually is restaurant traffic every month that we look at and while it's been slowing recently, as we've discussed on the call, we believe based on kind of how we model some things that we expect that to -- the consumer to get adjusted to the inflationary menu pricing and we expect that to return here going forward. So it's not a perfect, linear assumption that we're making but overtime we think it's going to return back to in-store restaurant business. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. And the only other thing that I'd comment on that, we've talked a lot about in the past is related to French fries and the fact that they are one of the highest margin items on restaurant menus. And we will likely then continue to see pushing towards those types of products by the restaurants. Max Gumport : Got it. And then turning back to the sort of the backfilling of the contracts that you exit in '23, it feels like it's been pushed off a bit, right, given the ERP transition. But I'm just curious because right now, I feel like you're going to be trying to maintain relationships with customers that were impacted by the ERP transition. So how far that has your ability to start to make progress on backfilling some of those contracts you exited with higher margin business has been pushed, is that more of a middle of '25-type event now? I'll leave it there. Tom Werner : Yes. So we're on the front end of a lot of our contracting with customers right now, as I stated earlier and we've got a plan put together as we start thinking about FY '25 and targeted customers and rebuilding the relationships with some of the customers that we impacted, unfortunately, with our ERP situation. And it's going to take the next several months to work through all that. But I expect as our team will recapture that business will be targeted in our approach to that. And so it's going to take some time to rebuild those relationships. And we're going to be mindful as we always are at this time of year as we talk to our customers that we're contracting with on the opportunities that we feel we need to target and go after. Operator : We'll go next to William Reuter with Bank of America. William Reuter : I just have two. The first is, at this point, are there any orders that continue to be delayed? I just wanted to put a finer point on that. Bernadette Madarieta : We're back to our previous order fulfillment rates. William Reuter : Okay. Good to hear. And then the second, given your early conversations with customers and the fact that you are in the midst of contract negotiations, have you gotten any sense that customers are leaning on you more than they would have in the past based upon the recent challenges that existed? Tom Werner : No, I don't -- we don't have any -- from a customer standpoint, we were communicating well with them. With the challenges we had, a lot of our bigger customers, we made sure they understood all the things we're going through. So generally, they didn't like it but they understood. But there's no fallout from a lot of our bigger customers as we went through this. And we did our best to protect everybody as we could. William Reuter : Got it. And actually, I have one more. I think the ERP implementation that's going on right now is just in North America and that you'll be doing it in international regions in the future. Is that right? Bernadette Madarieta : That's correct. So we did the central systems in North America. The next phase will be plant in North America. And then after that, we will go international. Operator : We'll go next to Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Carla Casella : In the past, you've talked about M&A and internationally. Is that all kind of off the table for now until you get the ERP system done? Or are you still looking at opportunities? And can you just talk about what you're seeing in the market? Tom Werner : Yes, it's not off the table. And I've been pretty clear on this that we're always continuing to evaluate international acquisition opportunities, certainly, the timing of those depends on -- it depends on the other side of the table, so to speak. So you can't always time these perfectly and we'll continue to evaluate it. And if something presents itself, based on what's going on today, we're going to continue to move forward. But we've got to be mindful about what's going on in the organization. But you can't predict when these things are going to happen, we have a sense of it but we're absolutely going to continue to pursue those. Carla Casella : And has the market -- I mean, given the kind of softness in the QSR today internationally, is the market opening up more? Are there more -- are you getting more looks in the past? Anything you can give us on the market? Tom Werner : Yes. I mean I'm not going to get into a lot of specifics on that question obviously. But the thing to remember is, we have a belief in the long-term resilience of this category and have. And yes, we're dealing with some softness right now, we believe the category is going to return globally. And we're seeing some pockets of international markets that are performing well, as I stated in my prepared remarks. So over the long term, if something presents itself, we're absolutely going to evaluate it. Operator : With no additional questions in queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Hi, this is Dexter. If you have any follow-up questions or like to schedule a call, please send me an e-mail and we can do so. Other than that, have a good day and thanks for joining the call. Operator : That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our strategies and priorities for the upcoming year, the current operating environment, and our initial thoughts on this year's potato crop. Bernadette will then provide details on our fourth quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal '25. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the year are disappointing, reflecting executional challenges both commercially and in our supply chain as well as soft global demand for fries. While Bernadette will cover our fourth quarter results in more detail later, our sales and earnings performance fell well short of our targets due to a combination of targeted investments in price, a decision to voluntarily withdraw our product to ensure we meet our quality standards and more importantly, those of our customers, higher than anticipated market share losses, an unfavorable mix and softer than expected restaurant traffic trends in both the U.S. and many of our key international markets. This level of execution is unacceptable and I and my leadership team take full responsibility for our operating and financial results. As we outlined in our Investor Day last October, we believe that frozen potatoes is an attractive growing global category and that we have built a solid foundation to serve our customers in this market over the long term. This includes some key actions taken in fiscal 2024 such as integrating the acquisition of our former European joint venture, starting up state of the art processing facilities in China in October 2023 and American Falls, Idaho in May of 2024, strengthening our product portfolio by introducing innovative technologies to expand our total addressable market, implementing pricing actions that offset multiple years of high input cost inflation, taking a big step in upgrading our IT infrastructure by cutting over key central systems processes in North America to a new ERP system and continuing to drive supply chain productivity savings across our global production network. We believe we're focused on the right strategies and priorities to get Lamb Weston back on track to drive sales growth, reduce costs, improve profitability and generate attractive returns over the long term. That said, the operating environment has changed rapidly during fiscal 2024 as global restaurant traffic and frozen potato demand softened. In fact, the downward traffic trends accelerated during the back half of the year and into early fiscal 2025. This has led to an increase in available industry capacity in North America and Europe. We believe this industry supply/demand imbalance will persist through much, if not all, of fiscal 2025. Although this has no impact on our long-term strategies, we are making some operating adjustments in the near term to support improved execution, competitiveness in our financial results. We are reinvigorating volume growth by matching the right product at the right price to fit customer needs and by also leveraging limited time offerings and innovation to help our customers drive traffic. We're targeting specific investments in price and trade support to protect share and win new business. We're aggressively looking at opportunities to reduce costs further by driving supply chain productivity and tightly managing operating expenses. We're leveraging recent capacity investments to increase flexibility in managing our manufacturing footprint to balance production and shipments. We're reshaping future investments to modernize production capabilities to better match the demand environment. And we're simplifying our key processes to make it easier for customers to do business with Lamb Weston. These priorities will change how we expect to drive sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2025. Specifically, our sales growth will be largely volume-driven unlike the price-driven top line that we've delivered in recent years. Overall, we expect the net impact of our inflation-driven pricing actions in the aggregate will have minimal contribution to our net sales as we employ targeted investments in price to support volume growth. As a result, we expect our earnings performance will be driven by a combination of volume growth, improved mix and cost savings. In recent years, our earnings growth has been largely driven by price and to a lesser extent mix. Our expectation for volume growth is dependent in part on an improvement in restaurant traffic trends. According to restaurant industry data providers, U.S. restaurant traffic softened over the past year as consumers continue to adjust to the cumulative effect of menu price inflation. During our fiscal fourth quarter, overall U.S. restaurant traffic as well as QSR traffic was down about 3% versus the prior year. Traffic at QSR chains specializing in hamburger, a highly important channel for fry consumption, was down more than 4%. In addition, traffic trends in QSR hamburger weakened sequentially each month of the quarter, with May down nearly 6%. However, we're encouraged that the QSR chains, including QSR hamburger chains, have increased promotional activities to drive restaurant traffic. Given the recent introduction, we believe these promotions did not affect traffic during our fiscal fourth quarter and we have not yet received comprehensive data that would indicate a more recent benefit on traffic. But we expect that these promotional efforts will have a positive effect on traffic as they have done so in the past. Outside the U.S., overall restaurant traffic trends in our key international markets in the fourth quarter were generally consistent with what we observed in the third quarter. Overall traffic was up in France and Italy, down modestly in Germany and Spain, and down about 2% in the UK, our largest market in Europe. In Asia, overall restaurant traffic grew in both China and Japan. While global restaurant traffic trends were mixed, fry attachment rates in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China were largely steady. With our key international markets largely stable and the potential for a tailwind from promotional activity in the U.S., we believe the pressure on restaurant traffic and demand is temporary and remain confident that the global fry category will return to its historical growth rate as consumers continue to adjust to higher menu prices. Nonetheless, we've taken a cautious view of the consumer and have not incorporated any change to current trends in our fiscal 2025 outlook. As a result, we expect our volume to decline during the first half of fiscal 2025. Turning now to the upcoming potato crop. We're harvesting and processing the early potato varieties in North America, and initial indications are that this portion of the crop is consistent with historical averages. At this time, the potato crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest that will be harvested in the fall appear to be largely in line with historical averages as growing conditions in these regions have been generally favorable. That said, we have not yet seen what impact, if any, the recent heat wave may have on the crop. As a reminder, in North America, we've agreed to a 3% decrease in aggregate in contract prices for the 2024 potato crop and we would begin to realize the benefit of these lower potato prices beginning in our fiscal third quarter. In Europe, heavy rainfall in the spring in the industry's main growing region in the Netherlands, Belgium, northern France and northern Germany delayed the completion of planning by about seven weeks. As a result, the futures index for European processing potatoes has climbed significantly, reflecting the market's expectation for a below-average crop. Based on our practice of purchasing a higher portion of our raw potatoes using fixed price contracts, we believe our exposure to the higher market price is less than that of our European competitors. Still, we expect our potato costs in Europe to increase as prices governed under fixed price contracts are up mid to high single digits. We'll provide more detail on the crops in both North America and Europe when we report our first quarter results in early October, in line with our past practice. So in summary, we believe we've built a solid foundation to support our customers and drive improvement in our financial performance. We continue to operate and invest in this business for the long term and are making the appropriate adjustments this year to manage through the current challenging environment. We're encouraged by the actions that chain restaurants are taking to improve restaurant traffic as well as the traffic trends in most of our key international markets, but we took a cautious view on the consumer when we developed this year's financial targets. And finally, at this time, we expect the potato crop in North America will be consistent with historical averages, but that the crop in Europe will likely be below average. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette for a more detailed discussion of our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2025 outlook. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our sales and earnings performance fell well short of our targets. Our team members are focused on getting our operations and financial results back on track in fiscal 2025. Before I provide our outlook for the upcoming year, let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter results. Sales declined $83 million or 5% to more than $1.61 billion. Volume declined 8% and price/mix increased 3%. As it relates to volume, nearly 5 percentage points of the decline reflects the impact of share losses, as well as our decision to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in EMEA earlier in the year. The decline is a couple of points more than what we originally anticipated and was driven in part by higher-than-estimated share losses. With respect to the ERP transition, the issues we experienced that affected our third quarter order fill rates were temporary and contained in that quarter. We have healthy warehouse inventory levels and flows throughout the system. The remaining 3 points of the 8-point volume decline reflected about 1 point loss related to the unexpected voluntary product withdrawal that Tom referenced and about 2 points related to soft restaurant traffic trends in North America and many of our key international markets, which was a bit more than we had expected. Price/mix increased 3%, reflecting the carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in late fiscal 2023 as well as pricing actions taken in fiscal 2024 across both of our business segments. The increase in price/mix, however, was a few points below our expectations. This was largely due to unfavorable mix versus our forecast as customer demand for value-based products increased, as well as targeted investments in price in North America. Moving on from sales, our adjusted gross profit declined $72 million to $363 million about $40 million of that decline was due to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remaining $32 million was primarily driven by lower volume and an $8 million increase in depreciation expense associated with our capacity expansions in China and Idaho. The carryover benefit of our pricing actions largely offset higher manufacturing costs, which was primarily driven by mid-single-digit input cost inflation. Our gross margin in the quarter was about 23%, which was about 400 basis points below our target of 27%. Of the shortfall, about 250 basis points was related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remaining roughly 150 basis points largely reflected the unfavorable mix impact from greater-than-expected share losses of higher-priced, higher-margin customers, as well as the investments in price that we made in our North America segment. Adjusted SG&A declined $6 million to $172 million reflecting lower performance-based compensation expense, which more than offset higher expenses associated with information technology investments. Higher advertising and promotion investments to support the launch of retail products in EMEA and $6 million of incremental noncash amortization related to our new ERP system. Our SG&A in the quarter was about $20 million below the midpoint of our fourth quarter target of approximately $193 million largely due to lower performance-based compensation expense and other cost savings efforts. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA of $283 million, which is down $50 million versus the prior year as lower sales and gross profit more than offset the decline in SG&A, that's about $80 million below the midpoint of our fourth quarter EBITDA target of approximately $363 million. About half of that shortfall is due to the voluntary product withdrawal late in the quarter. The other half is due largely to targeted investments in price and trade support in our North America segment, unfavorable mix and lower-than-expected volume, partially offset by favorable SG&A compared with our forecast. Moving to our segments. Compared with the year ago period, sales in our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the US, Canada, and Mexico, declined $47 million or 4% in the quarter. Volume declined 7% with about 5 points related to share losses and about 2% related to soft restaurant traffic in the US. Price/mix increased 3%, driven by the carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in late 2023, as well as pricing actions for contracts with large and regional chain restaurant customers taken in fiscal 2024. Unfavorable mix due to share losses of higher-margin customers, as well as targeted investments in price tempered the increase in price/mix. The North America segment's adjusted EBITDA declined $21 million or 7% to $277 million primarily due to an approximately $19 million charge related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remainder largely reflects a combination of lower sales volumes, unfavorable mix and higher cost per pound more than offsetting the benefit of prior pricing actions. Sales in our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America declined $36 million or 7%. Volume declined 9% with nearly 5 percentage points from share losses, which are due in part to decisions to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in EMEA earlier in the year. We expect these strategic exits will continue to be a headwind through the first half of fiscal 2025. More than 2 points of the volume decline in the quarter reflects the voluntary product withdrawal, while the remaining roughly 2 points reflected soft restaurant traffic trends in key international markets. Price/mix increased 2%, driven primarily by inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023, as well as the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken earlier in fiscal 2024. Our International segment's adjusted EBITDA declined $43 million or 52% to $40 million about $21 million of that decline related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remainder of that decline was driven by lower sales volume, higher cost per pound and higher advertising and promotional investments to support the launch of retail products in EMEA and was partially offset by the benefit of prior pricing actions. Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow, our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with net debt leverage ratio of 2.7x adjusted EBITDA and our net debt declined nearly $40 million as compared to the end of our fiscal third quarter to about $3.75 billion. We continue to have ample liquidity, including nearly $1.2 billion available for a new global revolving credit facility. For the year, we generated about $800 million of cash from operations, which is up about $37 million versus the prior year. As we discussed before, driving long-term growth requires making the right, strategic and forward-looking investments. The resilience of our business and our overall financial strength put us in the ideal position to modernize our assets, as well as to invest in critical areas that support customer needs and unlock efficiencies for our people and our business. This allowed us to spend about $990 million in capital expenditures this year or about $255 million more than the prior year, largely reflecting strategic investments, to complete facilities in China and American Falls, Idaho. Our ongoing capacity expansion projects in the Netherlands and Argentina, and our new ERP system. Finally, consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we returned $384 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the year. This includes $210 million in share repurchases, including $60 million in the fourth quarter and $174 million in dividends. This reflects the strength of our balance sheet and our confidence in our business. Now turning to our fiscal 2025 outlook. As Tom discussed, we expect that the operating environment this year will be challenging and that consumers will continue to be more intentional with the dollars they spend in a pressured economic landscape. We expect that soft restaurant traffic and fry demand may result in higher-than-normal available industry capacity for selected product types and channels in fiscal 2025 and that we will make some targeted investments in price and trade to support volume growth and share. In addition, we're aggressively evaluating opportunities and implementing actions to drive supply chain productivity balanced production based on lower shipments, and reduced operating expenses. Specifically for the year, we're targeting sales of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion on a constant currency basis. This implies growth of 2% to 5%, which we expect will be driven largely by volume. However, we anticipate that volume will decline during the first half of the year, primarily due to two factors : first, we'll continue to experience the impact of recent share losses. And second, despite efforts by quick service and casual dining chains to improve traffic through increased promotional activity, we expect that restaurant traffic will remain soft for at least the first half of the year as the consumer continues to adjust to the cumulative impact of years of menu price inflation as well as other economic headwinds. During the second half of the year, we expect our volume to increase as we lap the prior year impacts of the ERP transition and voluntary product withdrawal, increasingly benefit from recent customer contract wins in the U.S. and key international markets, and recapture some of the market share we lost in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, we don't expect a meaningful contribution to come from price/mix in the aggregate. In North America, we're targeting price/mix to decline. We expect to drive improvements in mix as the year progresses as we recapture lost share in higher-priced, higher-margin channels. However, due to the soft demand environment, we believe the mix benefits will be more than offset by targeted investments in price and trade support to drive volume growth and share growth across the sales channels. In international, when possible under the terms of the customer contracts, we'll look to drive pricing actions to offset input cost inflation, which we anticipate will be largely driven by a below-average crop in Europe. In addition, we'll begin to gradually leverage our revenue growth management tools to manage our price architectures and improve mix. However, we anticipate that the increase in price/mix may be tempered by targeted investments in price and trade support in certain markets and channels to protect market share and win new business. For earnings, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.38 billion to $1.48 billion. For diluted earnings per share, we're targeting $4.35 to $4.85. This includes an adjusted SG&A target of $740 million to $750 million which is up $70 million versus the prior year, reflecting returning performance-based compensation expense back to targeted levels, an incremental $24 million of noncash amortization related to our new ERP system and an incremental $10 million of advertising and promotional investments largely to support our retail brands in both North America and EMEA. Excluding these three items, our adjusted SG&A expenses are down due to aggressive cost management. As I previously discussed, we're continuing to evaluate and implement additional cost savings actions. We're targeting total depreciation and amortization expense of $375 million, which is an increase of $75 million about $50 million of the increase is included in cost of sales and largely associated with the depreciation of the capacity expansions in China, Idaho, and the Netherlands. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the incremental amortization of our ERP system, which is recorded in SG&A. For interest expense, we're forecasting about $180 million, that's an increase of about $45 million, reflecting higher average debt levels and lower capitalized interest. We're forecasting a full year effective tax rate of approximately 24%, which is similar to last year's rate. Finally, we're targeting cash use for capital expenditures of approximately $850 million as we continue the construction of our previously announced capacity expansion efforts in the Netherlands and Argentina. We currently expect the expansion in the Netherlands to be completed by the end of calendar 2024, while Argentina is targeted to be operational in mid-calendar 2025. In addition, as Tom mentioned, we're looking at rephasing future capital investments to modernize production capabilities to better match the demand environment. That said, more than 80% of this year's forecasted capital expenditures are committed. Since we anticipate our two large capacity expansions will be completed by the end of fiscal 2025, we expect a notable decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2026. Because of the rapid change in the operating environment our fiscal 2025 growth rates are below our normalized fiscal 2024 baseline. As it relates to sales, our fiscal 2025 outlook implies a normalized growth rate of 0% to 3% after adjusting for the estimated impact of the ERP transition in fiscal 2024. That growth rate is at the low end of our long-term growth algorithm of low to mid-single digits. Our adjusted EBITDA target for fiscal 2025 is about $160 million, below our normalized fiscal 2024 baseline of about $1.6 billion. Broadly speaking, that decline reflects targeted investments in price and trade support to retain or win new customers, challenges in certain markets and channels to implement sufficient pricing to offset input cost inflation, an estimated carryover impact of unfavorable mix from lost share of higher-priced, higher-margin customers in North America and an additional estimated $20 million to $30 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 associated with the voluntary product withdrawal. Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I want to provide some thoughts on the first quarter. While we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, given our recent results, the expected headwinds and the changes in the operating environment, we're providing more detail on our expectations for the quarter. Specifically in the first quarter, we're targeting sales to be down mid- to high single digits, with volume down mid-single digits due to the carryover impact of share losses, soft restaurant traffic, and the voluntary product withdrawal. We believe that the impact of share losses and soft traffic will be the greatest in the first quarter and gradually ease as the year progresses. We expect price mix may be down low to mid-single digits as the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in fiscal 2024 are more than offset by the impact of unfavorable mix and targeted investments in price and trade support in North America. For earnings, we expect our EBITDA margin to be the lowest of the year due to our typical seasonality and the $20 million to $30 million loss estimated to be associated with the voluntary product withdrawal that I mentioned earlier. We do not expect additional losses related to the product withdrawal beyond the first quarter. We also expect our first quarter margin will be pressured by higher cost per pound, unfavorable mix, and investments in price and trade support. Let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bernadette. We expect fiscal 2025 to be a challenging year but remain confident in the long-term growth outlook and the health of the category. Despite the current market softness, we're executing on our priorities that drive our long-term strategy. We're aggressively managing costs and evaluating our manufacturing network requirements as demand trends unfold. Our capacity expansion projects remain on schedule as we continue to modernize our production assets, which when combined with improving our core asset performance, positions us to continue to support our customers and create value for our shareholders over the long term. Thank you for joining our call today and now we're ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thank so much. Good morning, everybody. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Tom Werner : Good morning. Andrew Lazar : Good morning. I'd love to start, you obviously talked a bit in the remarks and in the release about the sort of building supply-demand imbalance in the industry. And I'd love to get, I guess, as specific as you can. An idea about, where do you see Lamb Weston's capacity utilization sort of right now? And how does that compare to sort of the industry? And I'm trying to sort of get a sense of or dimensionalize how large this sort of imbalance is, and whether it's large enough such that some of the more maybe major customers can make shifts in their mix of suppliers, or if these share losses are maybe some smaller customers, some of the things you talked about last quarter with respect to some of the ERP disruption? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. Thank you, Andrew. As it relates to our current capacity utilization rate, that's not a number we want to provide right now. We've got two new facilities that are becoming operational and we'll have available capacity. China has been operational and through the vertical start-up, and then American Falls came on at the end of May and is going through its vertical start-up as well during the next few months, and we're looking to gradually ramp that up. So we want to get those plants filled up on a run rate basis over the next 18 months, but the current demand environment will likely stretch that out a bit. As it relates to some of the higher-margin customers and the share losses that we referred to, some of those are the customers during the ERP transition that we would have lost during that time. And our sales teams are certainly out there and talking to those customers. It's a competitive environment, though, as we've discussed, with some of the incremental supply and the softening restaurant traffic trends. So we continue to keep focus on that. Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew. And the other dynamic we're managing through is the restaurant traffic, particularly in the QSRs, which is 80% of French fry consumption. As I stated earlier, in Q4, we saw a continued deceleration of traffic. So as you -- as we manage through our overall capacity and production, continued softness across our entire customer base is leading to a more challenging environment in terms of contracting than we've ever experienced. Andrew Lazar : Got it. And I think that was kind of where I was going to go next. You talk about the need for some, obviously, pricing concessions and targeted investments and such. Is that again, to maybe start gaining back some of these lost smaller sort of customers? Or I guess, you sort of touched on this a minute ago, but does that also relate to maybe some of the conversations and negotiations you've been having over the course of the summer with some of the larger customers for some of the annual or every other year sort of contract renewal processes? Is there -- I guess, is there some potential pressure coming there? Because I guess, historically by precedent any way, right, the industry hasn't had to sort of deal with that as utilization has always been so high. Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew, I'm not going to comment on our contracting because we're in the middle of it right now. But what I will say is with the challenges we had in our Q3 implementation, that over-indexed impacting are the independent restaurants and so we're working really hard to regain those customers. That's been a significant part of our share loss. And with that, plus you add on the restaurant traffic challenges, which is leading to industry capacity availability, we're going to have to make some and we're making some strategic choices to invest back with those customers and win their business back and their trust. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. And Andrew the only thing -- go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Keep going. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. The only other thing that I just wanted to mention is that over the long term, we still expect the market is going to be generally balanced. We have confidence in the continued category and absorbing the potential new capacity over time. But this is a short-term area with the softer restaurant traffic and some of the things that we're seeing that we're going to need to manage through this year. Andrew Lazar : And the last quick thing would be, just in light of that, I think you talked about some operational adjustments that you're making. And I know it's hard to talk about some of this, but does that -- you've got some facilities that are obviously coming online, very new, very efficient. Others that are some 40, 50 years old. Are we in a position where you start to go down that sort of plan B path a little bit and maybe say, there might be some sort of rightsizing of capacity that might make sense here and if so, do you see competitors doing the same thing? Tom Werner : Yes, Andrew, I'm not going to comment on kind of what you're pointing to. What I will say is we're evaluating a number of different things across the entire -- every part of the company right now to manage our costs based on the current operating conditions we're experiencing and what we expect over the next 12 months. So I'll just -- I'll leave it at that. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open, please go ahead. Ken Goldman : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Tom Werner : Good morning. Bernadette Madarieta : Hi, Ken. Ken Goldman : Hi. I wanted to start, one of the questions that I've received this morning are -- is as we think that this management team, given the challenges that they faced the last couple of quarters, are they being a little more conservative or prudent than usual with certain items, certain areas of guidance where they otherwise might not have been? So I just -- I wanted to put that back to you a little bit. Are there certain areas, as you thought about the outlook for 2025 or maybe you were a little more cautious than you otherwise might have been? Just trying to get a sense for that kind of give and take. Tom Werner : Yes, Ken. We're always prudent in our guidance and have been over time. I think the thing that we're cautious about, as we've said, is the whole restaurant traffic phenomenon that we're dealing with in terms of, we've seen traffic trends negative before but we've never seen traffic trends in restaurant collectively this prolonged. And as I stated, in the fourth quarter, we saw it accelerate, and even starting out in our fiscal 2025, we continue to see declines. So when we kind of look through how this year is going to unfold, our guidance for 2025, we absolutely took a cautious view. And as we get through the next couple of quarters, just like everybody, we'll have a clear view on return. We think it's going to return. It always has in the past. But again, this is kind of uncharted territory for us to see a decline for this prolonged amount of time. Ken Goldman : Understood. Thank you for that. And then a quick follow-up. I just wanted to get a little more color, if I could, on the voluntary product withdrawal. I appreciate the details you've provided about the financial impact in the fourth quarter and then into the first quarter of next year. I'm just curious a little bit more about it. Also interested in why it only affects two quarters and then seems to stop after the first quarter in terms of the impact on the bottom line? Thank you. Tom Werner : Yes, Ken. Again, this is a product withdrawal that we chose to do. It's not lost on me and my team on the financial impact. But in terms of keeping to our values of integrity and responding to our customers and keeping the specifications of the product at high levels, we chose to do it and it was the right thing to do and I'd do it all over again. And I know it has a tremendous financial impact on the company. And so I'm not going to get into customer specific. We've made some adjustments internally on a number of different fronts to -- as we made decisions to do this. So we've adjusted the organization and we're 100% confident that those changes are going to continue to keep the integrity of our product quality going forward. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, that's right. And the other thing that I would add is to your question in terms of why does it affect Q4 and Q1 and stop there. So we identified it soon after the end of the fourth quarter. And that's when we made the withdrawal from the market after discovering that it didn't meet our specs and so it does impact both fourth quarter and first quarter where we wrote off the remaining inventory that was on hand. Ken Goldman : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tom maybe just to start and this probably goes back to Andrew's comment around reinvestment in price. I mean, historically, this has been an industry certainly since you've been public, but probably even going back much further than that, that hasn't really given back anything or had to reinvest materially on pricing. And I think that comment probably ties all the way back to the early 1990s. So if you're breaking a 30-year cycle, just curious like we're into uncharted territories, what does it mean for your ability to price not just for long term, given what happened the last time this industry went through that? And maybe there's a more recent example to point to, but I think that context would be very helpful? Tom Werner : Yes, a couple of things. Again, the operating environment and coupled with some of the share losses we've had, the operating environment right now, there's available capacity. And so yes we're making targeted investments in price in some areas to gain our share back. And we believe over the long term as the restaurant traffic and the category returns to a more normalized growth rate everything is going to be balanced out, but in the current environment again the traffic trends we've experienced really over the last year is really impacting the overall demand architecture of the category. And you have obviously additional supply coming on. So we're managing the dynamic of the operating environment, we're working in right now. And we believe and confident over the long term that as category returns to growth it will all balance back out and have a more normalized operating environment. Peter Galbo : Okay. And then just like on the CapEx number Bernadette I think you gave the comment of 80% of it is kind of spoken for this year, but like two projects are -- projects that aren't fully completed. So I know Tom you don't want to talk about existing capacity, but you have capacity that isn't even live like why not delay it further? Why not kick it out more? Do you have to go through the process of it? Because I mean it's going to continue probably to be an overhang year. And then I mean, I know you're talking about a material step down in '26, but any more quantification you can put around that what material is would be helpful? Tom Werner : Yes. So the capacity expansions we have going on we made those decisions a couple of years ago and you have to commit to your suppliers. We're three quarters of the way built and so it would be more costly not to complete. And so we've got -- we're at a point where we need to finish it. And again we'll evaluate. We're looking at all areas of the company to evaluate overall capacity in our footprint . Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. The long-term fundamentals of this business are still there and on track and we're investing for the long term. And as Tom said we make those decisions in advance of knowing in the short term when restaurant traffic trends may soften, but we believe with the capabilities and in the markets that we are adding these expansions that they're going to be able to improve the asset modernization of our total footprint. Peter Galbo : Okay. But Bernadette just on the longer-term CapEx, like is 500 million the right number, 400 million like the 9% of sales number you gave at Investor Day in October doesn't seem to be relevant anymore. So just like what's the right range? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. At this point, I would just say you're going to see a notable decrease in 2026. We are rephasing our capital investments as I mentioned and taking a look at what capabilities we don't believe we need immediately. And so when we have that update we'll certainly provide it at that time but a notable decrease in 2026. Peter Galbo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Tom Palmer with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : Good morning and thanks for your question. I just -- first wanted to start out kind of understanding some of the moving parts of guidance because it seems like the primary driver of the expected volume growth is market share gains in the second half of the year. And so I wanted to kind of clarify two parts of this. So first how much of these share gains have already been secured by the recent customer contract wins referenced on the earnings call? And then look, I know pricing is maybe a bigger factor than in the past. Are there other factors that remain important as we think about driving those share gains in the back half of the year above and beyond pricing? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. No, thanks for the question, Tom. As it relates to the share gains in the second half of the year, some of those have already been committed and we know that we will be seeing those in the second half. There are those that we're currently in negotiation with and certainly not going to speak to that. But that is the rationale for those share gains that are coming. We've got a strong sales pipeline that we are currently working through and have those identified targets as it relates to the share gains. The other piece that is impacting our guidance would be changes in mix. As we talked about we had in the back half of this year some changes in mix with those small regional customers in our North America segment. That would be regaining share of those higher mix customers. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you for that. And then just on the North America crop if it comes in as expected, how does your contracted volume of potatoes compare to your current volume assumptions? We did see the write-downs this past year. I just wanted to understand if that was a possibility this year just at least based on your current volume expectations? Tom Werner : Yes, Tom. So we contract our potato crop based on our forecasted volume and that's always done about 18 -- almost 18 to 20 months in advance with our negotiations with the contract volume and rates. So we always take a prudent approach and obviously last year we had an issue based on our forecast plan versus as we started going through the year, we realized we're going to come up short. So right now I think we're pretty balanced, but we'll manage it as we go through the balance of this fiscal year. Bernadette Madarieta : And particularly when we give our updated view of the crop in the first quarter as we typically do. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to tie together some of the different threads around some of the strategic kind of product exits that you've made over the past 18 months really between North America and International kind of the capacity investments that are ongoing and this discussion about phasing kind of future investments back into the business. And I guess I'm trying to just make sense of is some of the business that you're going back after now really reclaiming what had been perceived as lower margin, less attractive books business before? And if I think about the market environment which has weakened from a traffic perspective, what would it -- what would have to happen for you to reassess your own internal capacity needs to actually make some tougher decisions around kind of your own internal network and closing kind of old capacity versus refurbishing it down the road? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. Thank you for the question. As it relates to the strategic exits that we've spoken about in the last year, if you recall, that primarily related to four customers in North America. And those strategic exits were made at a time when we were significantly capacity constrained and they made sense for the business at that time. Now going into softer restaurant traffic trends and incremental capacity coming online, we will continue to take a look at our sales pipeline and our portfolio. And in the current environment, which has changed from when we made those strategic exits, we've determined that it makes sense to make some price investments. And so that's what you're seeing in the current environment. Adam Samuelson : And how that would influence -- what would have to happen from here for you to make an assessment to idle or close older processing facilities versus further investing in them in '26 and beyond? Tom Werner : Yes. So, Adam, like we stated, we're phasing some investments out further in terms of, normalized CapEx outside of the new capacity coming on. So we've made those adjustments as we continue to -- as I stated, as we continue, we're evaluating all areas of our company. And we continue to see traffic softness. We're definitely going to think through our overall asset utilization rates and how we adjust that. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And if I can just squeeze one more in. The International segment, I know there was the discrete impact of the product withdrawal. Even adjusting for that, the margins were pretty notably below where they've been for the past four quarters since you consolidated EMEA, and that business did not have the same amount of impact from the ERP disruption. So just help us think about how the -- where the EBITDA margins in International are low double digits adjusted for that product withdrawal in the fourth quarter and where they go from here? Especially with more potato inflation in Europe over the next 12 months. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, as it relates to margins in the International segment it was as you say, affected by the product withdrawal. The other thing that we have there is we're seeing a competitive environment in international markets, similar to what we've explained in North America and there will be some price investments where it makes sense. As it relates to the poor crop, those are things that we always look to, to pass through that price inflation. But as we mentioned, we do have a pretty good mix of fixed pricing as it relates to that crop in Europe and then any delta between that is where we'll look to price through that incremental cost. Adam Samuelson : All right. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Your line is open, please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, thank you. I just want to try to reconcile the mismatch, I guess of a volume forecast that looks to be up like 2% to 5% and maybe even more if price/mix is negative, with a contracting environment that you're describing as the most challenging ever and market share losses that got worse in fourth quarter. So maybe really the question is, like if the market share losses got worse during the fourth quarter, how easy is it to reverse those losses? And what was causing those losses? Are customers upset with customer service from ERP? Or is it really just, hey, competitors are offering better prices, we're going to go there and now Lamb Weston has to react? Is it possible to simplify it that way? Tom Werner : Yes. I'd, Robert, say it's a little bit of both, quite frankly. And the -- our commercial team, we've got visibility to a pipeline of opportunities that we're executing against every week. And so we have line of sight to regaining volume, but the environment is different. And so we're making the appropriate adjustments. But to be quite frank, it's a little bit of both. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. And keep in mind, the volume in the first half is expected to decline due to the impact of the share losses in that weak global restaurant environment that we've been talking about. It's the back half where we expect to see those volume increases. Tom Werner : And we're seeing wins in the marketplace today so that gives me confidence that, yes, we'll navigate through the next -- the first half of this fiscal year, but we expect sequential improvement in the back half. Robert Moskow : Okay, I\u2019ll stop here. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. I guess just first question on the price and the trade investment going in. Are you saying that as you go into price negotiations overall on a contracted basis, clearly, that's maybe become a little bit more competitive, are there any other one-off investments that you would also be doing away from the contracted prices? Like let's say, if you contracted with someone last year, maybe it's a two-year contract, but their volumes and traffic are a little soft. Like are you actually funding maybe some of those customer-related promotions as well? First question. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. So we're not going to get into specifics about our experience competing in the current operating environment. We've got a number of contracts that are currently underway that we're negotiating, so we're not going to get into the details of those. Rob Dickerson : Okay. And then I guess, Tom, I think you called out specifically a little deceleration or kind of incremental decline in traffic as you got through May. Is there any visibility, let's say, more specifically on June? And then just like any kind of early reads? I know it's like super early from some of these new value offerings. Dexter Congbalay : Rob, if you looked at, May was a lower point, June recovered a little bit but was still down a pretty strong amount, but it was a little bit better than May. If you look at the entire fourth quarter, June was basically in line with that. So the trend, I would sit there and say nothing significant in terms of a change. With respect to the promo activity, we haven't really seen -- a lot of that started towards the end of June, so I wouldn't sit there and say there's really good clean data on that yet. Rob Dickerson : And then just lastly, kind of a pedicle question. On the share repo, clearly bought some stock back, which is great. But I'm just kind of curious as you were headed into today's print, you probably thought maybe the stock could be down a little bit. Why not just buy stock back like tomorrow versus in the fourth quarter? That's it. Thanks. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. When we make decisions on share repurchases, we do that throughout the year, and I can't comment further on that. Certainly, with the stock being down what it is, we will continue to evaluate that and make decisions as we move forward. Rob Dickerson : All right. Super. Thank you so much. Operator : We'll move next to Matt Smith with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Matt Smith : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the International market dynamics. That the competitive environment has stepped up, but at the same time, your competitors may be facing a tougher input cost environment with the upcoming crop. Can you help reconcile those dynamics? Why would your competitors be more price-aggressive in front of an unfavorable input cost environment? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. We don't specifically comment on our competitors' environments and some of the things that they're doing. We can only comment as it relates to what we're seeing and how Lamb Weston is reacting to the market. Matt Smith : I appreciate that. And then a follow-up on the product withdrawal. Just for clarity, are you back to shipping to the customer? Did you incur some market share losses associated with that product withdrawal or is that business back up and running? Bernadette Madarieta : Yes. We are back shipping to the customer. Matt Smith : Thank you for that. I can leave it there. Operator : We'll go next to Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Max Gumport : Hi. Thanks for the question. Turning back to the traffic commentary, I'm trying to get a better sense for what's embedded in your guidance with regard to restaurant traffic. And I realize it could be a range of outcomes, but if we take the midpoint, it sounds like you're saying in the first half, you expect restaurant traffic to remain weak. By the time we get to the second half, are you embedding a clean basin essentially, restaurant traffic is no longer getting any worse on a year-over-year basis in that second half? Just curious for what you're seeing and what you're embedding in your plans. Thanks very much. Bernadette Madarieta : Yes, that's right. So in terms of the first half of the year, we assumed the consistent restaurant traffic trends being down with what we experienced in the fourth quarter with slight improvement in the back half of the year. Max Gumport : Okay. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude the Q&A session. I'll turn the conference back to Mr. Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks for joining the call today. If you want to set up a follow-up call, please e-mail me. We can set up a time over the next number of days. Again, thank you and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's first quarter 2025 earnings call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website www.lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, but should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment and cost reduction actions that we announced yesterday, and an update on this year's potato crop. Bernadette will then provide details on our first quarter results, as well as our updated fiscal 2025 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Werner : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered financial results for the first quarter that were generally in line with our expectations. Sales came in above our target, driven by better than expected volume and price mix. Our volume performance reflected our effort to recapture customer share and win new business, solid execution in many of our key international markets, and only a slight improvement in restaurant traffic trends. Overall, price mix increased as inflation-driven pricing actions in our key international markets more than offset investments in price in North America. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was slightly above our target due to better sales and SG&A performance. However, this was partially offset by higher than anticipated manufacturing costs. While we're encouraged by our first quarter performance relative to our expectations, we continue to expect frozen potato demand and global restaurant traffic to remain challenging through fiscal 2025. According to restaurant industry data providers, during our fiscal first quarter, we saw early evidence of U.S. restaurant traffic trends improving during the summer months as QSRs stepped up promotional activity, and as consumers continued to adjust to the cumulative effect of menu price inflation. However, traffic remained negative. Overall, U.S. restaurant traffic, as well as QSR traffic, in the quarter was down 2% versus the prior year. That's a sequential improvement from the down 3% that we observed during our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. Traffic at QSR chains specializing in hamburger, a highly important channel for fry consumption, in our fiscal first quarter was down about 3%. That's an improvement from down more than 4% during our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. Importantly, traffic trends in QSR hamburger improved sequentially each month of our first quarter as promotional activity increased. We're obviously pleased with the growth in restaurant traffic, but it's important to note that many of these promotional meal deals have consumers trading down from a medium fry to a small fry. So while we benefit from improving traffic trends, consumers trading down in serving size acts as partial headwinds for our volumes. Outside the U.S., overall restaurant traffic trends in our key international markets in our first quarter were softer than what we observed in our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. Restaurant traffic in the U.K., our largest market in Europe, declined about 3%, which is down sequentially from a decline of about 2%. In Germany, traffic was also down about 3% after only being down slightly in the fourth quarter. Traffic in France and in Italy continued to rise, but at a slower rate than the fourth quarter, while traffic in Spain was essentially flat. In Asia, overall restaurant traffic grew in both China and Japan. Unlike the changes in global traffic trends, the fry attachment rates in the U.S. and our key international markets were largely steady. This resilience of consumers' demand for fries, as well as their importance to customers' menus, are key reasons why we remain confident that the global fry category will return to its historical long-term growth rate over time as global traffic rates improve. Given our expectations about traffic and demand trends, we also believe that the supply-demand imbalance that's been driven by the decline in traffic will persist through much, if not all, fiscal 2025. With respect to the bigger customer contracts, the season for competing for these contracts is essentially behind us, and the overall outcome was largely as we expected. We had good success in protecting customer share and retaining business with existing large chain restaurant customers. We also had some success in winning new chain restaurant customer business, most notably in our international segment, and we'll begin to realize more meaningful volume associated with these new customers beginning in our fiscal third quarter. Pricing associated with contract renewals and customer wins was competitive, but in total was broadly in line with what we expected. With respect to the smaller and regional customers in the U.S., we continue to leverage our direct sales force to acquire new customers and recapture customers that we lost either directly or indirectly from the transition to our new ERP system in the second half of fiscal 2024. As with the larger chain restaurant contracts, pricing levels needed to regain customer share or win new business have been competitive, but also broadly in line with what we expected. With respect to our cost structure, as we noted during our previous earnings call, we have been evaluating opportunities to drive down supply chain costs, reduce operating expenses, and improve cash flow. Yesterday we announced a restructuring plan, which includes a number of key actions. First, we permanently closed our Connell, Washington facility, which is one of our older, higher cost facilities. Closing this nearly 300 million pound capacity facility reduces our total capacity in North America by more than 5%. We stopped production at this site yesterday. Second, we're temporarily curtailing production lines and schedules across our manufacturing network in North America to focus more production on our more efficient, lower cost lines and steadily work down our elevated finished goods inventory levels. And third, we're reshaping future investments to modernize production capabilities. Together, these actions will help us leverage recently capacity investments, better manage utilization rates across our manufacturing network, and reduce capital expenditures. In addition, we're reducing our global headcount by approximately 4% and eliminating certain job positions that are currently unfilled. This affects team members and positions across our manufacturing, supply chain, and commercial organizations in both our North America and international segments, as well as in our corporate functions. Bernadette will provide details about the cost savings that we expect to generate, as well as the charges we'll incur in connection with our restructuring plan. These are very tough decisions, but necessary proactive steps in the current operating environment to improve our operating efficiency, competitiveness, and financial results. Now, to the potato crop. We're harvesting and processing the crops in our growing regions in both North America and Europe. But this time, we believe the crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta, and the Midwest are slightly above historical averages. As a reminder, North America, we've agreed to a 3% decrease in the aggregate in contract prices for the 2024 potato crop. And we will begin to realize the benefit of these lower potato prices beginning in our fiscal third quarter. With respect to the crop in Europe, a few months ago, we and the market expected that the crop for the later potato varieties in the industry's main growing regions in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Northern France and Northern Germany would be well below average since planting was completed late due to poor weather conditions. However, growing conditions were good in August and September, which improved the outlook for the crop. We currently believe the European potato crop in the aggregate will be in line with historical averages. Overall, we expect our potato costs in Europe will increase, largely reflecting the mid to high single digit price increase associated with our fixed price contracts. We'll provide our final assessment of the potato crops in North America and Europe when we report our second quarter results in early January. So, in summary, we delivered first quarter results that were generally in line with our expectations, driven by improved volume performance, solid price mix, and strict management of operating costs. While U.S. restaurant traffic trends have improved modestly in recent months, they remain negative, and we continue to take a cautious view of frozen potato demand and the consumer. We've announced a restructuring plan to improve our operating efficiency, protect our bottom line, and improve cash flow during this challenging operating environment. And finally, at this time, we believe the potato crop in North America will be slightly above average, and that the European crop will likely be in line with historical averages. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter results, our restructuring plan, and our updated fiscal 2025 outlook. Bernadette Madarieta : Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our financial results were generally in line with our expectations. Specifically, while sales declined 1% compared with the year ago quarter, the decline was less than the high single digits we expected due to better than projected volume and price mix. Compared with the first quarter a year ago, volume declined 3%, and largely reflected the carryover effects of customer share losses in North America, the exit of certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in Europe last year, and soft restaurant traffic trends in the U.S. To a lesser extent, the previously announced voluntary product withdrawal that began affecting our sales in fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 also contributed to the first quarter decline. Volume growth in our key international markets partially offset the overall decline. Price mix increased 2% compared with the prior year due to the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions in Europe, as well as the carryover benefit of pricing actions we took last year in North America. Unfavorable channel and product mix, as well as targeted investments in price and trade, tempered the increase in price mix. Moving on from sales, our adjusted gross profit declined $137 million to $353 million, due primarily to three factors. First, about $39 million of the decline was due to the voluntary product withdrawal. It was higher than the $20 million to $30 million range that we anticipated in the quarter, primarily due to higher than expected costs to dispose the product. Second, more than $15 million of the adjusted gross profit decline was due to higher depreciation expense that's largely related to our capacity expansions in China and Idaho that were completed last fiscal year. The rest of the decline was primarily driven by higher manufacturing costs per pound, which reflects input cost inflation, as well as inefficiencies associated with lower factory utilization rates. To a lesser extent, lower sales volumes and higher warehousing costs also contributed to the decline. Together, these factors more than offset the net benefit from pricing actions. Our gross margin in the quarter was nearly 21.5%, which was about 100 to 150 basis points below our target of 22% to 23%. Of the shortfalls, nearly 100 basis points was related to the greater than expected impact of the voluntary product withdrawal. The remainder is largely reflected, higher than expected manufacturing costs per pound. Adjusted SG&A increased $6 million to $149 million, due to an incremental $6 million of non-cash amortization related to our new ERP system that went live in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Aggressive actions to reduce spending, offset inflation, and investments in our information technology infrastructure. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA of $290 million. While that's better than what we guided, it was down about $123 million versus the prior year quarter, largely due to higher manufacturing costs per pound and the impact of the voluntary product withdrawal, which more than offset the net benefit from pricing actions. Moving to our segments. Sales in our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, declined 3% versus the prior year quarter. Volume declined 4% and was largely driven by the carryover impact of smaller and regional customer share losses in food away from home channels, as well as declining restaurant traffic in the U.S. The volume decline was partially offset by growth in retail channels. Price mix increased 1%, reflecting the carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions for contracts with large and regional chain restaurant customers taken in fiscal 2024, which was partially offset by unfavorable channel and product mix, and to a lesser extent, targeted investments in price. North America's segment-adjusted EBITDA declined $103 million to $276 million and included an approximately $21 million charge related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remaining decline largely reflects a combination of higher manufacturing costs per pound, unfavorable mix, and investments in price and trade, which combined more than offset the carryover benefit of prior year pricing actions. Sales in our international segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America, increased 4% versus the prior year quarter. Price mix increased 5%, largely reflecting pricing actions announced this year to counter input cost inflation. Volume declined 1% due to our strategic decision to exit certain lower priced and lower margin business in EMEA in early fiscal 2024, and to a lesser extent, the voluntary product withdrawal. These business exits in EMEA will continue to be a headwind during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Growth in key international markets outside of EMEA tempered the overall volume decline. International segment-adjusted EBITDA declined $39 million to $51 million. About $18 million, or about half of that decline, related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remainder was largely driven by higher manufacturing cost per pound, which was partially offset by the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions. Moving to our liquidity position in cash flow. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet with ample liquidity. We ended the first quarter with about $120 million of cash and $1 billion available under our global revolving credit facility. Our net debt was about $3.9 billion, which puts our leverage ratio at three times. Last week, we increased our available liquidity, $275 million, by entering into a new $500 million term loan. We used the proceeds from the loan to pay off an existing $225 million term loan and $275 million of borrowings under our global revolving credit facility. As a result, it had no impact on our total debt, increased our available liquidity, and our leverage ratio was not affected. In the first quarter, we generated $330 million of cash from operations, which, despite a decline in earnings, is about the same amount we generated last year due to favorable changes in working capital. We expect further working capital improvements during the balance of the year as we execute our restructuring plan. Net capital expenditures were about $335 million as we finalized spending for our Idaho capacity expansion and continued construction of our expansion projects in the Netherlands and Argentina. We expect our capital spending in the first quarter will be our highest quarter for the year as it accounted for almost half of our updated annual capital spending target. During the quarter, we returned more than $133 million of cash to shareholders, including $52 million in dividends. We spent $82 million to repurchase more than 1.4 million shares at an average price of just over $58 per share. Before discussing our outlook, let me first provide additional details on the restructuring plan we announced yesterday. As Tom noted, these were hard but necessary decisions to adjust to the current business trends. These actions will help us manage asset utilization rates, leverage our more efficient lower-cost production assets, and reduce costs and expenses. The actions include a 4% reduction in our global headcount and the elimination of certain unfilled job positions. We do not take this lightly, and we've carefully considered the impact on our Lamb Weston family. We currently estimate that these actions will generate total savings of approximately $55 million in fiscal 2025, with about one-third benefiting cost of sales and two-thirds benefiting SG&A expenses. We've incorporated these savings in our updated fiscal 2025 outlook. We expect further benefits in fiscal 2026, with estimated annualized savings of about $85 million. We expect to record a $200 million to $250 million pre-tax charge associated with the restructuring, most of which we expect to record in the second quarter. About 20% of the charge is non-cash and primarily reflects the accelerated depreciation of assets at our Connell facility. The remaining 80% are cash charges comprised of cost of contracted raw potatoes that will not be used due to the production line curtailment, the teardown and other cleanup costs associated with permanently closing the Connell production facility, severance and other employee-related costs associated with the reduction in our workforce and other miscellaneous restructuring costs. Additionally, we've scrutinized every project and every dollar of capital. As a result, we now expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 of approximately $750 million, which is down $100 million from our plan entering the year. A significant portion of the reduction reflects deferring the build and implementation of the next phase of our ERP system, which once built, will be deployed first in our manufacturing plants in North America. The remaining decline is largely due to deferring or canceling modernization projects due to the current operating environment. While the next phase of the ERP build and implementation has been deferred, we are committed to the benefits that an integrated system will deliver, but are prioritizing the investments needed to complete our strategic projects in the Netherlands and Argentina. As it relates to next year's capital expenditures, we're currently targeting a notable decrease in spend, as we expect our strategic capacity expansion projects will be completed by the end of this fiscal year. In fiscal 2026, we expect expenditures for base capital and modernization efforts will be in line with our annual depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $150 million for environmental capital projects at our manufacturing facilities. Our manufacturing processes involve water intake and waste handling and disposal activities, which are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, along with the requirements of permits issued by governmental authorities. To comply with these regulations, we expect the laws and the states in which we operate will require us to spend approximately $500 million over the next five years. The estimate to comply may vary based on changes in regulations and other factors. We're evaluating options to lessen these expenditures, including the potential for government incentives. And lastly, fiscal 2026 capital expenditures may include costs to restart the next phase of our ERP build. Consistent with past practice, we'll provide a specific capital spending target for next year when we provide our fiscal 2026 outlook in late July. Now, turning to our updated fiscal 2025 outlook. We're continuing to target a net sales range of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion on a constant currency basis, or growth of 2% to 5%, with volume driving our sales growth. For earnings, we expect to deliver at the low end of our target adjusted EBITDA range of $1.38 billion to $1.48 billion. We're targeting the low end of the range due to higher manufacturing costs per pound, which relates to fixed cost deleveraging related to the temporarily curtailed lines in our plants, as well as less favorable customer and product mix. These factors will put additional pressure on our gross margins. We'll look to offset much of this pressure with the estimated $55 million of manufacturing supply chain and SG&A savings that we expect to generate from our restructuring plan, as well as efforts to aggressively manage costs across the business. Other updates to our financial targets include reducing our adjusted SG&A target to between $680 million and $690 million from our previous range of $740 million to $750 million, increasing our interest expense estimate by $5 million to approximately $185 million to account for higher average debt balances during the year, and increasing our estimated full year effective tax rate to approximately 25% from approximately 24% to reflect a higher proportion of income from our international segment, as well as other discrete items. In addition, since we're targeting the lower end of our adjusted EBITDA range, and since we've updated our estimates for interest expense and our effective tax rate, we reduced our adjusted diluted earnings per share target range to $4.15 to $4.35. So in summary, we're responding to the current challenging environment by adjusting our spending to protect profitability and ensure positive free cash flow, while continuing to invest in and execute our strategy. Let me now turn it over to Tom for some closing comments. Tom Werner : Thanks, Bernadette. I want to thank our Lamb Watson team for their efforts to deliver our first quarter results and for focusing on executing our near-term priorities to reinvigorate growth, improve customer share, drive operating efficiencies, and aggressively manage costs. Our team will also continue to focus on our long-term strategies during this challenging environment. So when demand growth returns to historical levels, we're better positioned to continue to support our customers and create value for our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us today and now we're ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Great. Good morning everybody. Tom Werner : Good morning. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Andrew Lazar : Tom, I guess my first question is around pricing. I think you had originally said you expected price mix to be down low to mid-single digit in the first quarter, and it was positive, and I guess specifically really in North America, it was also positive as you mentioned. And I get the impact from carryover pricing in North America from last year, but presumably you knew that was coming. So I'm trying to get a sense of what was better on pricing in North America and is it that some of the trade investments and such that you needed to make to retain customers and some of these large customer negotiations were maybe more favorable than you might have expected? And obviously the reason I ask is because, of course, the supply/demand imbalance has investors more worried about the fate of pricing and what's been obviously historically a very rational sort of environment. So that's just my first question. Tom Werner : Yeah Andrew, so the overall, the pricing contracting season was in line with what we expected. We had a better mix and we had some carryover from last year, so that certainly played into it, but the pricing environment that we experienced was in line with what we expected. So, it's really \u2013 a lot of it \u2013 some of its mix in the first quarter in terms of overall sales pricing. And, so it's \u2013 the encouraging thing to me is, we've kind of stabilized the environment going forward. We've got through the contracting season. It was in line with what we expected coming into the contracting season based on the supply/demand dynamics we're operating in right now. So, I feel good about where we're at. I feel good about how we ended up the contracting season and we\u2019re \u2013 I think we're in a really good position. Andrew Lazar : Okay, thank you for that. And then, you generally have good visibility to your competitive set and sort of industry utilization levels. And I guess I'm curious if you've heard of or seen other North America players thinking about or taking similar sort of capacity reduction moves, or if utilization at competitors is already much higher than what you are seeing at Lamb Weston, because of some of your specific sort of challenges. Really trying to get a sense of how quickly some of these potential reductions in the industry can start to actually affect in a positive way, the supply and demand imbalance, knowing that restaurant traffic trends will likely continue to be weak for some time. Thank you. Tom Werner : Yeah, great question Andrew. I think we made some really tough decisions here in the last couple of days based on the operating environment we're in with restaurant traffic being challenged, and we think it's going to continue to be challenged for the rest of this fiscal year. So we're making decisions to manage Lamb Weston. And what the competitive set does, they are going to manage their business, how they want to manage it. I have no insight into what they may or may not do, so. But the best interest of what we do to manage and make decisions is to manage this company, and we'll continue to do that. I think, the question that everybody is \u2013 we're going to get asked and everybody's been asking is, there's been a lot of capacity announcements. I think people are going to rethink some of those additions based on the environment and may pause them, but it remains to be seen, but time will tell as we work through the near term environment based on what we're all dealing with around the globe. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Tom Werner : Yep. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the commentary about the $500 million that might be spent for environmental improvements in your plans. Can you walk us through a little bit more where that's coming from? What the timeline is on that, and maybe how you might be able to mitigate that a little bit and where that might really show up in your financial statements as well? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. Good morning, Ken. As it relates to the $500 million, again, this is related to primarily wastewater capital investments that will be needed at our manufacturing plants in order to continue to run them at current capacity levels. So as we look at the timing of that, that's going to vary depending on different regulations, and we'll provide more of an update on that as we give our specific guidance. We wanted to though, frame it up in terms of a large capital expenditure over the next five years, and we will certainly be looking to other regulatory bodies, whether it be state, federal, etc., in terms of whether or not there's opportunities for any government incentives to lessen that. But early in that process, and we'll provide updates as we move throughout. Ken Goldman : Okay. Thank you for that. And then I certainly understand the decision to sort of temporarily delay the rest of the ERP implementation, giving all the moving pieces in your business right now. Can you just walk us through a little bit, sort of what you are, I don't want to use the word sacrificing, but some of the choices that you've made in delaying those plans? Any impact to some of your medium-term financial targets as a result, just given that the ERP implementation longer term is done with some positive benefits in mind as well. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. So as far as the ERP timing of the implementation, after the last implementation, we paused work on future releases as we focused on the business and ensuring that we had stabilization. So in terms of timing of where we are in the process, it was an opportune time to pause that at that time. It does delay the benefits that we'll be able to obtain from the ERP, but we're confident that once with the capital spending and our major expansions occurring and being complete by the end of this year, that we'll be able to restart that work and get those benefits at that time. As it relates to future guidance and the opportunity for that delay to affect that, we don't see any major impact at this time. Ken Goldman : Great. Thanks so much. Bernadette Madarieta : You bet. Operator : We'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Tom Werner : Hi Adam. Adam Samuelson : Good morning. I wanted to dig in a little bit just on the updated gross margin expectation for the year. Clearly, part of it is related to the product recall in the first quarter and that being a larger item than you thought a couple of months ago. But you also alluded to a lower \u2013 a higher manufacturing cost on a per pound basis given the production curtailments. I was hoping you can maybe just put a little bit more context on the magnitude of those as we think about margins, any differences between the North America and international operations to consider. And how should we, given the restructuring and timing of the closures, is there any impact to the phasing of margins and earnings over the balance of the year that would differ from historic seasonality? A - Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. Great question, Adam. As it relates to the higher manufacturing costs, as I explained, a lot of that is attributable to the fixed cost deleveraging from the idle lines that we do have in the plants, and we're also seeing less favorable channel mix within our segments. We are looking to offset a lot of that incremental cost with the $55 million of savings that we discussed. And another point that I just want to make relates to the modernization of our assets over time, which is something that we've been investing in. And as we continue to modernize, as we have been at American Falls, for example, we have that lower cost manufacturing footprint that we don't necessarily have at some of these older plants. And that ensures, with that modernization, that we have more flexibility because not every plant is made the same. And so that's the reason why you'll see some of the decisions that we've made to idle capacity at different plants, and it's based on what those plants can make from a product perspective. So as we move throughout this year, our gross margin will be impacted because of that fixed cost deleveraging. But as additional volume gets brought back on and we pull those lines back up, we're going to see that improvement. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just as I think about some of the key items in terms of the cost-saving plans and the updated CapEx, I mean, just kind of think about some of the early items that you are laying out as we think about 2026. Just to be clear, you alluded to an $85 million cost-saving target in \u201826. Is that incremental to the 50 this year or that's total? So it's a year-on-year $35 million benefit. Just on the total CapEx piece that you alluded to Bernadette, you said base CapEx equals D&A, which I'm presuming you're saying is 375 the right go-forward rate or it steps up more, because the Netherlands and Argentina start depreciating, plus the environmental CapEx, which for next year you said was 150. Just to make sure we're all talking about the same numbers. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, so a couple of things there. First, as it relates to the savings next year, the $85 million, we'll see an incremental $30 million next year, because it's additive to the $55 million we're seeing this year. As it relates to D&A, it'll be closer to $400 million, which will include the additional D&A related to the new plants that we bring online. And then there was another question in there. Did I miss it? Adam Samuelson : Well, effectively you're saying CapEx next year in the range of $550 million plus or minus, including $150 million of environmental. Bernadette Madarieta : That\u2019s right. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that's very helpful. Bernadette Madarieta : The only other thing I want to say, I did also mention that there would be additional expenditures if and when we begin the next phase of the ERP, on top of the $550 million. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that's helpful. I will pass it on. Thank you. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys. Good morning. Bernadette Madarieta : Good morning. Tom Werner : Hey Pete. Peter Galbo : Thank you for all the detail and for taking the questions. I want to actually go back to Adam's question, just on the gross margin impact of idling lines and kind of test the other side of the argument. So in theory right, if those lines don't get pulled back up next year, let's just say, does that I mean structurally leave the margins lower? I mean, if the demand environment doesn't improve and those lines stay down, do we stay in a margin environment that looks more like the second through fourth quarter of this year, simply because that fixed cost de-leverage doesn't go away? Or do you have potential in there to further mitigate fixed cost de-leverage outside of the incremental $30 million of cost savings for next year? Tom Werner : Yeah. So Peter, the actions we've taken is to address the operating environment we're in right now. And certainly what Bernadette just said, its going \u2013 how she talked about it in terms of gross margin impact, that's going to persist in the near term. However, we believe in \u2013 restaurant traffic will rebound and the category will return to growth, so to speak. And so it's important as we make these decisions which are challenging to make, but we're also making these decisions looking at the future of the growth of the category. We've been modernizing our footprint over the past several years in terms of the capital we put in this business, and so I view this as a short-term issue. And we've got to get through a period of time and see what restaurant traffic does. We've seen trends improve in the first quarter, as we said in our comments sequentially, although they are still down, but we are seeing some traction. So this is a short-term management decision. But the great thing I am confident in is that with our new assets coming online in China and the Netherlands and American Falls and Argentina coming up, we've modernized our footprint. We're well positioned when the category rebounds, that we'll be \u2013 we'll come out of this as strong as ever. Peter Galbo : Okay. Thanks for that Tom. And then Bernadette, maybe just a clarification. On the SG&A reduction, I think it's like $60 million at the midpoint. I think you said two-thirds of the $55 million from cost saving goes to SG&A, so that doesn't make up the whole bucket. Just what's the rest of the reduction? Is it compensation expense? Like, how should we think about that? Bernadette Madarieta : The rest of the reduction in SG&A? Peter Galbo : In SG&A guidance, yep. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, a lot of it is people-related costs. Peter Galbo : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tom Palmer with Citi. Tom Palmer : Good morning and thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the composition of the sales growth. A quarter ago, I think the expectation was for flattish price mix for the year and then growth coming from volume. Is this still the expectation, or are there any shifts between these two items? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, thanks for the question, Tom. That is still the expectation for the remainder of the year, is for this to be driven by volume. Tom Palmer : Okay, thank you. And I guess just on that, I wanted to kind of understand the discussion on fixed cost to leverage. So it sounds like the volume outlook for the year is a little changed. And so kind of what's being cited is this added margin pressure is closing the lines. I would think that closing lines ultimately has benefits for profitability, so I guess why the added overhang. And again, it sounds like the fixed cost to leverage is not that big of an incremental factor if the volume outlook is unchanged. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, so the permanent capacity curtailment at Connell, that is a benefit. The temporarily curtailed lines throughout our footprint, we have the same fixed costs that are being allocated over fewer pounds if you will. And so that's where the deleveraging is occurring. We are in the process of also managing down our inventories. We have a very high inventory level. And so we take into combination running less, so that we can get our inventories into a better place as we end this fiscal year. Tom Palmer : Okay, thank you. I guess I just struggle with why this wasn't factored in a quarter ago if the volume outlook is so little changed, but we can talk about it later. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Robert Moskow : Thanks for the question. Two things. Is it fair to say that pricing goes negative for the rest of the year in North America? Because I think you still have to give incentives to food service customers to get them to come back after the ERP disruption. So can you give us an update on how that's going? Have you started that yet or is there a lot more acceleration to do and a follow-up after? Tom Werner : Yeah. So our current pricing environment, again, is in line with what we anticipated for this year. And for the kind of how we're working the food service channel, so to speak, it's as we do every year, it's on an account-by-account basis. So we're managing it with great detail in terms of customer interaction. The larger contracted pricing discussions, like I said, are largely behind us. So as we move forward, it's really going to be on an account-by-account basis in the market and in the food service channel and the team's managing it. We have a high-level visibility to some of the actions we're taking, but it's going to continue to play out over the coming months and quarters. A - Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, and if I could just add, Tom, I just want to emphasize that the overall pricing environment, it\u2019s competitive, but it's been disciplined. And as Tom said, our pricing investment for the year continues to be on-track. You will see greater pricing investment though during the balance of the year relative to the first quarter, and so we will see some negative price mix. Robert Moskow : Okay. So it's just going to step up. Tom Werner : As we expected. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, as we expected though. Absolutely. Robert Moskow : Got it. That's fine. And my follow-up is, I know you don't like these hypotheticals, but like a year from now, let's say demand is unchanged or just not getting any worse, and you've made all these capacity reductions and they are still in place. Is that sufficient to get the industry supply/demand back in balance? Is that alone enough? And then where do you think utilization would be in that scenario compared to where it is now? Tom Werner : Yeah. So I'm not going to get into hypotheticals, but I'll go back to some of the comments I made earlier Robert, is the industry in total, we're all feeling the same thing. And so we made our decisions based on what's best for the company in terms of how we're taking actions. And I think it remains to be seen overall what the industry will do. But again, there's capacity announcements that may be paused, but it's again, it's we're just, we're in a trended time watch in terms of restaurant traffic. And as we move through the next several quarters, we'll be \u2013 and we are closely monitoring restaurant traffic, that's going to determine not only for Lamb Weston, but for the industry, potentially additional actions that we've got to take, in terms of getting this thing balanced out and supply and demand. Robert Moskow : Okay. All right, well, thank you. Tom Werner : Yep. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. So, I guess just kind of first question is just on some of the share loss right, clearly coming out of the ERP disruption in Q3. It seems like maybe it got a little bit better in Q4. Maybe it got a little bit better in Q1, but at the same time it sounds like a fair amount of the volume pressure in North America, at least in Q1 was still from the share loss. And then secondly, as we think through kind of the rest of the year, especially the back half, as you lap that, there is kind of this implied nice lift, right, that should come as you get that share back. So I'm just curious if you could provide like any color as to maybe how the share regain progression might be coming. Tom Werner : Yeah. So Rob, we are seeing business wins, and we will start seeing that in Q3, Q4 this fiscal year, and so those are known things. The thing that kind of clouds it up, is the base business with restaurant traffic being challenged, volumes are down on some of our key accounts across the board. So while we are confident in the back half in terms of the business we are bringing in, we are closely monitoring what is happening with our base accounts. So we are in the market. We are winning customers back, but it\u2019s going to be a little murky based on what is going on with restaurant traffic right now in the back half of the year. Rob Dickerson : Yeah, okay, okay. Fair enough. And then just another kind of quick simple one from me is just, the plant closure, I am not sure if you can quantify, maybe just kind of as a percent of your total global in North America capacity, kind of what that estimate is. That is it. Thanks. Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. That is about 5% of our capacity in North America, 300 million pounds. Rob Dickerson : Super. Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : We will take our next question from Marc Torrente with Wells Fargo Securities. Marc Torrente : Hey, good morning. Thank you for the questions. Just building on the last one on the Connell facility, any context around relative manufacturing costs versus other newer facilities? And I appreciate you sizing the capacity there. And then also any other color on sizing and timeline for the plant curtailment? Tom Werner : Yeah, so just in terms of the Connell decision, it\u2019s a difficult decision. It\u2019s impactful to that community, people, all those things, and we didn\u2019t take any of that lightly. But the decision parameters are, we look at our footprint, look at production capabilities, cost to produce. We go through the litany of things you go through when you make these decisions, and potential future capital expenditures required in the facilities we have right now currently, and then you just go through the decision metrics. That was what drove specifically the decision to close Connell. And, its again, it\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s hard, you are impacting a lot of things. But the long-term footprint of the company, it was the right decision to do. Marc Torrente : Okay, thank you. And then you also called out some strong volume trends internationally outside of Europe. Maybe some additional color there, key regions, and how much is new international production enabling this? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, no, as it relates to our international business, we are seeing some good wins, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. That\u2019s where we are seeing a large pickup there, also in Latin America, which is positive in light of our upcoming plant that will be coming online in the spring of next year. So that\u2019s driving a lot of it. As Tom was alluding to, customer wins, a lot of our customer wins have been in the international segment, and we are going to see much of that begin to hit in third quarter. Marc Torrente : Great, thank you. Bernadette Madarieta : You bet. Operator : We will take our next question from Matt Smith with Stifel. Matt Smith : Hi, good morning. I wanted to come back to the discussion around pricing and what you are seeing in the business. It sounds like the amount \u2013 so far the investment in pricing has been relatively in line with your expectations. But in part of the explanation for taking EBITDA out of the low end, you referenced higher price investments, or higher investments in price and trade than originally anticipated. So, can you help me balance those two dynamics against each other? Are you seeing perhaps a bit more price investment in the food service business? And that is still to come, and that is the difference? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah. Matt, as it relates to our pricing investments, it is fair to say that our pricing is coming in line with what we expected for the year. Most of its on a cost basis as it was relating to our gross profit. In first quarter you did see pricing was up, I think positive 2%, but much of that investment, as I think Tom may have alluded to, is going to be heading beginning in second quarter. Matt Smith : Thank you for that. I will leave it there. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Carla Casella : Hi, I am wondering, on the $200 million to $250 million of charges, can you bucket that a little bit in terms of the different items that you talked about? And then also, is the 20% non-cash, is that mostly the potato inventory write-down or is another piece of it that is non-cash versus cash? Bernadette Madarieta : Yeah, so the 20% that\u2019s non-cash, that is mainly going to be related to the accelerated depreciation on the Connell facility as it related to the balance of the value that we had placed there. The remainder is largely going to be attributable to cash expenditures related to contracted potatoes that we will be paying for, but will not need, related to the curtailments in Connell and in the other production curtailments. That\u2019s about 60% of the cash cost. Carla Casella : Okay, great. And then, given the lower volumes this year and that potato contract that you won\u2019t be paying for, you haven\u2019t used, will that change any of your negotiations with your suppliers for next year or your contract pricing for next year? Tom Werner : No, so well, as we do every year, well as we go through the process, we\u2019ll provide insights at the appropriate time that we do every year, which is typically our April call of July. So we are on the front end of those negotiations, but we will not expect any changes in terms of how we go through the process at all based on this. It may change our needs, but that\u2019s about it. Carla Casella : Okay, but my guess, my thought is if the volumes are lower, would you see materials step up in the pricing? Are you getting a lot of volume based to discounts that you may lose? Tom Werner : No, I am not going to comment on that. We typically, we are right in the middle of those negotiations. So I am not going to comment and talk about the specifics of how all that works. Carla Casella : Okay, and then just one debt question. Leverage target, any change to your current leverage target? Bernadette Madarieta : No changes. Carla Casella : So that is at 3.5x? Bernadette Madarieta : That is correct, and I think as I shared, we are at 3x right now. I am comfortable with that as it provides optionality. Carla Casella : Okay, that is great. Thank you so much. Bernadette Madarieta : Thank you. Operator : That will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks for joining the call today. As usual, if you want to set up a follow-up call, please email me. We can set up a time. Other than that, again, thanks for joining the call and have a good day! Operator : That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",
