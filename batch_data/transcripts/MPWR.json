[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Meera Rao : Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statements contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2014, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call.  We will be discussing gross margins, operating expense, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2013, Q4 2013 and Q1 2014 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS is pleased to announce record first quarter revenue of $60.1 million, representing a 16.7% increase from the first quarter of 2013. This year-over-year increase, which was well above the industry average, was fueled by diversified growth in revenues from a newer, high-value consumer and industrial markets. Over the last several quarters, MPS has released many groundbreaking products in several new markets. MPS continues to build on the innovative foundation of these products by expanding its portfolio. I would like to discuss some of these product family expansions with you. In our AC/DC portfolio, we introduced the industry's first Monolithic 900 volt flyback regulator designed specifically for industrial power grid applications supporting wireless communication. This product saves our customers from having to include a high-voltage blockage device, and, due to its high integration, allows for improved ease-of-use, high reliability and the lowest overall solution cost.  MPS is also expanding its LED lighting portfolio with a third-generation LED driver that includes power faction -- power factor correction with dimming capability that has been even further enhanced from our previous industry-leading generation. We have multiple design wins for this third-generation LED driver and expect revenue to ramp in the second half of the year. Since we introduced our first products in the battery management family a few quarters ago, we have achieved significant success in the market. We have continued to expand this product family with the release of an even higher current charger, which integrates both booster kits and smart power distribution. As a result, our new charger delivers the best efficiency performance in the market, which equates to faster time to charge for users. MPS continues to leverage its technical advantage to gain market share.  Finally, MPS continues to build its portfolio of system-on-a-chip MPM modules by introducing a new mid voltage family of products. The mid voltage family works from 4.5 to 24 volts and can handle output currents up to 20 amps. Based on our industry-leading Monolithic BCD process technologies and a patented packaging technology, our MPM modules have achieved the smallest footprint on the market today. We continue to see widespread acceptance of the MPM module in the industrial storage and high-performance consumer markets.  Turning to the financials. Our first quarter revenue of $60.1 million was at the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with Q4 2013, revenue decreased by $3.5 million or 5% -- 5.5% primarily on seasonally lower consumer expense -- or consumer revenue, sorry. Looking at our revenue by end market. Industrial revenue grew approximately $900,000 to $9.8 million over the prior quarter, primarily fueled by automotive and smart meter applications. Revenue in the communications market also grew in the first quarter by $745,000 to $13.6 million. Computing revenue declined by $2 million to $10.6 million, reflecting an expected ramp down of an older HDD design win, as well as the seasonal decline in notebooks, partially offset by SSD revenue growth. Revenue from consumer markets declined $3.1 million in the first quarter to $26.1 million, largely due to seasonal declines in newer consumer markets like gaming, as well as in traditional consumer markets like TVs. Let's review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2014 were $15.6 million, a decrease of $5.2 million from the $20.8 million we spent in the fourth quarter, and also down $6 million from the midpoint of our guidance. This decrease was largely due to a $9.5 million legal settlement in our favor from O2Micro. The settlement was recorded during the first quarter of 2014 as a benefit to litigation expenses. This pickup was partially offset by onetime charges of $100,000 for payments to the law firm that successfully represented us against O2Micro and special nonexecutive employee bonuses of $2.8 million.  Moving on to our GAAP operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $23 million in the first quarter compared with $26.3 million in the fourth quarter. Since the only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expense for these quarters is stock compensation expense, let's look at stock comp. Stock comp expense attributable to operating expenses was $7.4 million in the first quarter compared with $5.5 million in the prior quarter as a result of a higher charge for pay-for-performance stock plans implemented from 2012 through 2014. Accordingly, we are required under the accounting rules to assess the probability of hitting the performance metrics under the plan on a quarterly basis. As we noted before, this has increased a quarter-over-quarter volatility of stock comp charges compared to the typical straight-line approach associated with time-based grants. Moving on to gross margin. Our first quarter GAAP gross margin was 53.4% for the first quarter compared to 54% in the prior quarter. This decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of a special nonexecutive employee bonus of approximately $300,000 in the first quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q1 gross margin was 53.8% compared to 54.2% in the prior quarter. The only difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is stock comp expense.  Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q1 net income was $15.6 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q1 2014 GAAP net income was $9 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $238.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2014, above the $236.2 million at the end of the prior quarter, as well as the $186.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2013. In Q1, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $10.9 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed another $6.6 million. MPS announced a $100 million buyback program effective August 2013. Under this program, we bought back approximately 324,000 shares for a total of $11.4 million in the first quarter of 2014. We also spent $3.9 million on capital equipment. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter at $22.1 million, down from the $23.7 million at the end of the prior quarter and $22.7 million at the end of the first quarter 2013. Days of sales outstanding were down to 33 days in Q1 from 34 days in Q4 2013, and 40 days in Q1 2013. Our internal inventories at the end of the year were $39.8 million, relatively flat with a $39.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory increased from 124 days at the end of Q4 to 130 days at the end of Q1. Inventory in the distributor channel increased by approximately $800,000 over the prior quarter.  I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2014. We expect second quarter revenue to be in the range of $65 million to $69 million. At the midpoint of the guidance, we are projecting approximately a 16% year-over-year increase and about 11.5% growth from the prior quarter. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.7% to 54.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54% to 55%; total stock-based compensation expense of $7.5 million to $8.1 million, including approximately $200,000 that would be charged to cost of goods; litigation expenses of $200,000 to $400,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $20.5 million to $22.5 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 39.5 million to 39.9 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion, MPS had an outstanding quarter, hitting record first quarter revenues while continuing to deliver solutions that exceed industry standards. We are delivering on our promise to broaden our product portfolio and grow revenues above the industry average with sustainable long-term growth.  I'll now open the microphone for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : My first question is on your outlook for the second quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your visibility either by backlog or current bookings? Meera Rao : Sure. We've had very good bookings so far, and I think we're kind of seeing an environment that is better than what we saw a quarter ago. And that's what's drives the guidance that we have now given for the second quarter. Tore Svanberg : Very good. And you mentioned your HDD business was down in Q1. Are we at a point now where SSD revenue is higher than HDD revenue? Meera Rao : Yes. It's -- more than half of our revenue is now coming in from SSD, and SSD continues to be a segment that's growing for us. Michael R. Hsing: Doesn't mean that HDD continue to go down. As the newer model ramping up, we expect the revenue start to pick up again. Meera Rao : Yes. So one design win that has started decreasing in the second quarter of last year has now bottomed out. Tore Svanberg : Okay, very good. And on your consumer revenue, I know last year you actually grew it in dollar terms, but I know it became smaller percentage. But if we look at how things are progressing so far this year, could consumer still grow in dollar terms or expecting it to be more flatted out? Meera Rao : We expect consumer revenues to also grow this year in dollars. Tore Svanberg : Okay, very good. Last question for me. Your gross margin guidance for Q2, does that assume just a natural improvement in mix or is there anything else behind that? Meera Rao : It contemplates a slow and steady improvement in our gross margins as we've always talked about in the past, and I think that's what you're seeing in the second quarter as our revenue mix gets richer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Vincent Celentano : This is Vince Celentano speaking for Steve Smigie. My first question was, with the recent price cuts in LED bulbs, I was wondering if you knew going forward when it would translate into a pickup in sales? Michael R. Hsing: The second -- as Meera said in the script, the second half of the year, our third generation of our LED will gain sales revenue. Vincent Celentano : Okay, great. And with the Broadwell delay, I was wondering if you see that impacting your 2015 outlook? Michael R. Hsing: Will you say that again? The first part, I can't hear. Vincent Celentano : I'm sorry, I said with the Broadwell delay. I was wondering if you see that impacting your 2015 numbers? Michael R. Hsing: Broadwalk? Meera Rao : Broadwell. Michael R. Hsing: Oh, Broadwell. Meera Rao : On the Intel. Michael R. Hsing: Oh, that. Oh, you switched topics, okay. Yes, these models, it was 2015 starting to see -- not in 2015 revenues. So we're not going to go beyond that. I don't -- I'm not very familiar with these names. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Matt Diamond : This is actually Matt Diamond on for Ross. I'm curious if you could give us a breakdown on your second quarter guide of the end market which comms consumer, computing, industrial, what all of those should be expected to do directionally? Meera Rao : Sure. I'd like to kind of put it in context, as I have in the past, that we don't have as much visibility to break it down by the different end markets when we are looking at bookings and a forecast as we do when we have the end quarter POS or resales data. But directionally, I can tell you that I expect to see growth in consumer in the second quarter. I also think that we will see growth in computing, since I expect both storage and notebook revenue to increase in that quarter. And I expect the -- all the other markets also to do fairly well. Matt Diamond : Okay. And in somewhat of a different vein on your OpEx, it looks like if I back out the litigation benefit, it appears as though it came in a couple of million above the midpoint of guidance fee -- I'm sorry, coming in at above the top end of non-GAAP guidance. I'm curious if there's anything beyond stock comp that would explain that or what the dynamics there is at large? Michael R. Hsing: Well let me -- before Meera answers, here's a correction. Meera in the script has said the settlement. This is not a settlement. This is a verdict from the court. Okay, Meera, please answer the question. Meera Rao : Yes. So the $3.1 million that you're referring to is actually special bonuses that were given to employees in the first quarter. And I think that's the difference that you're picking up, and that's what I talked about in the commentary a little earlier. And I think out of that $3.1 million, $2.8 million of that was in OpEx and about $300,000 went into cost of goods and impacted gross margin. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer Funds. Richard Schafer : First question, I guess, is, could you give us an idea, I guess, as mix improves and manufacturing costs are dropping, maybe walk us through your thought process on your longer-term gross margin targets. I mean, I guess, what I'm asking is what's actually going to keep gross margins below 60% longer term? Michael R. Hsing: Well, 60%, that's a big jump, Rick. Big jump. As we said in the long term, we're transitioning from -- we are broadening our market coverage and the gross margin world growth. And when -- how we're going to get 60%? I would say the possibility is there. And as we do the more annuity products and then we will get there. So -- but the questions is really -- really, the question is when will it get there? And as you know, this year, consumer business we're going to do really well, and they make very good bucket. Increase our -- keep increase our EPS and, I mean, these are money you can't walk away. And so we will see. I think in the next 5, 6 years, I think as a possibility it's very good. Meera Rao : Rick, I mean, our focus has always been on maximizing the operating income on a non-GAAP basis, right? So we also try at the same time to improve our top line while steadily expanding our gross margin. And as Michael said, there's absolutely no headwinds when it comes to gross margin, and you're going to see it improve. And as we get more revenue coming from some of our newer products, we also transition to a richer mix. And all that's going to help with our gross margin expansion as we go forward. Richard Schafer : And so maybe a second part of that question would be if you could give us some color on the percentage of your sales now that are BCD3 versus how much you're still on BCD2, and then maybe remind us sort of what that cost, relative cost savings was as you move from BCD2 to 3? Meera Rao : Sure. Our revenue from BCD3 and BCD4 is above 60% of our revenues in the first quarter. And the cost savings that we got, that came out of it, came both from having 20% to 50% die size reduction and the cost savings that came from it for the different products, as well as some of the packaging advances that we had made. Of course, some of that cost advantage gets narrower as we go forward as our competitors continue to drop prices. But it clearly allows us to still match a competitors' prices in the consumer market with a group of family of products and yet get a corporate gross margin that's in our model of 53% to 58%. Richard Schafer : And Meera, this is my very last question. But -- so would you say that on your consumer and PC businesses that the gross margins are actually improving there as well? Because of these cost reduction efforts, you're seeing a margin -- gross margin actually improve there? Meera Rao : I mean, we get picked up periodically as new products roll onto it. But some of the benefits have also come from some of the newer consumer markets we get into. And these newer markets have better gross margin profiles than traditional. Michael R. Hsing: Yes, the one we -- Meera just mentioned it, the very management -- and certainly it's much higher than a corporate average gross margins. And other consumer products we just recently introduced for the smart TVs. And those products are generally has a much higher gross margin compared on the existing one. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Anil Doradla : Meera, you talked about a charger. I just wanted to clarify. Would some of the applications of these chargers be in the automotive industry for electric vehicle charging? Would that be an application? Michael R. Hsing: No. Our charging is, a lot of them is for consumers products and other one is the hand tools. Anil Doradla : Okay. So it's a little step away. And also, you talked about LED being a driver in second half of 2014. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you meant by that? Michael R. Hsing: Well we just introduced the third generation of our LED drivers in early this year or second half of last year, and it's well, well received. In the conference call, we should have bring that up to our shareholders and that will have some additional revenues in the second half of this year. Anil Doradla : Can you quantify it or that's difficult at this stage? Michael R. Hsing: It's -- as you know, the LED market is very fragmented, and a lot of customer competing with the same sockets. And some's going to win, some are going to lose, okay, but ended up it's okay in [indiscernible]. These sockets are either more into the consumer side. And so it's difficult for us to forecast from the design wins to revenues. Anil Doradla : Okay. And finally, I mean, in your last Analyst Day, you did talk about going from $2 billion TAM to $6 billion TAM as you entered into new markets? Is there an update on the Tam now, I mean, is it more than $6 billion that you're trying to address or can you give us an update on that front? Meera Rao : Since then, one of the newer markets that we entered into, that we have discussed publicly is the gaming market. And I don't think we have announced any newer markets since then. Michael R. Hsing: Yes I think -- but we don't look at the TAM or calculate the TAM every quarter. From the last year's Analyst Day, we announced that here is the TAM we're going to cover, so this is the opportunity and then since then, of course, we introduced a lot more product than we will have more TAM, but we don't have any particular numbers. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : As a follow-up on your Monolithic Power Module, I was hoping you could give us an update on recent trends and also on optimizing the structure for that product line? Meera Rao : Tore, could you please say that again? You're breaking up. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Sorry, I was hoping you could update us on design wins for Monolithic Power Module and also on the cost structure initiatives there? Michael R. Hsing: Yes. We have, of course, we have seen a lot more design wins from the last quarter to -- well from the 2 quarters ago to the last quarter's. And then Meera talked about in the script that we have a more industrial design wins, more in SSD, more in the consumer side, actually. And some wearable device, some these action cams, those kind of a thing. Cameras, they require very small devices, and they want to use a high-performance product. And so we have a lot of these design activities. And so the revenue -- we're translating the revenues and some are sooner than the other one, okay, and consumer being the fastest and the industrial is relatively slowest. Also, the automotive and we have several activity -- several design wins. These will be probably take us 3 years to generate any revenues. From the cost side, the cost is really not -- and at this time, it's not really our concern because we're selling values. And the gross margin is a much, much higher than the corporate average. And so it's a less concern. But we believe our -- the way we implement the module is the lowest cost in the market. We don't use the PCB. We don't use any multiple chips in there and everything is the same. We utilized integrated circuit packaging technology which we developed. And available in -- we implement it in the assembly and it can be mass-produced. So the reliability and the cost that we clearly will have an advantage now. Meera Rao : And, Tore, one of the things that is truly exciting about this module is the variety of markets into which it's being adopted into. We have design wins all the way from SSDs to appliances, to smart meters and to automotives, other industrial applications, servers, networking. So we have seen these products being kind of being adopted very widely. And the revenue, as Michael said, some of it consumer will be earlier to ramp and the others will take a little longer. But you're going to see us talk more about this and having this be a more significant part of our revenues, particularly in 2015 and 2016. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Last question, you're a relatively new entrant into the high-voltage markets. I was hoping you could just update us a little bit there and will you actually start to break out BCDHV-based revenue? Michael R. Hsing: The last portion was a break... Meera Rao : The BCDH. Michael R. Hsing: Oh, the BCDH, okay. Well I'm glad that you mentioned it. This is the fastest growth segment in our revenue stream. The high-voltage device, and we started about 4, 5 years ago, and the revenue grows and it grows phenomenally, and as in AC to DC side, and also as well the LED lighting. Meera Rao : And just add to that, our AC/DC products essentially sell across to more than one of our end markets. While a lot of it goes into industrial, we also have one of our AC/DC parts, the synchronous rectifier that's going in for gaming as we announced a few quarters ago. So we won't be able to break it out that way, but we will give some color as we go on through the rest of this year and next year. Michael R. Hsing: Well most of it -- a lot of them is -- these are power -- these are micro transmitters, [indiscernible] and the WiFis and network for connectivities. Operator : I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Meera Rao : I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call today, and look forward to talking to you all again at the next earnings release. Thanks, and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Meera Rao :  Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today\u2019s call. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2014 and our Form 10-Q filed May 1, 2014, which is accessible through our Web site www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 and Q2 2013 releases, the Q1 and Q2 2014 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our Web site. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our Web site for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS again delivered record breaking quarterly revenues. And more importantly MPS achieved greater than 50% year-over-year growth in both non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS. Revenue grew 18.6% compared with the same quarter of 2013 to $68.4 million. This increase which is well above the industry average was fueled by organic growth in revenue from our industrial and newer consumer markets. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 70 basis points to 54.5% in Q4 2014 from 53.8% in Q2 2013. We continue to grow the business while holding expenses relatively flat by leveraging the infrastructure investment made over the last few years. This has resulted in a significant 54% year-over-year growth in both non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS. The strong organic revenue growth is attributable to our efforts initiated four years ago when we set our goals to diversify our products. To further enhance our growth strategy, we have acquired Sensima Technology SA, a Swiss company. Sensima is a developer of magnetic sensor technologies for angle measurements as well as three-dimensional magnetic field sensing. Sensima\u2019s patented magnetic angle sensors are used in rotary encoders, electronically commutated motors and a broad range of products. Combining Sensima\u2019s real time precision magnetic angle sensing with MPS\u2019s technologies could offer revolutionized solutions for key industries such as automotive, industrial and cloud computing. We believe Sensima\u2019s unique technology will enhance our diversification strategy and create new opportunities with key customers.  Turning to the deal terms; MPS has acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sensima. The purchase price includes an initial cash payment of $11.7 million, and a subsequent cash earnout payment of up to $8.9 million, which will be based upon Sensima achieving certain performance goals in 2015. Sensima is a free revenue company. We expect this acquisition to be accretive in the second half of 2015. The initial cash payment was paid with offshore cash and any future earnout will also be paid with offshore cash. Now a quick a review of other recent business activities, in the past MPS\u2019s demand creation and sales efforts was driven mainly by our internal sales force. Now we are accelerating these designing activities through the addition of two key distribution partners. We have added Future and Avnet Memec for coverage in North America and Europe. These partnerships will multiply the number of sales and field application engineers focused on selling and promoting MPS products. At the same time, we have been seeing significant design win momentum, new product ramps and market share gains in battery management, cloud computing, and industrial applications. Turning to the financials, our second quarter revenue of $68.4 million was well above the midpoint of our guidance, compared with the first quarter of 2014 revenue increased by $8.4 million or 13.9% primarily due to growth in the communications, industrials, and consumer market. Looking at our revenue by end market, communications revenue grew approximately $3.4 million over the prior quarter to $17 million, fueled by the ramp of networking and telecom design wins as well as our gateway business. Revenue from consumer market increased $2.4 million to $28.5 million on higher TV and gaming demand. Industrial revenue also grew approximately $2.3 million to $12.1 million over the prior quarter, fueled by smart meter and other industrial applications. We are pleased to report that industrial revenues now 17.7% of revenue. Computing revenue increased slightly from $10.6 million to $10.8 million. Moving onto gross margin, our second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 54.5% compared to 53.8% in the prior quarter. Higher manufacturing overhead absorption contributed 20 basis points of growth. The remaining 50 basis point improvement was attributable to the impact of a special non-executive employee bonus expense in the first quarter of 2014. That was not repeated in Q2. On a GAAP basis our Q2 gross margin was 54.2% compared to 53.4% in the prior quarter. The only difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is stock comp expense and the special non-executive employee bonus. Let\u2019s review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation and transaction costs related to the Sensima acquisition. Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2014 were $21.8 million, an increase of $6.2 million from the $15.6 million we spent in the prior quarter. This increase was largely due to $9.5 million legal payment in our favor from O2 Micro recorded during the first quarter of 2014, as a benefit to litigation expenses. This pickup was partially offset by one-time charges in the first quarter of $500,000 for payments to the law firms that successfully represented as against O2 and special non-executive employee bonuses of $2.8 million. Moving onto our GAAP operating expenses; our GAAP operating expenses were $30.5 in the second quarter compared with $23 million in the first quarter. The only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense and transaction costs related to the Sensima acquisition. Stock comp expense attributable to operating expenses increased to $8.2 million in the second quarter compared with $7.4 million in the prior quarter as a result of a higher charge for pay for performance stock plan implemented from 2012 to 2014. Accordingly, we are required under the accounting rules to assess the probability of hitting the performance metrics under the plans on a quarterly basis and record catch up adjustments reflecting our two-year revenue projections. As we noted before, this has increased the quarter-over-quarter volatility of stock comp charges compared to the typical straight line approach associated with time based grants. In addition, we incurred approximately $500,000 of legal and the accounting expenses in relation to the Sensima acquisition. Switching to the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis our Q2 net income was $14.6 million or $0.37 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q2 2014 GAAP net income was $6.4 million or $0.16 per fully diluted share. Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $250.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2014, above the $238.5 million at the end of the prior quarter, as well as a $201.3 million at the end of the second quarter of 2013. In Q2 MPS generated operating cash flow of about $22.9 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises, contributed another $3.5 million. MPS enhanced the $100 million stock buyback program effective August 2013. Under this program we bought back approximately 322,000 shares for a total of $12.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. We also spent $1.7 million on capital equipment. As a reminder, MPS initiated a dividend program in the second quarter of 2014. The $0.15 per share dividend declared and accrued in Q2 was paid on July 15th to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 30, 2014. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter at $21.4 million down from the $22.1 million at the end of the prior quarter and up from the $20.3 million at the end of the second quarter 2013. Days of sales outstanding were down to 28 days in Q1, from 33 days in Q1, 2014 and 32 days in Q2, 2013. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter were $41.2 million, compared with the $39.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased from 130 days at the end of Q1 to 120 days at the end of Q2. Inventory in distributor channel decreased in both dollars and days from the prior quarter.  I would not like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2014. We expect yet another quarter with record revenues. We are forecasting Q3 revenues in the range of $76 million to $80 million. At the midpoint of the guidance we\u2019re projecting approximately 14% growth from the prior quarter. We also expect the following : non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.4% to 55.4%, GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.1% to 55.1%. Total stock based compensation expense of $7.7 million to $8.3 million including approximately $200,000 that would be charged to cost of goods. Litigation expenses of $200,000 to $400,000. Non-GAAP, R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $22.5 million to $23.5 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 39.5 million to 40.1 million shares before share buyback. This Q3 outlook validates our overall business model discussed in prior calls as a mid-point of guidance will produce 25% non-GAAP operating margin. In conclusion, as we continue to execute on our growth strategy formulated four years ago, we are delighted to see these early results. I will now open the microphone for questions. Operator :  (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg - Stifel:  So my first question is on communications and industrial. It had a very strong quarter in Q2. And just wondering if that\u2019s what\u2019s going to continue to drive growth in Q3? Michael Hsing :  I think it is difficult to comment on quarter-by-quarter, but the overall trend is increase because in the past two or three years we have focused on that segment and we generate a lot of design wins. And these design wins turns into revenues and we see a very steady increase in the next few quarters, and in near future. So the next quarter will probably follow the similar trend, but it is not exactly a number but overall direction is same. Tore Svanberg - Stifel: And on gross margin, you\u2019ve had very nice steady increase now for a while. And as we look forward, I am just wondering if we should expect that similar improvement? And I assume that it\u2019s primarily mix driven or is there anything else going on there? Meera Rao :  We\u2019ve been saying for a while that our gross margin improvement is going to improve slowly and steadily and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s spanning out. So we have in the latest quarter Q2, we also had because of the big increase in revenue; we also had a pickup from a better absorption of our test manufacturing capacity that we have, the overhead costs. Our mix also continues to improve as the new products come out. Tore Svanberg - Stifel: Just one last question if I may. Could you update us a little bit on your Monolithic Power Module business? I know that\u2019s revenue primarily is slated for later. But just hoping you could give us an update on reception so far, when you expect more meaningful revenue and so on? Thank you. Michael Hsing : We introduced, as you know we have we have a matrix of product, in the last quarter we introduced few more. And as the release of these products are kind of difficult, we had to go through a full qualification; every one of them had made a deal about 2,000 hours, so we gradually complete that metrics. In terms of our market, reception is extremely well. Our customers and some customers adopted our module very quickly, and some industrial automotive for traditional markets and they follow the similar trend as they do with other business, which takes about 24 months to 36 months to generate any revenues. But we see a lot of designing activities and there are no surprises. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. And your line is open. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James :  This is Vincent Celentano speaking for Steve. I was wondering within your memory and storage business. I was wondering PMIC is looking really strong lately. Do you see this trend continuing and do you believe share growth is part of that? Meera Rao :  SSD PMIC continues to do well. We expect to see growth in next quarter as some design wins ramp up next quarter, I mean in Q3. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James : And then within the LED driver market. I was wondering what\u2019s your shares of that and what you see as the growth drivers? Meera Rao : In the LED lighting market, this is a market that long-term our interest is industrial and the commercial applications. We are playing in the consumer market right now because it\u2019s a good market and it\u2019s very profitable for us. We\u2019re only playing in key segments of this market and not across the board like some of our peers. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: I had a quick question first I think on the Sensima acquisition. I know you talked about being accretive. I think you said on the second half of 2015. When do you guys expect to see first revs from that business? And in the meantime can you quantify the dilution or is it a noticeable impact? Michael Hsing :  I can answer the first part of the question. It\u2019s a small revenue. The key is that we acquire technology, it\u2019s a proven technology and customer accepted it. And so whether you generate $1,000 and $100,000 of revenue, that\u2019s not really important. We see this technology is true revolutionized the motion control. You have mono drivers, you have robots, you have industrials machineries and automotives. And this is really something nobody else has seen it before. And we are glad to find this company and we can beat all. The founders like MPS, and they turn down all the other offers and they join us. Meera Rao :  And the second part of your question Rick. We expect this deal to be accretive by the second half of 2015. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer:  And then my next question is on mix. Obviously it continues to improve as comps and auto and industrial continue to ramp as a percent. What\u2019s the right split for your guys long-term between your sort of four main buckets? And I am just curious what gross margins are going to look like once we\u2019ve sort of hit that optimum mix? Meera Rao : For us the three target markets are computing, communications and industrial, and we\u2019d like to grow those markets as much as we can. We don\u2019t have any internal number that we\u2019ve shared. And our idea is that as we go out in time, when it comes to gross margin there are no headwinds and basically we expect to show a slow and steady increase in gross margin. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: And then just I am kind of curious on TV. Can you update us on what your TV exposure is now and maybe elaborate a little bit on the content increase story there? Meera Rao : Sure. It\u2019s roughly about 10% of our business from TV. And I think we talked about this a couple of quarters ago saying that we\u2019ve got more design wins now in TV and this particularly as you see some of the smarter TVs and some of the power requirements are going up. We\u2019re seeing higher revenues here. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: But can you quantify? I mean is your average content increasing, I don\u2019t know 5% or 10% year-over-year or any kind of number you could put that there? Michael Hsing : We just focused on that, on the market segment really opportunistic, and some of the newer TVs are smart TV with processor-based TV that requires higher power. And we have product and we have a very cost competitive product and we just take -- in the past we took this bucket. And we have continued to do well in those high current sockets. And because our competitor couldn\u2019t even match what we do. So in terms of a real percentage of what the growth is I put a very little focus on it. And maybe Meera can tell you what is our growth pattern it. Meera Rao : I think overall what we\u2019ve got is we\u2019ve got more design wins, so you\u2019ve seen the increase in revenue. I would attribute it more to design win increase rather than a dollar content increase. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Your line is open. Anil Doradla - William Blair : Michael and Meera I have a kind of big picture question. Obviously consumer business continues to do well. You\u2019ve had some benefits from some of the gaming products. But when I look at Monolithic Power one of the key transition stories was to step away slowly from the consumer business and diversify to more longer product cycles infrastructure oriented. Last couple of quarters consumers have been good, last quarter has been good. So how should I be looking at it? Are going to continue working with consumer? But your hurdle rates are going to be based on some higher gross margins? Or I mean can you lay out what the big picture strategy is going forward? And I have a follow up. Meera Rao : Sure, our overall strategy is to go into more and more markets where they\u2019ll pay as a premium for our products. And if you notice some of the newer consumer markets where we have been seeing higher revenues come in the last few quarters. There have been markets that require higher performance, calling for a thinner competitive landscape. And these are markets like gaming, battery management. These are the markets where we\u2019re particularly seeing our revenues increased. So while those happen to be in the consumer marketplace, it still plays into our overall strategy of focusing on performance and where we get a premium for our performance. And as you will see out in time, you\u2019re going to see revenue from computing, from communications, from industrial continue to go up. I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but our industrial revenue is about 17% of our revenue. And just about two or three years ago, it was about 6% to 8% of our revenue. So I think we\u2019re focusing on differentiated products that make a difference to us both from a top line gross margin and bottom line. Anil Doradla - William Blair : And on Sensima Technology, I mean why did you acquire this? Because I am trying to understand the connection between the Sensima Technology and a power management company. What were the synergies and can you give a little bit more color on that? Michael Hsing : Yes, I\u2019ll give you a longer version answer. Let\u2019s start it, that\u2019s motion control, all the motion controls are consistent with motors in them. And traditionally all the motors -- for the last century all the motors in building a similar technology in the last 10 years to 15 years and require higher performance motors that are using a microcontroller. So in order to deliver the power accurate and reduced noise and vibration of the motor, these are considered high performance and much costly. In Sensima Technology we can deliver higher performance motors. By using the Sensima Technology the motors performance will increase greatly and considered even better than any motor drivers in the market now with the microprocessors. So this is a very low cost solution. We can revolutionize the entire motor drivers. So you offered using this solution in lower performance motor can be even better performance than existing high performance motors. So that\u2019s the reason, one of the reason we acquired them. Anil Doradla - William Blair : And finally BCD3, can you give us a sense what was the contribution and how did that grow during the quarter? Meera Rao : BCD3 and 4, the revenues continued to be about 50%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lena Zhang with Baylock. Your line is open. Lena Zhang - Baylock:  So the Company has done real good job on the diversification in the end market, and I believe will continue. How has that impacted your sales in different ranges and how well that impacts as well? Meera Rao : Essentially, we have done a lot of sales using our existing sales force. And if you noticed in the last few months we\u2019ve announced at least two distributors who will increase the number of boots on the ground, and we believe will lead to future growth and revenue as well. And as you pointed out, we have a broad breadth of products and this just takes the revenue to the next level. Lena Zhang - Baylock: But in another words, so how should I expect which region will grow faster than others? Meera Rao :  That\u2019s hard to tell, but irrespective way the demand is created almost all the manufacturing ends up in Asia. And if you notice the numbers we report on the sell through region, and so you are going to see Asia revenues grow anyway. But that does not necessarily mean that the demand was created in that region. So it\u2019s kind of hard to answer the question. Michael Hsing : To answer your question in the industrial market, automotive market takes 2 years to 3 years. So you add more people, the result will be better two years to three years later. It doesn\u2019t change the pattern but change the numbers. Lena Zhang - Baylock: And in terms of the acquisition of Sensima and is your Q3 guidance -- does your Q3 guidance include OpEx from that, because of the acquisition? Meera Rao : Yes, we included about, I think just a little under $500,000 in Q3 for the operating expenses of Sensima. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Mike Lucarelli with Evercore. Your line is open. Mike Lucarelli - Evercore:  If I look at guidance for 3Q, how does that breakdown by end market. Maybe like I was thinking about which one should go faster or slower than the midpoint of your guidance? Meera Rao : As I\u2019ve said before when we look at the granularity of the forecast data, it\u2019s not at the same granularity as we get when with actual data. So I can\u2019t comment segment-by-segment, but I can talk about a few drivers that I see that are going to be doing very well for us, SSD for once, we\u2019re going to see growth over there. I expect to see that gaming is going to do well; we\u2019re going to expect to see growth in battery management or in LED lighting. In TV we will continue to see progress over there. I think industrial particularly automotive most probably is going to be a growth for us if you are comparing Q2 to Q3. Mike Lucarelli - Evercore: What about the design wins you had in server and PC? How is that shaping up? Meera Rao : In servers we\u2019ll be shipping this quarter and next quarter for revenue. In terms of -- in computing on the notebook side. I think the market is shifting from [shock bay] over to [crescent bay] and we are positioned to do as well if not better in the [crescent bay] than [shock bay]. Michael Hsing : The consumers market we expect to do well in the next two to three quarters or even beyond. So you will see some significant changes in the next couple of quarters. Mike Lucarelli - Evercore: And then I guess back into the storage PC bucket. That was only one that was down year-on-year. What are the moving pieces within there, is that ACGs falling off a little bit? Meera Rao : No, it was actually one of the SSD design wins ramp down. But the successor design win ramps up fairly strongly for us next quarter. So it ended up being flat this quarter. I mean computing was flat but SSD within was a little down. But we are going to see that portion go up again in Q3. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Chawla with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Amit Chawla - Wells Fargo : I just had a quick follow up question. I guess what percent of your industrial revenue at the moment stems from automotive solutions? And I guess what percentage of your industrial mix do you expect automotive to be exiting calendar year \u201814? Meera Rao : I would say industrial is an area where as I have said before there are multiple markets that make up that portion. Automotive is one of the market that is growing for us. I don\u2019t think we have disclosed in the past what portion of industrial is from automotive. Michael Hsing : But automotive will be a very significant number, so from this year and going out of this year in to next year. So we may develop that divide it up sometime. Meera Rao : In the future. Michael Hsing : Yes. Amit Chawla - Wells Fargo : And the one final question. I guess as you rollout your broad module product portfolio this year. My understanding is these modules require a higher level of integration. So I guess my question is will this higher level of integration require you to step up spending on capital equipment that\u2019s unique to these modules? Meera Rao : No, in fact we\u2019ve already released many of these modules. We have few others that are being sampled to customer and the rest of them are in various stages of QA. So we don\u2019t need any equipment from an R&D standpoint. Operator : I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Meera Rao for closing remarks. Meera Rao : I want to thank you all for joining us for this call and wish you a very happy day. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a good day.",

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to hand the conference over to Meera Rao, chief financial officer. Please go ahead. Meera Rao : Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS, is with me on today\u2019s call. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today.  Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2014 and our Form 10-Q filed July 29, 2014, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 through Q3 releases for both 2013 and 2014, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. As expected, MPS delivered again. In the third quarter of 2014, we achieved yet another record, with revenue of $28.3 million, 20% growth over the second quarter of 2013. This growth, which was well above the industry average, was organically fueled by sales into high value consumer, storage, and industrial markets. At the same time, the quality of revenue improved, resulting in a 60 basis point expansion in non-GAAP gross margin, from 54.3% in the third quarter of 2013 to 54.9% in the third quarter of 2014. More importantly, non-GAAP operating margin grew from 21.3% to 25% in the same period. As a result, we achieved record non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 per share.  Now let\u2019s talk about a few business highlights. In cloud computing, our [QS Mod] digital solutions have been very well received. This product family, introduced earlier this year, has won many design wins with major customers. We have already started shipping core power for Grantley service. In automotive, MPS\u2019s high voltage and high performance solutions are being designed into a broad range of applications, including the USB hub power inverters, infotainment, climate control, interior lighting, ignition lock, and keyless entry. In the internet of things, MPS has grown in various home automation projects. Our tiny AC/DC products have won multiple sockets where only a few watts of power are required, for ZigBee, wifi, sensors, and similar applications. Our MPM modules are attractive to customers with space constrained applications and we have won several sockets in this market.  In sensors, our recent addition of Sensima Technologies is progressing very well. Multiple European motor driver customers are designing in these revolutionary motion control systems. We are very excited about the future of this technology.  Trying to the financials, our third quarter revenue of $78.3 million was above the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with the second quarter, revenue increased by $9.9 million, or 14.5%, primarily on growth in the consumer, storage, and industrial markets. Looking at our revenue by end market, consumer revenue grew approximately $7 million to $35.5 million, fueled primarily by high value consumer markets like gaming, battery management, and home appliances. Computing revenue also grew by $2 million, driven by higher storage revenues. Industrial revenue increased by $1.7 million to $13.8 million, with growth in automotive, general industrial, security, and smart meters. Revenue in the communications end market was down $800,000 due to lower Gateway revenues.  Moving on to gross margin, our third quarter non-GAAP gross margin expanded from 54.5% in the prior quarter to 54.9% due to improved product mix. On a GAAP basis, our Q2 and Q3 gross margin was 54.2%. In prior quarters, stock comp expense was the only difference between MPS\u2019s GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin. Starting with the third quarter of 2014, amortization of acquisition-related IP intangibles will also be a reconciling item between GAAP and non-GAAP reporting. So the 40 basis point improvement in third quarter gross margin over second quarter was offset by the addition of 40 basis points of intangible amortization for GAAP purposes. Let\u2019s review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, acquisition-related transaction costs for Sensima, and income on an unfunded deferred comp plan, our non-GAAP third quarter 2014 operating expenses were $23.4 million, an increase of $1.6 million from the $21.8 million we spent in the second quarter, largely due to the addition of Sensima\u2019s R&D spending as well as higher new product development costs. Moving on to our GAAP operating expenses, our GAAP operating expenses were $32 million in the third quarter, compared with $30.5 million in the second quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense, transaction costs related to the Sensima acquisition, and income on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp expense attributable to operating expenses was $8.6 million in the third quarter, compared with $8.2 million in the prior quarter, due to a higher charge for pay for performance stock plan and performance shares granted to Sensima employees post-acquisition.  We are required under the accounting rules to assess the probability of hitting the performance metrics under this plan on a quarterly basis and record catch up adjustments on future revenue projections. As we noted before, this has increased the quarter over quarter volatility of stock comp charges compared to the typical straight line approach associated with time based [grants]. In addition, we incurred approximately $107,000 of deal-related expenses in relation to the Sensima acquisition. Investment income related to an unfunded deferred compensation plan reduced GAAP operating expenses by $110,000. Switching to the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 net income was $18.3 million, or $0.46 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q3 2014 GAAP net income was $11.2 million, or $0.28 per fully diluted share. Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $238.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2014, below the $250.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. This reduction in cash was attributable primarily to the $11.6 million paid in July for the Sensima acquisition. We also spent $9.2 million under a stock buyback program to purchase 212,000 shares. We funded our first quarterly dividend of $5.8 million and purchased $2 million of capital equipment. In Q3, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $14 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed $2.4 million.  Accounts receivable ended the third quarter at $24.3 million, compared to the $21.4 million at the end of the prior quarter and the $22 million at the end of the third quarter of 2013. Days of sales outstanding were down to 28 days in the second and third quarter of 2014 on 31 days in Q3 2013. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter were $41.6 million, essentially flat with the $41.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased to 106 days at the end of Q3 from the 120 days at the end of Q2. Days of inventory in the distributed channel decreased from the prior quarter. I would now like to turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2014. We entered the fourth quarter with strong bookings as well as the lowest days of inventory in the distribution channel that we have seen in the last two years. We continue to see strength in many markets. However, we have taken into consideration signals of weakening macro conditions from other analog companies and reflected that in our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $72 million to $76 million. We also expect the following : non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.6% to 54.6%; total stock based compensation expense of $8.5 million to $9.5 million, including approximately $300,000 that will be charged to cost of goods; litigation expenses of $200,000 to $400,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $22 million to $23 million (this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses); fully diluted shares to be in the range of 40 million to 40.5 million shares before share buyback.  In conclusion, MPS continues to execute according to the plan established three years ago. We are seeing positive early results and are optimistic about our future growth. I\u2019ll now open the microphone for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Steve Smigie - Raymond James : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your segments here. In particular, you had a lot of strength in consumer. I think you mentioned gaming. Is that seasonal? And then as we look into next quarter, any color on how the segments might perform? Meera Rao : Some of the strength in consumer, like in gaming, is seasonal. There\u2019s a definite seasonal pattern to it. But one of the things that we are excited is we have gotten into a bunch of new markets that we call high value markets, where they pay a premium for performance products. And those are markets like gaming, where we have battery management, we have lighting, and we have appliances. In all these markets, we have seen growth in the third quarter. Q4, typically there is a seasonal decline from Q3 to Q4, and we do expect to see some seasonal softness in consumer and consumer-like markets. Steve Smigie - Raymond James : And one item you mentioned there, battery management, you guys talk about that a lot. Sorry if you\u2019ve addressed this in previous calls, but can you go into a little bit more detail about what exactly you\u2019re addressing with battery management. Michael Hsing : Our battery solutions in battery management, these are mostly for [polar volts] and then electrical vehicles. So everything from either handheld, some industrial use, to tablets. We have very good solutions. Just two years ago, we released the product, and now we have meaningful revenue. Steve Smigie - Raymond James : And on the gross margin, another nice improvement. I think it\u2019s essentially flat sequentially, but down seasonal quarter. You\u2019ve got a little bit of back end capacity, so is that what\u2019s causing the flatness sequentially, just sort of maybe utilization? And if that\u2019s the case, what utilization rate are we at on the test? Meera Rao : It\u2019s not exactly utilization. We just look at the mix, and essentially expect gross margin to be in the same range in Q4 as well. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stiefel. Tore Svanberg - Stiefel: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you said about the distribution channel. You said it was at a two-year low. Would you care to quantify that? Meera Rao : We\u2019ve been managing our inventory in the channel very well over the last two years, and we\u2019ve been able to hold it at the same level for over eight quarters, I would say. And in Q3, we had addressed some of the concerns that it could be double booking, etc., by shipping early and managing the [unintelligible] concern. And we were able to complete the quarter with lower days of inventory in the channel than we have seen in two years. Tore Svanberg - Stiefel : And my second question is in relation to your computing business. It was up 19% sequentially. Is that a reflection of some of the design wins in Grantley? Or is this more seasonality and then the Grantley designs are yet to come? Meera Rao : . : Michael Hsing : The Grantley just started, and there\u2019s a lot more revenue behind it. Tore Svanberg - Stiefel : Yeah, that\u2019s what I was trying to get to. And then lastly, your communications business was up a lot in Q2. That\u2019s probably why it took a breather in Q3. But can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there? Are we getting to a point now where some of your bigger design wins in networking could potentially start to become more meaningful production? Meera Rao : What we saw in Q2 was some of the networking and telecom design wins that we\u2019d been talking about in the past started ramping in Q2. And what we saw in Q3 was, while we still have good revenues coming from the networking and telecom, we saw a certain amount of softness, I would say, in more traditional Gateway business. These are things like the modems, the routers, the line cards that we sell mostly on the client side. And that\u2019s where we saw a little bit of softness. But the networking and telecom we still saw good revenues this quarter. Tore Svanberg - Stiefel : Given your conservatism, and also the way you\u2019re managing your distribution channels, is it fair to say that your backlog percentage into your guidance is actually very high? Meera Rao : I\u2019d say that we\u2019re very happy with it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Just following on Tore\u2019s question, on the Gateway business, that was a little bit weak, the traditional comms. Is that something that is just choppy, or is it something that you expect to be a persistent headwind? Meera Rao : I think it was just choppy. Michael Hsing : These are the businesses we have. These are the set-top boxes and wireless [unintelligible]. Those type of business, which we\u2019re not really concentrated. What\u2019s exciting about that is that it\u2019s infrastructure. We made a significant headwind and we do expect revenues and world growth. But you know, these designing cycles take two to three years. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : And I guess on a last follow up on the revenue side of things, when you talked about the conservatism that you put into your guidance from what everybody else is seeing, what are you guys seeing as far as the bookings on your side? Michael Hsing : Our bookings, I will have Meera talk about booking. I would say our future is great. We\u2019re executing, in the last two or three years, all the products that we released [unintelligible] to revenue. Meera Rao : In terms of bookings, Ross, we\u2019ve seen good bookings as we go through the quarter. We\u2019re not seeing any signs of softness. But we are cognizant of the fact that if there is a slowdown, it\u2019s going to impact us, and we just want to give a guidance that we\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re going to be able to meet. As you know, we have a history of meeting our guidance, and so we just factored that in. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : You guys have done a great job controlling opex. Can you just talk about how you think opex versus revenues could grow as we think a little bit longer term, into 2015, 2016, etc.? What sort of band should we put about the relationship in growth rates between the top line and opex? Meera Rao : I would say we will continue to hold expenses, but we will have pay raises that will go in the first of each year, which could be in the range of $500,000 to $600,000 impact. And then as we see growth coming in, we will do some investment in the future. We did a bit of that this year. So a lot of it is going to be tied with our growth as we go forward. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Those pay raises, that was on a quarterly basis, I assume? Meera Rao : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: I guess my first question is talking about mix. You guys have doubled your industrial and comms business as a percentage of revenue over the past three years or so. I guess what\u2019s the right mix longer term? And maybe part of that answer, if you could talk about your design win backlog, if you look at how it breaks out, what percent would be sort of comms and industrial, auto, that kind of stuff, versus your more legacy PC consumer stuff? Meera Rao : Right now, we have growth drivers in every one of these segments. And even industrial, which typically is a segment where we\u2019d have expected to see growth coming in slower, we are seeing very strong growth. And as you know, we don\u2019t typically give guidance as to growth by segment, but I think when you see next year, assuming regular macro, you would see us growing in every one of these segments. Michael Hsing : Let\u2019s put it that way. It\u2019s difficult to give you what the percentage of each market segment. What we really focus on, [unintelligible], our customer value, the performance from our products. And they pay a premium, and also, if the market is sustainable, we will growth that market segment. Meera Rao : And the key is also we are focused on diversified revenue growth, so we are happy to see growth across multiple segments versus just one. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer : And I know you talked about premium customers on the consumer side. As those guys become a bigger piece of the mix, should we think of the consumer segments enjoying higher gross margin over time, a better mix over time, within just consumer? Michael Hsing : Absolutely. We\u2019re not going to a commodity. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer : And just a question on the power modules business. When does that begin to ramp in a meaningful way? Is it 2015? Or is this really something more out in 2016? And as part of that question, I\u2019m assuming your consumer business would adopt and ramp the power mods first? Is that right? And then same kind of gross margin question. Is that a gross margin positive versus overall corporate average gross margin? Michael Hsing : . : : Meera Rao : Right now, it\u2019s just early revenues. So we have got fairly big design momentum here. So you\u2019re going to see those revenues start ramping next year, and we\u2019ll see very significant revenues in 2016. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer : In terms of putting a number on it, is this a 10% business unit sometime in the next two years? Michael Hsing : If I think about 2016 MPS growth, in 2016 would be difficult, but it will be there in the next few years. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla from William Blair. Anil Doradla - William Blair : I\u2019m trying to figure out how to ask this question. I know it\u2019s kind of tough, but when I look at Monolithic Power, obviously it\u2019s a product cycle story versus the rest of the industry. So let us say the macro does weaken further over the next couple of quarters. Now, given that you\u2019ve got some very strong product cycles, even in macro-sensitive environments, could you share which are the end markets, or which of the four segments would you start seeing the effect of it on the overall revenue composition? Meera Rao : As you guessed, that\u2019s a hard one to answer, because in all these segments we have both a combination of new markets that we\u2019re just getting in, newer customers where we are ramping up, as well as markets where we are taking market share from our peers. It would be very hard for us to call, because I don\u2019t know how the macroeconomic conditions would impact different end markets. But I can say, just looking at the last few years history, that even if the macro gets weaker, we still expect to do better than our peers. Anil Doradla - William Blair : And last quarter, I know BCB 3 and 4 were about 60% of revenues. How much was it this quarter? Meera Rao : I think still in the 60s. A little bit above. I think it\u2019s getting close to two thirds of revenue. Anil Doradla - William Blair : And then finally, could you give us a little bit more color on the breakdown between TVs and some of the gaming devices? Meera Rao : I would say right now if you look at things like set top boxes and TVs, they would be a smaller portion of consumer, and just these newer high value markets that we talked about, that would easily be a third or more of our consumer revenue. And then you have set top boxes, TVs, and a lot of different stuff that we call general purpose, that would make up the rest of the two thirds. Anil Doradla - William Blair : And finally, if I can squeeze in, Michael, given the mixed signals that we\u2019re getting in China, especially China 4G, you\u2019ve got some exposure to some of the OEMs there. How does that play out for Monolithic Power, the volatility on the 4G buildouts in China? Michael Hsing : The telecom business essentially, for MPS, is at the beginning. As long as our customer is expanding then opportunity for MPS is enormous, regardless whether one region is shrinking or expanding. Anil Doradla - William Blair : So effectively you\u2019re not too worried about the volatility in the Chinese 4G, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing? Michael Hsing : No. Meera Rao : That\u2019s the beauty of a diversified model. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo. David Wong - Wells Fargo : You commented about inventory levels in the channel being so particularly low. So is there a need, actually, for inventories to be rebuilt in the near future, or do you anticipate they\u2019ll continue going down from the current levels? Meera Rao : No, we don\u2019t anticipate that they\u2019ll go down. They\u2019ll be at the same levels or maybe at more traditional levels that we\u2019ve had. So we kind of look at this inventory level that we had in Q3 as a sign of how well we have managed to execute in managing channel inventory. And it also gives us confidence as we look at our Q4 forecast. David Wong - Wells Fargo : And the other thing is, on the matter of pricing, with all your new product cycles, are you seeing pricing going up at all in any segments? Michael Hsing : The new products that we\u2019ve released all have a premium price. And for the competitive landscape, I won\u2019t put my fingers on the elephant and describe what kind of elephant it is. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Steve Smigie - Raymond James : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about gross margin across your end markets. And I guess within consumer, if you could differentiate the low end stuff versus the high end? Meera Rao : Sure, as you know, industrials is our best gross margin. And within the different segments, you take communications, our networking and telecom has a better gross margin profile compared to the traditional Gateways. If you look at consumer, the newer markets that we call our high-value markets, they clearly have a better than average gross margin profile compared to the rest of our traditional consumer. And then when you look at computing, SSD is better than HDD, and the cloud computing margins are very good. Michael Hsing : All the new products and product families, they all have a higher margin profile. And in this conference call, we never mentioned AC/DC, and that product line had a phenomenal growth this year and next year. Steve Smigie - Raymond James : : Meera Rao : No, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s quite half of industrial, but it is growing. We anticipate that at some point in the future, when it\u2019s large enough on its own, that we will break it out of industrial. But I think at least for the near term, we will continue to include it with industrial. Steve Smigie - Raymond James : If you could talk a little bit about LED lighting and the growth prospects of that over the next 12 to 24 months. It seems like we\u2019re kind of at an inflection point for that. I know you\u2019ve kind of got portions where you\u2019re better than others, but I was just curious if you could talk about that overall opportunity there. Meera Rao : We\u2019re seeing a lot of growth in LED lighting, particularly the incandescent bulb replacement. We believe we have a product that has a superior dimming solution, in particular, so we\u2019re seeing a lot of sales from that, and strong growth every quarter. Our longer term view in this market is we\u2019re interested in industrial and commercial LED lighting more than consumer. But right now, when it\u2019s still got an attractive gross margin profile, we\u2019re happy to play in consumer as well. Michael Hsing : That\u2019s well said, and industrial and commercial is our focus, but we\u2019re opportunistic and will take whatever the revenue is with the higher gross margin. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Meera Rao for any closing comments. Meera Rao : Thank you for joining us for this conference call, and we look forward to talking to you in February.",

Q4 and full-year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. [Operator instructions.] As a reminder the conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Meera Rao, CFO of Monolithic Power Systems. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Meera Rao : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS, is with me on today\u2019s call. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2014 and our Form 10-Q filed on October 31, 2014, which are accessible through our Web site, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 through Q4 releases for both 2013 and 2014, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.  MPS is pleased to announce record and allowing you of $282.5 million. Full-year revenue growth of 18.7% clearly outperform the analog industry which SIA estimates accrued 10.2% over the prior year. Four 2014 MPS is non-GAAP gross margin also expanded 60 basis points to 54.6%. Further our non-GAAP operating income excluding the $9.5 million O2 payment micropayment grew 3.6% to $16.6 million achieving record non-GAAP EPS of $1.03, a stellar growth rate of 34.9% over 2013. Over our first decade as a public company we have grown consistently and organically at a compound annual growth rate of 19.5%. Over that same period our share holder returns measured in stock price appreciation grew at a CAGR of 17.5% per year.  Diving into year-over-year revenue growth by market; industrial was up a record 43.3%, consumer revenue grew 22.8% and communications also increased 15.3% over 2013. Let me speak the results of each end market. In industrial and automotive markets, sales rose to $49 million, fuelled by product sales for applications, smart meters, automotive, security and power adaptors. We\u2019ve also seen significant design win activities in industrial and automotive. These design win activities have continued to translate into revenue growth in 2015 and 2016.  Revenue from consumer market increased to $122.8 million driven primarily by high value consumer markets like gaming, LED lighting, battery management and home appliances. Communications revenue grew to $64.6 million, fueled largely by growth in networking and telecom opportunities. Computing revenue was down $1.8 million to $46.1 million mainly due to the ramp down in a huge HD client program that bottomed out in the first quarter of 2014 offsetting the growth in SSD.  Switching to Q4; MPS had a record fourth quarter of its revenue of $75.7 million representing year-over-year growth of 19.1%. Our fourth quarter revenue was above the mid-point of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 54.9%, the same as the third quarter and 70 basis points higher than the 54.2% reported in the fourth quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $18.3 million compared to the $19.6 million reported in the prior quarter and $13.7 million reported in fourth quarter of 2014. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $17.2 million, or $0.43 per fully diluted share compared with $0.46 per share in the previous quarter and $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Let\u2019s review our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2014 operating expenses were $23.3 million essentially flat with a $23.4 million we spent in the third quarter. Our GAAP operating expenses were $31.8 million in the fourth quarter compared with $32 million in the third quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense, income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan and acquisition-related transaction costs basically in the third quarter.  Sub comp expense attributable to operating expense was close to $8.3 million in the fourth quarter compared with $8.6 million in the prior quarter. In addition we incurred approximately $107,000 of deal related expenses in relation to the Sensima acquisition in the third quarter of 2014. Investment income related to an unfunded deferred compensation plan reduced GAAP operating expenses by $110,000 in the third quarter but added $175,000 of expense to the fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis our Q4 net income was $17.2 million or $0.43 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q4 2014 GAAP net income was $8.9 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and investment with $244.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, above $238.5 million at the end of the prior quarter. In Q4 MPS generated operating cash flow of $20.6 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises has contributed $1.5 million. These cash incentive for partially offset by $8.2 million of expenditures on purchase of 194,000 shares under our stock buyback program. In Q4 we also funded the $5.8 million quarterly dividend declared in Q3 and be purchased $2.4 million of capital equipment. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter at $25.6 million, higher than the $24.3 million at the end of the prior quarter due to the higher sales in the third month of Q4 compared to the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were up to 31 days in the fourth quarter from the 28 days in the prior quarter, down from the 24 days in the late year ago quarter Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter were $40.9 million, essentially flat with the $41.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory increased to 107 days at the end of Q4 from the 105 days at the end of Q3. Days of inventory in the distributed channel where once again lower than the prior quarter and the lowest level we have seen in the last two years. I would now like to turn to the outlook for the first quarter of 2015. We have forecasted our Q1 revenue in the range of $70 million to $74 million. We also expect following. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.4% to 55.4%. GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.5% to 54.5%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $8.5 million to $9.5 million including approximately $300,000 [inaudible]. Liquidation expenses of $100,000 to $200,000. Non-GAAP, R&D, and SG&A expense to be in the range of $23.3 million to $24.3 million. This estimate includes stock compensation expense and litigation expenses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 40.4 million to 40.8 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion MPS had outstanding results in its first decade as a public company. A product diversification strategy, backed by MPS proprietary leading edge technology has proven successful. Looking ahead into the next decade we\u2019ll continue to execute strategy for sustainable and consistent growth and thereby enhance value to our shareholders. I will now open the microphone for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stiefel, your line is now opened. Tore Svanberg : Congratulations on the results and I guess on the decade; so my first question is on your communications business, it was up 10% sequentially with sort of bucks the trend seasonally and maybe even in relation with some of your peers, so can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on with that business and would you expect them to continue? Meera Rao : The quarter-over-quarter increase that you find in Q4 was in our traditional gateway business. If you remember back in Q3 had been a little choppy and lower than expected. So you are correct. It is a seasonally higher -- looking into Q1 I do expect this seasonal weakness in traditional gateway business. Our networking and telecommunication business has been steady through the fourth quarter and we expect the same in the first quarter. Tore Svanberg : Very good and my next question and I don\u2019t want to necessarily pick on anything negative but the one area that so decline last year was your storage and computing business, obviously there were some specific reasons why but as we look into 2015 should we expect that business to show growth more in line with what your SSD key business is doing? Meera Rao : Yes because we have less exposure, the client SED business and our SSD business will continue to grow over the year. Tore Svanberg : Very good and then again looking at \u201915 and looking at your four segments, could you may be rank what segment you expect to grow relatively faster and relatively lower? Meera Rao : We expect all four segments to grow and I have never been a fan for ranking them. We expect particularly in a newer products in each of these markets we expect to see very good growth next year. Michael Hsing : And also the computing business and lot of our designing win will comes in as a revenue in the second half of the year. Tore Svanberg : Okay very good and just one last question, can you talk a little bit about your relative visibility here in this quarter, I mean I know this quarter is seasonally a down quarter with Chinese New Year and so on but just relatively speaking, how is your visibility looking for the quarter in terms of the backlog or bookings or anything like that. Thanks. Meera Rao : It\u2019s a quarter where we came in with very good bookings, a backlog rather and we have continued to see good bookings. We feel comfortable about the guidance that given and very confident right now. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Thank you and congratulations again. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Steve Smigie : Thanks a lot guys. Another solid year, I think from that 19% it grow pretty close 20 there, can you comment Michael on what you see as the opportunity for this year, have got any products you are talking about the growth, because you do another 20% growth here or better? Michael Hsing : I can\u2019t particular with what the percentage is although it really depend on the micro economic but I can tell you that whatever we \u2013 in the past three or four years, we did obviously with the [indiscernible] all the result which is coming from what we did in the three to four years ago, in our next year result, as we \u2013 what we have planned to see in the about one to three years ago and every things are the indications of we are on the right track and from a cloud computing mainly the servers communicating sites and also industrial and automotive and all of these segments, we are doing really well. Steve Smigie : Okay great and specific to the server market, we saw obviously convenient and -- rectifier merge and then obviously maximum another competitor in the space, it seems like it\u2019s opening up a lot for you guys because [indiscernible] can you talk about the opportunity in the server market in the 2015 may be even in 2016 as you may be there some designs opportunities to ramp in 2016. Michael Hsing : Obviously, this is another MPS as a player and we have a much better chance now but server market is a very conservative and a [indiscernible] successful now and also the [indiscernible] and we start shipping now. Meera Rao : Just to add to that very quickly, for this year\u2019s revenue all the design wins have already been done back in 2014 and so we seem that play through, I think as next year comes out the things get more interesting because that's where the consolidation in the marketplace plus it will be, our second round in this market all those things would play to our benefit. Steve Smigie : Okay. Last question I [indiscernible] just as we look at gross margin going forward, it seems like you are getting decent traction in your products and this carries higher gross margin historically, what is the gross margin expansion opportunity there as the mix improves. Could it be over 100 basis points or better for the year? Meera Rao : As we have been saying in the past, we expect to grow to our gross margin steadily and consistently. As you know as we get more of the higher margin revenue, we have opportunity to take some of the lower margin revenue so that we can accelerate top line and bottom line growth and we expect particularly the same so I can say all the time our revenue grows I would expect to see a slow and steady increase in gross margin. Steve Smigie : Okay thanks a lot and congratulations on the numbers. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Matt Diamond : Good afternoon guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on for Ross. I want to ask a question that has been alluded to earlier but I am going to ask a little bit a in a different way, could you walk us through the drivers of your long term growth, there is a target out there of 20% to 25%, I am just curious what driver you see to get there over the next year or so, the next two to three years even, any of the biggest positives and negatives that you can see at this point. Meera Rao : As you know one of the key strategy is to grow through a diversification, so we expect the growth to come in from multiple market. For example if you take communication from the growth is coming from a newer networking and telecom market, we could also opportunistically say more in the traditional gateway business. When you look at computing growth opportunity comes both from the SSV storage as well as cloud computing and as we look at consumer particularly on newer higher value market opportunities markets like battery management, LED lighting, home appliances, gaming all these will be growth areas. Not to forget industrial where we have had multiple markets that are growing in industrial as well as automotive and in addition to all this we have module which is the contributing revenue this year. So all these together will be contributing growth for us this year and more so next year and we feel very confident about that we are going to have strong growth but since we don\u2019t focus more than a quarter, I don\u2019t feel comfortable to saying our growth could be X or Y% but you are right a long term growth model is to grow top line at 20% to 25%. Michael Hsing : All of the Meera mentioned, they are all, they are going really well in 2014 and Meera missed another big component of it, the sector DC and that contributes a tremendous revenue and we will continue to focus and it may contribute to grow. Q \u2013 Matt Diamond : Got it and then in same [indiscernible], could you talk about your OpEx trajectory for 2015, I know it has been mentioned that you have enough capacity for these new products but I am wondering if anything has changed from 3Q to 4Q, OpEx as far as the trajectory for 2015. Meera Rao : Our Q4 OpEx was at same level as Q3, although little higher than guidance and probably reason is that we had the higher\u2014new product development cost up that we saw in Q4. So going forward into 2015 other than the pay raises which we talk about in the last calls, we do expect as revenue grows we will continue to increase our investment because that helps us grow even faster in outer years. So we will do some investment in both R&D side as well as in sales and marketing but it will be in line with revenue growth meaning that the revenue growth is going to be higher. Matt Diamond : Okay great thanks very much. Meera Rao : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is now open. Anil Doradla : Hey guys congrats from my side, can you comment about the inventory level in the channel, what you are seeing out there , and I have a follow-up Meera Rao : Sure, inventory in the channel, when they came into the fourth quarter, it was already lower than the level we had been operating in for the last two years, and given the concerns that we had heard across the industry or perhaps some softness in Q4 we continued to manage the inventory in the channel fairly lean into the fourth, and as a result we came in even lower than the prior quarter. And our expectations as we -- as the business improves over the next few quarters we will take inventory in the channel back up to the levels that we typically operate at. Anil Doradla : Okay great, and Michael, recently you are quite the Swiss company Sensima, the specialist motor company; what\u2019s the latest on that front and are there any revenues yet [inaudible] from that acquisition? Michael Hsing : Yes, being with the group and visiting our customers a couple of times, the results are great and some of the opportunity we got with some revenue, and other ones will take a little longer time. In a couple of years our shareholders will think that MPS [inaudible] Meera Rao : And I think the current revenue, the revenue that we have -- we have a very little revenue currently, but the design wins are shaping up nicely and that way we expect a lot more revenue in future years. Michael Hsing : Since technology and it will revolutionize the motion control. Many other competitors, didn\u2019t realize. Anil Doradla : And I don\u2019t know that, but you know you talk about the pipeline design wins and 2 to 3 years or so, shaping on to revenues this year, last year, but there\u2019s a delay. If you want to look at the pipeline and if there was a discount factor to the actual revenues, can you share with us some color about that? Typically the pipeline, is that like the standard -- less than 70%, or whatever happened in the pipeline, it has more or less translated into revenue. Then how that evolved over the time, I mean if it is some qualitative [inaudible] very much in progress? Meera Rao : We haven\u2019t looked at it with a discount to our design win. Typically once we have the design wins we do see revenue come in, a lot of, how much revenue comes in depends upon how our end customers succeed in the marketplace and also depends upon the macro. But we have been, I would say overall very happy with the conversion of the design wins to revenue. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy of Piper Jaffray, your line is now opened. Ruben Roy : Meera, I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little bit of commentary on the service side of the sourcing computing business near-term, kind of what that as expected in Q4, and maybe an update on the Grantley cycle would be great. Meera Rao : On the Grantley cycle, this is one where most of the design win had been completed in 2013 and 2014. We started seeing our first revenue in Q3 and we ramped in Q4 and we expect to see this ramping up -- continue to ramp this year. Most of the design wins on the Grantley service side are in the point of load. We do have a few recor design wins at some of the emerging silver makers in Asia and \u2013 Michael Hsing : In the U.S. Meera Rao : And then the second tier in the U.S. and so this is the first cycle for us, maybe prove our as product, we do happened to have a product, but we have to prove ourselves as a supplier and that our products are reliable. And we are very excited about all the design activity that is taking place for the next cycle that we sealed a better position as a result of having played in the Grantley cycle. Ruben Roy : That\u2019s really awful. Thanks Meera, and to that end on the last bit of commentary, for the next cycle, I guess which includes inventory for the next cycle, I guess which includes[inaudible] from Intel, would you say that you have some of the content driver coming as well as market share or is that just market share, there is no additional content coming? Meera Rao : I agree on those. Ruben Roy : Okay and then just finally I have a follow-up question on the storage side; you had Q1 of last year, the heat from the one OEM, solid-state drive where a big growth driver, I think you are running solid-state drive that maybe a third to a little bit better as a portion of the overall storage business. Do you have any idea as you look at into 2015 based on design wins where solid-state drives end up and then what that might do for growth in the storage area? Meera Rao : SSD drive revenue in storage is more than half of that, I think it\u2019s close to 50%, and so most of our design wins are either on the enterprise side are on the high-end client-side and so our design wins are playing out. We also have a second SSD teammate that we have introduced. This one is targeting PCIE and SaaS and we expect to see revenue on that in the second half of this year as well. And so all these things together will be driving our growth. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer, your line is now opened. Shawn Simmons : This is Shawn Simmons calling for Rick. Congrats for the good results and guide. My first question is centered around your automotive and industrial business, you guys so a nice uptick here last year, I guess. How do you view that business for 2015? Do you expect to see sort of the same incremental growth and can you potentially quantify automotive as a percentage of sales? Michael Hsing : Let me answer that. The industry automotive as you know had a long designing cycle. These are revenues that happened three or four years ago, and we will start to focus on it. And for next year our sphere continues to grow, and in terms of quantifying the numbers, we don\u2019t disclose that. I will let Meera to mention about that. The train is we will focused on this three or four years ago and we continue to focus on and the numbers will grow. Meera Rao : We have already said in the past, for the last two or three years, is that industrial is always the slowest to grow and we expect steady growth and we recognize that they are actually done a lot better than that and I expect 2015 results are going to be better than the slow and steady nature of growth that we typically associate with industrial. But in terms of an actual growth of percentage we don\u2019t get that kind of guidance. I would say at this point automotive is one of the four big drivers in this and I expect as this year goes through it will be one of the fastest growing drivers within the industrial and automotive segment. Shawn Simmons : Okay great and the second follow-up on that. As you have two distribution agreements from last year, and is therefore any chance to accelerate it, that growth in there, how are those relationships progressing? Meera Rao : Those relationships are largely for industrial and automotive revenue, and so the design wins that they are generating would be revenue out later in time just because of the time it takes to convert the design wins in industrial and automotive. So they have been very helpful but that\u2019s going to be future years\u2019 growth. Shawn Simmons : And in my last question is just on the power modules; I know you guys are expecting to see some revenues this year, how significant you think that can be? And where do you expect some of those initial design wins to start ramping? Meera Rao : We have our design wins currently for the first four or five modules that we introduced. We already have design wins that is in practically every market that we play in. But as we have said before, just looking at the time to convert from design wins to revenue, consumers always adopt it, but the revenue we expect to see this year would mostly be consumer. We will be very happy if some of the others converted also this year. So we expected revenue from modules, or am willing to say is -- Michael Hsing : [inaudible] because the number is small. In 2003 we introduced our five or six modules. In 2014 we introduced three times amount, like a 15, 16 and for those products generate revenue in by 18-36 months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lina Tsang [ph] of [inaudible]. Your line is now opened. Unidentified Analyst : My question has been answered. Congratulations as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Steve Smigie : Meera, I just wanted a follow-up on the modules, as you said you talked about it is doing fairly well in consumer. I\u2019m just curious what are the margins like on these consumers; in the one hand I feel like the modules are very differentiated products, so we expect something better but at the end of the day, it\u2019s still the consumer market. So I was hoping to get some color on that. Meera Rao : Yes, we expect the margins on all the modules to be good, even in the consumer market it will be above consumer margins. Michael Hsing : Above corporate average. Steve Smigie : Okay. And you guys have done a good job, again trying to diversify away from just being a consumer company, with that said it\u2019s in some extent good to hear the consumers, how actually you\u2019re going to grow your ways as the modules take off, is that fair to think because of the success in the modules that you can still have healthy growth in consumer? Meera Rao : We expect to have a healthy growth in consumer and not just because of the modules, but also because some of these newer high value opportunities that we\u2019ve found like battery management, LED lighting \u2013 Michael Hsing : These are wearable goods and that\u2019s sports cameras, these are all very high -- customers will appreciate our technology and they will pay for those type of products. I think that internet of things, is emerging and it has a lot more demand for those type of products. Meera Rao : Internet is a thing that presents a lot of opportunities for our modules. Steve Smigie : Under the comment about gross margins as you said you\u2019ll have the newer products growing and getting a higher gross margin that you\u2019re also going to take some lower margin stuff -- you know given that opportunity. Is that lower margin stuff that you would take, is that consumer or is it kind of spread out across the end markets there? Meera Rao : I would say it\u2019s in our traditional consumer may be even in our traditional Gateway business those are the kinds of markets that we play in opportunistically. But the net idea is that at the end of the day when our revenue grows we still expect to show an expansion net-net in our gross margin. Steve Smigie : Right. On that Gateway stuff, obviously you have some exciting new stuff ramping in coms but I think a decent chunk of coms is still the Gateway business? How are you trying to manage that Gateway revenue to use \u2013 do you keep trying to grow that as well or is it more this kind of a cash-cow business. Meera Rao : For us, you know as we see opportunities we keep playing -- how much we pick up is all driven by how our revenues and margins are playing out. It is an opportunistic play for us. Steve Smigie : And you talked about in industrial [inaudible] it\u2019s just you have the new autos, one of the major drivers -- can you just give it up to any other three major drivers in there. Meera Rao : Sure, we have smart meters. We have security and surveillance and then we also have power adapters. Steve Smigie : Any three here, one of those you expect to do better in 2015 versus the others? Meera Rao : Automotive. Operator : And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Meera Rao for any closing remarks. Meera Rao : Thank you for joining us for this conference call, and we look forward to talking to you again in April for our next conference call. Thank you. Have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a remainder today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meera Rao, CFO of Monolithic Power Systems. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead. Meera Rao : Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the first quarter 2015 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS, is with me on today\u2019s call. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2015, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2014, Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS is pleased to announce record first quarter revenue of $73.5 million representing a 22% increase from the first quarter of 2014. This year-over-year increase which was well above the industry average was fuelled by diversified growth in revenue from all four segment. MPS\u2019 non-GAAP gross margin also expanded 100 basis points year-over-year to 54.8%. Excluding the one time payment of $9.5 million from O2 Micro in Q1 last year our non-GAAP operating income of $15.6 million grew 117% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.37 increased $0.20 over the first quarter of 2014. Looking at year-over-year revenue growth by market segment, industrial was up a record 36%, communications revenue grew 27.4%, consumer revenue was higher by 20.8%, and computing also increased by 7.5% over 2014. Let me speak to the results of each end market. In the industrial market sales rose to $13.3 million, fuelled by product sales for applications in automotive, smart meters and power sources. Communications revenue grew to $17.3 million, largely attributable to growth in networking and telecom opportunities. Gateway revenue also increased year-over-year on market share gains. Revenue from consumer market increased to $31.5 million driven primarily by high value consumer markets like home appliances, gaming, battery management and LED lighting. Computing revenue also increased to $11.4 million. Turning to the financials, our first quarter revenue of $73.5 million was above the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with Q4 2014, revenue decreased by $2.2 million or 2.9% on seasonally lower income \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, on seasonally lower revenue in the consumer client based gateway and computing segment. Non-GAAP gross margin was 54.8% slightly lower than the prior quarter. Our non-GAAP operating income was $15.6 million compared to the $18.3 million reported in the prior quarter. Q1 non-GAAP net income was $14.9 million or $0.37 per fully diluted share compared with $0.43 per share in the previous quarter. Let\u2019s review our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2015 operating expenses were $24.7 million. $1.4 million higher than the $23.3 million we spent in the fourth quarter mainly due to higher new products spending and increased compensation cost due to pay raises and higher payroll taxes. Our GAAP operating expenses were $33.8 million in the first quarter compared with $31.8 million in the fourth quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock-compensation expense as well expense on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock-comp expense included in operating expenses was $9 million in the first quarter compared with $8.3 million in the prior quarter. Investment expense related to the deferred comp plan increased GAAP operating expenses a $166,000 in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $176,000 of expense in the fourth quarter. Turning to other income, first quarter non-GAAP other income of $516,000 was $229,000 higher than the prior quarter primarily due to foreign exchange\u2026 Operator : [Operator Instructions] Meera Rao : Now, let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $239.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2015, slightly below the $244.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. This reduction in cash was attributable primarily to the $10.4 million we spent to purchase 203,000 shares under our stock buyback program; payments of the $5.9 million quarterly dividend and $4.7 million of capital equipment purchases. In Q1, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $13.6 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed another $2.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter at $25.3 million down from the $25.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were 31 days in both the first quarter 2015 and the fourth quarter 2014 and down from the 33 days in the year-ago quarter. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter were $53.4 million higher than the $40.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory increased to 144 days at the end of Q1, from the 107 days at the end of Q4. Inventory in our distribution channel increased from the prior quarter when inventory was lower than usual. Turning to the resolution of matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. On April 21, 2015 the IRS signed a formal closing agreement with MPS that resolves the IRS audit of the company\u2019s taxes for the years 2005 through 2007. The resolution includes the following elements. During the second quarter of 2015, MPS will make a payment of $1.2 million for taxes related primarily to the revaluation of a license for certain intellectual property rights of the company, through one of its foreign subsidiaries. The buy-in payment is final and no additional payments will be required with respect to the intellectual property license, for the years under examination or for a previous or subsequent tax year. MPS expects to make a related $1.1 million interest payment in the next few months as well as approximately $200,000 tax payment for the years 2008 to 2013. Under GAAP, the income tax impact is recorded in the period of resolution. Therefore, the results for the second quarter will include a one-time net charge of $2.3 million reflecting the taxes and interest to be paid, partially offset \u2013 which is partially offset by the reversal of previously accrued tax liabilities and valuation allowances. Of the $2.3 million book charge, approximately $1.6 million relates to taxes and balance $700,000 to interest. There were no penalties assessed on MPS. The agreement permits MPS to repatriate approximately $17.4 million of cash from its foreign subsidiary without any U.S. federal tax consequences other than those summarized above. I would now like to turn to outlook for the second quarter of 2015. We\u2019re forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $79 million to $83 million. We also expect the following. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.5% to 55.5%. GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.7% to 54.7%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $8.6 million to $9.6 million, including approximately $300,000 that would be charged to cost of goods. Litigation expenses of $200,000 to $400,000. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $24.3 million to $25.3 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income to be in the range of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 40.7 million and 41.1 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion, MPS continues to execute against its plans and deliver high growth quality revenue. I\u2019ll now open the microphone for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Meera Rao : Just one quick second. Rick Schafer : Sure. Meera Rao : Rick, was the phone line off for a minute during the call. Rick Schafer : Yes, it was about a minute, yes. It was just before you gave the cash number, Meera. Meera Rao : The phone\u2026 Michael Hsing : We can reread it. We read it again. Meera Rao : So yeah just before your question. I\u2019ll just go ahead and I think we were talking about switching to the bottom line. So let me just repeat that portion, on a non-GAAP basis our Q1 net income was $14.9 million or $0.37 per fully diluted share this result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q1 2015 GAAP net income was $6 million or $0.15 per fully diluted share. Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet and then we went on to cash, cash equivalent and investments were $239.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2015 slightly below the $244.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. Rick Schafer : And you were live for that Meera. Meera Rao : Okay, great. Michael Hsing : All right okay. Rick Schafer : So congrats, on a nice quarter you guys. I just had a couple of questions. The first is maybe can you give us a little more color what\u2019s behind the spike in inventory as we look at 1Q, I mean is it supporting a particular product or customer launch or you guys seeing any \u2013 or you guys seeing any push outs or any order cancels or anything like that? Meera Rao : Sure, if you remember most of last year, we were carrying inventory at around 130 to 140 days and the inventory last quarter ended up being much lower. So for over a quarter we\u2019ve been ramping up our wafers in the foundry and this is in support of higher revenue as in Q2 and Q3, these are all strategic builds that we\u2019re doing to support some of our customers and builds we see coming ahead. Rick Schafer : So maybe a related question, I don\u2019t know for you or for Michael, Meera. But can you give us a sense of what percent of your revenues last year came from sort a new greenfield products and what your expectations are for this year and maybe looking forward in terms of your mix? Meera Rao : So if you look at last year our revenue from new products has been coming up to close to 50% of all our revenues coming from new products and for this year also we expect mix to be the same or perhaps even a little richer compared - tied to new products. Michael Hsing : In general, we released the product and then we see revenues coming above 24 months to 30 months later. So if you specify what a green product is, these are we call it a green product. And for this year, last year, as Meera said, it is about 50% and these are products about four, five years ago. Rick Schafer : Got it. Michael Hsing : We\u2019re especially we\u2019re green to these more industrials, telecoms, and automotive and the revenue coming is typically about three years. So, this year, we just will be more fruitful than the last couple of years, we see have a lot more activity all of us three to four years ago. Rick Schafer : Okay. And is there Michael, this is part of that answer. Is there a target mix for you guys? We look forward the next 12 months, 24 months. I mean in terms of do you want your four buckets to sort of the evenly sized in your model like 25, 25, 25, 25 or I guess do you see comps in industrial kind of become a bigger piece over time. Meera Rao : Our target markets are communications, computing and industrials and we\u2019ve focused on growing those markets as fast as we can, we also recognize there is an inherent timing in each of those markets to convert design win to revenue. So as long as we see growth in all of them as much growth as we can get then we are happy with it. So we don\u2019t have a strict number saying we want to have 25%, 25%, we don\u2019t have anything that. We just want to see the maximum growth we can in those market segment. Rick Schafer : Great, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt Diamond : Hi, good afternoon, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on Ross\u2019s behalf. I want to segue to the gross margin line a little bit. The guidance of about 55% is maybe a little given the new products rollouts, it\u2019s maybe a little bit less than one might have expected. I\u2019m curious if that signals a change in mix for this year, just given that consumer was a little bit better than expected, industrial little bit worse, could you reconcile those two dynamics for us? Michael Hsing : Yes, Matt, this is Michael. That signal is it\u2019s a really a noise and it\u2019s not really a signal. So that and clearly where that the gross margins in a range, so we focused on the top line growth and a bottom line growth. Matt Diamond : Okay, I\u2019m sorry. On the - I\u2019m sorry \u2013 [duly] [ph] noted, on the buyback, [indiscernible] that there is an extension for the buyback program, could you remind us how much has been used to-date and how much of the authority remains? Meera Rao : Sure, we have - the buyback was originally the $100 million was authorized through June of this year, through the end of last quarter we had bought about $72.2 million. So we have $27.8 million to go. And this extension allows us to buy according to algorithm that we have put into place. Matt Diamond : Got it. And the $17.4 million of cash that could be repatriated that\u2019s certainly a nice boost. Could you give us an idea of how much of your cash is generated domestically and offshore? Meera Rao : We have not in the past shared how much is generated domestically and internationally, but I can share with you that right now over half our cash is onshore. Matt Diamond : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Steve Smigie : Great, thanks a lot. Now I\u2019ll have my congratulations on some nice numbers here. And then you guys just give guidance for the one quarter out, but I think typically you have some good seasonal strength of September and I was just curious, could you comment on and if you\u2019re seeing any reason at this point why wouldn\u2019t have some decent seasonal strength in the September? Michael Hsing : Yes from, we see the business is a normal and although we give a way we are very cautious for the overall market \u2013 overall MPS is feel a much similar players and that we a lot of opportunity. A \u2013 Meera Rao : Yes, you know we always guide conservatively as you know, we are like to hit that numbers. So we see business in normal macro there we see a normal booking patent. So well, we can\u2019t give any guidance for Q3, I don\u2019t see any problems in the horizon. Steve Smigie : Okay, great thank you. And I guess, you said that you saw some continued gateway strength, can you talk a little bit more about, just give any color more on the telecom on the boards you have got pretty substantial dollar content, that was attracting, so as you might have hoped, or is that still in process, there? Meera Rao : Yes, in the \u2013 on the telecom side we actually saw revenue growth from Q4 to Q1. So I mean, and the rest of the gateway business is all about opportunistic for us, it\u2019s based on the revenue and the mix we decided we wanted to take more. But the telecom side we\u2019re certainly in a growth phase in Q1. Steve Smigie : Fairchild had their earnings call recently and they talked about taking up some dollar content on a server market as they saw Infineon international rectifier merging, which they said created some opportunity for them on the short-term. Is that something you guys could capitalize on your term I know you\u2019d had some nice product introductions in that area or we still have to wait little bit for that stuff? Meera Rao : In terms of the server revenue, we\u2019ve been seeing a ramp in revenues every quarter and we expect that to continue until hit all the design, hit their stride. And we always by most of the design wins are done particularly for the Grantley cycle we are always open to picking up any new business as we see it. Steve Smigie : Okay great, last question was just in computing I think you had talk about within your storage products you are going to introduce some new solutions for SST and I think it was like may be around PCI Express I was just wondering if that\u2019s still on track at this point? Meera Rao : Yes. We introduced the PMIC for the PCI Express last year. And we have design wins and we expecting to have the revenue start in the second half of this year. Steve Smigie : Great, okay. Thanks very much. Congratulations. Meera Rao : Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you and congratulations on the results. A two questions as first of all your consumer business was up 20% year-over-year and I know you had obviously your next generation BCD products. But if you look at that 20% how much of that growth is coming from new generation BCD products versus new applications penetration? Michael Hsing : I think that \u2013 I don\u2019t have the numbers to quantify exactly which is \u2013 and which in that, but overall in the growth some modules business and some other newer products and these are release the products these products released about a couple of years ago and as you know the consumer is always he can gain a revenue very quickly. But this time were a lot more pickier and these are revenues that we make sure, these are just the sustainable revenues and sustainable with the margin. Tore Svanberg : Can I\u2026 Meera Rao : More recently inventory also been looking at our revenues, consumer revenues as a high value market. And what we saw is a lot of strength in the high value market. We also saw pretty good performance in the rest of the more traditional consumer products as well. We saw growth in both. Tore Svanberg : Very good. And as we look at the outlook for the June quarter, June quarter is seasonally a strong period for you. Do you expect to see growth in pretty much all the segments or are there some puts and takes as far as end market doing better or perhaps where is? Meera Rao : As first qualify my answer by saying that we don\u2019t have as granular view by all the different end markets as we do when we reach the end of the quarter. But I can tell you that right now we expected to see growth in most of the market. Michael Hsing : Yes, we don\u2019t see, this time we don\u2019t see any \u2013 in all the market segment MPS percentage is very small, there is a lot of opportunity for us to grow although, we can deviate from a market \u2013 and impact from a macro markets but we are very cautious and we are very optimistic, okay. Meera Rao : Optimistic. Tore Svanberg : Very good. And on the computing side I recognize server revenue continues to ramp, but I know, there is also some potential opportunities to gain some share in notebook core management in the second half of this year. Is that still the case and could you elaborate on that little bit please. Michael Hsing : In this particular market, we\u2019re very optimistic. And we released the product we have a huge attractions and I think this product we do really well. And then in terms of a numbers that we is \u2013 we have a lot of design \u2013 we can lot of design win, we have a lot more design win activities you know then before. And it also including that we\u2019re 12.5 and we\u2019re 13. Tore Svanberg : That\u2019s very encouraging. Last question, if you look at your module business, I know you\u2019ve introduced some new sales strategies there. Is there anything you would like to update us on as far as your sales infrastructure for your module business? Michael Hsing : Yes, let me answer this way first. Consumer modules always comes in faster. Their product cycles about a year or two or so. And industrial, automotive always comes later. And this year we see lot more activity than in a same period of a last year in industrial and automotive market segment. Tore Svanberg : Very good and congratulations again. Thank you very much. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is now open. Anil Doradla : Hi guys, congrats from my side too. Michael, and Meera can you help us understand what the end market dynamics and behaviors on the communication side I know you guys entered into some of the new vertical, so you are a share gainer. Can you share your thoughts on what you are seeing in China and some of the regarding some of the build outs [indiscernible] has reported, now they are not in your same bucket but things are weak on the outlook. So can share with us what you are seeing on the telecom side? Michael Hsing : In the telecom side we\u2019re still very new and then we do to the only in fact I can tell you there is we have a lot of design win activities we\u2019re somewhat in slower than automotive on a very much encouraged by all the design activities from a last year and this year. Anil Doradla : So for \u2013 being a new entrance in this market, you are not seeing any kind of soft dynamics out there that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing, I mean you are just a share gainer there. Michael Hsing : In the infrastructure side yes, we\u2019re too small to say anything, all I see is opportunity. Anil Doradla : Okay, great. And can you remind us how much exposure do you have on the PC side and the notebook side? Michael Hsing : We\u2019re very \u2013 we have some revenues and we pick the customers, pick the project really our customers will appreciate our technology. Anil Doradla : It\u2019s today, I mean when you see very small, would you see less than 5% or 5% to 10% can you give us some sense? Meera Rao : Yes, currently I exposure to the notebook side, is definitely less than 5%. In last year cycle et cetera, we just played in the market very opportunistically. And more excited about opportunity this year, as Michael said earlier. Anil Doradla : Very good. And Meera you\u2019ve talked about your BCD three, four contribution, can you give us an update and finally on BCD side, can you share with us some other end market dynamics and your lead versus the competition, thanks a lot. Michael Hsing : You know BCD4 we\u2019re still lead by our competitor by a wide margins. The BCD5 I can tell you this. Stay tuned now in our product is about being in productions. Meera Rao : And as with regards to BCD three and four, I would say it\u2019s approaching 70% of revenue at this point. Anil Doradla : Great, thanks a lot guys and congrats once again. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Liwen Zhang of Blaylock. Your line is now open. Liwen Zhang : Thanks and congratulations, as well. The first question is regarding your industrial segment. March quarter usually is pretty strong for industrial and the automotive. But I see you had kind of a flattish growth, sequentially. Can you tell me what happened there, and how should I look at it during this quarter? Meera Rao : Industrial I would say\u2026. Liwen Zhang : Yes. Meera Rao : In industrial we saw strength in power sources in automotive and not meters, so this is a market where I mean we saw strength in those in security which has been on a tear for several quarters was a little softer I think in one quarter, but I think it\u2019s more a question, customers having bought ahead. And so\u2026 Liwen Zhang : Okay, got it. Meera Rao : Industrial overall, they also do very well for us in 2015. Liwen Zhang : Okay. Thank you. Another question is, if you can give us some updates on your Chengdu testing facility in terms of capacity, utilization rates, as well as, so far, MPS does all the testing internally, or what's the ratio for the internal versus external? Meera Rao : So we\u2019ve been continuing to utilize the test facility in Chengdu, very expensively and we also have some tasting done outside too, so that we can \u2013 there is no limit on our test capacity. And we have also taken \u2013 we are also in the process of expanding our fab foundry capacity by signing on an additional foundry. And the\u2026 Liwen Zhang : Okay. Meera Rao : Go on, as you\u2019ll see some of the expenses in bringing up that capacity come on for us starting late in Q2 and more into Q3, Q4. Micheal Hsing : In terms of the\u2026 Liwen Zhang : Okay, thanks. That\u2019s \u2026 Micheal Hsing : Okay, in terms of a percentage we have a 600 products and growing, the utilization and particularly from a percentage of a inside and outside is difficult for us to do manage, okay, we will spend more money to manage \u2013 so spend more money to calculate the percentage than as is. Liwen Zhang : I see. Thanks. My last one, maybe one analyst already asked. But I still want to understand better about your gross margin. You have more internal testing as a percentage of revenue, as well as your module product ramping up? Which, I believe, even though in the consumer application that you mentioned before, that product line's gross margin will be above corporate averages. Plus, your industrial segment will grow much stronger this year. How shall I think about your gross margin down the road? Michael Hsing : All the products, all the products \u2013 you know pipeline are just released they are much higher than the average corporate margin, however I said that. We \u2013 the gross margins is in our models we in the at this period of time we should concentrate on the top line growth and the bottom line growth. Liwen Zhang : Okay, got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Amit Chanda of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Amit Chanda : Hi Michael, hi Meera. Congrats on the quarter. I'm just curious, what percentage of your consumer end market revenue is comprised of modules, at the moment? Meera Rao : The modules revenue we seeing increased revenue every quarter but right now it\u2019s still a smaller percentage of our revenue. Amit Chanda : Okay. So, do you expect to release the full suite of module products sometime in 2016? Is that your expectation? Meera Rao : Terms of revenue will be seeing revenue come from more modules as we go in. We announcing the revenue from the first few modules that we released over a year ago. So I think we already have released something like 12 modules. And then we have a few more that will be releasing. So as more and more of these modules get released we also see more design wins coming from them which is up for a good revenue growth in the quarters ahead. Amit Chanda : Okay. Great. As a follow-up, I was just curious for your v-core shipments, what the customer mix is? Is it mostly made up of Asian ODMs, or US-based server OEMs, and how do expect that mix to shake out for the rest of the year? Michael Hsing : Most in the U.S. and some ODMs Amit Chanda : Okay. Do expect \u2013 okay. And you expect that similar pattern to remain for the rest of the year? Michael Hsing : Rest of the year is a quick, yes. Amit Chanda : Okay. Michael Hsing : For the \u2013 we\u2019re 12.5 and we\u2019re 13 obviously hasn\u2019t really started yet in so the next patent could changes little bit. Amit Chanda : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Meera Rao for any further remarks. Meera Rao : I would like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again in July at our second quarter conference call. Thank you. And have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a remainder today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer of Monolithic Power Systems. Please go ahead. Meera Rao : Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the second quarter 2015 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today\u2019s call. Over the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make future projections and statements that involve risk and uncertainty, which can cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that can cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release as well as in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2015, and our Form 10-Q filed on May 6, 2015, which are all accessible through our Web site, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. Today we will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Included in our earnings release which we\u2019ve filed with the SEC is a table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures. Investor should refer to the Q1 and Q2 releases for 2014 and 2015 as well as the reconciling tables posted on our Web site. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available on our Web site for one year along with earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We\u2019re pleased to report that MPS again delivered record breaking quarterly revenue of $81.4 million representing a 19% increase from the second quarter of 2014. This is the 8th consecutive quarter MPS has achieved double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. In addition MPS\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin expanded 50 basis points year-over-year to 55%. Our non-GAAP operating income of $19.8 million grew 27.6% from our year ago quarter and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.46 per share grew 24.3% over the second quarter of 2014.  The strong organic revenue growth is attributable to efforts initiated four years ago. We have since introduced many ground breaking products in new market and consequently we have consistently delivered revenue growth well above industry average. Four years later MPS is expanding into a new $1 billion market besides power management.  We\u2019re excited to announce that MPS is introducing the revolutionary family of solutions in advance motion control. We are setting a new milestone for the next phase of MPS\u2019s growth. We will discuss this new development in detail at our next Analyst Day on September 15th. Turning to the financial, our revenue for the second quarter was $81.4 million which was above the mid-point of our guidance. Compared with the first quarter of 2015 our revenue increased $7.9 million or 10.7% primarily due to growth in consumer, industrial and computing markets.  Looking at our revenue by end market, fueled by higher demand in the security, smart meter and automotive markets. Industrial revenue which represents 19.9% of our revenue ramped up $2.9 million from the previous quarter. Consumer revenue grew approximately $4.1 million due to increasing demand from our newer high value market as well as from the markets they are traditionally served. Revenue increased $1.2 million in computing largely due to strength in the cloud computing and high end PC markets. Communications revenue was relatively flat due to soft demand.  Moving on to gross margin. Our second quarter non-GAAP gross margin increased to 55% from 54.8% in the prior quarter. On our GAAP basis our Q2 gross margin was up 54.2% from 54% in the prior quarter with the only difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin being stock comp expense and charges by acquisition related amortization. Let\u2019s review operating expense. Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2015 increased approximately $300,000 to $25 million. In the second quarter, GAAP operating expenses were $34 million compared to $33.8 million in the first quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense as well as expense or income on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp was $9.2 million in Q2 compared to $9 million in the prior quarter. Investment income related to the deferred comp plan of approximately $100,000 in decreasing Q2 GAAP operating expenses. In the prior quarter investment expenses of $200,000 increased GAAP operating expense.  Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis our Q2 net income was $18.8 million or $0.46 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q2 2015 GAAP net income was $7.9 million or $0.19 per fully diluted share. During Q2 MPS resolved the tax issues arising from the IRS audit of the 2005 to 2007 tax years. We recorded a net one time charge of $1.6 million for tax and $1.1 million in interest related to prior year.  Now, let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $236.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2015, slightly below the $239.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. This reduction in cash was attributable primarily to the $7.7 million we spent to purchase 148,000 shares under our stock buyback program; payments of an $8 million quarterly dividend and $1.1 million of capital equipment purchases. In Q2, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $8.7 million. Another $5.4 million was contributed from cash proceeds resulting from the exercise of employee's stock options. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter at $26.8 million up from the $25.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were 30 days in Q2, one day less than the 31 days reported in Q1 2015. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter were $65 million compared with the $53.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory increased from 144 days at the end of Q1, to 159 days at the end of Q2. Days of inventory in the distributed channel decreased from the prior quarter. I would now like to turn to outlook for the third quarter of 2015. We\u2019re expect yet another quarter of a record revenue. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $89 million to $93 million. At the midpoint of the guidance we are projecting approximately 11.8% growth from the prior quarter. We also expect the following. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.6% to 55.6%. GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.9% to 54.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $9.1 million to $9.7 million, including approximately $300,000 that would be charged to cost of goods. Litigation expenses of $100,000 to $400,000. Non-GAAP, R&D and SG&A expense in the range of $25.8 million to $26.8 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares in the range of 40.8 million and 41.8 million shares before share buyback. Conclusion, MPS continues to deliver. As a reminder we\u2019re hosting our September 15th Analyst Day at our San Jose headquarters. We look forward to sharing our vision of the future at that time. I'll now open the microphone for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Few questions. First of all, just given what\u2019s happening out there in the overall environment could you just talk about your relative visibility going into the September quarter, obviously there is a lot of share gains going on here, but just sort of how are your customers feeling right now typically at this time of the year? Meera Rao : If you're asking the softness that some of our peers have talked about, we\u2019re seeing some softness in a market, but what we\u2019re also seeing is some of our growth drivers and we\u2019re also seeing new opportunities. And all this together with our usual conservatism colors how we look at the quarter. Michael Hsing : As you said -- the growth is really from share gain. And to be more precise, all the gain is from the new segment that we entered in, and which wasn't there a few years ago. So the opportunity is for us is great. So that\u2019s why we see the growth and then we see the growth for the next few quarters. Tore Svanberg : And your inventory days picked up a little bit again, I'm just wondering what\u2019s behind that, is it basically getting ready for this quarter demand or is it the beginning of the transition to new foundries? Just trying to understand what\u2019s going on there please. Thanks. Meera Rao : It\u2019s a combination, some of it was in support of the higher shipment this quarter, and also in support of customers demand and strategic inventory build. And some of it is also we need to hold additional inventory until we get another foundry up and running. So it's a combination of those. Michael Hsing : Let me answer little more or give a little more color. I\u2019m never concerned about MPS's days of inventories because first thing, in a history of MPS we never have any large amount of write off. Because MPS is a product that lasts of six years to eight years. So in history we never -- let's say we\u2019ll never have a material amount -- the large amount -- have a material to stay there. So we never have it. And we have a very small amount of write offs because -- due to engineering issues that weighed [ph] to a technical issue. The reason you see the inventory is, overall in the history our inventory fluctuation is because, firstly, we have a lot of engineering lot and they\u2019re ready to take off and other customers are waiting and other reasons are of course and the manner [ph] and the demand. Than the third reason is depend on our pricing. We can use the pricing to book more materials, if it\u2019s a favorite we\u2019ll book more, if it\u2019s less favorite we book less. So these are the reason that\u2019s driving the MPS inventory.  So I give the reason, Tore I gave long, long answer is because I keep hearing our investors ask that MPS has an inventory, so might as well just give a -- once and for all, I give you all the color, what\u2019s the reason behind MPS inventory. Tore Svanberg : That\u2019s very helpful Michael. Just one last question and I know this is going to be highlight here in about six weeks. But could you just give us a little bit of sneak peak on your advanced motion control new business unit just maybe little bit of more information please? Michael Hsing : We\u2019re moving to a new era. MPS always relates to some kind of power, this one still relates to a power, but more in the motion controls, and then we introduced in a family, it's really software driven and to have our customers can much easier to implement an motions like robot, they can really easily -- ease of use or ease their design activity. And this is not only for robot, anything motion related, including automotive, and it will be much easier for them to design. So we\u2019re going to talk about it in Analyst Day. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Steve Smigie : Just a few quick one, so if I could just to clarify, I think what I am hearing you say is, one of the reasons for the inventory is up, is that, in bad environments like this you guys can usually get pretty great pricing on wafer and so you take advantage of that to lock in some lower cost, is that one of the reasons? Michael Hsing : No, the reason we\u2019re not disclosing why, -- there is a reason that either our demand high or second, we have a lot of a new product launching and the third, we may booked -- have a high inventories because of the favorable pricing. We\u2019re not disclose any of the reason. Meera Rao : Michael was just saying, historically the reasons why we have held higher inventory and he included all the reasons. So favorable wafer pricing is not necessarily the reason why we are doing it now, so that\u2019s the take on it. Steve Smigie : And then on the advanced motion control, you mentioned automotive, would that be for stuff like power breaking, power steering and then could you also it for stuff like -- seeing some of that used in like air conditioning and the other wide goods where you might have a pump or fans, something like that? Michael Hsing : Exactly, even in a car anything move, in the car seat, wipers, mirror and everything moves, or the breaks, and all can use MPS product. It\u2019s much easier to use, we really provide a new platform and other ones, as ACs anything related to [indiscernible], electrical bicycles and anything that move, pumps and anything with really a precise measurement, in that case MPS will replace many mechanical parts and also replace the parts called encoders and is an optical device, we will replace all of them. Steve Smigie : Your auto industrial category was pretty healthy there, can you talk a little bit about what some your bigger buckets are in auto right now? Meera Rao : We have four buckets in industrial that are big for us, automotive being the strongest and the other three are smart meters, security and power sources. Steve Smigie : But you're not like very strong in say, like LED lighting in auto or some other areas that we should be thinking about, that you guys are dominating right now? Meera Rao : So LED lighting, we include a small portion which goes to industrial and commercial in our Industrial segment. The rest of it that goes for incandescent bulk replacement. We include that in the Consumer segment. Michael Hsing : I think that Steve is asking for as in all of business. Meera Rao : Within the auto business. Michael Hsing : I think within the auto business is LED that which were very strong, lot of shipments, lot of designing activities or lot current shipment is in LED and the other one is body automotive, that has nothing under the hood, it\u2019s the body. Lot of DC to DC, these are the product we do in two category, now we shift to auto business. Steve Smigie : You guys done extremely well here on the quarter and the guide relative to other folks, but as we look out to December that\u2019s typically seasonally soft quarter for you, is that -- and not to guide exact amount, but is it fair to think that you would experience the pro-seasonal softness into December? Michael Hsing : We\u2019re not usually talking of others, the next two quarters of our guidance, but I can tell you in -- there is a large significant portion of the business, we\u2019re still very much affected by the macroeconomic condition. But overall the new business segment will grow very strong. Meera Rao : We do know that we\u2019ll have some seasonal weakness in Q4 in consumer and consumer like market and we have our growth drivers. The elements we cannot predict particularly this far ahead is what the macro conditions are going to be in Q4. And as Michael said, we\u2019re not immune. Michael Hsing : I am excited if we can have year-over-year -- and the four quarters of growth, it never happened, I expected -- I wished it happened, but it\u2019s didn\u2019t happen, so I can wish this year. Operator : And our next question comes from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is now open. Anil Doradla : I had one big picture question and then something more specific, Michael obviously you\u2019ve been very excited about this motion control, right, since the acquisition of that small company. But I mean the end markets and applications that you're talking about, when you add them up, I mean we\u2019re talking about billions of dollar. So is it fair to say that -- I mean the addressable market is what $4 billion to $5 billion here for you guys, or are we talking about a very small specific? And when would revenue start coming in from these product lines? Michael Hsing : I\u2019ll answer your last question first. The revenue comes in now. It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s already shipping. But that\u2019s based on the product, the existing, when we acquired from FEMA [ph] based on those products, we already generate revenue. And it\u2019s not a small revenue, its [indiscernible] meaningful to our revenue either. And to answer the other part about what the -- how bigger the large -- the market segments, it is certainly the over well -- well over several billions and not what over 1 billion or 2 billion. Whether it\u2019s 4 billion - 5 billion, we don\u2019t know yet. And that because the end market is growing very rapidly and I think from the Internet of Things and people now that connect to a phone, now the next explosion of a domain is when you do something, do something and you need automatic controls, those are really [indiscernible]. I see a lot of activity out there, there is a lot of small companies and are doing these kind of things. This product is a perfect for them, there is a product of family, it provides a platform for that kind of implementation. Anil Doradla : Now Michael I mean clearly you\u2019re very bullish and I think from day one you were very bullish with this very promising product line. So, why shouldn\u2019t I think of this segment being the next $500 million revenue, I mean this should happen very quickly given that no one is there obviously there is going to be some switching cost, but if there you\u2019re talking about these application in the end market and it\u2019s going to be the way you\u2019re talking about, this could itself power the company to double the revenues at where they are today, right? Michael Hsing : Absolutely, the limiting factor is our sales marketing. Now, and it\u2019s all possible. I think the 500 million, I see a much bigger growth on that. Anil Doradla : And finally, Michael you talked about little bit about pricing power. Can you help us understand what position Monolithic Power is in today, given that the modules are finally kicking in with some of these end markets such as, you talked about automotive industrial? How is that affecting the overall pricing environment from your point of view? Is it significantly better than historical levels or, it\u2019s getting offset by consumer? And how should we be looking at your pricing power? Michael Hsing : Well, our pricing power is, the more as a solution provider, the more we can charge more. And that\u2019s in the last four-five years, our level of integrations and also on top of it and have software and that really gains us our pricing power. And even in the consumer market segments and we\u2019re doing really well. Our customers appreciated those -- the easily used product. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Michael you mentioned before that market share gains were really the driver to allow Monolithic Power to offset what\u2019s going on in macro. Can you talk a little bit, either you or Meera about where you think those market share gains by end markets are the most apparent for this year and maybe into next year? And then I guess as a follow on for Meera on that, for the side of the business that you are seeing the weakness on, what are you doing to encapsulate some conservatism into your model and into your guidance, given what we\u2019ve heard from everyone else? Michael Hsing : Let me answer the first. Of course I am talking about motion controls and I\u2019m all excited about motion control, that\u2019s in the future and Meera can talk about what has been growing in for the last few quarters or so. Meera Rao : The areas where we see growth this year are some of the same markets we\u2019ve been talking about. We are seeing growth in our industrial markets. We expect to continue to see that. Consumer again it\u2019s our newer market to a large extent, the high value market opportunity that we talk about where we are seeing strength. And computing, and when it comes to computing, it\u2019s both storage as well as cloud computing where we are seeing the strength. So on top of all this and as you roll on into next year and everything, we are in the early inning of modules for example. We expect to get a few millions dollars this year. But as we go onto next year and the year after, we expect to see a lot more revenue there. So that answers the question of where we are seeing growth. And in terms of where we are seeing some of the weakness, we\u2019re seeing pockets of weakness in areas like our gateway communications business. We\u2019re seeing some softness in more traditional consumer market and so we have factored that into our guidance and as you know we have a track record of hitting our guidance. So we sit and put a lot of thought and effort into making sure that we are comfortable with the numbers that we guide the street. Ross Seymore : Great, that\u2019s a perfect. I guess as my one follow up, on the OpEx side of the equation you\u2019ve talked about that begin elevated for some period of time as you bring up your fourth foundry. Can you just give us a rough idea of how much of your current spend is targeted towards that and is that something that\u2019s a permanent step-up and then you grow into it, as that foundry ramps or is it something that\u2019s temporary and then will fall off after a period of time? Meera Rao : Well, currently we\u2019ve started some of the work on bringing the foundry from the standpoint of mass [ph], et cetera, but this quarter we just had a small portion of it in Q2 and we\u2019re going to see more of a stepped up cost in Q3, Q4 going into the first half of next year. And the rough estimate is between these four quarters we\u2019ll expand something -- maybe just a little under $3 million on this mass. And then the rest of the increase this quarter is obviously for some of the sales and marketing that we need, to the people we need to hire in support of growth in newer market. Michael Hsing : Let me talk about OpEx, I don\u2019t imply MPS will grow tremendously in OpEx. Look at the history, we always grow less than the revenue growth in the history of MPS. And some years ago it goes up a little bit higher than other. If you look in the last four years, and how we expect the next four years will be at similar levels in the plus/minus. But overall I said earlier, MPS growth is limited by our sales marketing. The reason I said I can get into a little more. Four years ago we tried to enter this new market segment so we\u2019re knocking on the door for about two years. Then the four years later we see the door open, we\u2019re in it and there we see lot more opportunity, in that we can grow. But we still want to grow very manageably within the same pattern as in the last four years. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rick Schafer : You guys continue to do great, just in general. I think compared to some others in your peer group. I guess I\u2019m just trying to quantify great, I mean for instance if talk about automotive, I think automotive revenues doubling -- potentially doubling annually for you guys over the next few years which would give us line of sight to that automotive business being something like a $100 million business in the next three or four years potentially. Are there other opportunities out there I\u2019m guessing that e-motion could be another one of those categories. But are there opportunities like automotive that you can lay out for us so we can kind of get a sense of some of these bigger pieces of the pie and how they\u2019re going to ramp over the next, let\u2019s just say three or four years. Michael Hsing : I think as the e-motion is across the boat, I mean that and also some of the new emerging market segments, so it\u2019s big enough there. For all our business that you said 100 million, I don\u2019t know 100 million, but in the last few years we grew 100%, we double it every year, is because of we\u2019re small. And growing next couple of years -- in the two years out, I don\u2019t know if we can still double it that will be lot more difficult. But e-motion is -- so far, sky is limited. Rick Schafer : Since you mentioned it, how far out is it -- if you want to call it the tipping point? But how far out is that business from sort of hitting that tipping point, the e-motion piece, is that -- and maybe able to find out it\u2019s maybe like a 10% revenue kind of driver, 10% of business kind of business. Michael Hsing : I think on the consumer side, like a drone, we think generally revenue very quickly. I see a lot of emerging market like a robot, and artificial intelligence, a robot driven by artificial intelligence both are emerging. And I think I truly believe they will more and more, these are all coming. For 10% of MPS revenues -- MPS also growing and I think as we\u2019re going to -- in the next three or four years, I think that we\u2019re going to be -- we\u2019d be more than 10% of MPS revenue. Rick Schafer : Got it. And if I could just speak one last one, just on the v-core. We\u2019ve talked about the v-core ramp in the second half for you guys and I guess maybe how much this v-core content really go up with Skylake in your eyes. And how big can this business be for you guys here in the second half and that's it. Thanks. Meera Rao : For the Skylake that's mainly into the notebook business, while Skylake is more interesting than the cycles that have come before. We still tend to view this more opportunistically because the strategic focus continues to on servers. We do believe that this is going to be a stronger cycles and will only play in the high end of the PC business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. David Wong : Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of where the growth in consumer is coming from? This one of your biggest divisions which has been growing at 20% plus year-over-year. So, have you gone into some new segments, do you have new products in particular applications? What is the biggest driver in this segment? Meera Rao : So, these are our four new markets that we have entered in the last few years that we call our high value market segments and that's where we are seeing most of our growth in consumers coming from these. And just to remind you these are home appliances, these are battery management, LED lighting as well as gaming. So these are the four markets that we are seeing most of our growth in consumer. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Lina Zhang for BayRock [ph]. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you for taking my question and congratulations as well, you guys just keep surprising street. So I have one puzzle in my mind and that given strong growth in the top line as well as in the street grow most and also Michael you mentioned that you are now at favorable pricing some foundries. So, it seems like gross margin expansion is kind of not as --. Michael Hsing : No. let me break you first. We have not increase of inventory it\u2019s not because we have a favorable pricing I didn\u2019t say that. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, I know. Meera Rao : I has historically been one of the reasons in some of the prior growth, not this one. So just to make that clear. Michael Hsing : Alright. Unidentified Analyst : I understand. Thanks for the clarification. But if you look at your top line growth, very strong, especially is this kind of tough market environment, right. And you look at industry growth it's almost more than 30% growth year-over-year in the at last six quarters. So, my puzzle is, it seems gross margin expansion is kind of behind than this kind of two strong growths and -- or you can help me to give me the factors which is in your gross margin, was factors to decide your gross margin? Meera Rao : It's very simple. As we have said before, as we see more and more revenue come from higher margin opportunities. We also take more of the lower margin revenue and these are in markets like, some of our traditional consumer market or it could be in the gateway business in communications or some time even in notebook. And these are opportunities where as we get more of the higher margin revenue, we do take that. So the idea is if you look at our long term model our gross margin is well within that at the 55% level and so we actually optimize our top line and bottom line more. At the same time showing a steady expansion in gross margin. And we have always talked about the gross margin expansion as a steady growth, it's not a raise. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. And also in terms of your new product line motion control and Mike did mention that down the road it will be above 10% of total revenue. So, should we expect you will give us a breakdown, when it reaches a certain amount of revenue? Meera Rao : When it reaches a material amount of revenue, we would most probably consider breaking it out, but we are not at that point yet. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. And the best of luck that. Thanks. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Meera Rao : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further question at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Meera Rao for closing remarks. Meera Rao : Thank you, Candus. I would like to welcome you all to come and attend our Analyst Day that's going to be on September 15th, at our headquarters in San Jose, it will be at 9 :00 AM California time or noon East Coast time and we\u2019d love to have you all come and attend. Where we can share with you how MPS is going to grow in the years to come. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker) Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Ma'am, please begin. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter 2015 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today's call. Over the course of today's conference call, we will make future projections and statements that involve risks and uncertainty, which can cause results to differ materially from management's current news and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release as well as in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2015, and a Form 10-Q filed on August 3, 2015 which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. Today, we will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to a measure the financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC, is a table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures. Investors should refer to the Q1 through Q3 releases for 2014 and 2015, as well as the reconciling tables posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Once again, MPS delivered record-breaking quarterly revenue of $91.2 million, representing a 16.4% increase from the third quarter of 2014. For nine consecutive quarters, MPS has enjoyed double-digit, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth. In addition, MPS's non-GAAP gross margin expanded 20 basis points year-over-year to 55.1%. Our non-GAAP operating income of $23.8 million grew 21.3% from the year-ago quarter. Our third quarter operating margin also rose from 25% in the year-ago quarter to 26.1% in the third quarter of 2015. More importantly, non-GAAP earnings of $0.55 per share represented an all-time record and grew 19.6% over the third quarter of 2014. Looking at year-over-year quarterly revenue growth by market segment, computing and storage revenue was up 40.9%, industrial grew 36.9% and consumer revenue also increased by 11%. Let me speak to the results of each end market. Storage and computing revenue rose to $18 million driven by growth in cloud computing, high-end PCs and storage. In the industrial market, revenue grew to $18.9 million fueled by product sales for applications in automotive and power sources. Revenue from consumer markets increased to $39.5 million, largely attributable to growth in high-value consumer markets like home appliances and battery management. Revenue in the communications market of $14.8 million was down on lower networking and telecom revenues. Turning to the financials. Our revenue for the third quarter was $91.2 million, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with the second quarter of 2015, our revenue increased $9.8 million primarily due to growth in computing, industrial and consumer markets. This sequential growth of 12% was well above industry average. Looking at our revenue by end market, computing revenue grew sharply by $5.4 million from the second quarter on strong growth in SSD storage, as well as growth in high-end PC markets and servers. Consumer revenue increased by $4 million due to increasing demand from our newer high-value markets such as gaming, home appliances and battery management as well as from the markets we have traditionally served. Fueled by higher demand in the automotive and power sources market, industrial revenue, which represents 20.7% of our revenue in the third quarter, ramped up $2.6 million from the previous quarter. Communications revenue declined by $2.2 million due to soft demand primarily in our traditional gateway markets. Moving on to gross margin. Our third quarter non-GAAP gross margin increased 10 basis points over the prior quarter to 55.1%. On a GAAP basis, our gross margin was 54.2% in both Q2 and Q3 with the only difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin being stock comp expense and charges for acquisition-related amortization. Let's review operating expenses. Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2015 increased approximately $1.5 million to $26.5 million. In the third quarter, GAAP operating expenses were $36.1 million compared to $34 million in the second quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense, as well as expense or income on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp was $10.2 million in Q3 compared to $9.2 million in the prior quarter. Q3 GAAP operating expenses benefited from a $500,000 increase in investment income related to the deferred comp plan. In the prior quarter, GAAP operating expenses included $100,000 of investment income related to the deferred comp plan. Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 net income was $22.4 million or $0.55 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q3 2015 GAAP net income was $11.2 million or $0.28 per fully diluted share. During Q2, MPS resolved the tax issues arising from the IRS's audit of the 2005 to 2007 tax years, we recorded a net one-time charge of $1.6 million for tax and $1.1 million in interest related to prior years in the second quarter of 2015. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $235 million at the end of the third quarter of 2015, slightly below the $236.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. This reduction in cash was attributable primarily to the $13.6 million we spent to purchase 284,000 shares under our stock buyback program, payment of an $8 million quarterly dividend and $2 million of capital equipment purchases. In Q3, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $21 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock plan purchases and from the exercise of employee stock options contributed another $1.3 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter at $30.5 million, up from the $26.8 million at the end of the prior quarter on higher third quarter revenues. Days of sales outstanding were 30 days in both the second quarter and third quarter of 2015. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter were $67.3 million compared with the $65 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased from 159 days at the end of Q2 to 147 days at the end of Q3. Days of inventory in the distributor channel decreased for the second consecutive quarter. I would now like to turn to outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015. Despite the softness in the economy, MPS expects to achieve a record fourth quarter. Our revenue guidance is in the range of $84 million to $88 million. At the midpoint of the guidance we are projecting 13.6% growth over the comparable quarter from a year ago and a 17.6% growth for the year. We also expect the following : Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.6% to 55.6%, GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.9% to 54.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $9.5 million to $10.5 million, including approximately $300,000 that would be charged to cost of goods. Litigation expenses of $200,000 to $400,000, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense in the range of $25 million to $26 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares in the range of 41.1 million shares to 41.5 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion, as expected we outperformed the market. I'll now open the microphone for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is open. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. My first question on your consumer business. I know the high value segment has become a larger and larger percentage of that business. Could you give us a ballpark on where you are with the high value as percentage of the consumer bucket? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : It's more than a third of our consumer revenue, approaching 40%, I would say in the third quarter. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, very good. Okay, and... Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Tore, the application is a variety of Internet of Things (13:11), okay. If it's related to Internet and also some wearable stuff in sports cameras, and that kind of things, and we see there's a lot more activity in recent years. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And the strength you're seeing in server storage, it sounds like that's primarily SSD related. So when we think about the opportunity that you have in the server market, especially on things like core power, that hasn't even started right just yet, right? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : The core power we have a few customers from last year, we start to ramp, and the bulk of a core power ramp would be end of the next year, the early 2017. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, very good. And, Meera, I think you mentioned that distribution inventories were down again this quarter. Could you maybe add some color there, how low can they possibly go, and what types of visibility discussions are you having with some of your end customers at this point? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. As we have done in the past, anytime we hear any suggestions of macro weakness, we typically hold inventory in the channel and that's what we have done now for two quarters in a row. And as you're aware, if we continuously keep it down, there's sometimes panic of shortage, so we'll continue to watch inventory in the channel and manage it as low as we can without generating any panic. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. Congratulations on the results. Very impressive. Thank you. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys, this is actually Matt on Ross' behalf. Congrats on the great results as well. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I wanted to ask you about the comms market. I know that it was mentioned that softness in the traditional gateway market happened in 3Q, but if you could extrapolate a little bit further on that, just to get a better idea of how long the weakness is expected to persist and what could catalyze its rebounding? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Most of the traditional market is \u2013 the traditional gateway market is something that's got lower gross margins, so it's not a market that we pursue aggressively. So if the demand is low, we just let it play out. We are more strategically focused on other markets, which have higher gross margin profile. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Duly noted. And the OpEx plan, it was mentioned last quarter that there's a little bit of a step-up given the ramp in the fourth foundry. I just wanted to calibrate that for the fourth quarter. Should we still expect \u2013 heading into 2016, rather, should we still expect a little bit of alleviated OpEx heading into 1Q or has something occurred to change that? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : No. One of the things you would have noticed is we have reduced our OpEx a little bit this quarter on the fourth foundry, and you'll see that spill over into the first half of next year. So we continue to invest in our fourth foundry. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Smigie of Raymond James. Your line is open. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot and add my congratulations on pretty good results in a pretty tough environment. I was hoping you could comment a little bit on how you think about seasonality going into the first calendar quarter. I mean, you have a very nice guide here which to me looks better than seasonal, so does that mean we should be a little bit more cautious on the March quarter before you got some big ramps next year? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : You know, at this point we don't give guidances for Q1, so we tend to look at \u2013 seasonally, we are typically down 5% to 10%, then it's a question of how much growth do we have to offset it and more importantly what's the macro. So at this point, I can't give any color on Q1. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. But overall as you pointed out, you guys have been getting double-digit growth year-over-year for quite a while. Is it fair to think that calendar 2016, we could probably see continued double-digit growth there, could that be 15% or something even higher like we saw this year? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I think the growth will be accelerating and if not like 16% (18:10), will be in 17%s (18:12), and we are really targeting more than 20% growth, and you see the results, just the recent results, this is at the beginning, and since last couple years we released all the right product to the right customers and the result in two or three \u2013 in a couple of years \u2013 well, two years or three years since last years and that will really accelerate MPS growth. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. And last question was just, can you give any new color on motion control programmability? Any new color there would be great? Thanks. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : The motion controls products we'll release in the first half of next year, and this is the product, not the same as what we do before and before we always have fixed products and you have design wins and once when the product is ready and now there's all \u2013 F (19:28) solution based and a lot of them is based on FPGAs and even before we have a product ready, and we could engage with a lot of those customers. And so we have a lot of tremendous design activity going on now. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then any color on \u2013 update on color on the programmability that you mentioned at Analyst Day? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. The other one is the module ones and the power modules and also the FPB, FPPM (20:07) and Field Programmable Power Modules and the Field Programmable Power IC, FPPC (20:12). And those are still very much on schedule. As we're speaking we're releasing many products now. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Could you give us some idea as to how your R&D expenses might trend out next few quarters and what your highest priorities will be in terms of new projects that you're investing in? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : So in terms of R&D, as well as sales and marketing, we will continue to invest because everything that we do in terms of resources we bring on board next year actually sets us up even better for growth a year or two out. So we will continue to do that, but we expect at the end of the day, they'll be leverage to the bottom line. Places where we'll spend on R&D, one is going to be the fourth foundry, the bring up the foundry. The second is going to be on differentiated products, which are targeting at different markets, some of which we have discussed in the past, some of which we will be discussing over the next year or two. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Overall, the R&D growth, okay, and expenses growth will be much less than the revenue growth and you see our history. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Your line is open. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Let me second (21:52) my congratulations. Just wanted to come back, Meera, looking at the breakout by end market, the compute (21:58) was up nicely and telco down to the lowest level in probably five quarters or six quarters. Just trying to get a sense on the compute side, do you think that SSD strength continues or was there sort of some, one-time business that you are able to take advantage of in the quarter? And then similarly on telco, I know that the telco market has been fairly weak, especially in some of the wireless comm infrastructure. But some of your peers have started to say, they're starting to see some uptick in comm infrastructure, wondering if you're seeing any pickup there. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. When we look at computing, in storage, SSD storage, we had a new design win that started ramping up for us in Q3 and that was part of the growth. In Q4, as far as storage is concerned, I see two things playing out. We typically sell our SSD products both to enterprise as well as high-end client, and there's usually seasonal weakness in both Q4 and Q1 on the high-end PC side of it. The second I think, overall, there is some softness in both HDD and SSD, particularly as we go into Q4. In terms of our communications, a lot of the weakness that we're seeing there has been in our gateway business. These are things like modems, routers, LAN cards that are sold to the home and the home office. There's also a little bit of weakness, I would say, in the networking and telecom side of the business, and there it's a mix of wired markets as well as wireless, so we're seeing a little bit, but I'd say more of the weakness is in the gateway side of the house. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: And just sort of two follow-on questions, can you give us any sense what percent gateways might be of the overall comm bucket? And then if you take a step back looking out at the broader business, across all end markets, obviously, the economy seemed to take a little bit of a breather. Over the summer, we saw a lot of the analog, mixed signal group indicating order softness. To the extent that you saw that slowdown late summer, would you say things have stabilized now or orderly times still fairly short and difficult to predict? I mean, a couple of your peers have said think we're through the worst of it, wondering if you might be able to make a similar comment. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : In terms of the auto momentum, we typically record (24:37) six weeks to eight weeks lead time to our customers, except for a few new products, which might have a slightly longer one, and we have not seen any change from that standpoint. I mean, we are \u2013 I guess, we are in so many different markets that we never feel comfortable quite calling the macro. We depend upon our larger, more stable competitors to call them macro for us. So if I were to say markets where we have seen some weakness, I would say it's in the traditional gateway business for the home, home office. I'd also say there's some in storage. Beyond that, I couldn't really comment about the macro. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : That's the beauty of the MPS, we are in a position we don't know, so okay (25:25). Everything is a good opportunity for MPS. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ruben Roy of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you. I had a follow-up on that last discussion topic as it relates to the distributor channel inventory. Meera, you talked about the inventory down for second consecutive quarter and you answered a question around that. I'm just wondering, what's going on in Bisbee (25:57)? Is that being actively managed down for any reason, would you say? Have you guys seen any change in the way distributors want to hold inventory at this point based on what they're seeing from the macro? And also I don't think I caught it, but can you give us the range, historical range in weeks that you typically see in distribution and where you are within that range at this point? Thank you. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Our typical range is about 30 days to 45 days of inventory. And we typically prefer to hold in the upper half of that, so we have not seen any particular push from distributors to hold less. This has been more something that we have actively managed and we have done in prior years as well, whenever we start seeing signs of a macro weakness, we start managing the inventory and the channel to the best we can so that the days come down and that's what you see played out for the second time. Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, hi, Ruben. I try to convince our shareholders that our inventory is not really like a traditional mature semiconductor company. It's indicating of a future business. I'm guess I'm losing the battles. This is the growth (27:33) company, and we have a lot of product released, and what kind of inventory holds and it really depend on what kind of product that we released. So that's how I can best put it. So slight inventory change, okay, it doesn't mean our futures. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Add on to that, in terms of the inventory, the internal inventories that we hold, we are now at about 147 days. Internal model is about 135 days to 155 days, and we expect in the next few quarters, there'll be more around the 150 days for all the reasons that Michael talked about, particularly the new products, as well as inventory needed to support our strategic customers. Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Right. Yeah, that's helpful. I was trying to see \u2013 get to whether or not anything had changed in distribution behavior, but I understand what you're saying, Michael. So thank you for that. Just a quick follow-up. In terms of the end market mix, obviously, there's some near-term issues going on in communications and you had a new design win ramping within storage. But as you look out into next year, would you say that the mix would be sort of similar to historical levels with communications still sort of in the low to mid-20%s as a percentage of revenue, and maybe if you could comment on if there are any changes that you're seeing with mix as you look ahead to 2016 based on design wins, et cetera, if any of that may impact gross margin. Thank you. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : So, when we look out into 2016, I'd expect to see growth in computing, consumer, and industrial markets. Communications, I'm guessing, is going to be mostly flat. And all the revenue drivers are essentially all the different drivers we have talked about in the past. I continue to believe that industrial is going to see strong growth next year with automotive markets leading the way, but you'd also expect to see growth in smart meters, in security, in power sources. In consumer, we expect to see the newer high value markets continue to grow and in the computing section, it would be SSDs, servers, as well as high (30:13), and a module business would also continue to grow and AC-DC, which is distributed among all these markets, would also be growing next year. So, we expect to see multiple areas of growth. Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Thank you, Meera. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. Michael, you mentioned strong design win momentum for e-motion (30:44). Can you talk a little bit about the number of design wins, or quantify the number of design wins you guys have so far. I know it's a new product and it's early days, but just to give a sense of maybe what that equates to in terms of dollars of backlog or any kind of color around that you could give? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'm so far as you know, we talked about, we have a separate chips now, (31:08), and a real e-motion (31:10) chip that we're going to release next year, and those we use \u2013 now use a programmable third-party product and that's FPGAs to do the feasibility study in our customers' systems. And so, it's hard to quantify in a dollar sense (31:42), but the SANS (31:44) portion of it we have a \u2013 we generate revenues, and I don't know what is the revenue numbers now. It's not small. Well, small means, in our case, it's still \u2013 now, small means it's still some millings (31:58), okay, and for the entire next years. Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And maybe a follow-up to that is, are there any hints of competition? I mean what are you seeing from the legacy guys? How are they responding in that space, or are they responding? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay, to them it's shocking and the good or bad and the good things is, wow, you can do this. And then now is the bad thing is really a behavior change. Okay. People change the design their system in a different way. And they don't have to use the encoders (32:46). They don't have to use the step models, and they don't have to use a brushed model anymore. And there's a momentum, think the brushless models, whether encoders (33:02) costs very, very high, and now when you look at this solution, its cost is so low. And overall they had to get over this barrier somehow in terms of how they design in their system. And so obviously, and it is a large market segment in like a printers and some of the traditional robots and they were adopting a first, and so still these are design cycles \u2013 is a one year or just a couple of years. Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And I know you've talked in the past about sales and marketing, maybe as a gating factor on your growth. I mean, this sounds like a perfect example, where you're going to have to help kind of get people over the hump or get people comfortable with the new solution as compelling as it is. I mean, should we read anything into that in terms of like looking into 2016, 2017, should we expect to see some of your sales and marketing expenses maybe take a step up as a percent of revenues or any change, I guess, maybe to the model you've been running? I think, Meera, correct me, but I think you've been running overall OpEx at sort of 50%, 60% of your top-line growth. But just basically looking to see if any of that was going to change. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : That's a very sensitive question, (34:34), yeah. And let me answer in that way. Our long-term shareholder, everything what we do is affect us three years, four years out. So, for the long-term investors and have the same kind of a length and so then our company's goals is perfectly lined up with our investors, but other long term is shorter than three years, four years, like one year to two years, then it's a not quite aligned with it. We published the models and we're going to grow the OpEx in slightly less than half of a revenue growth, which to me doesn't quite make sense and \u2013 but we balanced our shareholders' interest there. Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Thanks, Michael. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. I give you very political answer, so that's how we do it. Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is open. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys, congrats on the great results. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Couple questions. On the auto side, Meera and Michael, can you remind us how much is the contribution as part of industrial? And also with the recent controversy on Volkswagen, does that have any impact? I know you guys are very small on this overall market, but would love to hear some feedback on that because we get questions by clients on that. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we are very small and secondly, we're not in engine (36:21), okay. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: And on the auto side? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : It doesn't really affect us, okay, in terms of automotive. We're more into lighting, infotainment, and more the lightings, all kinds of lightings, okay. You have security, okay, you have lightings and illuminations, and okay (36:47), also the dashboards and we have \u2013 the other one is the camera side, and okay (36:55). So we have a lot of design activities, and it really doesn't affect. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: And what is the contribution, Meera, of auto to the overall industrial? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : I'd say among the four growth drivers in industrial, it's the biggest. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : So we don't give a percentage out. Okay. And next year we have to break out. Okay. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. So it's going to be material up (37:24), that's good to know. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Now, typically on the telecom side when we look at the big metal guys, when we go to the slump or weakness, we've historically seen based on precedence call it a three quarter air pocket and we come back. Now, Meera and Michael, based on your experience, with even the gateway business, I mean, I'm thinking it should be shorter air pockets, but do you have any experience with the duration of softness once you get into the space from MPS's point of view, any perspective? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : I mean, we have seen it be one quarter like we did last year. The two years prior to that, it was each two quarters. Before that, it has been three. When it comes to macro weaknesses and stuff, we just don't feel comfortable. I can look at it afterwards and say what we saw. I want to emphasize again that the gateway business is low margin and we just play in opportunistically. So we don't spend a lot of time doing any soul searching in the space. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And finally, Michael, on the \u2013 I saw some press release from TI, some product, now it was not brushless, it was around brush, but it was around sensing, could have been one of those small ancillary press releases. But coming back to your (38:48) \u2013 I think someone asked a question related to that. What is competition doing on it? Are they trying to beef up their assets in this space, or they're totally clueless or they're not focusing on it? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : They are (38:59), I think they do some current sensing. The current sensing and I don't know if you refer that one. I know \u2013 there's a product release and there's a current (39:08) \u2013 integrated with a current sensing. The current sensing \u2013 the model (39:13) driver, we released two years ago. These are... Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Our sensing is the sensing that rotor of the models and that's a Siemens (39:26) technology. So it's entirely different. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So e-motion product stocking (39:31) is much more advanced than the products that you were just talking about. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Very good. And congrats once again. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is open. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. I just had a few follow-ups. First of all, your business has been remarkably stable here the last few quarters, stable meaning you have very consistent double-digit growth year-over-year. Now, you probably turned quite a bit of each quarter, but it just seems remarkably stable. So is that mainly because, the new markets that you're getting into have longer lead-times, or is it mainly just because you have multiple design wins hitting all at the same time? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : I think it's a combination, right. I mean, we have multiple growth drivers, we are playing in different markets, some markets we are growing market share. So, as a result of all that, we have actually continued to see growth. I mean, that is the key reason why we were focusing so much on diversification. It helps us at a time like this. Yes, we see weakness in a few markets, but we kind of see growth in a whole lot of other markets and that's, I think, what's really helping us at times like this. It really showcases the strength of the diversification model. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And not the \u2013 yeah, go ahead, Michael. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, Tore, I might \u2013 as I added, okay (41:06), and give you a longer story. Four years ago, we sell up this model, two years ago, we \u2013 and four years ago, we are changing \u2013 we changed our focus, and then we start knocking on the door for these new customers. And two years ago, we were in the door. And two years later, we have a lot more product. And what I see is why we are not \u2013 why we are now in a grow 15%, 18% a year, why not faster? And all the products that we released in the last couple of years, it will indicate in 2017 and 2018 will grow faster. So, this is at the beginning. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And not to nitpick on the P&L but, Meera, in the other income line, it seems like maybe there was a negative impact. Was that from foreign exchange, and how should we think about that for the following quarters? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : So we actually had a positive effect to interest income line from foreign currency. This is more on payments, our payments to our subsidiaries, there's a foreign exchange difference and it turned out to be positive. So typically when we give guidance, we guide it to a $0 of gain or loss because we don't know until each quarter plays out whether it's a gain or a loss. We have had quarters of loss, and we have had quarters of gain. So what we guide to specifically is the pure interest income portion of it. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. Great. Thank you very much. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Your line is open. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the opportunity for the follow-up. Just, you gave a great answer, Meera, earlier on how the segments would perform in the coming year. Any sense that you could give us more short term just how you think Q4 each of the (43:35) segments will do sequentially? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : I think you will see the seasonal \u2013 seasonality play out in the gateway portion of communications. You will see some seasonal impact on the SSD for the high end computing, consumer, of course. Industrial, I think, will relatively have less of a seasonal play and that's the best I can describe at this point. As you know, with such a distributed revenue base, we are actually dependent on the resales (44:20) reports we get to actually pinpoint which markets we sell into. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. And just any color on the lighting market? I think you've had some success there with LED lighting. Just curious, does that \u2013 how that's doing into Q4 and how you think about that for 2016? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Lighting has \u2013 is one of these markets where we haven't seen seasonality play in before \u2013 in the fourth quarter and it's a market where we continue to do well because we play in the high-end of the market with a very good dimming solutions, and so we continue to see that play out. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Last question was just around auto. I know you guys are extremely diversified, which is great, but just to give us some increased confidence around how we could think about potential opportunity there. Would you say at this point you're on annually tens of millions of vehicles, out of the 90 million or 100 million maybe autos are you on 10 million, 20 million and you've got a little bit on each, are you more concentrated on the vehicles you get in with multiple solutions? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : So what we are seeing is mostly revenue that we got from design wins that we got about four years ago and since then every year we have increased the pace of our design wins here. We started with infotainment and then we have gone on to safety and... Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Lighting. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : ...lighting and a whole bunch of other products. So like Michael said, we are not under the hood, thankfully, at this point, but we see on an annual basis there are more and more design wins. So when we look at revenues for automotive, we are increasingly confident that we will see higher revenues each year looking at next year's... Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Actually, yeah, we have \u2013 in Analyst Days that we have a slide, and we have a couple of slides and now I think it will be \u2013 is online, right? Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : And you can look at our product and our design cycles. Four years ago, we started knocking on doors and with existing product and, again, two years ago, we're in the door and we engage with all these auto customers and we design specifically for automotive. These products will be \u2013 since two years ago will be four years later, which is 2016/2017 and 2016/2017, we're getting to productions, so these are very predictable and very sustainable revenues. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. All right. Thank you very much. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time I'd like to turn it back to Ms. Rao for any closing remarks. Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer : I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call and look forward to talking to you again at our next earnings call in February. Thank you and have a nice day. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect.

Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Ma'am, please go ahead. Meera Rao : Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including a Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2015, and a Form 10-Q filed on October 28, 2015, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 through Q4 releases for both 2014 and 2015 as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Let's begin with a summary of 2015. We continued to perform as we have in the past few years. We are pleased to announce record annual revenue of $333.1 million. Our full year organic revenue growth of 17.9% clearly outperformed the analog industry, which SIA estimates grew 1.9% over the prior year. For 2015, MPS's non-GAAP gross margin expanded 40 basis points from the prior year to 55%. Further, our non-GAAP operating income grew to $81.7 million, representing a 34.8% increase over 2014 after excluding the one-time $9.5 million litigation judgment received in the prior year. We achieved record non-GAAP EPS of $1.89, 32% over 2014, again, excluding the litigation judgment. Diving into year-over-year revenue growth by market segment, industrial was up 35.3%, storage and computing revenue grew 22.6% and consumer also increased 18.2% over 2014. Let me speak to the results of each end market. In industrial and automotive markets, sales rose to $66.3 million, fueled by product sales for applications in automotive, smart meters, security and power sources. We are thrilled that industrial revenue as a percentage of total revenue surged from 6.7% in 2011 to 19.9% in 2015. With significant design win momentum in industrial and automotive, we expect to see continued growth in 2016 and beyond. Revenue from consumer markets increased to $145.1 million, driven primarily by high value consumer markets like battery management, home appliances, gaming and LED lighting. Computing revenue was up $10.5 million from the prior year to $56.6 million, mainly due to growth in cloud computing, high-end PCs and storage. Communications revenue grew slightly to $65.1 million compared to $64.6 million in 2014. Growth in networking and telecom was partially offset by a decline in the traditional gateway business. Switching to Q4, MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $86.9 million, representing year-over-year growth of 14.8%. This is our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year quarterly revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55%, 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter, but 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $22.5 million compared to the $23.8 million reported in the prior quarter and $18.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2014. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $21.1 million or $0.51 per fully diluted share compared with $0.55 per share in the previous quarter and $0.43 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Let's review our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2015 operating expenses were $25.3 million, down from the $26.5 million we spent in the third quarter. Our Q4 expenses were below expectations, primarily due to new product costs being delayed to Q1 2016. We have also begun investing in our infrastructure as the industrial and automotive market opportunity continues to grow. Our GAAP operating expenses were $35.1 million in the fourth quarter compared with $36.1 million in the third quarter. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters are stock compensation expense, income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan, as well as a write-off of an acquisition earn-out liability in Q4. Stock comp expense was $12 million in the fourth quarter compared with $10.2 million in the prior quarter. Since 2014, we have implemented pay-for-performance equity programs. This increase in expense is due to MPS's revenue performing better than expected compared to the analog industry during this period. Q4 GAAP operating expense also included a $2.5 million credit resulting from an acquisition-related earn-out liability. In addition, Q4 GAAP operating expense included $300,000 of investment expense related to an unfunded deferred compensation plan compared to an investment gain of $500,000 in the prior quarter. Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q4 net income was $21.1 million or $0.51 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q4 2015 GAAP net income was $10.1 million or $0.24 per fully diluted share. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $240.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, above the $235 million at the end of the prior quarter. In Q4, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $21.7 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises contributed another $900,000. These cash inflows were partially offset by $8.6 million to purchase office space and capital equipment. In Q4, we funded the $8.1 million quarterly dividend declared in the prior quarter. We also spent about $600,000 to purchase 11,000 shares under our stock buyback program. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter at $30.8 million, slightly higher than the $30.5 million at the end of the prior quarter due to higher sales in the third month of Q4 compared with the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were up to 32 days in the fourth quarter from the 30 days in the prior quarter and the 31 days in the year-ago quarter. Internal revenues at the end of the fourth quarter were $63.2 million, down from the $67.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased to 144 days at the end of Q4 from the 147 days at the end of Q3. Days of inventory in the distributed channel decreased for the third consecutive quarter. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter of 2016. We are forecasting Q1 revenue in the range of $81 million to $85 million. We also expect the following : non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.5% to 55.5%; GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.5% to 54.5%; total stock-based compensation expense of $11 million to $13 million, including approximately $350,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; litigation expenses of $150,000 to $250,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $25.4 million to $26.4 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; other income of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 41.2 million to 42 million shares before share buyback \u2013 sorry, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 41.2 million to 42.2 million shares before share buyback. Our board has approved a $50 million stock buyback program over a one year period beginning this quarter. We're pleased to report that we've achieved all of the share price targets that were set for the 2013 MSU program. Accordingly, at the end of 2015, we've established another MSU program with a new set of share price target which includes an initial range from $71.36 to $95.57. The program spans six years with a four year performance period. In conclusion, in 2015, we continued to deliver and we have great expectations for the future. I'll now open the microphone for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Your line is now open. Joe Hodes : Hi. This is Joe Hodes in for Anil. Congratulations on another great quarter. I'm wondering if you can give us anymore color regarding the industrial segment, given some weakness you're seeing in the overall environment. I guess, in other words, what products are driving your success and how much of that is automotive? Thanks. Meera Rao : We are not seeing any particular weakness. And if you look at our trend, even last year, we didn't see much weakness in Q4. And this is a quarter where we continue to see momentum in industrial areas, including automotive. And one thing to keep in mind is these are all early revenues. We are not a big player yet. So if there is any macro weakness playing in automotive, you wouldn't expect to see it in our numbers. Joe Hodes : Okay. Thank you. Okay. And then I'm moving to new products. What can we expect from the brushless motion control in 2016? Michael Hsing : We have a lot of design win activities and we have some small. In terms of revenue, we'll have some revenues, but we expect to have in the 2017 and beyond the product start really in the growth. Joe Hodes : So late 2016, probably? Michael Hsing : Yeah. And even starting now, we have revenues. Joe Hodes : Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Yeah. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter, you guys. It's tough out there. Meera Rao : Thank you. Rick Schafer : Maybe I've got a question on your auto business. I mean I think you've seen your auto business double annually for the last couple of years. What's that trajectory look like this year? Can we kind of stay on that same kind of slope? And maybe part of that question is, is this auto growth primarily going to be coming from sort of infotainment where you guys are pretty strong now or is it going to be coming from a combination of areas? I mean are you going to be ramping in areas like drive train or ADAS or other areas within the auto? Michael Hsing : Yeah. Rick, thanks for the comment. And the growth in the automotive is pretty consistent because unless the auto company cancel the design of a car, okay, cancel the entire project, that doesn't happen very often. So we have many design wins and started a couple years ago. And also, with the right product and particularly for design for automotives, we are very optimistic for the next period. And related to what kind of a product \u2013 what kind of application in the car, except in the engine, except under the hood, we are almost everywhere now. Meera, you can - Meera Rao : That was my point basically that except for the power train that we started in infotainment but then we've gone into the body, into safety, into various different applications. Rick Schafer : Got it. And then by region, is there anything \u2013 I mean I know you guys are strong in Europe. Have you seen -looking at your backlog like you said, Michael, you've got good visibility there. Are you starting to see areas like Japan or North America or any other place start to pick up? Michael Hsing : North America, China, Korea, definitely picking up, other than Japan. In Japan, we have some. And they are much slower than any other region. It is not because the market is stagnant. It is because of MPS's salespeople. We already corrected that in the last \u2013 two years ago. Rick Schafer : Got it. Got it. And then my second question is on E.MOTION. I'm curious like what milestones we should be looking at this year. It sounds like revenues would be pretty small. But I guess maybe my real question is what's sort of the biggest hurdle to that business ramping? I think we've talked about it being a $2 billion or greater TAM. I mean is the biggest hurdle just scale? I mean do you guys \u2013 would you ever license that IP or would you ever think you need a partner to ramp that business? Or I guess maybe just if you could give some color on what that business looks like in the next year or two years? Michael Hsing : Yeah. Next couple of years still we'll see a slow growth and you will see accelerating after probably 2017 or so. And all of these things that we're talking about really changing how you design the \u2013 how do you control the motion, how you design the model drivers. And these ones is really a long-term. And MPS doesn't focus on a very short-term business. If anything goes up fast then it comes down fast. And so we focus on these longer-terms in the sustainable market segments. And so far, there is no surprises and everything has followed plan. I mean, everything is executed well. So we generally have some revenues from some strategic customers and we work with them closely. And the larger market segments will \u2013 and our revenue will come in the 2017. Rick Schafer : And, Michael, would it mean anything to think about like what your two-year or three-year backlog is for that business or is it just way too soon to think of it that way? Michael Hsing : No, it is not. Okay. We focus on the \u2013 as we said, okay, industrial robot, that segment is growing and also the very mature market is the printer market. And using our technology can revolutionize the way of printing. So, not only in the office paper printing, also textiles and fabrics and photos, all of these. It can increase the speed just dramatically. And these are the market, TAM is easily is over $1 billion, okay, just for this printing segment. Rick Schafer : Got it. Thanks a lot. Michael Hsing : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the results. A few questions. First of all, I know you typically don't discuss backlog or bookings or anything like that, but could you just talk about your relative visibility now versus perhaps a year ago? Meera Rao : I think our visibility now is the same as it was about a year ago. We had good bookings coming into the quarter, continue to see \u2013 orders continue. We had good resales last quarter. So we are actually seeing good activity from a backlog standpoint. Michael Hsing : Tore, you know us for \u2013 you've covered us for many years and, of course, since the beginning. And you know that our turns business is less and less and especially in the last couple years, okay. Going through the quarters is now much more predictable now. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Which I think also explains the very consistent performance for the last few years. My second question has to do with SSD. How will that play out for you this year? I know last year that was a pretty strong business for you. And are we \u2013 I assume now we are for sure \u2013 we have crossed over SSD versus HDD as far as your power management revenue? Meera Rao : The SSD \u2013 we have all the designs that we have. There's additional sockets with existing customers and we have a new customer who started buying our SSD products last year. So with all that, we do expect SSD to continue to grow. And yes, SSD is now the bigger part of \u2013 has crossed over HDD at this point. Tore Svanberg : Okay. And moving on to your server business, I know Grantley or VR12.5 and also Purley are going to be strong catalysts for you. Any updates there as far as timing is concerned? Michael Hsing : I think they are \u2013 ramp up, all right. Meera Rao : Purley is Q3, Q4 of 2017. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Meera Rao : And as far as I know that schedule is still on. The design cycle for Purley is still going on. And as we told you at the Analyst Day, we are seeing very good progress over there. We are much stronger in Purley than we were in Grantley. Michael Hsing : Yeah. All these cycles we designed in a couple years ago and nothing has changed. And they are just waiting for the cycles to begin. But more exciting thing is that we gained a lot more socket and we established as a player in that segment. Tore Svanberg : Great. Just one last question from me on battery management. I know you have a single chip solution there and you've already gotten some good traction but any new applications that you could share with us that you have penetrated with your single chip solution for battery management? Michael Hsing : Well, we have a lot of things going on, I mean. But the one in the analog space that really pay attention to it hasn't released it yet. And we are still working on it. But everything else is just normal. Tore Svanberg : Okay. Actually I did have one last question. Could you just clarify a little bit what you said about the stock option program, especially on the pricing? Meera Rao : Sure. We had an MSU plan that had been set before that had price targets that ranged from $43, I think, to $40 to $56. And since we have achieved all those price targets, we now have a new program. And that has got the initial range of \u2013 the target prices is from $71.36 to $95.57. So there is a four-year performance period for this. And then between vesting and sales restrictions, it extends another two years. Tore Svanberg : Okay. So this is basically just an update to the older version? Meera Rao : I mean it's conceptually. But I think there are more \u2013 it's a new plan, but, yeah, it's not an extension, but it is a new plan. Tore Svanberg : Got it. Great. Thank you so much, guys. Meera Rao : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey. Just a follow-up actually on Tore's last question there. You had restricted stock plan. Does the stock have to hit those levels for those RSUs to vest or to be awarded? Meera Rao : Yeah. They have to be at that, I think, for an average of 20 trading days for it \u2013 consecutive trading days for it to be earned. But then, even if it's earned, it doesn't vest until the fifth year and sixth year. Quinn Bolton : Okay. Meera Rao : There are operational goals as well. This time, there are operational goals in addition to the price targets that have to be met. Michael Hsing : First how we set it up is \u2013 I know, Quinn, you just covered us not very long ago. We had a program and the stocks during the close is about at $30 levels. And we set up the programs for some $40 to high $50s. And that program is only \u2013 had only one measurement and it's the stock price. And when the stock hit, then we have some period of vesting. And now, this time, we have a similar program and they're using stock's price as one element but we also add also the performance element to it. Quinn Bolton : Understood. But I was just trying to confirm that you're aligning management employees RSUs with shareholders and that the stock has to go up for those RSUs to divest or to be earned. Meera Rao : Absolutely. Michael Hsing : Absolutely. That's what. Quinn Bolton : That's what I was trying to confirm. Okay. Great. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Quinn Bolton : And then just looking to the business \u2013 I apologize because I missed some of the prepared comments. But it looks like the computing or storage and computing was probably down by the greatest percentage sequentially. I know you have very strong third quarter which I think reflected the ramp of a new SSD program. Should we think December is kind of just coming back more of a normal run rate or is there something in particular that happened in storage and computing in the December quarter? Meera Rao : If you remember the beginning at the last earnings call, we had called out the fact that we were seeing some weakness in the SSD. We had expected to see some seasonal decline in the SSD for client, but we had also seen some softness in demand, both HDD and SSD enterprise. And I think it's more a reflection of what was happening in the macro and how it impacted some of our customers in those markets. Quinn Bolton : Based on answers to some of the earlier questions, it sounds like your backlog and bookings activity has been fairly healthy. It didn't sound like you were seeing much impact from weaker macroeconomic conditions. Is that storage and the HDD, SSD comments really the only place where you'd seen any impact from macroeconomic conditions on the business? Meera Rao : That's the only one that I could see anything clearly. I mean the rest of it \u2013 we're kind of listening to more to what our peers have to say about macro because we are still seeing good bookings and billings. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Great. And I just wanted to ask. I know you had a lot of longer terms drivers in E.MOTION and it's early ramp that really starts to kick into more significant revenue contributors in 2017 and beyond. But as you look at 2016, can you sort of list for us on a product basis maybe what some \u2013 maybe the top two or three growth drivers would be for 2016, again, from a product perspective? Meera Rao : Sure. Michael Hsing : I can comment on it. And this year's 2016 revenue, especially all these growth drivers and these products are released about two years to three years ago. One is obviously in the auto segment and the other one the cloud computing, the high end computing. That's including some workstations and high end notebooks and also the servers and data centers. And other one is the industrial and industrial is not as good as the last year's. It's similar, right. Meera Rao : Industrial is going to be doing very well. Michael Hsing : The industrial is about - Meera Rao : Yeah. Michael Hsing : And so we have many actually. And we have many segments. What else? The consumer side \u2013 the high-end consumer business and we released a lot of product for mobile and for ultra-low power application and also a variety of product for the Internet of Things now nobody talk about anymore. Those products actually we started to do in 2011. Those products are actually doing really well now, because we see many applications in the connectivity that requires those products. And this year we're doing really well. Any other segment I forgot? Meera Rao : No. The three I would emphasize would be industrial, storage and cloud computing and consumer, particularly the high-end consumer. Michael Hsing : And also auto, right? Meera Rao : Auto is included in industrial. Michael Hsing : Okay. Quinn Bolton : And, sorry, last question from me just on the high value consumer. I think last quarter you said that that was approaching 40% of the total consumer bucket. Did that reach 40% or does that continue to increase here in the December quarter and as you look into the March quarter? Michael Hsing : I don't know the percentage of total revenue. We don't know \u2013 I don't know what that number is because the other segment will grow faster and consumer probably grow the slowest. But revenue-wide, I don't see what decrease was. We'll continue to grow. Meera Rao : Year-over-year, I would say that the high value consumer is continuing to be a bigger portion of our consumer revenue. But if you're comparing quarter-over-quarter, there would \u2013 since Q3 was a much stronger \u2013 seasonally stronger quarter for consumer that would impact our high value consumer revenue as well. But year-over-year what we're seeing is even if you look at a quarter or year-over-year, we are seeing bigger portion of consumer revenue coming from the high value consumer market. Quinn Bolton : Okay. So you continue to mix that high value consumer. It's what I was trying to get at. Meera Rao : Yeah. Michael Hsing : Yes. Quinn Bolton : Thank you. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt Diamond : Hey, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on Ross' behalf. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Your comms business is upsided really nicely it seems. I'm just curious to get your thoughts on the stability of the comms market. We've heard from some of your peers that things seem to be stabilizing and I just like to get your own thoughts on what to potentially expect for the first quarter and beyond? Meera Rao : Sure. In comms, I would say networking and telecom was relatively flat with the prior quarter. Most of the upside that we saw was in the gateway business where we had \u2013 if you remember a quarter before, we had seen weakness. So if I look out into Q1, I kind of expect from a networking and telecom that it will be flat. And Q1, on the gateway business, it would depend upon how the macro plays out. If you remember, the gateway is an area where it's not a strategic focus. It's something that we play in opportunistically depending upon the margins for the orders that we receive. So my expectation is that the gateway business is going to be flat, maybe even slightly down. Matt Diamond : Understood. And you mentioned some OpEx commentary about new products cost being pushed out to the first quarter. I don't want to make you guide beyond the first quarter but directionally is there anything abnormal or irregular to call out about OpEx for the rest of 2016? Meera Rao : Sure. What we were talking about there is, remember, we had been talking about the new foundry that's coming up. And we had identified the cost of bringing up the new foundry at $3 million. This is between the MOSFET cost as well as the wafer development loss. And we ended up spending only about a $0.5 million in 2015. So we'll be spending about $2.5 million in 2016 on that. The other thing that we also commented is that we have begun our investments in industrial and automotive markets. And so that is going to be something that's going to be driving OpEx expenses this year. Matt Diamond : Great. Thanks very much. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Let me comment on the expense side. It is clearly \u2013 okay, we have a very outstanding product for automotive and industrial. And it's \u2013 our quality is exceptional. However, we need investment in the systems \u2013 in the quality systems. And those one \u2013 MPS just have those products just by brilliant design engineers and our peoples. Now, we need to invest in the infrastructures. And there's a lot to be done in there which will overall elevate the company's quality. And so, in 2016, it's time we should do that. But we do \u2013 and it depend on how much \u2013 how much is really depending on what MPS's growth rate. And during the Analyst Day last year, I said that with our growth \u2013 our OpEx always grows a little more than half of what the revenue growth. So this year's will be just slightly higher and also we are really controlled depending on the revenue growth. Meera Rao : And just a reminder, we talked about revenue growth. Our OpEx growth rate would be 50% to 60% of the revenue growth rate. And while we expect to be a little higher this year, that does not include \u2013 that 50% to 60% we were talking about does not include the new product cost for the new foundry coming up. Matt Diamond : Got it. It makes total sense. Thanks very much. I appreciate the clarity. Meera Rao : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Vincent Celentano : Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. So I start with your LED business. It looks like it's up almost 20% year-over-year in the quarter. Can you talk a little about what's led that outperformance so far and where you see that market going in 2016? Michael Hsing : If you see these fast trending products, we are very just opportunistic. And it may come in. It may be more, may be even less. Okay. But these are not our core interest. But we do have underlying very solid LED product customers. These are really for the decorating lighting, industrial lightings. And if we have a fast-grow revenue, we're just very opportunistic to take those revenues if we have the capacities. Vincent Celentano : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, can you give any color on upcoming DC5 as far as how it compares to DC4 either in performance or does it target different applications? And then more broadly, how do you see BCD as far as how it compares to competing solutions? Michael Hsing : While competing with a competing solution, I don't see anybody that's come in and have anywhere close to what MPS have. We are leading by far. Okay. In the past talking about a few years, a couple years, I think that's even much further now. And so BCD5 and we have a first few products in the market. We are launching it now in the market, meaning with all of the probable features in it. Meera Rao : One of the key things I'd also add for BCD5 that makes it special is that we've also added memory and digital capability. Vincent Celentano : Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. David Wong : Thanks very much. Just a clarification of your earlier answer. You noted slight growth in communications for the full year 2015 but communications revenues if I calculate correctly were down about 10% year-over-year in the second half of the year. So was all this driven by declines in the traditional gateway or did telecom and networking or any other sub-segments of comms also dropped in the second half? Michael Hsing : I wish we have all the other infrastructure business. We don't have that much, okay. So the rest of it was explained already. Meera Rao : Also, to add to that, the networking and telecom area has been doing well right through the year. So the weakness in the second half was more attributable to the gateway business which is an area like I said we only play in opportunistically. If the prices are attractive then we will take that business. Otherwise we may not take it in a particular period. David Wong : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions on the phone lines at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Meera for closing remarks. Meera Rao : I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this call and look forward to talking to you at the Q1 earnings call. Have a nice day. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Analysts : Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call will be recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Bernie Blegen, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Good afternoon, and welcome to the first quarter 2016 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is on the call with me today. For those of you, who I haven't been introduced to yet, my name is Bernie Blegen. I've been with Monolithic Power Systems now for four-and-a-half years, working largely in the background with Meera, as the Corporate Controller. For those of you, again that I haven't met, I look forward to getting introduced to you in the next quarter or two. In the course of today's conference call, we'll make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release, and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2016, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to Q1 2015, Q4 2015 and Q1 2016 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast over the Internet, and will be available for replay on website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS is pleased to announce record first quarter revenue of $84.5 million. Our first quarter revenue was on the high-end of our guidance, and represented a 14.9% increase from the prior year quarter. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. This consistent revenue growth is a result of our diversification strategy and investments in targeted market segments. As we have become established among the first tier suppliers to the major OEM customers in these new markets, we have encountered even more exciting opportunities that if we invest now, will enable our growth to accelerate in the next few years. We want to capitalize on these new businesses by investing strategically, while being mindful of the need to operate in our long-term model. These efforts will enhance our market position, and accelerate MPS' revenue growth. Turning back to the financials, this revenue increase over the prior year was fueled by growth from our Industrial, Computing and Consumer segment. MPS' non-GAAP gross margin also expanded 20 basis points year-over-year to 55.0%. Looking at revenue growth by market segment; Industrial was up 38.3% from 2015. Computing revenue grew 35.2%, and Consumer revenue was higher by 7.5%. First quarter Communication revenue fell 2.8% from the prior year. Let me speak to the results of each end market. In the Industrial market, sales rose to $18.4 million fueled by product sales for applications in Automotive, Security and Point-of-Sale Equipment. Computing revenue increased to $15.4 million reflecting strength in notebooks, servers and storage. Revenue from Consumer markets increased from a year-ago quarter to $33.8 million, driven primarily by gains in high-value consumer markets like home appliances and battery management as well as in GPS devices. Communication revenue fell $0.5 million to $16.9 million largely due to lower wireless revenue. Compared with the prior quarter, Q1 2016 revenue decreased $2.4 million or 2.8% on seasonally lower revenue in the Consumer segment, with each of the other three segments improving. Non-GAAP gross margin of 55.0% matched the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $20.0 million compared with the $22.5 million reported in the prior quarter. Q1 non-GAAP net income was $18.7 million or $0.45 per fully diluted share compared with $0.51 per share in the previous quarter. Let's review our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2016 operating expenses were $26.4 million, $1.1 million higher than the $25.3 million we spent in the fourth quarter of 2015, mainly due to increased compensation costs reflecting pay raises, staff additions and higher payroll taxes. Our first quarter 2016 GAAP operating expenses of $35.1 million matched GAAP operating expenses recorded in the fourth quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these two quarters is stock compensation expense, expense on an unfunded deferred compensation plan and the write-off of an acquisition earn-out liability in Q4 of 2015. Stock comp expense included in operating expenses was $8.5 million in the first quarter compared with $12.0 million in the prior quarter. This between quarter decline in stock comp primarily reflected a one-time $2.9 million expense reversal associated with our prior CFO's retirement. We expect stock comp to normalize once a permanent CFO replacement is in place. Investment expense related to the deferred comp plan increased GAAP operating expenses by $157,000 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $290,000 of expense in the fourth quarter. Turning to other income. First quarter non-GAAP other income of $241,000 was $117,000 lower than the prior quarter, primarily due to foreign exchange transaction losses resulting from a weakening of the dollar. Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q1 net income was $18.7 million or $0.45 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q1 2016 GAAP net income was $10.6 million or $0.25 per fully diluted share. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $256.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2016, up $16.6 million from the $240.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. This increase in cash reflected cash flow from operations of $27.1 million offset by the $8.0 million quarterly dividend payment, and the $4.3 million spent on capital equipment and office space. No shares were purchased during the quarter under our stock buyback program. Q1 cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed another $1.7 million. Accounts receivable ended the quarter at $28.8 million, down from the $30.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were 31 days in both the first quarter 2016 and in the year-ago quarter, compared with 32 days in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter were $62.3 million, lower than the $63.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory, however, increased slightly to 145 days at the end of Q1 from the 144 days at the end of Q4. Inventory on our distribution channel increased from the Q4 2015 level reflecting the seasonal build. Prior to this, inventory in the channel had declined in each of the three prior quarters. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2016. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $91 million to $95 million. We also expect the following. Non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 54.6% to 55.6%. GAAP gross margin will be the range of 53.6% to 54.6%, total stock-based compensation expense of $10.4 million to $12.4 million including approximately $400,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold, litigation expenses of $100,000 to $200,000, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $26.1 million to $28.1 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses, other income of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 41.2 million to 42.2 million share before share buyback. In conclusion, we continue to grow and we continue to invest for further growth. I'll now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you, and congratulations on the results. And Bernie, welcome to these public calls. My first question is on your relative visibility, I know you typically don't give the booking and backlog numbers, but just given all the macro backdrops out there, how would you classify your current visibility either sequentially or year-over-year? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Sure. When we look at the backlog going into the quarter, as well as the momentum that we carried in from the prior quarter, we feel that we're in comparable shape to when we were going into either Q1 of last \u2013 or Q2 of last year or Q1 of this year. So, all-in-all I feel, we're in pretty good shape. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : And... Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I... Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I'd just add on, like I mean, given in the last few years, and then when we go into the quarters, and has a more and a more less term business, and a more and more booked (12:41) and although we don't release the numbers, but the trend is very good for our long-term business. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And my second question is in relation to your Communications business, I recognize, you're doing exceptionally well in all other three. Now, this one, it's down year-over-year, but it was up 7% sequentially. So you think, we're starting to see the reversal of the Communications business, and if so, what would be driving that? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Let me answer that. And the short answer is, no. That came in, because a lot of those Communication business during \u2013 in the wireless LAN, that's from the legacy product. And although we're doing pretty well, and those are business we're very opportunistic to gain revenues and margin dollars. However, we're going to reverse that, and it will be a lot more sustainable market, I see it in a couple of years down the road. We are now releasing the product for telecom market segment, and I really believe these are winners, and we will take shares in the large \u2013 this market segment. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. Just one last question from me, either Michael or Bernie, could you just give us an update on your module business, and maybe your programmable module business? I know you probably can't give us any specific numbers, but maybe where some of the design wins are coming, and are you starting to see revenue already in the programmable modules or is that a bit too early? Thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So I can take some of the numbers there, and then I can defer to Michael as far as the programmable. In general, the modules business is on track with what we were expecting, and what we presented at the Analyst Day earlier. We've introduced a number of products, and we've obtained a number of very positive reviews and several design wins which are generating good revenue right now, obviously with the longer-term growth opportunities coming later this year and into 2017. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : The programmable modules, and as we talked about in the last Analyst Call, those are products that \u2013 at the time we talked about it, is about a year, a year and half away. So we haven't really, really generated any revenue yet, but we're starting sample rate in those modules. And from the last time in, I know in the history of MPS, we didn't talk about all the products until we generate revenue. However, our business model changes, and also particular changes in anything what we do now will affect two years or three years later. So in the last year, Analyst Day, we talk about all the products that would generate revenue two years or three years down the road. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good, and congratulations on another stellar quarter. Thank you. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Tore. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. And I'll add my congratulations to you guys on a nice quarter. A couple of questions, I guess, maybe the first one is, could you give us an update on the progress ramping your new foundry, and maybe the timing and linearity of the associated expenses, I think you talked about a couple, $2 million or $3 million, I think, Bernie, in the incremental expenses? And another question I had on that is, this foundry just going to be for BCD5 or is it going to run all Monolithic processes. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Thanks for the good words on the quarter. So, the progress on the foundry is coming along quite well. In fact, we've already started to take some deliveries of wafer from it, and we have several products that are actually in production. We're if I could characterize it probably at about the mid-point of bringing up all the products that we want to, and it is not restricted to only the BCD5, but also a couple of the earlier versions as well. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And as the follow-up, what will that bring total wafer capacity up to for you guys now that you've got the fourth foundry running, I mean, is it \u2013 and is it going to create any sort of bottlenecks with Chengdu or do you just simply outsource that overflow? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : I'll answer your second question first, is that, we outsource the overflow, we've been very successful in migrating to that, adding that into or complementing that as our business model. And then, rather that talk specifically in wafer volume, I think we've said in the past that, in terms of revenue, with three fabs we had about a little over $100 million of capacity per quarter, and now we're going up to about $125 million to $130 million per quarter? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and also the overall manufactured capacity, we transfer out in low-end product, but those are traditional products; high volume, we go to a testing house, and for packaging in testing, we are in-house or we're more developed or more high in a very high quality products, and those are \u2013 we have a much better control, much worthwhile in the long term. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then just one final one from me, it's on E.MOTION. Obviously, a new product that's kind of changing the way motor makers and system designers are designing products, so maybe just, kind of provide some color on or talk about, what's your go-to-market strategy is with the sort of brand new product category, if you will, or brand new product? I mean, it's a $2 billion opportunity or more, I think you've talked about in the past. I mean, how do you scale that business, I guess, with limited resources? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : It is true, there's limited resources, like I mean, but as Bernie said in the script, we mindfully invested, and not affecting our long-term growth model \u2013 I'm not giving you any \u2013 but are really excited about this technology. And as you see it, we generate, already generate pretty meaningful revenue from Sensima's existing product. And once we put their products in our \u2013 are qualified and now we transfer into our own foundry, and the volumes are going to increase quite a bit. However, those products are still in Consumers' area, and as expected, and you have a fast ramp it's always in those Consumer area. And now, the more exciting thing is for the future, we changed the way our, the behavior of \u2013 design engineer behaviors, all these machine design, these are equipment designer, it takes time. And but we introduced all these ideas in the products and concepts and we're designing and some of them we're co-designing with all these first tier customers, and those, I'm very confident those revenue will come. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks, guys. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on the line for Ross. Congrats again on the great quarter, and thanks for letting me ask a question. I'm curious on the end market breakdown this quarter, was there any one that didn't align with your own expectations and if it or they didn't what ramifications those surprises might have for 2Q? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : No, no. I think that there were a lot of positives that we take away from this quarter relative to both how we performed in Q4 as well as against our expectations. The growth that we're seeing in Industrial, and particularly a lot of that is driven through automotive, but also our high value opportunities in the power sourcing and in security are ramping very nicely. And I think, going back to the point that we made in the script is that, I think that we've done a good job of being able to get introduced to a lot of high-value opportunities, and now what we want to do is be able to capitalize further to both continue and accelerate that growth. Likewise, when we look at the Computing, we saw very good opportunities in the high-end notebook and a continuation of progress in Storage as well. So in the Computing and Storage, in fact it was a pretty balanced approach. We didn't have any categories that fell short of our expectation. So when I sum it up, I think we've touched on Communications, that went down in Q3 of last year, but as we pointed out, it's trending nicely, and we have good opportunities there. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we don't \u2013 to answer your questions, do we have \u2013 expected a gain or loss, and again, MPS' revenues are very much expected, and are very stable. And we know in a few quarters out, what gain, what losses, okay. Of course we do have a \u2013 play a lot of opportunistic games in those traditional legacy product, but we do see, and expect the things as Bernie said in the script. We encounter a lot of demand for the new product from the first tier OEMs. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. And just in the second half of the year \u2013 you may have already answered the question, how do you feel about new products heading into the second half of the year, should there be any expected acceleration there, or any way to ballpark that would be helpful. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : It's pretty much set. In our revenues, we focus on two years or three years out, and those customers design us in (24:33) and work with us on those products, and if they don't cancel the product or delay the product the revenue is there. And now we don't see a significant difference, and it's pretty much as we expected. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks so much, guys. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Your line is open. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll add my congratulations to the good numbers there. Michael, I just wanted to follow-up with your answer earlier in the call on Communications, you talked about new products coming out. I just couldn't understand, was that for higher-end Communications equipment or was that a new set of products for more the home router type equipment, and is that quite a load or what type of product would that be that you think's going to be a pretty good one? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, if we're defending our own point of law (25:36) in home router systems, then it has to be at a lower cost. And of course we develop those product, we release those products to defend our segment, still very good money to be made there. And what I'm more excited about is that, the new line of our product, and you know we released very high power density product into servers in the Computing segment. Those similar type of products go for Communications, these are for infrastructures. And servers and infrastructures are somewhat related, and those products we redesigned for the infrastructure, these products are coming out. That's kind of product I really talk about. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, right, that sounds great. On the auto side, any thoughts to what growth might look like for auto for the year, now that we're sort of decently in, and you probably have good visibility on designs, and what you think auto could potentially grow into 2017? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : In autos, and as expected, we said it, in the last couple of years, we see the very consistent of a growth, and a ramp and we don't see any different. Now the opportunity is that, we've seen a lot more now, and we need a lot of more new product for that. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And do you think that you'll keep focused on the areas where you already have success or investment or would you move over and circle to powertrain, as well, I don't think you have any real presence right now. If I could just throw one last question in, you guys have been investing, you mentioned again, here on the press release, can you talk a little bit about how you see OpEx spending in the back half of the year, is it anything different what you guys already communicated or is it pick up, slow down, a little bit from what you were originally thinking? Thanks. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : So, as far as \u2013 I'll take your first question on automotive, is that, certainly being \u2013 we're such a small component in selling into that huge market opportunity that we have tremendous upside both in terms as far as introducing new content to the cars as well as expanding on the designs that we've already had built in. So we're very excited about automotive, obviously. And then as far as like what we are trying to signal as far as the sales and marketing expenses is that, there's just a real opportunity to continue this growth. We've done, we've already made the investment in R&D as far as the design, the process technology, and now the fabs, and so in order to complete the rollout to be successful is to invest appropriately in sales and marketing. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : So that's on the expenses side, we do have to sensibly invest, and we, again in the last conference call, we talk about, we balanced our short-term shareholders. Nobody admit it, we have short-term investors, and some are short-term, what I mean is okay, for one-year or two-year guys versus a four-years or five years guy, we balance those interests, because whatever we do in this year has nothing to do with the revenue generation for next year, so it's two years or three years out. So we balance those shareholder interests. And when talking about powertrains, I'll answer you very specifically. Yes, we're going to get in there, and now before we get in there, we need to put our house in shape for these are quality controlled, these are very critical components, and we need to upgrade our production control. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay great, congrats again. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is open. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey, Michael, just wanted to follow-up on that last question about the long-term opportunities by investing in new products and sales and marketing to-date. It sounds like you're not changing your sort of target to grow OpEx at a rate of 50% to 60% of sales. One, I just wanted to confirm that, and second to the extent that, that is still accurate, at what point would you consider making larger investments now, how big would some of those future opportunities be for you to say start to spend at a growth rate more than 50% or 60% of sales...? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes, that's a very good question. Okay, and once I talk about investment, everybody get nervous, okay. Here is \u2013 we're not going to \u2013 okay here's our long-term target, okay, 50%, 60% of our growth \u2013 of the OpEx growth from the revenue growth. And we're going to stick with our models, and we've been (31:13) one year's below a little bit, below one year, a little bit higher, but I would say the long-term, our long-term is about two years or three years, and we'll be average out in a similar range. We're not going to have big gigantic jump, and we'll surprise everybody, we won't do that kind of thing. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay, let me try and just ask, on the E.MOTION product, I believe that you were scheduled to be taping out the fully integrated E.MOTION part sometime here in the first half, just wondering if you can give us an update if that's still on track? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes, we have \u2013 actually, well, the product was delayed a little bit. And we said, in the release in May, it doesn't look like we're going to release in May, and we have \u2013 all the engineers are bogged down with some of the details, and okay, what I think to me these are very minor things, but however we're delayed. But the products that we're working with these are large customers for very fast revenue \u2013 I mean talking about fast revenue is still a year, and a year-and-a-half away. And those products, and engineers want to make final changes before \u2013 to satisfy those large customers, and I don't have a big argument about it. And those \u2013 however we're releasing the product in the next couple of months and all the existing Sensima's products, and as I said earlier, we generate pretty good revenue now. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. And then just one for Bernie, you mentioned the sales or disti inventory did increase here for the first quarter, for the first time in the last three quarters or the previous three quarters, I should say were down. Can you give us some sense how much inventory did you build in the first quarter, and any expectations for what disti inventories will do in the second quarter, is that another quarter typically when you see the channel build seasonally? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : There's two components to that. So, yes, we did experience a dollar increase as far as inventory in the channel, but as significantly is, we're calculating the days off of a lower denominator with the lower revenue. So in fact the pattern conformed pretty much to the normal seasonal that we've seen. For Q2 we're actually going in with the expectation of not increasing the channel inventory in terms of days keep maintaining those generally about flat maybe a day increase or so, but we don't expect that to be material. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: But on a dollar basis it probably goes up a touch, just reflecting the higher revenue base? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair & Company. Your line is open. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi Michael, Bernie, congrats from my end too. I had a couple of questions. What was the contribution of automotives during this quarter, can you give us some sense, I know you don't break it down, but can you give us some sense what the revenue contribution was? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I think that, what we've said in the past is that, of the Industrial, it comprises about a third of that segment, and now auto is starting to increase as a percentage of that segment as their sales are growing faster than the remainder of that market. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And one for you Michael, you talked about programmability, it sounds like the revenues would be some time in next year, couple of questions around that. Is it second half of next year, and more importantly obviously this is a big important trend within our management sector. Can you talk about the competitive landscape, are people catching on the programmable solutions, when do you think competition is going to come in? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I don't see, and all of the \u2013 lot of people are talking about. And some people talk about, and they have products for those Industrial market segments. But these are still very much semiconductor-related, and not \u2013 it's a very similar to what they have before. And MPS' product is significantly different, and designed for ease of a use. In those revenues, and I expected, yeah we do see fast revenues in \u2013 from when we release it, and also we have to release it with the softwares and also on the Internet. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: So, the revenue contribution is this going to be more like Q3 or do you think it's going to be more of a Q2 contribution? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I will say that, at this time, I'll say that, it's like second half of the year. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, very good. Once again, congrats from my side. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, again. Operator : Thank you. And we have a follow-up from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. Looking at the cash flows, I think they were almost at record levels, I was just wondering if there was any sort of one-time items that helped those cash flows or should we assume for operating cash flow to hover around 30% of revenue going forward as well? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, there was no one-item per se. What we had seen is that working capital in each of the three prior quarters had consumed cash and in this quarter it actually turned to be beneficial as receivables in particular went down. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And last question, on your Consumer revenues, so obviously high value Consumer continues to drive the growth there. I was just wondering within battery management, how sizable that business is becoming. I believe you said at the last Analyst Day that, that would be one of the biggest growth driver of the Consumer business, and just trying to understand relatively how big that has gotten now? Thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So when we look at the battery management, currently it's still relatively small, relative to the overall opportunity, but it is growing significantly more than any of our other market segments in Consumer. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you, again. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Bernie Blegen, for closing remarks. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Great, thank you very much. I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again in July at our second quarter conference call. Thank you. Have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems' Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the meeting over to Michael Hsing, CEO of Monolithic Power Systems. Please go ahead, sir. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon and welcome to second quarter's 2016 Monolithic Power conference call. First of all, let me introduce you to MPS' new CFO, Bernie Blegen. As you already know, Bernie has been with the MPS as our Corporate Controller for the past five years. It's our philosophy that we give our internal candidate the first opportunity to rise to the rank. In the past two quarters, Bernie has been well received by our shareholders after having worked with many of you. So now please join with me to congratulate Bernie on his new role. Now I pass to Bernie. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Michael, thank you very much, and I want to thank you for all the support and the confidence that you've shown in me. I am excited about the new responsibilities and being part of MPS' future growth. I also look forward to working closely with many of you on the phone with us today. Turning now to the Safe Harbor disclosures. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release, and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2016, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2015, Q1 2016 and Q2 2016 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted to our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS is pleased to announce our financial results for the second quarter as follows. Our second quarter revenue of $94.1 million was on the high-end of our guidance and represented a 15.6% increase from the prior year quarter. MPS' non-GAAP gross margin of 55.1% was 10 basis points higher than the prior year. Second quarter non-GAAP operating income was $24.1 million, up 21.5% from the same quarter in 2015. The quarterly revenue increase over the prior year was fueled primarily by growth in our industrial and computing markets. Looking at year-over-year revenue growth by market segment, computing revenue grew 45% from 2015, industrial was up 41% and consumer revenue was higher by 8%. Second quarter communication revenue fell 14% from the prior year. Let me speak to the results of each end market. In our industrial segment, sales rose to $22.9 million compared with $16.2 million reported in the prior year, fueled by increased product sales in automotive, smart meters and a variety of industrial equipment. Although the design cycle can take three or more years, the multi-billion dollar industrial market offers us a significant growth opportunity. Over the past few years, MPS has been recognized by Tier 1 OEM customers as a high quality and reliable supplier. We expect our future growth will be well supported by our expanding product pipeline built on MPS' well-known technologies, which deliver superior efficiency and ease-of-use. We will continue to invest in our quality and customer support capabilities. Gains in this market will be key to MPS' sustainable long-term growth model. In our computing segment, revenue increased to $18.3 million compared with $12.6 million reported in the prior year reflecting strength in servers, storage, and high-performance notebooks. This growth represents an early validation of our QS Mod product family, which we expect will gain traction during the next design cycles for cloud servers. Looking ahead, we have been continuing to gain designing momentum in the broader computing market. In our consumer segment, revenue increased to $38.3 million compared with $35.5 million driven primarily by gains in high-value consumer products. In our communication segment, revenue of $14.6 million fell $2.4 million from the $17.0 million reported in the year ago quarter. In the last six quarters, revenue in our communication segment has been fluctuating within a range of $3 million due to changes in our customers' new project launch schedule. Q1 2016 demand was on the high side, and in this quarter we saw weaker demand. While in this low-end market our near-term revenue trend is flattish, we are excited about our long-term prospects as we're about to launch our premium FPPM modules to address central office, cell phone towers, and data centers. These modules are an ideal fit for the infrastructure market. Turning now to our E.MOTION products development, customers have begun evaluating our single chip prototypes. We are further refining the software and firmware and optimizing its performance, based on specific customer demand. We remain positive about this game changing E.MOTION technologies. Turning back to the financials. Compared with the prior quarter, Q2 2016 revenue increased $9.6 million or 11% as revenue gains in the industrial, computing and consumer segments were partially offset by a decrease in our communication revenue. Revenue mix for the quarter was 41% consumer, 24% industrial, 19% computing and 16% communication. That represents a shift from the prior quarter with a two percentage point increase in the contribution from industrial and a four point reduction in the communication market. Non-GAAP gross margin of 55.1% was up 10 basis points from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $24.1 million compared with the $20.0 million reported in the prior quarter. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $22.6 million or $0.54 per fully diluted share compared with $0.45 per share in the previous quarter. Let's review our operating expenses. As we indicated on last quarter's call, we expected a slight increase in operating expenses this quarter, as we began to ramp investments in new product development, bring up our fourth fab and capitalize on new business opportunities through strategic sales and marketing investments. As such, our non-GAAP second quarter 2016 operating expenses of $27.7 million were $1.3 million higher than the $26.4 million we spent in the first quarter of 2016. As our business grows, our operating expenses may fluctuate in the short-term, but we remain committed to operating within our financial model. Our second quarter 2016 GAAP operating expenses of $39.4 million were $4.3 million higher than the GAAP operating expenses recorded in the first quarter. The difference between non-GAAP and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation and an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp expenses increased $2.8 million between quarters, reflecting a one-time $2.9 million expense reversal recorded in Q1. Switching to the bottom-line, on a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 net income was $22.6 million or $0.54 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q2 2016 GAAP net income was $11.2 million or $0.27 per fully diluted share. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $249.2 million at the end of second quarter of 2016, down $7.7 million from the $256.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $12.8 million compared with $27.1 million reported in the prior quarter. This decrease in cash flow reflected an increase in net working capital and other long-term assets. Spending on capital equipment and office space totaled $12.6 million. We paid $8.5 million in dividends in second quarter. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter at $31.4 million, up from the $28.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were 30 days in the second quarter of 2016, which was the same as the year ago quarter and one day lower than the 31 days reported in the first quarter 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter were $69.9 million, higher than the $62.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory at the end of Q2 of 147 days increased slightly from the 145 days at the end of Q1. Inventory in our distribution channel decreased from the Q1 2016 level, reflecting an overall increase in end customer demand. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2016. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $104 million to $108 million. We also expect the following. Non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 54.8% to 55.8%. GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 54.0% to 55.0%. Total stock-based compensation expense will be between $10.7 million to $12.7 million. Litigation expenses of $100,000 to $300,000. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $28.3 million to $30.3 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Interest in other income of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 41.4 million to 42.4 million shares. In conclusion, as we continue to execute against our long-term business strategy, we believe the success of our new product development will further propel MPS' future growth. I'll now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Congrats on the job Bernie and congrats on a nice quarter you guys. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Rick, thanks so much. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. So I had a couple of questions. So first really on the comps business. I know it's kind of been treading water. I know you said, plus or minus $3 million for the last 18 months or so. Can maybe we get a little more color on what's being going on with mix over that 18 months? I mean have we seen mix improvement maybe away from gateway and maybe more towards the networking side of things? And then maybe some color on when we might see stabilization ahead of the sort of FPPM ramp? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. And I think that you focused on a very key element there is that, while we have been sort of treading water with the market segment in total, there's been a pronounced shift as we've been moving increasingly towards the telecom and away from the gateway and the wireless per se. So as far as looking at the trend lines going forward, we see that displacement continuing, but again there isn't necessarily a point of inflection until we get the new product releases that we expect to start coming out in the middle second half of 2017. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So we should sort of keep thinking that this is sort of a lumpy business for the next few quarters? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. As we speaking, so we \u2013 traditional gateway business in the \u2013 this was MPS traditional business. And as we are speaking, we are changing the content in the last few years by 50%. And so the legacy business is only about 50% of that total. All the other ones has a much higher margin and that we are gradually changing it. As you know, the telecom business, it takes a while and these are the products we offer the better performers, but not really our outstanding. They must have it. The next generation product, we feel like that there's a lot of wow factors in it; and a lot of people that want those product. And I think it will lead MPS in the particularly, in the telecom areas, in the new directions. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then as my follow-up, maybe this is a weird question, but your auto business is obviously \u2013 I think it's doubled the last couple \u2013 each of the last couple years, I think it's on track to do that again this year and starting to get to be a real material contributor to revenues. I mean, maybe a weird comparison, but does that kind of \u2013 how do you think of that in terms of your server business? I mean does that have the same type of dollar potential of your server business, and maybe just it's a year or 18 months kind of behind the automotive ramp. If we look out two years or three years, I mean, are we talking about something that could be up $50 million business or more? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I think the $50 million for a server was a \u2013 it's a failure. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : We're looking for a lot, lot, lot higher numbers. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : I think that you've touched on a good point there as far as the parallel between the two, and that we're little further ahead in the automotive as far as how we were able to make the long-term commitment to the market that it takes to get designed in, and we're seeing those benefits now. And likewise, we've just released particularly the QS MOD products that are ideally suited to the servers going forward. And with the next design cycle for the Intel processors, we expect to pick up an awful lot of that business and market share. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in, you guys. Any update on the ramp at your new foundry, and what percent of costs are in now versus what's left out there, Bernie? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think that we've been very consistent as far as how we portrayed this, that we had about a $2 million investment to make in this year. We'll have cycled through the majority of that by the end of Q3, and there may be a little bit of tail into Q4, but as I said in the previous call, we've already started taking the material deliveries from the fab. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on Ross' behalf. Congrats on the solid quarter. I wanted to ask, why is the CapEx notably higher year-over-year. Could you give us any specificity on what's driving that? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. We have a couple of things that are going on. We have a relatively consistent spend rate that has to do with the testing equipment, mainly in our Chengdu facility. This time we also purchased a office space for our Shenzhen location. And so, the two of those events are really costing the bump up, but when you look at the office space investment, we are doing that on a basis that expands our capacity as far as the number of people that we can have in that office, and we're doing that on the basis that is less dilutive than if we had continued to rent. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : The operating cost was the higher, so they helped the EPS. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. And that actually feeds into my next question. I heard the answer to the ramp of the fourth foundry, but is there anything else to call out in your 3Q OpEx guide as far as any other operating costs or anything more specific there would be helpful? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : No. As we referenced in the script here, we did a fair amount of staffing in Q3. Some of that was related to new product investment. A lot of it was also related to sales and marketing resources. So when you look at the operating expense growth, which we again tried to project last quarter, you see sort of the one-time expense that's going to ramp down in the fab investment, and then we will not be necessarily doing a repeat of the level of investment that we're making going forward, so that's going to get trending out as our revenues continue to increase. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And one last one... Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We \u2013 this was the case here that you can't grow the company out of thin air. And we managed the growth, we managed the gross margin, however in the expense, maybe it's not \u2013 there's a lot of conditional, and we have opportunity to hide people and also it's time to upgrade the fab, and that's we talked to \u2013 or we communicated to our shareholders in many quarters ago. This year it will go up a little bit, but however, we're still operating within our margin and within our business model, and we will continue to do the same. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And I'm sorry one last one, just to go full circle a little bit on the CapEx side. Any direction you could give us on what CapEx is going to be going forward? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. The model as far as looking at additional opportunities in order to replace leased office space with purchased is continuing. So if you look at our office locations, you can see there's probably two or three candidates that still remain as opportunities for us to invest in. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. First, let me offer my congrats to you Bernie on the promotion to CFO. I wanted to just follow-up on that OpEx question. You look at the fourth quarter, and understand you're not going to give us a fourth quarter guide, but just want to make sure I understand sort of the dynamics. Obviously, you've talked about some of the increased staffing levels to fund new R&D plus some strategic sales and marketing, but it also sounds like the fourth foundry is contributing to some of that higher OpEx in Q3. Just kind of wondering as you look to Q4, you wrap up that foundry expense which I think is kind of one-time in nature, do you see potentially then a flattening out for a quarter or two? Is that foundry spending comes out of the OpEx model and we get back kind of more in line with your longer-term plan? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Obviously with our longer-term plan and if you look at our spending, I know the Wall Street doesn't look in the past. But if you look at our past, some year we spend high, other one we spend almost \u2013 don't spend at-all, and don't increase the spending at all. So that's the nature of the business. And to answer your questions, after fourth quarter or so, I think that we go back to our long-term plan, and then we end up well below at the lower end of our model. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : And as we hire a few more people, we still need absorbent. We cannot just continue to hide. We need to absorb and we reorganized the teams a little bit and that's the nature our business is. This year it happened to have a few good people available, we can hide. And we are very picky to hide people and we only choose a few good guys. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Quinn, I think you see... Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : ... this is very sound, in that flattening to down as far as \u2013 because we no longer have the need for the further investment in the fab. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : And also hiring. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, and hiring is going to slowdown. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: (25:14). Got it. Good. And just wanted to follow-up on a couple of the product questions. First, Bernie in his script talked about seeing server strength or really server storage and high-end notebook strength. Just wondering if you could break out was it across the board? I know the Broadwell server platform is ramping now and I think you've had some content gains. Just wondering, if you could comment perhaps more specifically on the server outlook, especially you made comments about the QS MOD? And then last question, just a follow-up on Rick's question about the communications business. If half of the business now was no longer gateway, are there one or two product areas where most of that infrastructure or non-gateway business is targeted, or is it fairly well diversified outside of gateways in the comm bucket? Thanks. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. So to give a little bit more granularity, first on the storage and computing. We're looking at \u2013 first off let's talk to storage which has enjoyed some significant growth particularly in SSD, but that's been counterbalanced by what we've been seeing with the HDD marketplace. So, I think the overall trend line in storage remains very positive. But I think that when you look at our near-term prospects, it's going to be overshadowed by the opportunity that we see in both the notebooks, where we are starting to graduate to, looking ahead to the next-generation of servers from the Skylake to Kaby Lake, both in terms of \u2013 there're more opportunities where we are getting designed in and we see that actually Kaby Lake is getting a little bit of delay. And that actually works to our benefit because it's giving us more of an opportunity to be able to get designed in for the Kaby Lake release, which should be out in the 2017-ish there. But on the servers, I think that's a very consistent story where we had been able to gain content and dollar value that we've been selling in, particularly to the Tier 1s within the current Grantley cycle. And those relationships as well as the their understanding of what our technology does particularly with QS MOD which has really been gaining traction, probably on par ahead of what we've expected. And so I'd say that the two growth drivers for those areas would be the notebooks and the servers, and that would come about evenly and we may get some net pick up from storage, but again, you've got two offsetting dynamics there. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Understood. Thanks for the additional color, Bernie. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. When you look at your second question, as far as the communications, one of the things that we are seeing better traction on is as far as the network or telecom business. And again, as Michael pointed out during our first comments, that it is kind of a lumpy business. It takes a long time to get designed in. And even though we see some initial opportunities particularly in the next probably two quarters to three quarters, it'll really be when the next set of products are released that we see the uplift there. And then as far as on the gateway, you know a coloring item there that we've discussed in the past is that we sort of play some of the low margin business opportunistically. So, in a quarter like this where we had visibility of the types of gains that we had in both the industrial and computing, we really didn't have to draw much from that market space. And so as the consequence, it really was not just a \u2013 it didn't grow, but it actually had expense decrease. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Melissa Fairbanks from Raymond James. Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. It's Melissa Fairbanks for Steve Smigie. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what you're expecting for mix in the September quarter. Do you have any comments on seasonality or what we should look at between the segments? Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Sure, Melissa. Thank you for that. So I think that in our traditional model, Q3 would've been colored by a ramp of consumer. And you know we are getting some benefit from that. And particularly, in some of the high value \u2013 what we refer to as high-value consumer opportunities such as gaming which is really starting to generate some additional revenue as we go into the holiday season, but I think that in fairness, the growth drivers are really coming out of what we're seeing in the computing and the industrial and automotive market segments for us. Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And within industrial, you have highlighted the automotive opportunities. Looking longer-term, are there any areas within ADAS that you feel well-positioned to compete in? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We feel that. As we said it in some of the small meters and also other industrial equipment and the security side. These area we are very... Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Optimistic. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : ... optimistic, yeah. Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Let me add one more thing to that, is that even though automotive is both the largest individual contributor as well as the largest growth driver, it's kind of unfortunate that these other areas that Michael just mentioned get overshadowed by comparison, because cumulatively they're a little bit smaller than automotive, but their growth rates remain very attractive and we believe that there will continue to be growth drivers not just for the remainder of this year, but well into 2017 and 2018. Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We don't want to be known as a automotive company. And we want to have a very balanced growth across all the segments. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on your new role, Bernie and congratulations to your company for the solid execution. Just a few questions here. For the last few quarters, you've been growing the top-line 15%, 16% year-over-year. Michael, I know you're quite ambitious and your targets are higher than that. So based on your current visibility, when do you think you could start to potentially see some acceleration above that growth rate? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I think as we \u2013 yeah, it's above this growth rate as I talked about it in the early quarters. And then I think it happened in the second half of \u2013 starting second half of next year and we will break out more than 20% gross. And I see it as not only from automotive as we keep talking about, like I mean automotive then in \u2013 but we do have other areas, like servers, even consumers \u2013 in the consumer segment. We see a variety of a designing activities and our products are proven to be the choice for all these segments. And we look it overall, I think our three years, four years \u2013 our planning, okay, it will happen in the next year, in a year and a half. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : And just to reiterate a couple of the growth drivers that I think you're talking about, that we've talked about is continuation of strength in automotive as well as in the other industrial categories. The computing really as far as looking at the Grantley conversion to Purley, the design win activity that we have there. Likewise, with Skylake going to Kaby Lake. We also have the introduction of the modules which we'll really be ramping and taking off. And we also have our battery management systems which are scheduled to come out there. So you really have a number of opportunities that are all hitting the market at about the same time, and that's what gives rise to our optimism. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And you mentioned the inventory in the channel was down sequentially. I don't know if you could put any numbers or data on that? And do you feel like at this point maybe the channel is carrying out the true lean of your products? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : No. What was interesting is, generally speaking, the channel is investing as you're looking at going into Q3. And midway through the quarter, that was our experience. And then in the last month we saw a couple of geographic pockets that had higher demand than we'd expected, and we obviously manage or dip the inventory between a range of 30 days to 45 days, and we're sort of in the middle of that, right now, having come down about 10% on days. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And on visibility, I think the consistent theme lately has been your backlog has started to grow; maybe not just the 90-day backlog but even beyond that. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that, and how that's helping you sort of manage the business? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So as we've had the experience of being able to transition away from consumer, which tends to rely much heavily on turns business. We have been able to finish the quarter with visibility that's as long as four months to six months out, and that's been one of the side benefits that we've enjoyed as we've picked up more of the industrial, but also computing that both those demand longer lead times. So as a result, it gives us the confidence to be able to project our revenues as well as our gross margin and then sort of establish the base financial model around that as much as you know four months to six months ahead of time. So, at least in the environment that we're enjoying right now where there's a minimum of either economic headwinds or any other variables, it's led to a very stable and predictable alignment for which has to manage high level of growth. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : So in our turns business when we go in the quarter, it's much, much lower than that of a few years ago, even two years ago. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : And I can finish just by adding the comment that when we look at Q3, we're not in a dissimilar position from where we were in Q2. And I even say that recognizing that we're releasing our earnings to you today about a week ahead of when we did it last quarter. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. And if I could just add one comment. Looks like, taking your guidance, you're going to be doing close to 28% operating margin in the September quarter. So I wouldn't be too apologetic about the higher OpEx, so great job guys. Thank you very much. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you very much. Now you make my day. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you for that comment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla from William Blair & Co. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey guys. Bernie, congrats on your appointment and wishing you the best of success in this new position. I had a couple of questions. So Michael, when I look at telecom, obviously there's been quite a big effort from you to transition into telecom; big metal infrastructure products. We've seen the performance over the last, call it, four quarters, showing kind of year-over-year decline. Bernie talked about certain near-term dynamics where you kind of pulled back on it. But when I look back at the telecom business, I mean how has this played out with respect to your prior expectations maybe a couple of years ago? Has it been basically a macro driven event, or has it been cancellation of products that you're designed in? I mean how would you characterize from your point of view, your exposure to these big metal projects, so to speak? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : All right. Okay. I'll give you a straight answer. One thing is \u2013 okay, four years ago we laid out our plans we're going to do this, this and that, and telecom was a part of it. We have other low-hanging fruits, and we got it. And telecom is sort of neglected. And so I had to say that. And as a result, that reflects what's been there today. Although in the telecom content, we're using other product, mainly these are \u2013 such as point of load and the other ones, the power of Ethernet and we grow some market shares. And these are much higher values than gateway business, but my take on it is we have to have a killer product. And while releasing this killer product and that's a family (40:56). And we address this telecom market. It is very easy to use and very high efficiencies and a very compact size. And I think that we're going to be \u2013 these products would be far better than everybody else in the market now. And we expect it to have a very, very good growth. However, the telecom as you know \u2013 again it kind of is even slower than automotive, and their product cycles, we have to meet with it, but long-term perspectives of it very good. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: So the killer product Michael that you're talking about is that that module that Bernie and you mentioned. Is that the killer product or is it yet to come? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : No. It is FPPM \u2013 based on the FPPM technologies and targeted telecom applications. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And this will be more of a 2017 event or from actually material contribution... Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I think some of them \u2013 it can convert into a 2017 or 2018. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. There's going to be some alignment. Again, the telecom industry is going to go from four to five. And during that transition, we'll probably pick up more design opportunities. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: So is it fair to say Michael till this killer product comes out, the way telecom will behave would be kind of plus, minus in this range, nothing spectacular, but it kind of work its way, chug its way through, so to speak? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I mean for the dollar amount, yes our case is similar, but the content probably grow to a higher margin area, less of a point low for gateway, but the gateway businesses are pretty quick. And within the half year, we can turn it on and turn it off. So we judge our growth and we judge the fab capacities. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. And on the automotive side, what is the contribution. Is it \u2013 can you break down what was the percentage of revenues from automotive during the quarter? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : I'm sorry. You mean, as far as the automotive as a percent of the industrial group? Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Oh, industrial or total revenue whatever you want to say. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's about \u2013 oh yeah. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. What we intend to do there is do that on sort of an annualized basis. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : So what I indicated previously is that, at last year it represented a little over a third of the industrial group and it's growing, you know, I think not quite a doubling but at a very high double-digit growth rate when the group itself is growing at, you know, in the 40%s. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Very good. And the server, obviously, a big effort on server starting from Grantley. Grantley was the first push. It worked out okay, but nothing spectacular, I think. But now with these new rounds of servers obviously you've got a more bigger platform, more content. So Michael, when you step back and look at the current version of the rollout, can you quantify the number of design wins, the total design win dollars. Anything that we could kind of appreciate, how good you guys are doing on that front? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : We don't release design win activities and we don't release the particular project to design wins, meaning we don't as our competitors are looking at us very carefully. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : And very closely. And however, so I'm not going to say look we have \u2013 in the last half years, all these first tiers really opened up all the opportunity to MPS, and lot of them are very highly visible project. MPS won it. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : So I can add to it. I think Anil you did a good job at helping us by saying that the dollar content per server is going to go up significantly because we now have a very competitive VCORE solution. And the design wins that we're enjoying are reflective of all the content that we have and they're broad-based as far as the number of tier one and tier two server OEMs that we're working with. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : But all this revenue we generated now more than 70%-80% or maybe not. Yeah 70%-80% \u2013 at least about 70% as well from a point of load for ease-of-use. And the core power is just start to ramp now. And as you see that what the market size is, okay, and there is only a very few players, and MPS can be a significant player there. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. And Michael finally if I \u2013 don't mind me squeezing in on the Brushless motor control. It's obviously a topic you guys are very excited about. We've had some ups and downs on it. Can you give us any kind of update on the Brushless motor control? Where you guys are? What the market is? How the market is behaving? And when can we see any kind of a good ramp in that business? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I don't say it as it is up and down. I think there is everything as expected. And then, I think, in the last quarter said that we delayed that chip for a couple of months. Now we have it in our \u2013 in the Bernie's script we said it, okay, we sampled our chip. We have the chip product. And a couple of customers, okay they want \u2013 and they start to evaluating it. And actually we're working with them very closely on it. The first time the chip is functioning well, and meet our expectations. That's a very complex product and both we and our customers, they're surprised, even working. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Very good. So revenues from this would be 2016 or 2017 from this new sample chip? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : We're generating revenue currently and we're actually starting to get a good ramp, but I think we try to set the expectations out into 2017 and 2018. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : 2017-2018 \u2013 more in 2018. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : And I have a very high expectation on this technology as you know, and that will really a revolution change the way we do and manage the E.MOTION, okay or generate energy. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Well, great. And we're looking forward to it and Bernie once again, congrats. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Chanda from Wells Fargo. Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Hi, this is Amit Chanda dialing in for David Wong. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, could you talk about your e-commerce effort to sell your modules how that process is coming along? Are a lot of your customers using that channel to help grow your module business at the moment? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Well we haven't just set-up a website, we're just starting to selling the modules so we haven't \u2013 clearly you look at our website hasn't launched it yet. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : The e-commerce rollout is initially expected to help with demand creation as far as being able to reach areas of the market that we could not cost-effectively do. So when you look at the initial opportunity when we launch what we're expecting to be able to do is right now there's a very high service component in order to be able to get design wins. And if we have to add one Fae in order to get one account, what we want to get to is to lower our sales and marketing investment, because we're able to attract and get customers designed in through the e-commerce solution. So it's going be something that we'll be introducing and then it's going to evolve and develop. But it won't be an immediate click the switch and have all our business transitioned to that platform. Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And when do you expect to have that fully launched by? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We have \u2013 you will see our website changing in the next couple of months or so. Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Okay. And then as a follow-up question regarding automotive, can you provide us with an update on when you might penetrate the powertrain business specifically? Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I think that we want to avoid the powertrain. Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : The powertrain and a lot of them are single failure components. Can we \u2013 those area we want to avoid it. And of course, if they want to buy, okay, we won't buy any of these liabilities that came in and but we are focused on the infotainment, lighting, camera and... A \u2013 [009PNL-E Bernie Blegen]>: Networking. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : ... networking the call \u2013 networking even something ignition area \u2013 in summa safety arena where we will engage with all business, but the powertrain's no. Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then on average, can you give us a sense for what Monolithic's dollar content is tracking within automotive at the moment? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Well, it's very variable. Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I think as average of \u2013 on analyst day, we said we have a model pulling up, it's like somewhere the $1.40. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, is the opportunity.

Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities Steve Smigie - Raymond James Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems' Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the floor over to Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Bernie Blegen : Thank you, Karen [ph]. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter 2016 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. In the course of today's conference call we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor Statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2016 which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2016, Q2 2016 and Q3 2016 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Revenue for the third quarter was $106.5 million, up 16.7% from a year ago. Non-GAAP gross margin at 55.3% was 20 basis points higher from the prior year, and non-GAAP operating income was $29.4 million, up 24% year over year. Our growth in third quarter revenue over the prior year was due primarily to a 30% gain in computing and storage revenue and continued growth in our industrial market segment where revenue increased 22.8%. In our computing segment, revenue increased to $23.5 million compared with the $18.0 million reported in the prior year, reflecting strength in high-performance notebooks and servers. In our computing and storage market segment, much of the revenue increase is attributable to market validation of our power management solution based on MPS's digitally designed quantum state modulation or QS Mod. Digital design allows our power management module to deliver the precise amount of power even as processor requirements go from peak to minimal in as little as a few nanoseconds. This is critical as cloud computing servers include a number of power-hungry features such as quad-core processors. The increasing power requirements of these features introduces difficult trade-offs for OEM power supply designers. In order to meet these dynamic power requirements while maintaining a small form factor, designs must be extremely energy efficient and plays a premium on reducing component count, complexity and size. We believe these characteristics, characteristics which are specific to our proprietary digitally designed QS Mod products are valuable to OEM designers. As the server market transitions from Intel's Grantley family to Purley in about one year's time, we expect this significant design win activity we have enjoyed to date to translate into market share and revenue gains. In our industrial segment, sales rose to $23.2 million, compared with $18.9 million reported in the prior year, fueled by increased product sales for automotive and smart meters. Over the past few years, MPS has been recognized by tier 1 OEM automotive customers as a high-quality and reliable supplier. We expect our future growth in automotive will be supported by the attractiveness of our superior efficiency and ease of use. We will continue to invest in our quality and customer support capabilities as we enjoy gains within this market segment. In our consumer segment, revenue increased 10.5% to $43.6 million, compared with $39.5 million in Q3 of 2015. A majority of this increase was driven by sales gains in IoT and home appliances. As we look ahead, we see continued improvement in IoT, home and appliances, gaming and other selective high-value consumer opportunities. In our communication market segment, revenue of $16.2 million rose $1.4 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting gains in gateway revenue. Finally, development of our E.MOTION product family is continuing, with customers evaluating our single-chip prototype. We are further refining the software and firmware and optimizing its performance based on specific customer demand. We remain positive about this game-changing E.MOTION technology. Turning back to the financials. Compared with the prior quarter, Q3 2016 revenue increased $12.4 million or 13%, reflecting revenue gains in computing, consumer and communications. Revenue mix for the quarter was 41% consumer, 22% industrial, 22% computing, and 15% communications. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $27.5 million or $0.66 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.55 per share in Q3 2015 and $0.54 per share in the previous quarter. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Let's review our operating expenses. As indicated on last quarter's call, we expect an increase in operating expenses this quarter as we ramped investment in new product development, incurred costs associated with the development of our fourth fab, and capitalized on new business opportunities through strategic sales and marketing investments. As such, our non-GAAP third quarter 2016 operating expenses of $29.4 million were $1.7 million higher than the $27.7 million we spent in the second quarter of 2016. Our third quarter 2016 GAAP operating expenses of $42.9 million were $3.5 million higher than GAAP operating expenses reported in the second quarter. The difference between non-GAAP and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation and an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp expense increased $1.8 million between quarters, reflecting a catch-up adjustment for the performance-based element of our MPSU program. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $264.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2016, up $15.2 million from the $249.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $33.3 million, compared with $12.8 million reported in the prior quarter. This increase in cash flow reflected a decrease in net working capital and other long-term assets. Spending on capital equipment and office-based totaled $11.1 million. We paid $8.2 million in dividends in third quarter. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter at $33.3 million, up from the $31.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were 28 days -- days of sales outstanding were 28 days in the third quarter of 2016, which was 2 days lower than the year-ago quarter and 2 days lower than the 30 days reported in the second quarter of 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter were $70.7 million, higher than the $69.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days in inventory at the end of Q3 of 133 days decreased 14 days from 147 days at the end of Q2. Inventory in our distribution channel decreased from the Q2 2016 level, reflecting an overall increase in end-customer demand. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $101 million to $105 million. We also expect the following. Non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 54.8% to 55.8%. GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 53.9% to 54.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense will be between $11.8 million to $13.8 million. Litigation expenses will be between $100,000 to $200,000. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense will be in the range of $27.3 million to $29.3 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Interest and other income should be between $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains and losses. Fully diluted shares will be in the range of 42.0 million to 43.0 million shares. In conclusion, thanks to acceptance of our new product offerings and with our shareholder support, we will continue to invest and deliver outstanding products for our customers and consistent results to our shareholders. I'll now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anil Doradla from William Blair. Anil Doradla - William Blair : Hey guys. Good job and congrats. So I had a couple of questions. So, can you go over the compute strength, especially in the context of Purley and what's going on? Has there been any change? And if so, what are the key reasons here? Bernie Blegen : Thank you, Anil. So as far as the current quarter performance, we really saw the growth drivers to be sort of evenly split between our performance in high-end notebooks as well as in the server model. And as we look out ahead, those should be continued sources of strength, well into next year, before the Purley cycle transitions. So at this point, as far as the adoption rate and the ramp activity that we've been expecting, we don't see any changes. Anil Doradla - William Blair : Okay, great. And on automotive, can you give some qualitative idea of the contribution? I know you've had somewhere, anywhere between I think one-third or something like that. How much of -- is auto as part of the industrial today? Bernie Blegen : Sure. So I usually wait until I get a full year of activity before we sort of break out the segmentation. So you are correct that, at the end of last year, automotive accounted for about a third of industrial, which would represent about 7% of our total. It has been growing at an attractive double-digit rate, high double-digit rate, albeit not as fast as it had in 2014 and 2015 when it doubled. Anil Doradla - William Blair : Great, guys. Michael Hsing : This is Michael. This is Michael. Anil Doradla - William Blair : Hi, Michael. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Both automotive and computing segments are -- where MPS just entered only two or three years in the market. Three years ago we have a zero revenues and now we have a fraction of the total market size. So the opportunity for growth is very big. Anil Doradla - William Blair : Excellent. Congrats guys, and looking forward to a great 2017. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rich Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks guys, and great quarter. I had a couple of questions. Maybe the first one, I haven't asked this one before, but I know we focus a lot on your opportunities with all your new products, your new markets you're getting into and penetrating. But if we look at your business by customer, can you comment on any significant new opportunities there? Any sort of potential 10% type customers that you see over the next year or two? Michael Hsing : We don't see it. We have -- we gained more than 10% of number of -- 10% of customers. As a matter of fact, we don't have any. And in the last few years we tried to hard to diversify the company product portfolio and also customer portfolio -- customer profile. And we found out in the last few years that we expand our customer base by, I don't have exact numbers, by four, five times. And probably even more. And so it's a lot more than diversified now. And I will continue our -- in the future, I will continue to see the same trend. Rich Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. Bernie Blegen : And probably add to that, very quickly, is that we're able to demonstrate in a lot of different market segments where we've been introduced to new customers and we've started out with some relatively low-end offerings and then we've been able to incorporate their feedback into our design and sort of go up as far as the amount of dollar content that we sell into them. So I think that in addition to just the pure acquisition of new customers that Michael referenced, we've also been able to do a good job of capitalizing on those relationships and growing them. Rich Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. And then just a follow-up on storage, I mean it's up very big again for you guys. I mean, are we already beginning to see the benefit of the ASP bump you guys enjoy with the new PCIe and SAS PMICs, or is this something else that's driving the growth and that's still going to be an incremental leg-up? Bernie Blegen : I think that in storage, and again I referenced this in the previous call, is that, you're exactly correct that we have very good opportunities there and it is as we increase the dollar content. The real story in the segment has to do again with the notebooks and servers. In storage we have sort of a mixed view as you've got some gains accruing in SSD and then some sort of mixed signals in the HDD market. So I think that you're going to see a very positive trend for that segment that's going to be at or just below our corporate average, but really the near-term growth drivers are in the servers and in the notebooks. Rich Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.: Got it. And then my last question, and I know Michael will laugh [ph], I know he says he can't grow the company out of thin air, but fourth quarter OpEx seems a little higher than we expected. I mean, what drives that in 4Q? And when can we expect OpEx growth to probably drop closer to your target range, closer to 50% of top line? Thanks. Michael Hsing : Well, I'll let Bernie to answer that question. Bernie Blegen : I'd be happy to. Thank you very much, Michael. So as far as the operating expenses, I think that two of the big growth drivers there have been our investment in new products as well as an increase in investment in sales and marketing. And much of this has been achieved through headcount acquisitions. While the pace of those headcount additions is probably going to slow, we'll need to annualize those costs next year, and then on top of that, we will continue to make selective net headcount additions. So the punch line in this is that we're probably going to look at a flattening in our rate of growth and returning to, you know, our expense model, but we don't expect to go, you know, see a decrease in the growth of -- the rate of growth of the operating expenses. Rich Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.: Got it. Thanks guys. Michael Hsing : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Hey guys. I wanted to ask a little bit of a longer-term question. On the last call you talked about getting your revenue growth maybe at or above even 20% the back half of next year. It sounds like you have a lot of good drivers just from tonight's call that you've already talked about. But if we put it in a 2017 as a whole perspective, what do you think will be the biggest tailwinds from a product cycle point of view? And are there any headwinds? Michael Hsing : I don't see any headwinds and all these products, like servers and like power modules and among the other things, okay, we talk about it, and a lot of them, especially from a computing side, is not really up to MPS, okay? We did what we can and all the seats are planted [ph]. And we see the initial results. And the higher growth, okay, as we expected -- high growth rate and we expected next few years, is all depending on the whether the adoption rate of new models. And this is the same as in all the other area. We have many design win activities and many projects under qualifications, and whether it's -- if we're going the same trend and the growth rate will be much higher than the corporate average in all the segments. Bernie Blegen : And just to add to that, is that I think you did a good job of saying that the two near-term growth drivers are firmly in place and we're seeing good execution. And then as we look to next year, we believe that the ramp of new product introductions, in particular with the new server opportunity, as well as the modules start to ramp, will be additive to that. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : I guess that's a perfect lead-in to my follow-up. When you were talking about the near-term trends, the positive trends in the computing side of things, you mentioned a good roadmap of growth up until Purley. Talk a little bit about what happens again when Purley launches? Because, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that actually should be a further acceleration as opposed to what could have been perceived in your answer prior as something changing to the negative. Bernie Blegen : Exactly right. Thank you, giving me the chance to clarify that point. Is that, as we looked at the last two to three years, we've developed relationships with many of the tier 1 and tier 2 server providers. And in the Grantley, the current version, we've sold low dollar content for point of load and for e-fuses [ph]. And as we looked to the transition to the Purley sometime in the fall of next year, we expect also to be able to complement those sales with our V-core [ph] solution. So our dollar content per server will go from $13 per box up to $49 per box. So we're very optimistic with the design wins that we've already seen converting into market share and revenue gains. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Great. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Okay, let me, okay, add on this. I don't have -- in terms of a high growth rate in the 2017, okay. As I said it earlier, we expected that. In this near term, and I don't have any crystal ball as everybody else, but I'm very firmly believe and in the future, 2017, 2018, 2019, when everything is in place. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Great. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co.: Hi, Michael; hi, Bernie. Just wanted to ask one on the OpEx. You guys have been ramping or spending on ramp in a fourth foundry. And I think on the last call you had said that most of those incremental expenses would be wrapped up by the third quarter. Just wanted to see if you could give us an update on the fourth foundry spending? Bernie Blegen : Sure. The fourth foundry has been developing quite nicely and in fact almost entirely according to plan. So we're actually very pleased with the development. Now the news that's additive to that is that we've made the decision to be able to transfer more new products into the fourth fab because we find that it's -- the capacity is there to take advantage of, as well as there are certain cost advantages that we've been able to take advantage of. So on that basis, we would see that we're going to continue to invest into next year, albeit at a lower rate, but still there'll be, you know, additional wafer spend and map sets as we bring the new products up in the next two to three quarters. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Overall we just do it as we promised. We grow revenues, okay, and we grow the OpEx, less than 60% of the revenue growth. And so last year, everybody criticized us, we go 61%, okay, [inaudible] just 1%. Next year we'll be in the model. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co.: Great. Okay. And then I was wondering, I think you guys -- you talked about your high-value consumer opportunities for a while. I think one of those being gaming. It sounds like you guys have had some success on that front. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as you look into 2017, how important gaming could be next year. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think that we've been consistent there as far as once again it's an area where there's three primary gaming companies and we've been developing relationships primarily with two of them, although not to the exclusion of the third. And once again I think we've seen that we've started out with sort of lower-value content and then been able to further develop those relationships and increase the content. So as we look ahead to design wins that we have solidified for next year, we seem very positive for continuing growth in gaming. Michael Hsing : The gaming is just like any other segment. We have -- we clearly see our advantage in being, as a matter of fact, in all computing segments. Gaming is a part of it and use a lot of computing power and it's very opportunistic, and we will get the market. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Yes, thank you, and congratulations on another record quarter. You want a trick-or-treat question? Sorry, bad joke. So, first question, can we dig into automotive a little bit more? You talked about your dollar [ph] content in server. But if we look at automotive, my understanding is so far most of the growth has been coming from LED lighting. At what point do you start to see really an inflection point as far as dollar [ph] content in automotive and what are some of the technologies or components that would come from? Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think that I'm going to answer this from the inverse as far as some of the areas that were probably not as receptive to go into, and then I can develop the more optimistic form of the answer, is that automotive is an area that we want to be measured where we invest our technology. We're doing a very good job as far as developing our QA and our reliability, but there are areas in the automobile such as the powered train and the ADAS that may not be as high a value to us when you take into account what the risk potential could be. So we'll continue to expand in our areas that we have much more strength as far as the infotainment, as in the body lighting and audio systems, and in certain aspects, both safety as well as in the networking. But we're also making sort of a cautious approach to automotive so that we make sure that we are able to uphold what's best for the company as well as for our shareholders. Michael Hsing : Yeah, the automotive, we will be criticized that if we spend money to build up the infrastructures for all these safeties [inaudible]. And now we just play what we can. And we're not explaining the budget. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, that's helpful. And a question on the quantum state modulation technology. Obviously that's giving you great success for design wins in the server market. Is there any other areas out there that we should keep an eye on as far as where that technology is applied and you're gaining some design wins? Michael Hsing : Yeah. As we said -- as I said the last quarter, we didn't do well in the communication area. So, although we gained some high-value targets and we exchanged with low to more in the high value content in the revenue stream. I said we will release some good killer products in the market segment, and that's a quantum state, QS Mod, like we'll have a series of products we're going to announce in this quarter. And if you go to Electronica, we will show it there. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Very good. One last question, you've obviously talked in the past about programmable power modules. I was just hoping to get an update there, because that technology is sort of thought of being used to go after the industrial market. And just want to understand your success there so far, especially with the sales strategy. Michael Hsing : It is slow process, okay. We gain market -- many segments of the market accepted it, that from IoT, from industrials, autos and communication segment, even computing, that's in the service, right? And the revenue is ramping but it's still small. It's not that small anymore, but it's ramping. It hasn't really moved the needle yet, the entire company's revenue. That, I expected that will be next few years you will see a significant revenue contributors. Bernie Blegen : And just to sort of complete the thought, what differentiates us is both the power management technology, but as importantly, it's the energy efficiency and the ease of use. And we think that, as we look forward to the adoption rates, particularly as we convert from the predesigned modules into field programmability, we see significant opportunities. We're very committed to this market. Michael Hsing : The product that we're going to announce is -- we'll have any current up to 500 amp current, up to 500 amp. And everything can be modulized and require a very or no -- very minimal or no design work. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Very good. Congratulations again guys. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo. David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities : Thanks so much. Can you give us a rough idea of what proportion of your storage division, storage and computing division, is servers? And was the year-over-year growth in server in the September quarter? Bernie Blegen : Sure. The servers, again using the full year numbers, the -- I'm sorry, did you say storage or servers? David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities : Servers. Yes, what proportion is servers? Bernie Blegen : Okay. So again using last year as sort of the baseline for it, servers only accounted for between 10% and 15% of the market segment, and the growth of servers is not quite triple digits but it's in the very high double digits this year. David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Steve Smigie - Raymond James : Great. Thanks guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about computing in Q3 and Q4 or all storage and computing, in the sense that, thinking what we saw with Intel, had a very strong quarter, but then the guidance is a little bit below expectations. It sounds like overall the business is looking really great, but I just want to try to make sure I have expectations right for Q4. Would it be fair to say that Q3 is maybe a little bit stronger than expected and so Q4 might be down a little bit more than seasonal or something like that? Bernie Blegen : So if you look at Intel, they're looking at the desktop and the notebook market in total, both the high end and low end. And we're benefiting from sort of an upswing that's occurring currently with both the adoption of our technology into the high-end notebooks, as well as the development of pretty strong performance in the high-end notebook market. So that's what differentiates ourselves I think from their story. And we did have a good performance in Q3 which actually fell in line with our expectations, and we don't necessarily see that same falloff in Q4. Steve Smigie - Raymond James : Okay, great. And then within industrial, you guys mentioned the strength in metering as you did last quarter. Can you talk about how big that is? And I'm assuming overall industrials is still pretty disperse and that's just kind of one example, but I was kind of wondering how impactful metering is to that overall business at this point. Bernie Blegen : Sure. Metering has actually been growing very, very well. And while we tend to focus primarily on the automotive part of the story of industrial, meter is growing at a rate that is significantly above our corporate average and it's not from an insubstantial base. So when you look industrial, again, as you said, we are very diversified because we also have sources coming -- revenue sources coming from meter as well as security and point-of-sale systems, and all three of those lines are developing quite nicely. Steve Smigie - Raymond James : Okay. And last question was just, could you give some sense sequentially how you might expect each of the segments to perform? Bernie Blegen : Sequentially, I think if you look at our guidance here, revenue is decreasing in Q4 a little less than normal seasonal average. And really that reflects the diversification because we're seeing sort of flattish performance in the communications and computing. You have a normal sort of seasonal down in consumer and we still see good growth in industrial. Steve Smigie - Raymond James : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. He just left the queue. With no additional questions at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Bernie Blegen for closing comments. Bernie Blegen : I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the conference call and look forward to talking to you again in the fourth quarter conference call. Thank you and have a happy Halloween. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Let's begin with a top-level summary of 2016 revenue. Our full-year revenue was $388.7 million, up 16.7% from the $333.1 million MPS reported for 2015. This year-over-year growth compared favorably with the analog industry which SIA estimates grew 5.8% over the prior year. On a GAAP basis, full-year 2016 gross margin of 54.3% expanded 20 basis points from the prior year. GAAP operating income grew to $54.4 million, representing a 32.6% increase over 2015. Finally, MPS recorded GAAP EPS of $1.26. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin expanded 20 basis points from the prior year to 55.2%. Non-GAAP operating income of $102.6 million grew 25.6% over 2015. MPS achieved record non-GAAP full-year earnings of $2.30 per share, 21.7% higher than 2015. Diving into year-over-year revenue growth by market segment. Full-year computing and storage revenue was up 42.4% and industrial revenue grew 35.1%. Full-year consumer revenue was up 6.0% over 2015 and communications revenue was essentially flat between years. Let me speak to highlights by market segment. In computing and storage, full-year 2016 revenue of $80.6 million increased $24.0 million year-over-year, reflecting strong sales growth for cloud computing, SSD storage and high-end PCs. Computing and storage revenue represented 20.7% of MPS's total revenue in 2016. In the industrial market segment, revenue grew $23.2 million to $89.6 million, fueled by product sales for applications in automotive, security, smart meters and power sources. Industrial revenue as a percentage of total revenue grew to 23.1% in 2016. Revenue from consumer markets increased to $153.7 million and represented 39.6% of our total revenue. The year-over-year revenue increase was driven primarily by gains in high-value consumer markets, including home appliances and battery management systems. While MPS has consistently achieved high rates of revenue growth, we believe our technology lead is widening, and we are in the early stages of expanding our addressable market. With increasing visibility into long-term design engagements, we believe MPS is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. As a case in point, with our superior digital power solutions, we continue to successfully win and gain share for high-end, space-limited notebook solutions. As Intel transitions to the Purley server cycle later this year, we believe MPS' energy-efficient solutions positions us for growth in cloud-based data centers. In gaming, our QS Mod solutions are being adopted by a major gaming OEM for its high-end console. In addition, we believe the significant automotive design win momentum experienced during the past four years will continue to drive industrial revenue growth. Finally, we have completed development of a high-voltage SOI process technology, which will enable us to grow into a number of new market segments. In the next few quarters, we will be introducing a number of products utilizing this technology for the medical market. Switching to Q4, MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $103.6 million, 2.7% lower than revenue generated in the prior quarter, but 19.2% higher than the comparable quarter in 2015. By market segment, revenue for computing and storage grew 60.8%, and industrial revenue rose 40.5% over the same period of 2015. Quarterly revenue for the communications segment increased 7.6% over the prior-year period, while consumer revenue was essentially flat with the prior-year period. GAAP gross margin was 54.5%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter of 2016 and 50 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Our GAAP operating income was $17.5 million, compared to $15.0 million reported in the prior quarter of 2016 and $11.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2016, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.4%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter of 2016 and 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $29.0 million, compared to the $29.4 million reported in the prior quarter and the $22.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $39.0 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $42.9 million in the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2016 operating expenses were $28.4 million, down from the $29.4 million we spent in the third quarter and up from the $25.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. On both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter litigation expenses represented a $321,000 net credit, as a portion of a $3 million IP settlement was recorded as income. The remainder of this settlement will be recorded as income over the next several years. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters being discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan, as well as a write-off of contingent consideration recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Stock comp expense was $10.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $13.1 million in the prior quarter of 2016. Switching to the bottom line. Q4 GAAP net income was $16.6 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.34 per share in the previous quarter of 2016 and $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $27.5 million or $0.65 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.66 per share in the previous quarter of 2016 and $0.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $273.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, above the $264.4 million at the end of the prior quarter of 2016. For the full-year 2016, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $107.8 million and for Q4 2016 operating cash flow was $31.0 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises contributed about $1.3 million for all of 2016 and $153,000 in Q4. These cash flows were partially offset by $8.1 million to purchase capital equipment in Q4 of 2016. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter at $34.2 million or 30 days of sales outstanding, which was slightly higher than the $33.4 million or 28 days reported at the end of the prior quarter of 2016. This modest increase was due to a higher proportion of the quarter's sales being recorded in the third month of Q4 compared with the prior quarter. Fourth quarter 2016 days sales outstanding were 2 days lower than the 30 days posted in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 were $71.5 million, up from the $70.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory increased to 138 days at the end of Q4 from the 133 days at the end of the third quarter of 2016. I would like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017. We are forecasting Q1 revenue in the range of $98 million to $102 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.8% to 54.8%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.8% to 55.8%; total stock-based compensation expense of $12.1 million to $14.1 million, including approximately $400,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; litigation expenses of $150,000 to $250,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $28.3 million to $30.3 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; other income of $300,000 to $400,000 before foreign currency exchange, gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 42.8 million to 43.8 million shares before any share buyback. In conclusion, in the last several years, MPS has focused on investing in new products and targeted markets. Starting this year, we believe MPS will begin to benefit from those investments, which will translate to strong revenue growth in 2018 and beyond. I'll now open the microphone for questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the nice results and outlook. Wanted to start, Michael and Bernie, on the notebook business. We just had the formal launch of Kaby Lake at CES, and so wondering if you could sort of give us your outlook now that that processor formally launched. And a sort of related question, Intel I think is planning yet another fourth generation \u2013 I'm sorry, 14-nanometer processor to be introduced in the second half of the year. I think with Kaby Lake, you guys picked up market share. As we look forward to that eighth-generation core processor Intel was talking about introducing towards the end of the year, do you think you might be poised for additional share gains on those client platforms? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. Quinn, thank you very much for the question. So, as we look at 2017 and 2018, certainly going into the Kaby Lake, we've benefited significantly by having the reference design, and we've been able to see a lot of very good traction for our power solutions, because, as we mentioned in the script, of the overall efficiency and the small form factor. So, as we look at the current year, we continue to see sort of a similar growth rate as we've experienced in the previous generation of Intel products. Now, as we look out to the product, which I believe you're referring to of Intel's next generation Cannonlake, which I believe may come out at the end of this year or in the early part of 2018, we go from not only being a reference design, but also we have been designed into their core product, which is a significant enhancement over our previous position. So we remain very optimistic in that relationship for the high-end notebooks. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Quinn, this is Michael Hsing. Let me add on. I'm very aware, like any other investors, that notebook is associated with lower margins. And however, we develop those based on the QS Mod, that technology. We develop those product and these are very unique ones. And we're only focused on size constraint, and that requires a very \u2013 notebook has a longer run time, which is very highly efficient. And also, it's a time to market because our product is very easy to use. So we only focus on those high-end market. As I see the notebook market segment, it's only one of the product line and we're not really concentrated on it. We really focus on a balanced growth in the overall MPS. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Thanks for the additional color. I sort of wanted to move on to the new process technology that you just announced on the call, the high-voltage SOI process. And, Bernie, I think in the script you mentioned some medical products. I guess I would have thought that there could be applications for low-power SOI in other perhaps industrial or perhaps even comm, other related markets. So wondering is there a particular application or use case within medical? Or do you see that really is just the first market and you've got opportunities well beyond the medical market for that SOI process? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: You mentioned exactly right. There are other market segments that MPS couldn't \u2013 within the industrials, even autos and medicals, and for some of the product segments, we couldn't adjust it. And we think long and hard that's the high-voltage SOI is the best, it's the best way. So we took us a couple of years to develop that technology, and the first few products will be in the medical market segment. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: And, Michael, is that with one of the existing four foundries? Or will that be a process that require the new foundry engagement? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: We \u2013 both actually. This product is in the new foundry, yeah. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: New foundry. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Smigie with Raymond James. Your line is open. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. So, right now infotainment is your biggest part of revenue within auto. Is that more so due to Monolithic deciding that this is the area that you're best positioned to take share in? Or is it more of a matter of infotainment having the highest content opportunity? If it's the latter, what would you say are your next largest content opportunities within auto? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: There are a number of opportunities that were designed into in automotive. I think that our initial footprint, when we started out in the area four years ago, was definitely in the infotainment. And now we've moved into many of the lighting systems, a lot of the systems that are either in the body or designed into sensors. We're into some of the light ADOS areas. So I don't think that we're necessarily restricted in any way, and that I think we have a broad set of offerings for automotive. And, as we referenced, we've had design wins and a lot of momentum that we expect to continue out into 2018 and 2019. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And last quarter you mentioned that server was 10% to 15% of computing in 2015. Is there a way you can give us an update on what 2016 was, and what your expectations are for growth in 2017? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: So I think that, with server, we feel very positive and optimistic. And that optimism is due to a lot of the reference designs that we have, in addition to the fact that, in the next generation Purley, we are going to be not just increasing the number of OEMs that we'll be working with, but also we'll be increasing the dollar content of going from something in the mid-teens up to the high $40 on a per-server basis. So we see, as the rollout occurs here in the second half of the year, that we should get some good momentum. And that we really should see some sales gains occurring in the early part of 2018. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. I'll add my congratulations, guys. Maybe a quick follow-up on server since we were just talking about it. Could you maybe walk us through or talk about the competitive landscape and what kind of visibility you guys have regarding market share on Purley, specifically later this year and as we look into 2018? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Well, I think to begin with, on the servers, this is an area where we had essentially zero market share as recent as a couple of years ago. So this is almost a continuing greenfield opportunity for us. Obviously, there's a couple of very dominant players in this market who are very well established as far as their relationships, as well as the technology. The feedback that we've been receiving, particularly in the area of cloud computing that we're most interested in being able to take advantage of, has been very positive. We think that we have a unique offering that sufficiently differentiates ourself in order to be able to get the design win and also to command very attractive ASPs and margins. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, no hints on are there any visibility on what kind of market share you might kind of have there coming? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think in a earlier call that we allowed for the potential of being between 10% and 20%. And again, I think that's a long-term opportunity and what we want to do is, remember, there's well-established competitors here and that we're starting from a very small space. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Let me add something. Okay. And we can divide it into what the market share means, okay? And you see our servers are pretty steady growth and we will see the acceleration end of this year and next year. So which are these areas, okay? And a few years ago, our point of below (25:25) product penetrated into server. Now it's widely adopted and across the board. And two years ago, we introduced the electronic fuse and now became almost the sole source for some of the first-tier server makers. And from a core power, we penetrated, in the last couple years, we penetrated these second-tier server makers and now we're growing the revenues. And also, last year we penetrated a few first-tiers. However, we emphasize not on the bulk of the volumes and for a common footprint. We're not participate in that because those are lower margin product. We only concentrate on the highly efficient, high frequency. So those servers require that. And we believe in the longer term, that's the market trend. And we will get a majority (26:41) we will get a high percentage of our market shares in 2018 and in 2019. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. That's really helpful, Michael. And then maybe as a follow-up, any update \u2013 I didn't hear you guys mention it in your prepared remarks, any update on the timing of your new website launch and where we are now with your new e-commerce initiative? And maybe as part of that answer, is there any way to help us quantify what that dollar opportunity or what that potential could be there, and what that ramp might look like? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: The programmable modules we're launching already. And you will see our \u2013 we're still selling through the traditional channels. However, the new website was delayed a little bit. But it will be either in March or in April, we will see the new website. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And if I could add to this, there's sort of a continuum here where what we're beginning to see is good traction with regard to our pre-design modules where they're generating a good amount of money, a good amount of revenue on a quarterly basis. And then what we expect to do is introduce the new website, and that will be how we'll launch the field programmable modules as well. So I think that everything is tracking exactly as we had hoped it would. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. And if I could just sneak one last one in. Just any update that you guys could give us on the Intersil lawsuit would be great. Thanks a lot. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: We can't comment too much, okay, because that's in the courtroom in the legal proceedings. And that's the only thing we said, okay, MPS will defend vigorously our IP. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on Ross's behalf. I'll echo the congrats on the solid results. My question's been alluded to by some previous callers but I just want to ask it a little more directly. There was some talk in the script about the visibility into longer-term design engagements, one of which being server. I'm curious if you could give us the rough timing of the magnitude of those random \u2013 the high-end notebook solutions were mentioned, the gaming with QS Mod, and more generally the auto design win momentum. Is there any way to roughly time when that acceleration should happen? Or is it just the general framework that we should be thinking about, or thinking about that framework in general? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: We think in the second half of this year, in the server side the revenue will ramp, all the designing activity. Even though the core power, we still will gain a significant amount of market shares, okay? And those may not be in mainstreams, but we have in other \u2013 I'm talking about other first tiers. But it's a giant step for MPS. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And the timing of gaming and auto, should we think of that then the same way as in the second half? Or would the timing differ? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Well, I think as far as automotive, that's a continuation of the momentum that we've been generating in each of the last three prior years. Whereas gaming, I think that we have some new opportunities that will be additive and we should look for those to start to kick-in in Q3 of this year. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And on the OpEx front, I know last year was an investment year. Could you give us your initial outlook for spending plans later in 2017? Obviously, we have the 1Q guide, but any initial color on OpEx for the rest of the year would be helpful. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. So I think you're familiar with what our long-term model is, and we want to grow operating expenses at a rate that is 50% to 60% that of our revenue growth rate. Certainly, in 2016, we've mentioned that we had some excellent opportunities as far as generating new product investments as well as sales and marketing resources, as well as the investment in our fourth fab. And we expect to continue to invest in all three of those initiatives, albeit at a lower rate of growth in 2017. And we do not plan to add head count at the same level as we did in 2016. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anil Doradla from William Blair. Your line is open. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Close enough. It's Doradla. So... Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I was going to help out. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Michael and Bernie, congrats on my end, too. So, 2017, clearly a very inflection year in some ways, right? You've got, like, these three, four product segments. You talked about the server's second half. You've got the programmable stuff, you've got autos kicking in. So, when we step back, I think you've given some color, but if you were to sum it up really 2017 in general, it sounds like a pickup in the second half, primarily driven by the server. And how should I be looking at some of the programmable stuff? So, if you can help us understand kind of the objects of first half/second half big picture, that would be great. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. I think just the way you positioned that comment is actually very helpful to understanding the dynamics here. We actually have three, four, five unique opportunities that are coming on-stream in 2017. And when we look at the timing and the order of magnitude for them, I think it's good to be a little bit cautious only because there are certain events that aren't 100% in our control and those that are we have some level of execution risk. So, as we look ahead to 2018, we believe that those elements will all have sorted itself out and that we'll be able to fully capitalize on the \u2013 take advantage of these opportunities. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Let me add on. To me, the 2017 is done. All the designing products, okay, I don't think our customer can change it. And it will take an extraordinary effort to change that. And so when the revenue happens, okay, particularly in the cloud computing, but some of the notebooks, some of the servers and some of the data centers, and these are depending our customers. And also, the third-party really the product is like Intel's processors. And so to me, these all done within plus or minus of a few months. So, related to other market segments like auto, this is very steady-state growth. We seen a lot more designing activities in the last couple of years. That all will translate into revenues second half of 2017 and 2018. And at the same time, don't forget we still have a high-end consumer business. IC and IoT will grow this year tremendously. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. So sounds like from the investment community point of view, I think we should be focused on the server opportunity in 2017. That seems to be the most perhaps material delta as the year progresses. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Frankly, I see very similar growth rate. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And the company designed it that way, very balanced growth, and with growth in the high rate. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I'd have to agree with Michael there that I think that you'd be limiting the message to focus solely on servers. I mean we're, again, very excited about that opportunity, but not at the expense of what we're seeing with the high-end notebooks, what we're seeing with the gaming opportunity. And Michael brought to light what we're seeing with appliances through the Internet of Things and high-end consumer. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And finally, Bernie, your guidance of 54.8% to 55.8% on the gross margin front similar to what you guided, I think, in the December quarter. But given that the mix and the mix shift seems to be moving towards some of these higher margin businesses, is that guidance based on just conservativeness? I mean, I'm thinking that the gross margin should trend upwards as the year goes by. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I think that if you look at how we progressed gross margin in 2016, we went up 10 to 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter. So we ended up with gross margin in Q4 that was 40 basis points higher than the year before. And I would expect a similar trend line to occur. You are right that a lot of the new revenue growth is at higher margins. And we're also seeing some of the investments we made, particularly with the new fab, that those should also generate improvements to gross margin. But the thing that we want to manage first and foremost is very predictable, modest, as I said, 10 to 20 basis points increases in gross margin, and to the extent that we can afford to add in lower margin business to accelerate revenue growth, that's really what our business model is based around. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Michael, Bernie, congratulations on another solid growth year. First question is on the high-voltage SOI process. Should we think about the competitive advantage share being similar to some of your other processes, meaning being able to integrate many components? Or are there other elements to the advantage as well? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Exactly. And including other components down the road. And we think that this is really a game change, okay? We take a look at the other opportunities and the technology that we targeted. And so we will be able to deliver signal much more cleaner. And also, we integrate a lot more than a silicon technology is capable. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And my second question is on your module business. So could you just update us where you stand there? And are you in production already on the programmable module products? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: It is in production now. And sales volumes are very little and just at the initial stage. And these are mostly for industrial applications and also smaller customers, variety of them, and including some of the small customers in the consumer space. And so we really emphasize the website which we'll launch in March or April. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And I think that there's also a longer-term opportunity in the communications market for the field programmability. So it's sort of an interesting product family where we're trying to encourage more of these low-end, small volume industrial and consumer opportunities, but at the same time we see a longer-term opportunity in the wireless infrastructure for the comms market. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Forgot about the programmable product for telecom, for the infrastructures. And that we launched a product, and again you can see on the YouTube, you can see on our website, you can parallel all of them from 20 amps to all the way to 1,000 amps. And in the APAC show (40:49) in March, we will demonstrate something like 1,000 amps or 2,000 amps solutions. And those are one of a kind and well, well received among telecom companies. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And maybe on the topic of communications, it was flat year-over-year. And sort of in the spirit of balanced growth, how should we think about the communications market for you this year? Do you expect some growth? Or will it still maybe lag a little bit some of the other end markets? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think, at this point, and again let's talk about the nature of the market, you've got the gateway wireless, which tends to be a little bit low end and has some characteristics that are similar to consumer. And then you have the higher-end network, which, as we were just talking, we believe has great promise for us. We're very committed to that part of the market. As we are just introducing the products now, and while the feedback has been very positive from the telco companies, it's like any product release, it takes time. And this tends to be a lumpy marketplace where you can \u2013 if you win a large customer, you can have a significant order. But the time it takes to win the trust and win the relationship and demonstrate the value of your technology, it makes it a little hard to predict. So I think the way we've tended to look at the comms market is it can be any quarter plus or minus $1 million, and there will be a point of inflection but it's probably later in 2018. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes. Very much agree. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Fair enough. Just one last question. We're hearing about some foundry capacity getting tight. You're obviously expecting another good growth year this year. Do you feel like you have, with all your foundry partners, you have all the capacity in place for another good growth year this year? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes. We've made the investment in order to be able to manage the growth for 2018-2019 and even beyond that. And it's not just on pure capacity, but as we're referencing as far as a partner to help us with the new technology, we feel very, very well-positioned. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. Congrats again. Thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have a follow-up from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Just wanted to sort of follow up on some of these new product drivers. You've got high-end notebooks ramping nicely through the year. You've got the new game console. You've got Purley power management. A lot of those seem like they're pretty back-end loaded into the second half of the year. You typically have pretty strong seasonality with the third quarter typically the peak. I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is do you think that these new opportunities and the timing of those ramps could change seasonal patterns this year and into 2018? Or is it best to sort of think that those products ramp, but probably don't ramp to such a degree that it's going to change your typical seasonal pattern? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. That's a very good question, so that we are also puzzled (44:37). MPS like a trend has a start about four, five years ago, have a transition also like into more diverse market segments. And last year, I hope that we had every quarter's consecutive growth, okay, but we think with a lack of Q4. But Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 is shy just a little. And so, obviously, the pattern is changing and what we'll see probably this year is a very similar or even I can hope \u2013 I still hope we can have a consecutive quarter-to-quarter growth for four or five quarters in a row. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Bernie Blegen for any closing remarks. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Great. I would like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our first quarter conference call, which will be most likely at the end of April. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

You joined the Monolithic Power Systems\u2019 Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host Chief Financial Officer of Monolithic Power Systems, Mr. Bernie Blegen. Sir, you may begin. Bernie Blegen : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome to the first quarter 2017 Monolithic Power Systems\u2019 conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today\u2019s call. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2017, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2016, Q4 2016 and Q1 2017 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS had a record first quarter with revenue of $100.4 million, 3.1% lower than revenue generated in the fourth quarter of 2016, 18.8% higher than the comparable quarter in 2016. MPS continues to benefit from technological leadership and our diversified multi-market strategy. Looking at our revenue by market, first quarter 2017 industrial revenue of $27.7 million grew 50.2% over the same period of 2016, fueled by product sales for applications in automotive, power sources, and smart meters. Industrial revenue as a percentage of total Q1 2017 revenue grew to 27.6%. In our computing and storage market, revenue of $20.6 million increased, $5.2 million or 33.9% year-over-year reflecting strong sales growth for SSD storage, cloud computing and high-end notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 20.5% of MPS\u2019 first quarter 2017 revenue. Revenue from consumer markets increased 5.3% over the first quarter of 2016 to $35.6 million and represented 35.5% of our Q1 revenue. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected solid improvements in high value consumer markets including home appliances and lighting tempered by lower sales for set-top boxes. First quarter 2017 communication revenue of $16.4 million decreased 2.5% from the first quarter of 2016 and represented 16.4% of our total first quarter revenue. GAAP gross margin was 54.6%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter of 2016 and 70 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2016. Our GAAP operating income was $13.6 million, compared to $17.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $10.4 million reported in the first quarter of 2016. For the first quarter of 2017, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter of 2016 and 50 basis points higher than the first quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $26.5 million, compared to $29.0 million reported in the prior quarter and $20.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2016. Turning to automotive, macro economic trends in the industry appear soft. However, our market penetration is in the very early stages. And we believe our future growth will be largely driven by gaining market share. Accordingly we expect revenue for the next several years continue to grow at a rate significantly above market as MPS\u2019 footprint and automotive is relatively small by the market size and opportunities are tremendous. Growth trends in automotive electronic applications align well with MPS technology as consumers demand higher connectivity and access to more intelligent content. More importantly, the proliferation of sensors and multi-core processors for autonomous driving capabilities provide MPS with increased available dollar content for each vehicle. These trends will have a strong positive influence on our business prospects over the long-term. In addition to continued momentum from automotive, we expect to layer on new revenue streams in 2017 and in the years ahead. Beginning in Q2 2017 product ramps for MPS\u2019 superior digital power solutions will drive growth in applications for cloud computing, gaming council and high-end notebooks. We expect our digital power solutions will be further adapted in 2017 and 2018 for use in field programmable applications, networking and automotive. Let\u2019s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $41.3 million in the first quarter, compared with $39.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $35.1 million in the first quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2017 operating expenses were $29.2 million, up from the $28.4 million we spent in the fourth quarter and up from the $26.4 million reported in the first quarter of 2016. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, first quarter litigation expenses were $286,000, compared with a $322,000 net credit in Q4 2016, a portion of a Q4 2016 IP settlement was recorded as income in that quarters litigation expenses and a similar adjustment was not repeated in the first quarter of this year. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Total stock compensation including approximately $400,000 that was charged cost of goods sold, for the first quarter of 2017 was a $11.7 million compared with $10.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Switching to the bottom line. First quarter 2017 GAAP net income was $14.5 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.25 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Q1 non-GAAP net income was $25.2 million or $0.58 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.65 per share in the previous quarter of 2016 and $0.45 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2017 were $43.3 million, which included a one-time increase of approximately 500,000 shares upon adoption of the new accounting standards for stock compensation. Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $284 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017, compared to $273.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $21.9 million, compared with Q4 2016 operating cash flow of $31.0 million. First quarter 2017 capital spending totaled $3.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2017 at $38.1 million or 35 days of sales outstanding, which was slightly higher than the $34.2 million or 30 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2016. This modest increase was due to a higher proportion of the quarter sales being recorded in the third month of Q1 compared with the prior quarter. Day sales outstanding for the first quarter of 2017 were four days higher than the 31 days posted in the first quarter of 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2017 were $78.5 million, up from the $71.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. Days in inventory increased to 157 days at the end of Q1 2017 from 138 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and 145 days at the end of the first quarter of 2016. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2017. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $109 million to $113 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.1% to 55.1%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.0% to 56.0%; total stock-based compensation expense of $12.5 million to $14.5 million, including approximately $400,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; litigation expenses ranging between $200,000 to $300,000; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $42.0 million and $46.0 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $29.9 million to $31.9 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; other income is expected to be in the range from $400,000 to $500,000 before foreign exchange, gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 42.9 million to 43.9 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion, we continue to grow and continue to enhance shareholder value. I will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton of Needham. Your line is open. Quinn Bolton : Hey guys, congratulations on the nice result. So I just wanted to start up with some of the revenue drivers for 2017-2018, it just sounds like the transition share gains on game console related devices and then server power management are kind of the three near-term next 12 months drivers. And just in terms of the timing kind of it feels like probably notebooks first, game consoles maybe starts to ramp late here in Q2 and then servers closer to year-end and just wanted to see if that\u2019s kind of the right timing from your perspective in terms of the ramp of those three opportunities. Bernie Blegen : Hi, Quinn. Thank you very much. I think that the way that you\u2019ve sequenced those opportunities is correct and let me just add a little bit of color. So the notebook opportunities, we expect to be sort of steady and consistent growth. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a big bang that\u2019s going to occur in one quarter and then grow from there. When we look at gaming, obviously, that\u2019s driven around the holiday season, so we would expect that with the adoption of the gaming console business that that should be weighted more heavily into Q3 although it may have a tail into Q4 as well. And then certainly with the servers as we\u2019ve discussed in the past much of that while we\u2019ve continued to see good revenue growth, much of the next layer of growth we believe is expected with the Grantley the Purley transition, which is expected to the second half. And there again, we see good games to come for as we are designed into new platforms and also we branched out into dual OEMs and that would include both our POL and our E-Fuse products. And then we believe over time that we\u2019ll see adoption rates for our VCORE power management solution that we called QS Mod as that goes from that tier-2 to tier-1 and in particularly the cloud providers. Quinn Bolton : And on these cloud providers, they tend to be sort of earlier adaptors in the sort of server upgrade cycle. Did that that kind of ramp do you think maybe enters the tailwind of 2017? I know Intel often provides early access to some of those Hyper-Scale guys or do you think that\u2019s still kind of more closer to year end and in to early 2018 for that Hyper-Scale Cloud opportunity. Bernie Blegen : I think that when we look at the MPS is overall energy efficiency solutions, they really do bases for growth in the cloud based data centers. And yes, they do have earlier adoption rates. Michael Hsing : Quinn, this is Michael. All these are the Company\u2019s strategies, we don\u2019t really care which market segment, how we time it and how we time it and that relates to growing our MPS revenues. So these \u2013 we actually in opposite, we don\u2019t want to \u2013 we want to disassociated with or we are tied to Xbox, or we are tied to whatever the game \u2013 whatever the game console, in game platforms and in the game \u2013 in the Intel\u2019s of when we were to release \u2013 release productions for whatever the process so yes. These are just our opportunity and that we only want to getting show our gross margin in the steady growth. And our customers facing \u2013 whatever the \u2013 whichever the product is, I can \u2013 we don\u2019t contact and it\u2019s all within a plus minus six, seven months, as I said earlier. Quinn Bolton : Okay, great. And then just\u2026 Bernie Blegen : I\u2019m sorry just a finishing thought on Michael there, one of the interesting characteristics as Michael has just laid it out as well is that it provides for a steady growth ramp both for the second half of 2017, as well as throughout 2018. Quinn Bolton : Great. And then just the follow up question about JV, you\u2019ve talked about sort of some general macro economic weakness in the automotive sector, but share gains would allow you sort of over the next several years to grow faster than the market. And I\u2019m just kind of wondering, do you think that there\u2019s any point in time where macroeconomic conditions can change the near-term outlook, I mean, does macro change so quickly that it can fetch your quarter-to-quarter revenue ramp on automotive or do you think the share gains are really the driving factor there and even with soft macro environment sort of steady share gains that you have for more consistent growth. Just trying to get your sense on whether or not, we should be thinking automotive could be lumpy. Michael Hsing : For the automotive Quinn in MPS as you know, we entered a market about four or five years ago, and four or five years ago our revenue almost is zero. And even two, three years ago very teeny-tiny. And it takes a long time to get the revenue. And so design cycle is about three to four years. And we our total ten in Automotive is about $6 billion, probably now is more than that. And so what is our percentage is less than a percent. So it\u2019s a total greenfield for us to grow. As I see it in the next few years all the design win activities happen in the last couple of years. So it\u2019s all designing. Unless they cancelled a car, they canceled their entire cars and are now going to move to a production market and of course the very effective MPS revenue. But it\u2019s highly unlikely they\u2019ll not introduce a car any more. So, we yes that\u2019s why we said lucky. Is we \u2013 and also at the same time we\u2019re gaining share. We\u2019re gaining share we\u2019re entering other applications and we\u2019re winning other sockets. So the overall for us it\u2019s very optimistic. Quinn Bolton : Great, that\u2019s great. Now Samsung Galaxy Note7 automobiles coming into marketing anytime soon. And thanks and congratulations. Michael Hsing : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rick Schafer : Thanks and I\u2019ll add my congratulations on another nice quarter. Maybe just a quick follow-up on [indiscernible] I\u2019m just curious which your guys thoughts are and how you see that mix migration and what it looks like over the next 12 months to 18 months. I mean, are we going to \u2013 is it a relatively rapid crossover possibly like the first half of 2018 or is it going to take a little while longer for that mix to shift? Michael Hsing : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be are very sharp cross over. So that will be a gradual, a gradual change. So our revenue as I said in the last few quarters so the second half this year we start to gradually see revenue coming. Bernie Blegen : And I think I would add to that a lot of the initial revenue will come from similar dollar content hence we have in the in the Grantley cycle. And that is based on the POL and the eFUSE opportunities. And then we\u2019ll continue to gradually layer in our next generation as far as power management the QS Mod, over the next, the course of the next two years. So I think that Michael is summed it up nicely that we see it steady ramping in that for us. Rick Schafer : Okay. Thanks. Bernie Blegen : Again, the opportunity for us in a car computing is well over $1 billion. And we have a very few, I don\u2019t know what is the percentage \u2013 it\u2019s less than the couple of percent. Rick Schafer : And maybe just a follow-on to that then I mean how do you guys feel like you\u2019re positioned with ARM servers for co-power or Point of Load or eFUSE do you expect any revenue are you working on any projects along those lines in the next, same kind timeframe next 12, 18 months? Michael Hsing : Of course, we want to cover everything like if we entered the market okay, without taking our technologies and we can be easily adapted into different platforms. And so we are working on it all these other solutions of them and a lot of them where we have it now. Rick Schafer : Okay. And then maybe just on switching gears to e-commerce and the initiative there maybe could, first I guess is the website live and is it up and running, I know you talked about sort of March, April timeframe for launch maybe if you could remind us or kind of frame out how big that opportunity is in terms of potential new customers and when we might start to see revenues from that effort? Bernie Blegen : Yes, I will open up by saying that e-commerce solution and the opportunity that is afforded through ask field programmability and we\u2019ve been viewing that really the second half of 2018 and 2019 as far as when the revenue ramp begins. So to answer your question specifically, this quarter we did have a rollout of basically an upgrade over our all website. And then we\u2019re expecting in about another 3 to 4 months time that will go up at the first generation of the next-gen website which will have an e-commerce component. Rick Schafer : Got it. Okay thanks, guys. Michael Hsing : Just an update, okay its very I call it baby steps I mean it\u2019s just we show \u2013 we have other components in all the interactive and the e-commerce question haven\u2019t really kicking yet and I hope in the next few months the new website will be live. Rick Schafer : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hey, guys, this is actually Matt on Ross\u2019 behalf. Congrats on the results once again, but I\u2019m curious about two in-markets in particular, comms and storage and computing. It looks like they \u2013 you\u2019re just a tad bit softer than at least we expected. Was there anything beyond your prepared remarks that could explain the directionality of those two? And it sounds like that you\u2019re pretty optimistic about both of them in the second half, but anything you could talk about one in the near-term and anything over and beyond what was already answered from the previous caller concerning the long-term? Bernie Blegen : Yes. So let me address just focusing quarter \u2013 year-over-year on the quarter\u2019s performance. So the computing \u2013 storage and computing revenue for that market went up 34% year-over-year and a lot of it was driven by storage SSD in particular. And if I could offer sort of a thought is that storage for us has been somewhat constrained because lack of availability of NAND. And we had a very good bump and we expect that to continue for the next several quarters as there have been certain of the larger suppliers that have been able to extend greater availability, and so that\u2019s removed a bottleneck for us. And then as far as the server and the notebook; notebook, we are benefiting as we transition from Skylake to Kaby Lake, and that is going to increase the number of OEMs that we serve, it actually increases it by building five or six. And we expect that to ramp incrementally right now, but have continued growth through the remainder of this year and well into next year. And likewise, I think we\u2019ve already addressed the server which is going to be driven by the Grantley Proleague conversion. On the comms market, I think we sort of had a very consistent theme that we are very enthusiastic of the opportunity there, we believe that the field programmable solutions for power management that we have are ideally suited, particularly for high voltage opportunities in the wireless infrastructure, but that is a long-term proposition. And so, quarter-to-quarter we expect the comms market to sort of increase or decrease by a margin of about $1 million until we really start to get some attraction in next generation products and new customers. Michael Hsing : Yes, as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re going to introduce some acquainted product and that killer product is out, will be introduced. And I expected to have a next couple years that we\u2019re going to grow that business significantly. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, great. And on the OpEx front, could you give any rough color on this second half outlook. It sounds like again we talked about the growth drivers on OCM, but just a rough idea of what OpEx should do in the second half of the year. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think that we said in the last call that, we expect to be within our financial model growing operating expenses in this year at a rate that is represents 50% to 60% the rate of revenue growth. In Q1, we actually came in middle, low end of that point. And I sort of say that we\u2019re targeting plus or minus 2 percentage points of the midpoint of that for the full year. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your question please. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you and congratulations on another consistent quarter. My first question is for you Michael on all the consolidation we\u2019ve seen so far especially our power and management companies. I\u2019m just wondering if it seems that changed in the marketplace whether it\u2019s pricing or capacity because it seems like your competitors are getting global got the recorder how so, any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Hsing : I think of the \u2013 we gained a lot of large, but these are first here customers in the recent years. I think of that attribute to, I was there to first our technologies and that came \u2013 and secondly I came out I think that yes I do agree there is some effect. And our customers need a multiple sources and the source of that kind of dried out. And the some it kind of forced them to looking into another supplied. And a combination we\u2019re both I think we gain a lot of recognition in the last couple of years. And particular, these are very well established at first year customers in auto and a industrial side. Tore Svanberg : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And on the high end note books other than the process or change, is it anything about the power management architecture there that\u2019s along you to gain some incremental share. Michael Hsing : I think of for the high end note books I get where we are \u2013 consider now we can provide a total solutions and for the power management. And so obviously \u2013 and other peripheral we can gain some more shares. But we don\u2019t want to associate that to MPS is a notebook company. And we only address that those are small vary thing, vary portable and long battery running times. Tore Svanberg : Yes. And then on the industrial side, which obviously have the strongest growth the last 12 months, any further thoughts on the distribution strategy. There seems to be some mixed strategies out there, some companies are relying less on distributors, some are kind of stepping them up. What do you stand as far as leveraging the distribution channel in the industrial market? Michael Hsing : Yes. We\u2019re in the past [indiscernible] sales guys are really have a hard work as opining the pavements to get our customers attentions. And all these distributors just frankly just ignore us. And then now they\u2019re run out of source they come to us too. And so I think as where we\u2019re going to futures in the next couple years there will huge benefit to MPS. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Very good just one last question for Bernie, Bernie the inventory days were not, but little bit sequentially I understand it tends to do that in the March quarter but anything else going on there basically just getting ready for a strong period in Q2, Q3. Bernie Blegen : Sorry. That\u2019s exactly I think that as you look at the market that the fab capacity is being mentioned as a concern for some people. And I believe we\u2019ve positioned ourselves very well to manage the growth that we expect to get in the second half of this year. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Again congratulations for the consistency. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you, Tore. Operator : Thank you. At this time I like to turn the call back over to Mr. Blegen for any closing remarks, sir. Bernie Blegen : Sure, thank you. I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which will likely be at the end of July. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your program. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS had a record quarter with revenue of $112.2 million, 11.8% higher than revenue generated in the first quarter of 2017 and 19.3% higher than the comparable quarter in 2016. MPS continues to benefit from technology leadership in our diversified multi-market strategy. Looking in our revenue by market, in our computing and storage market, revenue of $24.5 million increased $6.2 million, or 33.7% year-over-year, reflecting strong sales growth for SSD storage, cloud computing and high-end notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 21.8% of MPS's second quarter 2017 revenue. Second quarter automotive revenue reported separately from industrial for the first time of $12.9 million grew 55.7% over the same period of 2016, fueled by product sales for applications in infotainment and lighting. Automotive revenue was 11.5% of MPS's total Q2 2017 revenue. Revenue from consumer markets increased 14.6% over the second quarter of 2016 to $43.9 million and represented 39.1% of our Q2 revenue. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected solid improvements in high-value consumer markets, including gaming and home appliances. Second quarter 2017 communications revenue of $15.9 million increased 9.0% from the second quarter of 2016, and represented 14.2% of our total second quarter revenue. GAAP gross margin was 54.7%, 10 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2017 and 60 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2016. Our GAAP operating income was $15.0 million compared with $13.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2017, and $11.5 million reported in the second quarter of 2016. For the second quarter of 2017, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.6%, 10 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2017 and 50 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $31.2 million compared to $26.5 million reported in the prior quarter and $24.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2016. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $46.5 million in the second quarter compared with $41.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, and $39.4 million in the second quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2017 operating expenses were $31.2 million, up from the $29.2 million we spent in the first quarter of 2017, and up from the $27.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2016. On both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis, second quarter litigation expenses were $290,000 compared with $286,000 expense in Q1 of 2017. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Total stock compensation, including approximately $450,000 charged to cost of goods sold for the second quarter of 2017, was $15.1 million compared with $11.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Switching to the bottom line, second quarter 2017 GAAP net income was $15.0 million or $0.35 per fully diluted share compared with $0.33 per share in the first quarter of 2017 and $0.27 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $29.5 million or $0.68 per fully diluted share compared with $0.58 per share in the first quarter of 2017 and $0.54 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2017 were 43.4 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $283 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017 compared to $284 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $24.9 million compared with Q1 2017 operating cash flow of $21.9 million. Second quarter 2017 capital spending totaled $17.1 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2017 at $42 million, or 34 days of days sales outstanding compared with the $38.1 million or 35 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Both quarters experienced a modest increase over historic norm due to a higher proportion of the quarter sales being recorded in the third month of the quarter. Days sales outstanding for the second quarter of 2017 were four days higher than the 30 days posted in the second quarter of 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2017 were $92.7 million, up from the $78.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Days of inventory increased to 166 days at the end of Q2 2017 from 157 days at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 147 days at the end of the second quarter of 2016. I would like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2017. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $124 million to $128 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.4% to 55.4%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 56.2%; total stock-based compensation expense of $13 million to $15 million, including approximately $450,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; litigation expenses ranging between $250,000 to $350,000, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $43.8 million and $47.8 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $31.2 million to $33.2 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income is expected to be in the range from $650,000 to $750,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 43 million to 44 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion, we continue to execute against our long-term business strategy and believe the success of our new product development will further propel MPS's future growth. I will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the record quarter. My first question is on the outlook for the September quarter. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what are some of the main growth drivers for the quarter? I know you have a couple of specific product cycles coming up, but if you could just add some color there that's be great. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure, Tore. Thank you very much. So, as you know, Q3 tends to be a seasonal quarter for consumer and we're seeing good traction and are good anticipating good demand actually in several of our different product lines \u2013 market segments there. In addition, we believe that automotive is going to continue to do very well. And then also, we have a number of areas in computing that are going to be continuing strong into Q3. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And I noticed that your inventory days, I think you said around (12:26) 165 days now. So is it purely a reflection of the demand that is coming here in the second half of the year or is this more sort of a long-term project for you to keep the inventories \u2013 or the inventory days just as elevated? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I think that about a little over a year ago that we started slowly elevate our inventory levels as we introduced a lot of new products design for new markets. And then, as we're looking at entering the second half of the year, there have been concerns about fab capacity and so we wanted to get ahead of that so that we were able to meet demand. And so that's reflected in our inventory as they stand today. We expect them to exit the quarter probably about the same \u2013 similar level, but then come down probably in the subsequent quarters. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. One last question \u2013 yeah, Michael. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Another factor is that we \u2013 all these greenfield market segments, which are of a much higher levels and a higher quality than in the past, five years ago, those are more consumer oriented, not in the industrial, automotive and cloud computing. And those customers require us to carry high inventory. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And last question also for you, Michael. Could you give us an update on the website and if we're going to see a launch here pretty soon? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes. If you're looking at our website now, they've really changed. And MPS is transitioning from selling ICs, now we're selling solutions. Okay. Of course, it's based on IC. And we will sell a lot more higher content other than MPS product and that's included in our solutions. Now, you look \u2013 lock (14:40) on our MPS website, you will see it. However, MPS in the past, always a hardware company, now, we are doing a lot more software and a lot more Internet development. And it's a little bit slow than I thought, but our website will be launched in the second half of this year. In addition, what we have now, actually, is a bigger part of e-commerce business, is that the interacting with the users, and that the users start to order parts, and also configure parts from our website. You see it in the later second half of the year. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good and congratulations again. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Tore. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Let me echo the congratulations on the record quarter and the nice outlook. Just wanted to come back to automotive, obviously, you guys are seeing strength. I think one of your larger competitors, Maxim, was talking about perhaps a little bit of a slowdown in their market. So, wondering what's sort of giving you sort of a better outlook than perhaps some of your peers? Do you think it's just strength of your design wins going to production? Are there pockets of automotive where you're perhaps seeing strength where maybe competitors are not as well positioned? Just any thoughts you might have on that. And then, I've got a couple of follow-up questions. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Quinn, it's Michael. In automotive segment, we are so new and we haven't really scratched the surface. So our growth should be regardless what the automotive industrial condition is. So our revenues, our opportunity is \u2013 the ratio is very, very high in that case. So we have a lot of opportunity to grow. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then, just looking at the compute strength, Purley was just launched a couple of weeks ago, obviously, that's a big power management cycle for you. Wondering, now that we've had the official launch of Purley, how you're looking at the ramp in the server power management into the second half of 2017 and into 2018 as well? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think that now you see that we move the needles. We'll move the revenue noticeable. And in the next years, we'll probably grow at a similar rate or even higher. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And I think one of the interesting components here is that we're getting significant contribution from storage, primarily SSD, as well as the high-end notebooks, and we're only at the very early stages of the Purley conversion. So to echo Michael's point here, we see this being able to develop over the course of the next 12 months. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then just lastly sort of capital returns. You guys have done a very nice job growing EPS, reported $0.68 this quarter. Cash dividend has been sort of flat at about $0.20 a quarter since I think the first quarter of 2015. Any changes in how you're thinking about that dividend and whether there's a chance that we could see that moving higher over the next few quarters? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Quinn, we continue to look at our capital allocation model and it's something that we're mindful of, as far as what our investor feedback is, as well as what we think is best as far as the cash management for the company. So, at this point, again, it's under evaluation, but there's no firm direction. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. And then just, sorry, last quick clarification, Bernie. The CapEx seem to be much higher this quarter than in a typical quarter for MPS. Was there a big outlay for testers, or what was behind that jump in CapEx? I assume it's probably temporary. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Well, we have a lot of automotive qualification, and as well as industrial and cloud computing, and a lot of qualification equipment we had to buy. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: We've also, as you know, been buying office space over time and that contributed as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Congrats from my side to Michael and Bernie. First question, if you look at Q1 and Q2, it was close to 19% year-over-year growth. If I look at the high-end of your guidance, that suggest about a 20% year-over-year growth. Now, I know, Michael and Bernie, you guys have talked about aspiring to get to 20%. And without talking too much about Q4 and everything, but just qualitatively, could we even potentially exit this year at a 20%? I mean, is that realistic or maybe that's more kind of a \u2013 it spills over into next year? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: That's very possible. As I said about a year ago or so, this year, we'll see some of the greenfield market segment that we entered in the last two or three years, or three or four years ago, and this year, we start to see the revenues. So it's only got a few percentage change. It doesn't mean to me a lot. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I think that the substance that we're really looking at, and while certainly the 20% number is a number that we've had in our long-term guidance, but it's really the quality of the new product launches and how successful that they're being viewed that we're very interested in. And all of the initial signs, as far as both the demand and acceptance in the market, has been very, very positive. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I don't look at whether 19.5% or the 18%, 21%. These are \u2013 the 20% seems to me as a psychological barrier and that I don't get it. Okay. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right, right. Well, it is definitely impressive. And as a follow-up, I mean, Michael, you talked about the e-commerce platform. Obviously, there's some resources and energy are being allocated to that. So, Bernie, whenever you have the e-commerce development platform, is that part of the R&D spending or is that part of its SG&A? And if I look at the next 12 months, how should I be looking, qualitatively, the growth of SG&A versus R&D? Should SG&A revert to a higher growth rates than R&D, given some of these initiatives? Just a qualitative kind of feel. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. The e-commerce is part of our R&D spend. And I think that you're fairly comfortable with our management of operating expenses. And while we have significant opportunities ahead of us that we want to invest in, including the e-commerce platform, I think that we've always demonstrated a strong discipline, particularly on the G&A side. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great, and congrats once again, guys. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. I'll add my congratulations to you guys. I guess, my first question is, could you talk a little bit about your new gaming business and how it'll impact seasonality in your consumer segment in the second half? I mean should we expect sort of the typical fourth quarter slowdown, or is there still enough ramp left to kind of blow through that a little bit? Or could you just give us some color maybe on the consumer segment? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Again, we don't offer guidance more than one quarter ahead. So I'm not going to try and add too much color that we would give way any thinking there. But I will say that there's nothing currently \u2013 when I look at what the analysts and how you have us modeled out, there's nothing in that cycle that gives me pause. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then within computing and storage, if you had to, how would you rank the growth, maybe the second half or in 2018, if you're ranking growth sort of between server and notebook and the SSD business? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Well, I think that it's hard to actually rank them, because a lot of the parts have so much similarity that we kind of make a very educated guess as far as which end market they go into. But I think that server, which has just been introduced right now with Purley, probably would be the number one grower over the course of the next 12 to 15 months. And then, SSD really has only been limited by NAND availability because that transition away from HDD has been very clear and apparent in the marketplace, so we see that continuing to go. And then high-end notebooks, we have such an underpenetrated position that we see that all as upside. And probably that would be sort of my rough ordering of it. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Probably number one is the server. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Products we're selling to servers and computing and desktop, I mean, not that are workstations, and the servers and the high-end PCs, these are very much \u2013 a lot of them are convoluted. But I would correct Bernie that, on the SSDs, they are different product. So if we rank them, I think of servers on the highest and then probably SSDs (25:19) second. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah, got it. Thanks for that color, and then maybe just one follow-up on server. Can you talk about any new server customers that come on with Purley? And maybe would they be primarily point of load and E-Fuse-type customers or could they take QS MOD sort of out of the gates as well? Thanks. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Our servers, they're just the very beginning. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And the significant growth will be in 2018 and 2019 for MPS. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. [Operating Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just sticking on the computing side. Mike, earlier you said a comment about the business staying strong growth rate wise and maybe even accelerating going forward. Without pegging you down to anything too specific, were you referring to the growth rate kind of this year going into next year or was that a comment that was more specific about the year-over-year growth rate in the second quarter alone? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: No. I'm talking about year-over-year growth rate and \u2013 not growth rate, the absolute numbers, and will be a significant portion of MPS revenues. So I'm looking at what kind of product. This year is mainly ramping up from a point of load, E-Fuse and some portion of core power. In the next couple of years, the core powers will start to ramp. And now, we have all the first tier customers. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: We're in the very early stages, particularly, in the server workstation as far as being able to grow and develop that market. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And I guess following on with the new product side of things, you've talked about the OpEx being a little bit higher because you have so many new products coming on, so many new end markets you are gravitating towards. Do you expect in general for these markets to generate revenue in kind of a consistent steady \u2013 might improve a little bit or slow a little bit year-over-year, but more of a steady pattern? Or is there going to be a time where you're going to have numbers that are significantly above what we view as seasonal patterns because these new products really kick in? And it's not meant to be a single quarter comment, Bernie, because you don't want to comment on 4Q or any other thing beyond that. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: No, no, no. I think that one of the things that we're known for here is our level of predictability even managing a level of higher growth \u2013 significantly higher growth than the market is enjoying. And within that, we're not looking for seismic shifts that create a hockey stick, but what we want to do is a groundswell where we continue to grow. And we look at it over a two or three year horizon, not just how can we get to next quarter. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Ross, look at the market segment that we entered, and we really announced about five years ago. And those are very slow \u2013 a slow changing market, and customer will not design us in and the design us out in a couple of years. Not in five, six years, these are 10 years plus. And that takes \u2013 the cycles take that long. So nothing changes very quickly. So once we roll-out all these products, the doors are open to MPS now and we need to grab all these sockets. So we will see some acceleration in growth, but very steady state. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. I guess my follow-up or my final question is one on the gross margin. You guys have had a steady, predictable execution on that to use your words, Bernie. With these new markets kicking in and becoming a bigger percentage of your revenue over the course of the back half of this year and even more so in the next year, year and a half, does that change any of that kind of 10 basis points per quarter trend? Has it accelerated, decelerated, any change whatsoever? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: The advantage of some of these new markets that we're developing in, they have much longer lead times. And so what we're able to do is, as we're looking even two quarters out, we have a very strong sense of what the sales mix is going to be. And if there's an opportunity to introduce lower margin business as a means of accelerating revenue growth and also continuing to increase gross margin by 10 to 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter, that's what we're trying to do. So, if we have the good fortune of having very high margin business come through, what we'll probably do is level that out with lower margin business in order to get a higher overall growth rate. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Monolithic management for any closing comments. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter conference call, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Mr. Bernie Blegen. Sir, you may begin. Bernie Blegen : Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter 2017 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2017 and Form 10-Q filed on July 31, 2017, both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2016, Q2 2017 and Q3 2017 earnings releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. This was a record quarter for MPS with revenue of $128.9 million, up 14.9% from the previous record set in Q2 of this year and up 21.1% from the comparable quarter in 2016. In addition to the continued strong sales momentum in cloud computing and automotive, this quarter's results included the first full quarter of revenue from our power management solutions for gaming consoles. Looking at revenue by end market. Revenue from consumer markets increased 26.8% over the third quarter of 2016 to $55.3 million. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected sales gains in high-end consumer applications. Consumer revenue accounted for 42.9% of our total Q3 revenue compared with 41.0% in the prior year. Third quarter automotive revenue of $12.9 million grew 48.8% over the same period of 2016 as a result of increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive is MPS' largest SAM opportunity at $6 billion and we are in the early stages of penetrating this market. In the years ahead, we plan to offer a number of new products for applications in body controls, lighting, infotainment and ADAS. Automotive revenue was 10.0% of MPS' total Q3 2017 revenue compared with 8.1% for Q3 2016. In our computing and storage market, revenue of $29.0 million increased $5.6 million or 23.7% year-over-year, reflecting strong sales growth for cloud computing. MPS has experienced a significant increase in product sales reflecting both new design wins and increased dollar content. Computing and storage revenue represented 22.5% of MPS' third quarter 2017 revenue compared with 22.0% in Q3 2016. Third quarter 2017 industrial revenue of $16.3 million increased 12.6% from the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased sales for AC/DC power applications. This market represented 12.7% of our total third quarter revenue versus 13.6% for the prior year. GAAP gross margin was 55.0%, 30 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2017 and 60 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2016. Our GAAP operating income was $23.8 million compared to $15.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2017 and $15.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2016. For the third quarter of 2017, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2017 and 40 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP operating income was $38.9 million compared to $31.2 million reported in the prior quarter and $29.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2016. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $47.0 million in the third quarter compared with $46.5 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $42.9 million in the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2017 operating expenses were $32.9 million, up from the $31.2 million we spent in the second quarter of 2017 and up from the $29.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses primarily reflects investment in new product introductions and staff additions in support of targeted sales and marketing efforts. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, third quarter litigation expenses were $327,000 compared with a $290,000 expense in Q2 2017 and a $55,000 expense in Q3 of 2016. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Total stock compensation expense, including $453,000 charged to cost of goods sold for the third quarter of 2017 was $14.0 million compared with $15.1 million recorded in the second quarter of 2017. Switching to the bottomline. Third quarter 2017 GAAP net income was $23.6 million or $0.54 per fully diluted share compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2017 and $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2016. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $36.6 million or $0.84 per fully diluted share compared with $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2017 and $0.66 per share in the third quarter of 2016. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2017 were 43.5 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $305.0 million at the end of the third quarter of 2017 compared to $283.0 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $33.7 million compared to Q2 2017 operating cash flow of $24.9 million. Third quarter 2017 capital spending totaled $4.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2017 at $50.8 million or 36 days of sales outstanding compared with the $42.0 million or 34 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Days of sales outstandings in the third quarter of 2017 were eight days higher than the 28 days reported in the third quarter of 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2017 were $99.9 million, up from the $92.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Days of inventory decreased to 156 days at the end of Q3 2017 from the 166 days at the end of the second quarter of 2017, but were higher than the 133 days reported at the end of the third quarter of 2016. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $123 million to $129 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.4% to 55.4%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 56.2%, total stock-based compensation expense of $13 million to $15 million including approximately $500,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold, litigation expenses ranging between $250,000 to $350,000, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $44 million and $48 million, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $31.5 million to $33.5 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income is as expected in the range from $600,000 to $700,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 43.7 million to 44.7 million shares before any share buyback. In conclusion, thanks to acceptance of our new product offerings and with our shareholder support, we will continue to invest and deliver outstanding products to our customers and consistent results to our shareholders. I will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Your line is now open. Anil Doradla : Good evening Michael and Bernie and congrats once again. It looks like it's in auto mode and looks pretty exciting. Now a couple of questions. So obviously, you are talking about the data center and some of these design wins, Michael. But can you give us some update on kind of the pipeline of design wins and kind of the opportunity that you have here. Michael Hsing : We have many of them and some are small, some of them big. Of course, the bigger one now, we don't want to disclose that on the Internet or to anybody. And so overall, I can tell you is everything is doing well. We are doing expected or better than what we expected. Anil Doradla : And on the e-commerce platform, I know this is something that you guys have been looking at a little bit longer term. But any updates here? Michael Hsing : On the e-commerce? Well, it's a bigger project and obviously you haven't seen our new website launched yet. But we still expect that at the end of the year. The key is all the contents. And we are working very hard with the limited resources. But it's going to be some time next year. So may be you will see something new. Bernie Blegen : And again, Anil, here. Just to set expectations is, we are probably most excited as far as developing the new sales and marketing channel through this e-commerce platform, particularly as it relates to our field programmable power modules. But we have wanted to keep expectations at a relative level. So in the initial stages here, we are going to be taking customer feedback as far as their user experience and also how valuable they find the content and then we are going to integrate the website in order to be able to take into account that feedback. And we are really looking for sales to really start to ramp in probably about another two years out. But we do believe that we will be able to go live with this by the end of this year. Michael Hsing : Well, that's well said. I think the user experience is everything and we don't want to have some things crippled out, just to put it out there. And we go at this very cautiously. And I think to enter this market with the breadth of a product behind it, user experience is everything. But I think we are still pretty much on-time. And next year, you will see a first line of product we put out there and then we gradually loading, put out on the other products. The first line of product that we talk about before is a programmable DC-to-DC converter modules. Anil Doradla : Great. Congrats once again from my end. Bernie Blegen : Thank you Anil. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Jerry Li : Hi. This is Jerry Li on, on behalf of Ross Seymore. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Just a few from me and the first one, just want to go into a little more detail about your recently disclosed automotive group. So the year-on-year growth appears to be declining every quarter. And just want to get a sense of, what is the rate that do you think this business could grow over the next two or three years? Michael Hsing : I think, as Bernie said and we are addressing this, when the current product serve the market, is about $60 billion. So we are at the very, very beginning. So I can't quantify exactly what that number is. But the growth rate will be kind of similar to the current growth rate, maybe okay, over a couple of hundred million dollars or we slow it down a little bit. But I just give you, all these numbers I am just pulling out from my hairs. Bernie Blegen : Actually, he's got a good head of hair, too. Michael Hsing : I do have a lot of hair. Bernie Blegen : So just to add to that, I think that the exciting part for us is that we are able to work across so many different verticals within automotive and certainly across all the different geographies with the different OEMs. So we see this as an opportunity that has legs for growth for the next several years. Jerry Li : Got it. That makes sense. It's only 10% of your revenues anyway. So you would think that other guys are at 20%. So there's definitely room for growth. Michael Hsing : I think, yes, well said too. In our other market segments grows pretty consistent speed in the last five or six years. And automotive, it grows slightly faster, but it's start from a very small numbers. And once you get to $100 million to $200 million levels in that and again, I think the growth rate will be very, very similar to the rest of the quarter average. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Jerry Li : That makes sense. Thanks so much. Moving onto storage and computing. The segment, at least for the third quarter, it came in slightly below our model. Could you talk about how the Purley ramp is trending and the impact to your company and how long you expect that to last? Bernie Blegen : Yes. I think that the opportunities for us in the compute and storage are very exciting. And I don't think that you can look at an individual quarter and sort of use that as a milestone for the success of what we are seeing. I think that we were very clear that we have two opportunities that are driving this new growth, particularly in the cloud computing and that has to do with increasing the number of overall design wins. And then also we are adding significant dollar content into the second half of the year sales. So from our perspective, actually the rollout has been almost exactly to plan and the prospects as far as what we see in the next two years seem similarly positive. Michael Hsing : Well, it's not quite exactly that plain. I think it would delay it a year or two or so. But overall, cloud computing is very similar to automotive business, except we have only a few players in there. And other players are dominant in the market and we are not. We just entered. Our customer just accepted the last couple years, just barely accept our product. And this year, particularly, is really a good year for us. We have a new product introduced to this market segment and we are ahead of everybody else. And now it will give us the next couple years a very good growth. Jerry Li : Appreciate the responses. Thanks guys. Michael Hsing : Okay. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you and I think we are all excited about the growth, but I am actually going to congratulate you on your 30% operating margin. So, well done there. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Bernie Blegen : You are the first to notice that. That was why we did it. Tore Svanberg : Well done. So my first question, Michael, you said that your design win pipeline is better than expected. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? I mean, are you starting to see more customers coming to you? Or is it just because you have been able to introduce more new products? Michael Hsing : I think in every segment is slightly different. In automotive, we are more recognized and all the top-tier companies we are engaged now with, before we have meetings and now, we engage you on the product level. And they open up for MPS to quoting the new product development, which is for 2019, 2020, 2021 revenue. And in the cloud computing, I think we are ahead of a lot other people. And we introduce the products and meet all the order requirements or exceeded all these requirements and very simple to use. And that attracts the customers open to us in the first tiers and the customers first tiers of server makers now really open up. Tore Svanberg : That's very helpful. And could you update us a little bit on your new foundry partner? I know you probably don't want to mention who it is, but maybe just give us an update on how that's going? Are you up and running? Is it starting to contribute to revenues yet? Bernie Blegen : Yes. So I think that you are familiar that we began to invest with this partnership back in late 2015 and early 2016 and through the following 18 months was a period of investment for us. And actually the results have been quite good. We are pleasantly surprised and it comes at a time where certainly there are some concerns in the industry as far as capacity at the moment and we are not experiencing that at all. So I think that as far as the partner, that was very timely as far as when we added them, but also looking at the long term relationship and being able to develop new technologies together, we are very encouraged. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Just one last question and back to Michael. I know you don't want to talk too much about your process technologies, but you must be working on the next one. And I know, obviously you have been integrating more and more capabilities with that process. So is there anything that you care to share with us as far as what you are working on for the next-generation process? Michael Hsing : Yes. We are moving on to a 12-inch fab. So that obviously will not be ready for production next year. So we are looking for 2019, 2020, which also these 12-inch trading edge of most of the band circuit, not even talking about most of the bands, CMOS. So we will be keep upgrading our MPS capabilities. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Thank you very much and congratulations again. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hi guys. I will add my congrats on getting back to a 20% growth rate for the first time since, I think, early 2015. Good to see that two-handle. Wanted to ask first, just as I look at automotive business, it looks like you have kind of been hovering in a range of the low $12 million to the higher $12 million per quarter range. So it looks like it's seeing a little bit of a flattening out here on a sequential basis over the last couple of quarters. On a year-over-year basis, it's still growing pretty nicely. How should we think about the growth in that business? Does it kind of come in phases? Or should we think it can be a more steady quarter-to-quarter type grower? Michael Hsing : I will say the steady state. But you said it, okay, we are kind of flattening out and we didn't grow as much, okay. I haven't really looked into deeply. Maybe Bernie can answer the question. Bernie Blegen : Yes. I think that in the past, we have discussed the fact that while we are not immune to the macroeconomics because we are so small and new to the market, we have seen basically a step function in the growth here where we will have a series of new product introductions that might be timed around a particular model year and then that step function of growth occurs and then you get a couple quarters where you don't necessarily see the same rate of increase quarter-over-quarter. But certainly year-over-year, we have been generating results in excess of 40% annual growth year-over-year. So I think that it's not a perfect linear. It's not like a math equation. But I think a step function with the upward direction is the way to look at it. Quinn Bolton : Okay. So last year, it looks like you guys kind of hit that step function in the December and March quarters. Is that a fair way to think about maybe you kind of see that step function up with each new model year and you tend to see maybe a little bit better sequential growth December into March? Or is it not necessarily timed to the same seasonality each year? Michael Hsing : Yes. I think as I have to say that before the product, I am looking at the behavior of the product line. In last year or the year before that, all these revenue we generated from the non-automotive product and we requalify as automotive. In particular, from this year, the new revenue generated, these are all specifically designed for automotive application. And going forward, these products, all the new revenues, all from this particular design for automotive products. So I would say, there's more consistent growth. Quinn Bolton : Okay. Great. And then just looking at the sequential growth, you guys had a nice jump in the consumer revs as well as the compute. Just wanted to confirm, is that game console, the new game console included in the consumer? And then, similarly on the compute, was that mostly coming from the cloud computing or the server power management launch? Or did you see broader growth in the compute segment in the September quarter? Bernie Blegen : Yes, you are correct that the power management solution for gaming -- Michael Hsing : The game console is my least favorite. That's my least favorite topic. Bernie Blegen : But it is in the consumer group. And then as far as the growth in compute and storage, I think that most of that was with servers and workstation which we refer to more broadly as cloud computing. Quinn Bolton : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Hi guys. I will add my congratulations as well for this nice quarter. I guess I just had a couple of follow-up questions on some topics that were raised earlier. The first is just on your e-commerce site. Could you maybe provide us a sense of how big that S&B opportunity is for you guys? Is there like a framework or some guidepost we could use to kind of think about how big that opportunity is for you guys? Michael Hsing : I think it will be a few billion dollars. Because you think about all these company, that market size is all about underserved market. And you really require the FAE, like a field application engineer, hand-holding on it. And secondly, it's a fast-time to market segment. And so we, initially I think that will trickle down the initial design, that will not sustain it. But our e-commerce model, our modules is open bill of materials. And customers initially buy our modules for plug-and-play purpose and later on we get the production they can buy our chip and they can source in their own component. So by modules itself, okay, you add all these together, the modules, all these customers, smaller customers, I think that total market is a few billion dollars for MPS. And we add more programmable capability and put on the Internet, I think that we should have a very good chance. I am very optimistic about it. Rick Schafer : Okay. And should we think of the ramp there, once it starts to go as sort of more of a linear ramp? Or do you think there's any kind of a step function there or anything as new features on the site come online or adoption takes hold? Or is it just too soon to kind of know how that's going to roll? Michael Hsing : Well, first thing, like we already launched, okay. It's not on the Internet. We just sent them, as I stated before. I told you before, we send them a floppy disc, okay, right. And so it's well received now when it came. And once you introduce it on the Internet, I wish the step function, but it's too early to call it. Rick Schafer : Okay. And then just a quick follow up on the auto business. Maybe if I would asked the question a little different way, but I think you have said in the past that your auto SAM is roughly $200 a car today. I believe that's correct. Michael Hsing : Actually, it's a little less than that. It's a $145 or $150. Rick Schafer : Okay. So how does that compare with your actual average content then today? And then maybe what is that going to look like in the next, I don't know, year or so based on the design wins that you guys see coming down the pipe? Bernie Blegen : Well, again, let me take a quick stab at this. When you look at the potential of analog and sensor electronics in each automobile, you win an individual application or a socket. It's not like you get a 100% adoption in that. So in the area that we have been launching, which has been a combination of infotainment inclusive of USB ports, I think that we have actually seen very, very good penetration, but it's spread out with just a few dollars of content per individual automobile. And then as we do additional vertical product releases and go into the lighting, the body and controls and ADAS, then I think you will see opportunities for multiple adoptions which will, by nature, increase the dollar content per car. Rick Schafer : Got it. And then maybe just my last question is, you guys have been growing cash so nicely. Maybe Bernie or Michael, if you guys could discuss sort of what the top uses of cash here are for you guys? I mean, is it more apt we are going to see a raise in the dividend at some point? Are you looking more at buyback? Or sort of how you are thinking about uses of cash? Thanks. Michael Hsing : We are looking for all the scenarios, all scenarios being considered. And as we always said it, we are looking for some small tuck-in type complementary technology company. Rick Schafer : Got it. Thanks guys. Michael Hsing : Okay. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Chandra with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Amit Chandra : Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon gentlemen. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Bernie, just a quick follow up. With inventory increasing sequentially each quarter in 2017 to support your strong second half product ramp, when do you expect inventory levels to start to normalize? Would that be in the March quarter of 2018? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Let me process this. But the reason that we have invested in inventories is because we had some very unique new business opportunities as far as developing power management solutions for cloud computing, for gaming and for high-end PCs. And during a time where capacity has been a question mark, we have actually been able to do a really good job, a very good job of meeting our customers' demands. But obviously, our intention is not to stay at an elevated level, but as you said, to normalize. In the past that we have tried to target a range between 135 to 155 days for inventory and I would see us being able to bring that back more into, not a historic level, but within that range, probably in Q2 or Q3 of next year. Amit Chandra : Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow up, you guys are guiding to really strong year-over-year growth in the December quarter. Just out of curiosity, is that driven more so by the Purley product ramp? Or more by the Kaby Lake processor transition? Or is it mostly the new game console business? Or a combination of all three? Or is there something another --? Michael Hsing : A combination of more than three. Combination of all above that we said in this conference and also that Bernie said in his script and don't forget about consumer. And we grow percentage-wise, it's not big, but the revenue side, they are pretty sizable. Amit Chandra : Okay. Bernie Blegen : If I can add one comment that is, we are really trying to be a diversified company and the way that we differentiate ourselves is with unique technology. And so I think that what you are seeing as far as the acceleration of our rate of revenue growth, it's been acceptance of that technology by our customers for their applications. Amit Chandra : Okay. Great. And Michael, one final one for me. Can you give us a sense of how your single chip solution for battery management content is tracking for electric vehicles? Michael Hsing : Yes. It's on schedule. And we do some field testing now. Amit Chandra : Okay. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the great results and outlook. I joined a little late, so I apologize if this is already asked. But I would love to get an update on e.Motion. If you could remind us how big that business is for you now? And are there design wins that are coming into the market and generating revenue currently and over the next couple of quarters and any sort of elaboration on that business would be helpful. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. Thanks for raising the question. In the last few earnings calls and I say all this didn't grow as expected because I didn't look at it. And actually this product line grows really well. And we will have more than a few million dollar business in next years. And also the fully integrated product and we are launching, actually we have a lot more focus as a launch as a module and as a small model. And we will sell with the models and so we are partnered with a couple of model companies and with our module behind the models. And so first we introduce we have many design wins since this March and I think that we will have a lot more. And you are talking about really a revolution ideas to replace stem models, replacing all the BSP controls and as well as optical sensors. And so the acceptance will be very for particular applications. But once we, for a few larger segments start it and like robots and like warehouse robots, I think that will widely spread. William Stein : Maybe just one level deeper in the same topic. I think the somewhat unusual go-to-market approach is you are trying to get these components designed in by OEMs, who would have otherwise went to motor companies to buy a motor. And I think you are, correct me if I am wrong, but I think you are going to customers and telling them basically, build your own motor or a better motor using our components. Is that right? Are you seeing sort of acceptance based on either performance or pricing or both? Michael Hsing : I think go-to-market segment, it's like the MPS selling DC-to-DC. Now we are selling modules. We are selling our modules for underserved customers and for time to market. And for the higher, when the volume reach high they can source in there, the MPS IC. You can buy MPS IC. For the model, for this e.Motion product line, we will do it very similar, except in that case, now we do a model. So we partnership with the model makers. Really depend on customers' needs. Where they can buy our modules, they can buy our chip. And the key is, I think that at this time and the customers have a hard time to understand that. They are like, why, okay, how to use this product? Because we get rid of the optical encoders. And it has a new way of controlling the models. So we help them to design their modules and also we help them to select the models with our model maker partners. William Stein : Great. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Okay. All right. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A session. I would like to return the call to Mr. Bernie Blegen for any closing remarks. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. I would like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our fourth quarter conference call, which will likely be in early February. Thank you. Have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-answer-session and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the conference over to Monolithic's, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Bernie Blegen. Please go ahead. Bernie Blegen : Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2017 and Form 10-Q filed on November 6, 2017 both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, pre-tax income, net income and earnings on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table of that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 through Q4 releases for both 2016 and 2017, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Continuing with our now five year trend, we are pleased to announce 2017 with another record year for revenue. Full year revenue of $470.9 million was up 21.2% from 2016. The year-over-year growth was nearly double that of the analog semiconductor industry, which SIA estimates grew 10.9% over the prior year. Looking at our 2017 over 2016, revenue growth by market segments, automotive revenue up 58.7%, computing and storage up 25.1%, consumer up 23.4% and industrial revenue up 12.9%, communications revenue essentially flat between years. Let me speak to highlights by market segment. Full year automotive revenue grew $19.9 million to $53.9 million in 2017. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive is MPS's largest SAM opportunity at $6 billion, and we are in the early stages of penetrating this market. In the years ahead, we plan to offer a number of new products will application in infotainment, body controls, lighting, EV batteries and Ados. Automotive revenue represented 11.4% of MPS's full year 2017 revenue compared with 8.7% for 2016. Compute and storage revenue grew $20.2 million to $100.8 million in 2017. This growth reflected strong sales growth for cloud computing, SSD storage and high-end notebooks. Compute and storage revenue represented 21.4% of MPS's total revenue in 2017. Consumer revenue grew $36.0 million to $189.8 million in 2017. This growth reflected games in gaming and high-value consumer markets, including home appliances and battery management systems. Consumer revenue represented 40.3% of MPS's full year 2017 revenue. Industrial revenue grew $7.2 million to $62.9 million in 2017. This growth reflected sales for applications and power sources, point of sales system and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented 13.4% of MPS's full year 2017 revenue. Turning back to our overall financial performance. On a GAAP basis, full year 2017 gross margin of 54.8% expanded 50 basis points from the prior year. GAAP pre-tax income grew 44.8% over 2016 to $82.9 million. On a per share basis, GAAP net earnings of $1.50 were 19% higher in 2016. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in a one-time GAAP tax expense of $13.5 million or $0.31 per share. This new tax legislation also allows MPS to repatriate foreign sourced earnings. The one-time charge increased our 2017 tax rate from 5.1% to 21.4%. On a non-GAAP basis, full year gross margin of 55.6% expanded 40 basis points from the prior year. Non-GAAP pretax income of $137.9 million grew 32.4% over 2016. MPS achieved record full year non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 per share, which was 27.4% higher than 2016. Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $129.4 million, 24.9% higher than the comparable quarter in 2016 and slightly higher than revenue generated in the prior quarter. Looking at our 2017 over 2016 fourth quarter revenue growth by market segment, automotive up 57.7%, consumer up 44.6%, compute and storage up 14.0% and industrial up 6.7%. Fourth quarter revenue for the communication segment fell 7.0% from the prior-year period. Fourth quarter GAAP gross margin was 55.0%, matching the prior quarter of 2017 and 50 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Our GAAP pre-tax income was $26.7 million compared to the $25.1 million reported in the prior quarter of 2017 and $18.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, matching the prior quarter of 2017 and 30 basis points higher than the fourth quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP pre-tax income was $39.2 million compared to the $39.5 million reported in the prior quarter and the $29.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $46.1 million in the fourth quarter compared with $47.0 million in the third quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses were $33.9 million, $1 million up from the $32.9 million expense in the third quarter, primarily reflecting, an increase in R&D, new product spending. Fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses were up $5.5 million from the $28.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. From both and the GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter litigation expenses were $340,000. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarter discussed here are stock compensation expenses and expenses from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp expense was $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $14.0 million in the prior quarter of 2017 and $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Switching to the bottom line. Q4 GAAP net income was $12.1 million or $0.27 per fully diluted share compared with $0.54 per share in the previous quarter of 2017 and $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The current quarter GAAP results included the one-time expense of $13.5 million or $0.31 per fully diluted share resulting from the newly passed tax legislation. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $36.3 million or $0.82 per fully diluted share compared with $0.84 per share in the previous quarter of 2017 and $0.65 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $304.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, $620,000 less than the prior quarter of 2017. For Q4 2017 operating cash flow was $53.4 million, and for the full year 2017, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $133.8 million. Cash proceeds from employee's stock option exercises and the ESPP were $20,000 in Q4 and $2.9 million for all of 2017. Q4 2017 capital equipment purchases were $40.7 million, and for the full year, were $65.8 million. Dividend payments were $8.7 million for the quarter and $33.9 million for the year. Fourth quarter accounts receivable was $38.0 million or 27 days of sales outstanding, which was lower than the 36 days we reported at the end of the prior quarter of 2017. This decrease was due to a higher proportion of the quarter sales being recorded in the first two months of Q4 compared with the prior quarter. Fourth quarter of 2017 day sales outstanding were three days lower than the 30 days in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 were $99.3 million, down slightly from the $99.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased from - to 155 days at the end of Q4 from 156 days at the end of Q3 2017. I would now like to turn to our outlook. First and foremost, MPS is announcing a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.20 per share to $0.30 per share for shareholders of record as of March 30, 2018. During the next year, MPS will look for future opportunities return value to our shareholders. As of January 1, 2018, MPS adopted ASC 606. This new accounting standard, which modifies the revenue recognition role will have a minimal impact on our Q1 revenue. Looking at Q1, we are forecasting revenue in the range of $122 million to $128 million. We also expect the following, GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.8% to 55.8%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.3% to 56. 3%; total stock-based compensation expense of $13.9 million to $15.9 million, including approximately $400,000 that will be charged to cost of goods sold; litigation expenses of $250,000 to $350,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $32.1 million to 35.1% million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income of $600,000 to $700,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 43.9 to 44.9 million shares. Our tax rate for 2018 is expected to be between 5% and 10% on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. In conclusion, we continue to grow and continue to enhance shareholder value. I'll now open the microphone for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Quinn Bolton : Hi, Michael, hi, Bernie. Congratulations on another record and nice to see the 50% increase in dividend. Michael and Bernie just a couple of questions. First on the compute business quarter-on-quarter, looks like it was down sequentially despite the ramp of Purley. I wonder if could give us an update on the Purley ramp and superpower management for you guys? And then, Bernie, it looks like CapEx was up significant in the fourth quarter, can you give a little bit of detail on what you were spending that CapEx on? Bernie Blegen : Sure. Let me start up with your first question as far as what we're observing in computing and storage in the Q3 to Q4. So interestingly, we had a very good continuation of growth in our cloud computing, which is supposed to be associated with the server business, and that was offset by declines in both the storage and notebook. So I think that - versus our expectation internally as far as what the opportunity for servers are, we are tracking at or in fact, a little bit ahead of what we expected to be. And the business that we'll had to date has been primarily in some of the lower dollar categories, and we expect to see are in telophase our QSMod side of the business, which is higher dollars to pick up early in 2018. With regard to the cap spending, we've made some purchases of office space in the quarter, and we picked up two offices, one for $25 million and the other for $15 million. And believe that this is a good way to secure capacity at a fixed price that will benefit the - accretive to earnings over the years to come. Quinn Bolton : Great. And then Maybe just one sort of forward-looking question, as you look into 2018, could you size or maybe rank quarter for us, what you see is perhaps some of the biggest incremental revenue drivers heading into this year? Bernie Blegen : Sure. I'm going to address it on a percentage basis. And so the dollars maybe a little bit different. But automotive, as I've been saying in the recent past is expected to grow in any quarter-over-quarter between 30% to 60%. And that was consistent the experience that we had in 2017. So that - the design wins and the visibility that we have in the long-term, we believe that for 2018 and 2019 and 2020, automotive\u2026 Michael Hsing : The growth on each market segment, if you look at our last two or three years, and you looking forward in our K [ph] that's just plus or minus fewer percentage on the each market segments. And the trend will be very similar. 2018 and 2019, 2020 that we see as a pretty much all set. The percentage is just only a few percentage change. Quinn Bolton : Understood. Great. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you, Quinn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is John for Will. Thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. I'm just wondering if you guys had an update on web based e-commerce analog for the masses project. Michael Hsing : Well, I see it's - it's delayed again. I promised it in January, it didn't happen. I think that we rather have a very good user experience to launch it first. And rather than - and a mediocre one. And so I made a very hard decision not to do it and not to launch it. And you will see the probably in a - now I don't have a creditability on that. I postponed it several times already, and like I promised, I postponed it several times, and hopefully it will be in Q2. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And thank for that. Bernie Blegen : Just to add to that. I think Michael has a lot of credibility typically when you look at the results we turned in that 2017 and going forward. And that secondary point is - Michael Hsing : Well, this is one area I buck it up. Bernie Blegen : We will manage that in the transcript. The expectations set as far as zero revenue generation as a result of e-commerce in 2018 and 2019. So to the extent that we have a successful launch and we're able to incorporate customer feedback into making quick adaptations of that platform, I think it's time well spend. Unidentified Analyst : Very helpful. Michael Hsing : But on the other bucket, I do emphasize that's the direction we're really going. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. Michael Hsing : And that doesn't - the delay doesn't cause any doubt. And as a matter of fact, all the testings that can be without the website, it's doing really, really well. And we in the last few months, every months we increase 600, 700 customers, and those customers whenever low off even. Michael Hsing : No marketing just coming over and trying some. Bernie Blegen : That's right. Yeah. So the train - even I can't imagine with our own website and these acquired - acquired customers from our distributors and from other sites. And I can't imagine from our own site, the marketing all other effort we will put it in and it will be a phenomenal growth. Unidentified Analyst : It's really helpful detail. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, if you could give you any update on customer order patterns, are you getting any sense for double ordering given the strength of the revenue growth? Bernie Blegen : Yes, it's a concern that we had going into Q4 because we had very high level of backlog compared to what historical norms have been. And going into Q1 that has remained also on high side and what we're very conscience of is that we don't want to either participate in double ordering, or where we're selling demand with inventories just going to sit in the channel, excuse me. And as a result, we've been very cautious as far as meeting customer demands that we believe in excess of what they need to keep-up - keep their facilities going. So in the end of Q4, I think we did a very good job because we were able to generate the revenue we did and that increase the days in the channel. Unidentified Analyst : Very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Jeriel Ong : Thanks for letting me ask question. This is Jeriel Ong on behalf of Ross. So just wondering to get some clarity on the tax rate, so it appears the semi industry you reported so far that presently pay a higher tax than you, and you reported an increase in their tax - ongoing tax rate going forward. So with your 7.5% rate, it appears you guys are guiding to a rate that flat, I assume on an ongoing basis. Could you walk me how you guys derived with your tax guidance? Michael Hsing : Well, you look at our outlook and thanks for our last year effort, we bought a lot of buildings. These are tax free. Bernie Blegen : So let me try and clarify that. So there are two components to the tax, the transition of the toll tax, which we recorded in Q4. That's what Michel is referring to. Because we've invested in a lot of property, we actually had a lower blended tax rate that we had to pay there. Going forward, as far as how we can guide to the 5% to 10% rate, there is a step up as far as the guilty [ph] tax, but we have some discrete items that can offset that. And so as a result, for 2018, we won't see a change in our tax rate from what we reported in the current year. Jeriel Ong : Got it. That's really helpful. And I think next question I guess, switching over to automotive, it was really strong in 4Q and strong in 2017 in general, north of 50% growth rate, what's driving the strength from like a various infotainment or lighting, et cetera perspective? And staying at this rate in 2018? Michael Hsing : Yes, it's fair that the growth rate it will not changes much. Okay, but don't follow me them exactly what the rate. It would be very similar to this year. Which applications or which segments, I think in the next couple of years we're going to expand lot more segments. Now the lighting, infotainment and the safeties, and we will have a lot more safety products come out. And as Bernie said in his script, we have an ADAS and also the\u2026 Bernie Blegen : Battery. Michael Hsing : Battery management, as well as the connectivity. Jeriel Ong : Yeah. Michael Hsing : And those areas have a very little revenue or some of the item have no revenue, only sampling cut. And we expect to have a very high percentage growth in dollar amount growth that in 2019, '20 and '21. Bernie Blegen : And one more point is that, we've getting good penetration in all the major geographies known for automotive. Jeriel Ong : All right. If I could squeeze one last one, just clarity on the CapEx spend. You mentioned it was office space, so is this more capacity to manufacture goods or is this some office space for workers. I'm trying to \u2026 Bernie Blegen : Well, I think it's everything. Everything so for the factories [ph] and for engineering facility, for automotive, quality control systems and everything. Michael Hsing : And down the road software as well. Software design. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Jeriel Ong : All right. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is actually Jerome calling in for Tore. Let me add my congratulations again to you, another great quarter. Just want to follow-up briefly on the automotive segment. You mentioned connectivity. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what this piece is, is it USB tech stuff or is it serial [ph] tech stuff? Bernie Blegen : Michael, Connectivity? Michael Hsing : On the automotive? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Michael Hsing : Could you repeat the question. I was looking at people. Unidentified Analyst : Just wanted a little bit more incentive what the connectivity portion of this business was related to? Michael Hsing : Yes, okay, sorry, I've been in the [indiscernible] I wasn't paying attention. The connectivity for the car and lot of ADAS and a lot of safety things and safety cameras such as the cameras, the LIDARs [ph] and these will be connected to the cloud. And those are the areas we really focused on it. And those are our customers' requirements. Unidentified Analyst : So it's more of a card to you - infrastructure cloud connectivity versus in car connectivity system? Michael Hsing : Actually both. In the connectivity between the - all these sensors to the control units, and the control units to the cloud and these all add up to all this self-learning capability. And that's the area we are really focused on it and that's where we receive huge requirements and for joint development with these larger automotive companies. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's very helpful. Second question, in terms of your industrial market, can you give us an update in terms how E Motion is doing and how you are penetrating that and also with medical? Michael Hsing : Yes, emotion, it's not emotion - E Motion product line in the past and other - a lot of people asked me, okay, the product didn't do well and actually it's doing really well. This year, we will generate somewhere between $8 million to $12 million business. And we develop at the newer product the integrated - fully integrated\u2026 Bernie Blegen : Modules. Michael Hsing : The modules and we receive how many request, it's beyond my belief actually. And those will do well in the 2018 and 2019 particularly. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And just one question more on the longer-term on the outlook, you've done obviously very well using - leveraging your DC/DC process, expanding to multi markets and applications. And as you look out three to five-plus years, can you still - there is something you can still ride or do you intend to invest in may be adjacent processes - there something could be new? Michael Hsing : Well, that's a good question. As we said, in the last conference call, we will move - we started the two 12-inch wafer fab. So we migrate from a 6-inch, 8-inch, now the 12-inch. And on the each upgrade, we add a lot more new features. And so you can think about it, okay, now we can integrate microcontrollers and is not inconceivable, we even put a Wi-Fi system on it. Unidentified Analyst : Very good. Thank you very much for this insight. Operator : Thank you. We do have a follow-up question from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Thanks for letting me ask follow-up guys. Just on 2018, given that you are guiding for 25% growth in Q1, and given like the multiple growth drivers you have coming on Purley gaming, notebooks, is there any reason we shouldn't think that calendar '18 can grow in the low 20% range year-over-year? Bernie Blegen : We don't offer a specific guidance for - beyond one quarter. But the way I can respond to it is that we've been promoting our strategic business model now for about last four years. If you look at 2017, we had revenue growth of 20%, which map 21% which was little better than our model. We had gross margin increased at 40 basis points for the full year, which is consistent with our margin - with our model. And our operating expenses came in between 50% and 60% of what our revenue growth was. And I think what we've done is, we've achieved the model and expect to continue along that line. The one thing that will offer just some concern is that there are risk factors associated with introducing new products to new customers and particularly, in what is becoming a sort of a more clouded longer-term outlook as far as what the economy is going to do. So we've tend to believe that we're capable of achieving our model, but I add just cautionary note that there are risk factors and say you might build in little bit of cushion when looking at full year outlook might be. William Stein : Got it. Understood. Michael Hsing : Let me comment on your question. Okay. In early 2005, 2006, and again we had a model like a got 20% to 30%, and we never achieved that. We achieved close to 18%, 19% in between 15% to 20%. And I was very criticized by that - some of the shareholders, and I spend too much money and not grow enough. Okay. I can't figure out 20% or not 20%. In 2006 - 2016 in the first quarter, I made an announcement, or some people asked me, if we're going to achieve the models. I said that okay, it will be 2017, and we did it okay. Now since you ask for this year again, I think as a - I can't predict in a couple of percentage difference. But we will grow double or triple than the industrial growth. If the industrial growth negative 5%, okay, we'll be three times - okay, well, we grow from somewhere 10% to 15% range. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. And that's if the industry grows 5%, that we will grow 10% to 15%. Michael Hsing : Yeah. William Stein : Yeah. I got it. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yeah. William Stein : And just a housekeeping question, are you guys having an Analyst Day this year? Bernie Blegen : We are planning on it. But we haven't announced a date yet. Michael Hsing : We will plan in to it - and because our website stuck up, so, okay, we delayed it. William Stein : Okay. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Thank you. We have another question from John Vinh with KeyBanc Capital. You're now - line is now open. John Vinh : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Bernie, last year you came in at the high end of kind of OpEx as a percentage of sales growth. I think at the - high-end of the 60% range. What's your sense in terms of how we should be thinking about OpEx growth this year as a percentage of sales? You've got to 50% to 60% model, could we get a little bit more leverage and be at the lower end of the range or how should we be thinking about that? Bernie Blegen : When I say the 50% to 60% range, that's really focused on R&D and SG&A, and does not include litigation, which can be a little hard to manage. So for 2017, my calculations show this for the full year being at 58% of our revenue growth rate. When you look ahead here, I think we've got three drivers that we're going to invest in. Automotive in particular, we want to continue to fuel that revenue growth through sales and marketing as well as a QA and some - also some R&D specific to it the. On top of that, Michael also mentioned to you, as far as our investment in 12-inch fabs, that's going to be continuing for about five to six quarters beginning in Q2 - beginning in earnest in Q2. And then finally, with the launch of the website in the e-commerce platform, we are going to make a big investment in marketing to be able to really launch that successfully and get the word out. So I think that in that - and I don't have a firm number yet, but we want to be able to strike and make these investments and that will put us, at a minimum, at the high end of that range. Michael Hsing : Yeah. But Bernie is talking about lot of investment. Okay. But if you look in our history, we never had a wide spending\u2026 Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Michael Hsing : And we will - if we spend, we'll spend a couple of more percent. That's - that will be it. And we don't have a wide - open pocket spending bracket, will never happen in the entire MPS history. And - so there's 50% - 60% to 61%, 62%, so that's probably - I don't see we go beyond that. John Vinh : Yeah. Great. And then my follow-up is just on growth question. I know you guys are trying to avoid guiding specific - to a specific number 2018 again, but if I think about the computing segment, you've got kind of uplift, higher ASPs in QSMod and then you get the full year's benefit of the Purley ramp. And then on consumer you've got obviously the full benefit of a full year's worth of a gaming consoles ramp or you've kind of increased your market shares. Is there any reason to think that the growth rates of these two segments could be positively bias, slightly higher in 2018 versus 2017? Bernie Blegen : I think Michael did a good job responding to that, saying that if you look at the growth profile of 2017 and plus or minus a couple of percentage points off of what we enjoyed there, that's pretty much what we're expecting for '18 as well. Michael Hsing : Well, it's a gaming, and I can't openly fit it. It's not my favorite topic. And it goes up by a quarter a lot, and then next couple of quarters it comes down again. And I want to manage a very, very smooth growth and that can - and sustainable growth. And so since you mention of for gaming, of course, there is a lot of dollars to be made. And these are very opportunistic. So that's why we have a few percentage variations. Bernie Blegen : But on the gaming, and I think it's very important to offer that we're fully committed to the gaming platforms, and but there are limited opportunities for growth. And so we have to be able to make sure that the market understands that we are positioned for the long term there, and to be able to enjoy the benefits of future design wins to help accelerate that growth. John Vinh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Amit Chandra : Yes. Hi. This is Amit Chandra dialing in for David. Thanks for me letting me ask a question. Bernie, for the December quarter, could you share with us what percentage of your cash flows are onshore versus offshore? And should we expect the majority of offshore cash to be brought back to the U.S. post tax reform? And what are your priorities for uses of cash in 2018? Bernie Blegen : So at the end of the year, we had about 40% of our cash is onshore, 60% was offshore. We are continuing to evaluate what the impact of the new tax reform means for us. We took an initial step by increasing the dividend this quarter, and we're going to use the remainder of this year to consider other opportunities where we increase shareholder value even through dividends or acquisitions or perhaps even a stock buyback. But right now, we haven't firmed up any specific plans around that. Amit Chandra : Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, in your high end notebook business can you maybe talk about the product cycles that you expect better upcoming in 2018 to drive that business higher? Bernie Blegen : Yeah, I'd say that the notebook business, a lot of that has to do with customer adoption. And we have a couple of very good prospects that we've been designed with. And we're looking at various scenarios as far as what the timing and the unit volumes could be. One of the things that you may be aware of is that Cannon Lake was cancelled and the next opportunity for a new design will be, I believe it's called Whiskey Lake, which is supposed to be in mid 2019. So I think we feel very, very well positioned there. We have very good new adoptions that are occurring right now, but that the product cycle from Intel got moved out by a year. Michael Hsing : Well, since you mentioned, notebook is not my favorite either. And these are kind of low-margin but the way Bernie emphasize high value notebook. And those are generally their sales are retailing price like $1200 or $1300 and above. And some of the models they pay it. And so they appreciate our technology, as those are product that we deliver\u2026 Bernie Blegen : That we want to go after. Michael Hsing : Yes. Amit Chandra : Okay. And then one final one for me, for your E-Fuse opportunities, can you talk about that in 2018? Bernie Blegen : Sure. E-Fuse tends to be lower dollar content, but what they been very helpful for us is being able to open the door for opportunities that we haven't else wise had. Michael Hsing : Are you talking about server area or talking about all the area? Bernie Blegen : Broadly. Amit Chandra : Yes, broadly speaking. Michael Hsing : The server area is - the MPS become a single source and adoption in some very large customers. And our product now is realized - just start to realize by all the large first tier makers. And those are not small lower dollar, very high margin and what we are more excited about in all. And the trend is to replace the blowup fuse and use an electronic fuse, so that's where the MPS opportunity lies. Bernie Blegen : There is also an opportunity in the communications network as well. And that should start to roll out here at the end of 2018. Amit Chandra : Okay, great. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. I show no further questions in queue. So I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Blegen for closing remarks. Bernie Blegen : Thank you very much. So thank you for joining us on the conference call. And I look forward to talking to you again during our first quarter conference call, which is likely to be at the end of April. Thank you, and have nice day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-answer-session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin. Bernie Blegen : Great, thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter 2018 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018 which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table of that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC.

I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS had yet another record first quarter with revenue of $129.2 million, 28.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2017. MPS continues to benefit from our technology leadership and diversified multi market strategy. Looking at our revenue by market, compared with the first quarter of 2017, revenue from consumer markets increased $11.5 million, or 32.4%. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected solid improvements and high value consumer markets including home appliances, power chargers and lighting, as well as increases in certain traditional consumer revenue categories. Consumer revenue of $47.1 million represented 36.5% of our Q1 revenue. In our computing and storage market, revenue of $31.0 million increased $10.4 million, or 50.2% year-over-year reflecting strong sales growth for cloud computing, SSD storage and high end notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 24.0% of MPS' first quarter 2018 revenue. First quarter 2018 automotive revenue of $17.7 million grew 43.8% over the same period of 2017. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive revenue represented 13.7% of MPS' first quarter 2018 revenue. First quarter 2018 industrial revenue of $17.6 million increased 14.3% from the first quarter of 2017, reflecting gains of smart meters, security and power sources. Industrial revenue accounted for 13.6% of our total first quarter revenue. In Q1, MPS adopted the revenue recognition standard generally referred to as TOPIC606. Its adoption had a negligible impact on Q1 revenue. GAAP gross margin was 55.4%, 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and 80 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2017. Our GAAP operating income was $22.0 million, compared to $13.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.9%, 20 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and 40 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP operating income was $37.2 million, compared to $26.5 million reported in the first quarter of 2017. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $49.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $41.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2018 operating expenses were $35.0 million, up from the $29.2 million reported in the first quarter of 2017. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses to the quarters discussed here are, stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2018, total stock compensation expense including approximately $433,000 charged cost of goods sold was $15.0 million, compared with $11.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Switching to the bottom line, first quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $21.9 million, or $0.49 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.33 per share in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 non-GAAP net income was $35.0 million, or $0.79 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.58 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1, 2018 were $44.3 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $312.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018, compared to $304.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. In the quarter MPS generated operating cash flow of about $16.3 million, compared with operating cash flow of $21.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 capital spending totaled $7.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2018 at $48.2 million, or 34 days of sales outstanding, which was one day lower than the 35 days posted in the first quarter of 2017. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2018 were $111.9 million, up from the $99.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. Inventories increased in anticipation of sales growth during the second half of 2018 especially for the computing, consumer and automotive markets. Days of inventory increased to 177 days at the end of Q1, 2018, compared with 157 days at the end of the first quarter of 2017. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2018. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $135 million to $141 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.9% to 55.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.4%. Total stock based compensation expense of $15.2 million to $17.2 million, including approximately $500,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold. Litigation expenses ranging between $300,000 to $500,000. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $48.4 million and $53.4 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $33.7 million to $36.7 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Interest and other income is expected to range from $600,000 to $700,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 43.9 million to 44.9 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to grow and continue to enhance shareholder value. I will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hi, guys, nice results. Michael and Bernie wanted to start with the power management business specifically for the Purley cycle. Can you give us an update on when the QSMod solutions for CPU power begin to ramp? Does that start this quarter? Michael Hsing : I think if we see it starting last couple of quarters and just slowly. There are all these activity, yes, now that we see a lot more. Bernie Blegen : Yes and I think that in addition to Purley, we certainly increased the number of design wins that we have on this cycle with some of our other products, the point of load in the E-Fuse. And so as we look ahead, we see a continuing momentum. Quinn Bolton : Did you guys still think you're on track to pick up those 45 points of share that you'd previously talked about? Bernie Blegen : Yes, well, we only talk about results for the next quarter of forecasts; we don't see anything that's changing that assumption. Quinn Bolton : Okay. Michael Hsing : This is a very beginning - at the very beginning early for MPS. All the opportunities still developing here. Quinn Bolton : Okay and then the second question just kind of it looks like your inventories are up in anticipation of sort of higher second-half sales, but I think the last couple of quarters you've said that the things in the supply chain are tight. You were worried about double ordering and I think that was particularly something that you're worried about heading into the fourth quarter. Can you just give us an update on your backlog coverage? Do you think you've seen - have you been able to sort of shake out any potential excess from the order books? Bernie Blegen : Yes. I think that it's prudent to be cautious as far as interpreting the ordering trends that we're seeing. In each of the last three quarters, the bookings and backlog going into the quarter have been running higher than they traditionally have. And so as a result of that we wanted to a, be able to make sure that we have adequate inventory in order to be able to meet real demand, but by the same token we're trying to manage what we observe as far as inventory in the channel to make sure that that doesn't increase and come at the expense of future growth. So when we looked at the channel inventory at the end of Q1, it was very consistent, in fact, it was down a few days more we've been a year ago. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Thanks and congrats on another nice quarter, guys. So your auto business maybe my first question, your auto business has been doubling annually I guess the last few years. I think it was up close to [50%] [ph]. I think you highlighted Bernie in your remarks this past quarter. Can you talk about the growth expectation for 2018 as much as you much color as you can give there? And maybe provide some color on what's driving that growth? I mean it seems like ADAS becoming a bigger incremental driver. So as mix kind of maybe favors ADAS going forward. Can you talk about what that does to maybe gross margin in that segment? Bernie Blegen : Sure. When we look at automotive right now we are certainly benefiting from significant growth, but still we represent such a small portion of what the total available market is to us. So a lot of what we're seeing right now is been any gains in infotainment and then we've also seen some gains in body controls and also in certain of the networking applications. And we look forward to opportunities in ADAS In particular, although I don't think that those will be of a material nature to us until for another couple of years. Rick Schafer : Got it, thanks. Second question, 12 volt to 48 volt transition that's sort of already underway in auto. Can you talk about that opportunity as it relates to GPU and CPU core power? Is that something else that we should think about as being sort of a couple years from now but before it's really a growth driver? And who do you expect to compete with there? Who do you see also going after the 48 volt market for CPU, GPU? Michael Hsing : I think a 48 volts market is an inevitable and as CPU or GPU power increases that's the only way to get the current down, to get the efficiency up and thing is that it's all, well none of the our competitors they are publishing papers, but we have solutions now. Rick Schafer : And Michael any key competitors you see there. I mean it would be the sort of the TIs and the Infineons of the world or who would it be do you think at 48 volt? Michael Hsing : I don't think, we don't have a see a real solution out there, okay other than existing 48 volts, and 48 volts which is a very expensive as far as I know. And I think we are first few companies, first company that has our own solution as semiconductor players. Rick Schafer : Got it and then if I could sneak one last question and just maybe a quick update on your 300 millimeter design efforts and I don't know how to frame that I mean any expectation or what your expectations are for 300 millimeter revenue contribution this year? Or is it more of a - I know I'm asking a lot of far out questions I mean is it more of 2019, 2020 kind of thing. Michael Hsing : And I think it's 2019, 2020 kind of things. And I mean I don't rule out, and at the end of the year we have some small volume productions happening. Rick Schafer : Michael is it targeting any particular like specific verticals or is it just kind of across your basket of verticals? Michael Hsing : I think it's across a basket of vertical. Now we with 12 inch and we integrate a lot more features in there and as we talk about a lot of programming capability, a lot of memories and along with the increase of a power density and I think we'll be putting a power solution as MPS name, the Monolithic Power System, we're going to put a sub power systems on a single chip in 12 inch - 12 inches just widen our capability. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Great, thanks. I'd like to sort of contrast the growth rate it in light of your inventory building the quarter. I mean you've been a rapid growth company for some time. You've accelerated the year-over-year growth in the last couple quarters now, which is great and inventories are increasing. Should we expect that acceleration to continue and to see even higher year-over-year growth rates as we've progress through the year? That's what the inventory build would imply. So it's not a hoping maybe we can reconcile it a little bit. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes, that's a good reading. Okay, I mean of course we're not sayings and okay we're going to accelerating more but the way I certainly anticipated that. Okay, if there's opportunity there. William Stein : And for investors that sort of looks at this outsize growth rate and recognizes it's pretty unusual, pretty unique in semis. Can you help us maybe review the reasons that you're seeing the design wins maybe from a technology perspective or just from the design wins that you've won recently that you can talk about that would exemplify why you're seeing such rapid growth? Michael Hsing : Well, it's a - if we're talking about all the design wins and okay we can go for hours. And I frankly I don't even know. I can remember three or four things. Look I mean just-- this is truly a broad-based growth and we're not using our standard product and using our configurable software, we can go into a many different field, that's actually reality, yes, and that's the beauty of it. I can't say which one has a more growth and now you're talking about server, locking and talking about autos, and these are much a very high concentrated market segment that we can talk about it. But a lot of others actually grow more than these areas. So I can't really talk about it in a - in fact, lot of smaller customers using our solution that really excites me. That means okay we're pushing a margin even higher, and we provides the service. Our customers really want that even though we have outrageous margins. So that's kind of things I'm getting excited. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter and guide and the comments you said earlier Bernie about the inventory up because you saw opportunities in the second half. I think you said in computing, consumer and automotive. Without going into specific customers and sockets et cetera can you just talk a little bit about the applications into which you're putting those parts to the back half of the year? And just what sort of dollar content penetration, market penetration just some numbers around those to give us a little more color to help investors feel comfortable at the inventory level? Bernie Blegen : Sure. So when we look at a lot of the growth that we've started to enjoy probably beginning in Q3 of 2017. We were basically introducing new products and new markets for new customers. And the demands of these customers are significant meaning that we didn't want to come out of the gate with our new release, new product releases and not be able to sustain the growth because of being constrained in any way. So I think you recall that last year we invested in bringing up a fourth fab in order to aid capacity. So really this has been pretty consistent, as far as an overarching supply chain management philosophy to position us to be able to achieve as Michael said, should a demand be there, this accelerated rate of revenue growth. And we believe that we have actually targeted so when we look at the inventory levels, they're targeted in some of the highest growth revenue areas. And right now it's also in the quarter pretty well evenly split between raw materials work and process and finished goods meaning that what we've done is have a very balanced approach to how we're making those investments. Michael Hsing : Yes. Ross you don't have to worry about these inventories, look I mean we increase it and I know this our invest - our investors - some of the investors kind of sensitive okay and I'm a kind of irritated okay. We grow this much and we need it real, a real inventory to back it up and on top of it all these products, a new product, because anything goes wrong we have something to back it up. And also provides with some industrial automotive even computing company, they want inventory, they want okay we are the new players and we guarantee they're supplied. So that's why we're doing it. And so last reason is I don't worry about inventory, our product cycles the last for 10 years and we never - we don't have a problems until have a huge write-off. Ross Seymore : That is very helpful. My second question and I'm going to try not to irritate you further if that one happened to this might do worse but the guidance on an absolute dollar basis the guidance is great, on year-over-year the guidance is great, sequentially though that's less growth than you guys I mean I have to go back many, many, many years. Is there anything that's changing in the very near term, the bridge between now and the second half growth that's less than normal? Is there something that's changed just with the move to ASC 606 as far as the seasonality? Just trying to figure out or you're just being conservative like you tend to do over time for consistency benefits. Just try to figure out what went into the guidance in those regards. Bernie Blegen : Sure I can help out with this. So if you look at generally speaking we have a fairly large or pronounced fall-off in revenue between Q4 to Q1. And that didn't occur, so the base that we're starting out with Q1 revenue is much higher than the seasonal norm would normally have provided for. And some of that represented that we had some late deliveries in Q1 that aided our performance in the quarter, but then also creates an issue with the comparable Q2 number. So I would say that we do have a profile to always be able to meet expectations. And in fact do a little bit better and there is a change in seasonality relative to what our historic norm has been with Q1. And none of that is related in any way to the 606 the new revenue recognition standard. Michael Hsing : Yes, well, I think Ross you cover us as things the IPO right. And you see that seasonality change and from a consumer centric to broad-based announcing okay. And last year, we see a four quarters consecutive growth. That's the first time I think a first time ever in 2006. That was the last time so this is the second time. And I think at this time is a really changed from - or the business change. And that's a less irritated question. Ross Seymore : Oh, I am glad I didn't annoy too terribly, so congrats again guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you and congratulations on the consistency. First question could you update us on ecommerce and your programmable products or is that business model starting to contribute to revenue yet or is that still more of a second half event? Michael Hsing : Well, I think our web e-commerce website is up and I think that's the only the first step and regarding to revenue, no, okay and but the business model it's more - the more I visit customers, these are smaller customers and the more I really excited. I think of this is a we were hitting flashing point, sometimes this year or next year, as we provide a more color - now it's the time provide more content, working with full on the website. How we serve to all these, time to - very quick time-to-market product or underserved customers. And the business models are truly really believe more and more I believe when I visit those smaller customers. And I see a lot more opportunity and now we have a delivered more content. We have the website but although the programming portion is still not there yet, but as we - as I talk about we hand them a floppy disk, they can program it on their own now. Tore Svanberg : That's really helpful and on that same topic and as that business models start to materialize. I mean wouldn't that mean that inventory days will be higher anyway just because these are programmable parts. Michael Hsing : I haven't really thought about this or probably because we have a third-party product and as our part of our solutions okay. And so that probably will be a higher inventory in the futures. Bernie Blegen : And sorry part of the benefit of being able to go to the 12 inch wafer is that we can have larger production runs and get better cost economics that certainly benefit this mass customization market. Tore Svanberg : Okay, great and I had a follow-up question on the on the 48 volt. So are you going to be BCBHV process for that or is it something else? Michael Hsing : No, that's correct. And we have a very efficient solutions and I think as a lot of people seen it and we're presenting a papers. We have a real we have a real product now okay. And these are - this product family is a very cost effective, and I think as a 48 volt we're really betting on it, that's our future. Tore Svanberg : Okay, very good, just one last question. I know there have been some talks in the industry about shortages especially for raw wafers. Is that something that you're seeing and have you secured enough capacity there for your growth going forward? Michael Hsing : We don't have a shortage and we don't have a shortage. In last year we expand a fab and that this year we expand fab again. And we don't see shortages okay. We have a lot of inventory. So, no. we don't have a shortage issues. And two other ones I heard a lot of stories okay out there. I can't confirm. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Chris Caso : Yes, thank you, good evening. Just a another question following on to the seasonality question and is there anything in particularly we should be thinking about seasonality with respect to individual segments embedded in the Q guidance was automotive and computing carrying much of the sequential growth in Q1? Does that continue into Q2 or do you see a bit more broad-based revenue growth as you go in Q2? Michael Hsing : I can give you something as well. See it again in what I believe the business that we focus on a very long term and in a very broad-based and these are designing activities. And I have designing activities turn into a revenue takes about three or four years. And we see all these activities and we see all these activity turning to our revenues. And I think from now on we will have a very consistent growth. And that's really what we want to see it in a steady state, in a growth - maybe steady to have a bad connotation, somebody going to pick up okay we're slowing down, we're not okay. So I think as a consistent is the key. And from next couple of quarters and we don't see it much of a difference from last year I guess yes. Bernie Blegen : I mean one of the things that we work to do is even though we're on a high growth relative to our industry is we want to be predictable. And I don't think there's anything boring about that. Chris Caso : Well as follow-on to that given that what appears to be strong industry conditions, strong revenues for you guys. To what extent are you able to be somewhat selective in the business that that you take from a quarter-to-quarter basis? That I'm sure that there's some margin discrepancies up among some of the things that you sell given the business conditions right now are you able to be a little bit more selective in that business? And if so, what's does that mean? Bernie Blegen : One of the things that we benefited from is we've seen this shift in our business mix is that there's longer lead times and so as a result of that we're able to have very consistent 10 to 20 basis points improvement in our gross margin quarter-over-quarter and what that allows us to do is find the mix that allows us to accelerate our rate of revenue growth. So it's really having that visibility in that lead time that allows us to be able to manage the business in this manner. Chris Caso : Great. If I just one quick follow on in computing, Intel made some changes to the roadmap on 10 nanometer pushing, some of that out I know that you guys have had some design wins on that. Is any material effect on your business going forward? Bernie Blegen : No. We are - we keep an eye on what Intel is doing but as far as a delay and a release or a change in their roadmap, it does not - is not going to impact us. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. David Wong : Thanks very much. Michael can you run through some of the R&D projects currently underway that you're most excited about? Michael Hsing : Oh, it's of emotions and I just visit a couple of customers when I came in these are really need our help and they will glad to see us okay. These are from what do you call it the mill the packaging sorter to warehouse management, to massage chairs, to a hospital bed okay and they have a different kind of a design and each design take them half year or three months to half year. And we can't go in there with our standard product, standard module, and sometimes they want to buy us - our bio modules and we buy from a third party. We produce several standard product and we use a program to change it either significantly change our business. We sell in instead of a few dollars a chip now we sell $20-$30 module now. And our customers or those customers really want this product. And so they do not have to go through a design. So that's kind of thing to get me excited. Bernie Blegen : I think just to add to that sort of two things that all of our R&D is focused on right now is really the ease of use, and that we're really focused on selling our customers solutions as opposed to just an individual IC. David Wong : Okay, great and our one thing just confirmed Bernie I think last earnings call you talked-- you said that adoption of ASC 606 has negligible revenue recognition impact on Q1 revenues and that's still true going into the next quarter. Is that correct? Bernie Blegen : That is correct. Michael Hsing : We just sell two modules right. We never have sell-through models. Bernie Blegen : Yes. We only --our business we had very a small portion of it that was on sell-through. Michael Hsing : Since the beginning of the company inception, company will always build sell-through models. Bernie Blegen : Correct. Michael Hsing : You buy a product, you owned it. We don't have - Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer for closing remarks. Michael Hsing : I'd like to thank you all for joining us to this conference call. As a reminder, MPS will be hosting an Analyst Day on June 7th at our offices in San Jose, California. We expect this to be an informative update on MPS' strategic direction. I hope you will be able to join us. And if you are unable to join us on June 7th, I look forward to talking you again during our second quarter conference call which is likely to be at the end of July. Thank you. Have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-answer-session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead. Bernie Blegen : Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to the second quarter 2018 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018 and Form 10-Q filed on May 8, 2018 which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2017, Q1 2018, and Q2 2018 releases as well to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet , and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. In the second quarter of 2018, MPS set a new high watermark in quarterly revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. MPS\u2019s Q2 revenue of $139.8 million was 8.2% higher than revenue in the first quarter 2018 and 24.6% higher than the comparable quarter in 2017. MPS\u2019s sales momentum continues to build as we generate superior results from our R&D investments targeting the computing, automotive and industrial markets. Looking at our revenue by market. In our computing and storage market, revenue of $37.0 million increased $12.5 million or 51.1% year-over-year. Growth in this market was broadly when compared to the year ago quarter, with all applications, cloud computing, storage and high-end notebooks increasing at a rate well above the market. Computing and storage revenue represented 26.4% of MPS's second quarter 2018 revenue. Second quarter automotive revenue of $20.3 million grew 58.2% over the same period of 2017, fueled by product sales for infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive revenue was 14.6% of MPS's total second quarter 2018 revenue. In our consumer markets revenue of $47.8 million increase 8.9% over the second quarter of 2017 and represented 34.2% of our second quarter 2018 revenue. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected gains in home appliances, IoT-related applications and specialty lighting. Second quarter 2018 industrial revenue of $19.1 million increase 27.2% from the second quarter 2017 due primarily to increased sales of industrial power supplies. Industrial represented 13.7% of our total second quarter 2018 revenue. GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, 10 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2018 and 80 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2017. Our GAAP operating income was $24.9 million compared to $22.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2018 and $15.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2018 was 56.0%, 10 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2018 and 40 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $41.4 million compared to $37.2 million reported in the prior quarter and $31.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Let\u2019s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $52.7 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared with $49.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 and $46.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2018 operating expenses were $36.9 million, up from $35.0 million we spent in the first quarter of 2018 and up from the $31.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2018, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $480,000 charge to cost of goods sold was $15.9 million, compared with $15.0 million recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $24.2 million or $0.55 per fully diluted share, compared with $21.9 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2018 and $15.0 million or $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $40.0 million or $0.90 per fully diluted share, compared with $35.0 million or $0.79 per share in the first quarter of 2018 and $29.5 million or $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2018 were $44 .4 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $318.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2018, compared to $312.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $25.4 million compared with Q1 2018 operating cash flow of $16.3 million. Second quarter 2018 capital spending totaled $5.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2018 at $53.5 million, representing 35 days of sales outstanding which was 1 day higher than the 34 days reported above that at the end of the first quarter of 2018, and at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2018 were $128.9 million, up from the $111.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Days of inventory increased to 189 days at the end of Q2 2018 from the 177 days at the end of the first quarter of 2018. The increase in inventory days is due to build up in advance of seasonally high Q3 revenue, changing customer requirements, particularly in automotive, computing and gaming applications, and hedging for potential upside in the second half of 2018. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2018. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $155.5 million to $161.5 million. We are also expecting -- we also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 56.2%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.6% to 56.6%; total stock-based compensation expense at $15 million to $17 million including approximately $500,000 that will be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $52.3 million and $57.3 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $37.8 million to $40.8 million. In anticipation of higher revenue in the next two to three years, we are stepping up investment in our foundry capabilities. We're actively qualifying two 12-inch fabs and are in the process of developing advanced technologies. Other income is expected to be in the range from $600,000 to $1 million before foreign exchange gains and losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 44.0 million to 45.0 million shares before share buyback. We are continuing to execute our long-term business strategy which we believe will maximize long-term shareholder value. I'll now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : [Technical Difficulty]Thanks for letting me ask the question. [Technical Difficulty] I just want to focus in on the auto business a little bit. It\u2019s kind of grown from being your smallest business line to now larger than both comm and industrial. At the analyst day, you guys detailed that you see auto growing in a 40 to 50% CAGR. Auto grew about a 60, 65% CAGR from 2013 to 2017. Is it fair to think of auto growing like at about maybe 40% CAGR going forward through 2021? I guess, how do you guys think about the growth going forward? Bernie Blegen : Sure. At the Analyst Day that was on June 7th, we characterized growth for the next three years of being in the range between 40% to 50% in any given year. And on a quarterly basis, because there's sort of a step function with how revenue increases here that it could be between 30 and 60%. So, I think that you're in the right ballpark for your CAGR. Unidentified Analyst : All right. I appreciate that. And next, I'd like to ask about the inventory dynamics you guys had this quarter. I understand you guys had prepared remarks, but I'd love to hear you guys elaborate a little bit more on this. Inventory is up 39% year-on-year, that's ahead of revenues for actually the sixth straight quarter. Maybe there's some mix dynamic there, I understand with the auto maybe some of your parts have a longer life cycle and maybe require more of a build. But, is there anything else that you'd like to elaborate on why inventories continue to be outgrowing revenues. Bernie Blegen : Actually, you gave a pretty complete answer for me there. In that, we\u2019re\u2026 Michael Hsing : What we really said in earnings, one of those is that we're hedging the potential future growth. And I can give you more color is that we have so many products introduced in the market, they start to ramp. A lot of them we still haven\u2019t seen the revenue yet. And during the ramp, you don\u2019t want you to see any hiccup, either the number of the products or the quantity issues, and we don't have any history of it. And so, we would be very cautious. We use the cash wisely. And in terms of MPS in history, we don\u2019t ride a lot of inventory. And so, if you want talk about inventory, this is how we manage it. And we have a long life cycles. And as long as we see it grow, growth the top line, grow the EPS. I don\u2019t care the rest of it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. Congratulations on the nice results for June, and particularly strong guide for September. I just wanted to start with the September quarter. Is there anything in particular, any one end market where you\u2019re seeing particular strength leading to that guide, or is it pretty broad-based? And I\u2019ve got a couple of follow-ups. Michael Hsing : It\u2019s pretty much of broad-based, all the growth areas we cover, in the last few quarters the story remains same, we\u2019re very -- with the very beginning. And all the product ramping is across the board. Quinn Bolton : Do you guys still feel pretty comfortable with hitting that 8% to 10% share of the server power management market by -- or for all of 2018. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Our expectations for the server market have really have not changed in the 18 months since we started discussing on those terms. We\u2019re seeing very positive results and very good acceptance and continuation of good volume. Quinn Bolton : And I just wanted to ask, some others in the industry have been constrained by the supply of ceramic capacitors and passive devices. And just wondering, if you\u2019ve seen those same constraints. If so, are you doing anything to try to avoid some of those constrains, possibly purchasing passive devices that you can sell as part of your solution to the customers or any thoughts on the supply of passives and whether it\u2019s impacting your business? Michael Hsing : Yes. It does impact our business. And a lot of products ramping are just not as high as we expected. And we\u2019re looking heavily at design around without using the capacitors. Quinn Bolton : And then lastly, for you Bernie, you mentioned the step-up in spending here to qualify two 12-inch boundaries. It sounds like that might be a two to three-year phenomena. Does that take you above the OpEx as a percent of sales in that range of 50% to 60%, or do you still think you can kind of target that 50% to 60% OpEx growth as a percent of revenue growth? Bernie Blegen : I think, for a brief period of time here, and I don\u2019t know how many quarters necessarily that\u2019s going to be. But, while we\u2019re ramping and qualifying the two fabs, we will be beyond what our model is. But we\u2019re very conscious of the need to get operating leverage and return spending down to the 50% to 60% of revenue growth. But, I\u2019d say that probably for the next four to five quarters, maybe six, we\u2019ll probably be above that level. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rick Schafer : I guess, maybe I\u2019ll start off with the ecommerce question, maybe an update on the progress there with that effort. I know, you are already adding some customers. I\u2019m just curious what feedback has been. Maybe if you could quantify what that opportunity looks like for you guys over the next couple of years. I know that\u2019s tough, but put some kind of -- quantify somehow I guess. Give us a TAM, kind of what you -- how you guys look at that? Michael Hsing : Well, I can answer your first question first. The website is up, and it still looks pretty shitty, but we will improve it later. And we do have orders come from our own website. And the programmable modules that we are pushing out there and trajectory -- we cannot even predict, because this is from nothing to something. And we look at the numbers. And in last couple of months, it\u2019s better than I expected. So, we keep evaluating. So, stay tuned. Rick Schafer : Okay. But for now, I assume -- we are keeping it out of the model for now I guess? Bernie Blegen : Yes. We\u2026 Michael Hsing : Yes, keep it out of that model. Bernie Blegen : We kept revenue expectations, maybe conscious effort to keep them low for \u201818 and \u201819. And really, what we're trying to do is get up to speed and what it takes to market and successfully manage the ecommerce experience. And during this time, we will also be adding more products and getting traction with customer acceptance. Rick Schafer : Got it. Then, maybe switch gears to 48 volt core power. I know, in the next couple of years, you guys have talked about 48 volt coming to GPU and CPU. I guess, maybe if you could walk us through what the timing looks like of that? Who you are likely to compete with there? I think GPU probably ramps before CPU. So, maybe what has to happen for that to go? Michael Hsing : Yes. We expect hitting the main stream in the early or mid 2019. And we have been looking at it -- we have been developing that product for last three years. And we see this as an eminent solution for the future of servers. I can't answer who do we compete with, because there is no such a solution out there. And maybe there is a few. And our solution will be hit -- mass produced and easy to use. And we see -- in the last few years, we see we have many design wins. Bernie Blegen : And just to add real quickly, as Michael said that we\u2019ve had this project under development for three years. And I think that there are a couple of data points in the market today that validate the timing of having our solution released in the 2019 was a good set of circumstances for us. We're in the right place at the right time with the 48 volt solution. Rick Schafer : Got it. And then, just a quick clarification question, if I could, on 300 millimeter. Where do you guys stand today? I mean, do you have any design wins on 300 millimeter or is that still on the comm? And then, maybe if you could update us on the ramp of any design wins at 55 or 65 nanometer? Michael Hsing : These are some of the stuff we're hitting the market very, very soon, and I don\u2019t know it is the first shipment or we certainly sampling it. Bernie Blegen : Slightly different development track where the 55 effort will probably have design wins early in 2019 and the 300 millimeter will probably be more out in the 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the very good results and outlook. I wanted to return to the comment about hedging for potential upside in the second half. Is there a particular end market that that's weighted towards? And likewise, would you anticipate a sort of the variability in potential upside to be more of a Q3 event or is there something special in Q4 that we should think about? And then, I have a follow-up, if I can. Bernie Blegen : Yes. I think that as we said on the call that there's really three or four key areas that are driving a lot of our business. And within that what we've tried to do is we're working within a range of expectations for any one of those. And generally, what we\u2019ve done is we've modeled in our revenue expectations the midpoint or below, but we've provided the inventory at the upper end of the range that has been provided to us by the OEM or from the end customer. So, it is really could be any one of the opportunities in computing and storage or automotive in particular where we could experience a pop. William Stein : Thanks, Bernie. I appreciate that. And maybe backing up, you offered initial take on e-commerce. I wonder if there's any change in the customer traction relative to the E Motion product. Michael Hsing : It's a family -- E Motion, a lot of them I see, we are rather selling the ICs and we're selling the total solution. And it is a lot better way, a lot easier way to generating revenues or to service our customers that we learned from -- I learned from the last couple of years. And so, I see this is the same kind of -- ramping [ph] to the same kind of things. Bernie Blegen : And on E Motion, that is starting to ramp very nicely right now, and we've seen a lot of design wins that we have, not just in \u201818 and \u201819 but even \u201820 and \u201821 that we're already going to be benefiting from. So, that is an initiative that we started in earnest about four years ago, and that's how long it takes for these things to ramp, whereas the e-commerce platform and the field programmability offered on it, we're just in the very early stages of that. William Stein : Great. Thanks for that clarification and congrats again on the good results and outlook. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg : Thank you. Congratulations on hitting all those records. First question, the 12-inch fab, I understand the OpEx of top of it. But, how should we think about that impacting your gross margins over time? Because I would think that that could potentially be pretty accretive to your gross margin. Michael Hsing : Yes. Tore, you covered us for a long time and you know that our patterns is that we move from early days to go to 16-inch [ph] and then we go to 8-inch, with the first 8-inch was a 0.35 micron fab. And until these are 180 nanometer fabs, depreciated further, then we moved there. So, each step we move to a new foundry or new advanced fab that it doesn\u2019t impact the margin immediately. And so, those 12-inch fabs are still expensive. But three, four years later, that will be cheaper. So, we just follow our history, we repeat and repeat the same thing. By that time we have the superior technologies and good cost. Tore Svanberg : Very good. And I believe last quarter your ASPs were of sort of in the high single digits. Is there a number you could share with us for this quarter? Bernie Blegen : Not at this point. But what I can tell you is that the ASP delta has a lot to do with our mix of business. And many of these new opportunities that we\u2019re going into have ASPs that are 2, 3 and 4 times what some of our legacy products, particularly in consumer used to be. So, I think that you're going to see missing bias as the higher percent of our businesses is with these newer opportunities. Tore Svanberg : And just last question on automotive, it sounds like there could be some pretty major upside there next -- in the second half of the year. If we think about the confidence you have in the car, so far I think it\u2019s been primarily in lighting and also in some of the USB powers stuff like that. Is there some new incremental content other areas that could come already in the second half of this year? Bernie Blegen : Actually as far as the technology that we\u2019ve introduced in the automotive, it really is centered around the infotainment, the USB-C ports and the body controls. Interesting, the lighting, we\u2019re just at the very early stages of that. And so, over the course of the next 12 months, I think you\u2019re going to see the ramping in the body control and then little bit after that in lighting. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Vecchi with William Blair. Your line is now open. Alex Vecchi : I guess, just moving back to the increased expenses on the fabs. Bernie, you said that was gone for four to six quarters, and you guys just gave a 2021 sort of operating margin target at your analyst day. I assume you\u2019re still -- those targets are still intact and these increased expenses were obviously planned at that point. Bernie Blegen : Yes. What we have been looking to do, and we\u2019ve been sort of trying to provide some soft guidance on both the timing and order of magnitude. And now, we are starting to see those investments translate into the P&L here. But, the overall commitment to manage our core business outside of -- I\u2019m not going to describe these as onetime costs necessarily, but this is a project-related. And those will wind down and that will allow us to get to the targets that we set for ourselves. Michael Hsing : Here we see the opportunity to grow and we will grow in the next two, three years. And we have a lot of opportunity. So, we made a decision, so we are going to increase it. And to increase our expenditures and investments rather to -- in a new fab. So that we don\u2019t have -- we won't have the capacity issues. And the same, I\u2019ll keep our technology advance forward. And just look at last year and early this year, MPS did not have capacity constraint. We grow as normal. So, we spend our money wisely. And as long as we grow -- again, I only care the topline and EPS. I care the rest of it less. Bernie Blegen : And then, as far as characterizing what we provided at the analyst day, those are guidelines. So, for example, in the revenue, we want to be able to grow at 20%. And in this case, with the midpoint of the guidance that we\u2019ve offered for Q3, as well as what we've done in Q1 and Q2, we are several percentage points above that this year. So, you really have to look at the guidelines that we've offered in the business model as sometimes it will be above it, sometimes will be below it. And then, the thing to focus on is we only provide guidance one quarter ahead at a time. Michael Hsing : To be fair, okay, if we grow less, we will spend less. And now, this -- we are accelerating our growth. We cannot grow in the thin air. Alex Vecchi : Understood. Are you guys seeing sort of the seasonality of your business change as you become more broad-based? I mean, obviously, your Q3 is sort of in line with normal seasonal. I know don\u2019t guide Q4. But given some of the upside opportunities you guys have been describing, how should we think about seasonality as we look out into the out year as well? Bernie Blegen : Yes. I\u2019d say that by and large, we are looking to maintain to maintain seasonality, the way we've been historically. Now, having said that, Q1 came in higher, there was a lower step down from Q4 to Q1 than we had experienced. And as a result of that, the increase from Q2 -- from Q1 was also lower than we've historically done by about 3 percentage points. But then, in the guide that we\u2019ve given here for Q3, that's almost right down the middle of how we performed in the past. Michael Hsing : Yes. Our seasonality is changed, in the last year -- as business changed, and also we are in a higher growth period. So, the last year, we had four consecutive -- I think is it right? Four consecutive growth, it never happened since 2004-2005. And so, I can\u2019t tell you what is our seasonality anymore. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Your line is now open. Josh Buchalter : Hi. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the great results again. Firstly, I'd just like to dig a little bit more on the storage and compute bucket. Is there any more granularity you could provide on some of the moving parts within the quarter and maybe the guide, given your large socket wins there? Bernie Blegen : Again, it\u2019s a story of -- we have too many riches, because all of the major product lines that we\u2019ve gone after in the computing and storage are doing very, very well. And in the guide for Q3, that just reflects a continuation. And so, it\u2019s a situation where a lot of the technology that we invested in developing are now coming into the market. So, if you focus on the servers for example, that transition has rolled out almost identical how we expected it. And right now, we don't see any headwinds. In fact it's continuation of tailwinds. Josh Buchalter : And then, you provided an update on E Motion and ecommerce. I was hoping maybe you could provide the same on field programmability. Michael Hsing : No. This is tied together, the ecommerce of course is wider than we do some of the products that are not programmable. And currently, I think that we sell most of the products that is kind of fixed, and because the website was late. And now we have the capability to reprogram the product, reconfigure the product. So, these are the things to me, ecommerce and we -- feel programmable. Bernie Blegen : And I think that as we look at the continuing demands in this area is that we're going to take even larger number of our product catalogue today and reengineer it around field programmability, which offers our customers the best ease of use and time to market. Operator : I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Bernie Blegen : I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter conference call, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

LLC Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Alessandra Vecchi - William Blair & Co. LLC Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Incorporated's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all lines are on a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Bernie Blegen, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter 2018 Monolithic Power Systems' conference call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings included in our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, and Form 10-Q filed on August 2, 2018, both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We'll be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2017, Q2 2018 and Q3 2018 earnings releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Let me start by telling everyone that our Q3 2018 quarterly revenue of $160.0 million established another record for MPS, our fifth high watermark for quarterly revenue in the last six quarters. Likewise non-GAAP gross margin grew 10 basis points sequentially, representing the 12th consecutive quarter MPS' non-GAAP gross margin has either expanded or matched the prior quarter's performance. As expected, we reached the $160 million revenue milestone, reflecting strength in each of our targeted market segments. Q3 revenue for computing and storage, up 64% year-over-year; automotive up 54%; and industrial up 52%. During the quarter, MPS did experience some unexpected softness in high volume consumer-related businesses, especially in the Greater China region. However, we still see high demand for these products and remain optimistic in our prospects for high-end consumer products. We also gained market share in low end communications segment. We will stay opportunistic in these high volume businesses and focus on growing higher margin products. Looking at our revenue by end market. In our computing and storage market, revenue of $47.7 million increased $18.6 million, or 64.2% year-over-year. Growth in the market was broad based when compared to the year ago quarter with all applications, high-end notebooks, cloud computing and storage increasing at rates well above the market average. Computing and storage revenue represented 30% of MPS' third quarter 2018 revenue compared with 23% in Q3 2017. Third quarter 2018 industrial revenue of $24.9 million increased $8.5 million, or 52.1% from the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased sales for applications and power sources, meters and security. This market represented 16% of our total third quarter revenue versus 13% in the prior year. Third quarter automotive revenue of $19.8 million grew $6.9 million, or 53.9% over the same period of 2017 as a result of increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive is MPS' largest TAM opportunity at $7 billion and we are in the early stages of penetrating this market. In the years ahead, we plan to offer a number of new products for applications in body control, lighting, infotainment, ADAS and battery management. Automotive revenue was 12% of MPS' total Q3 2018 revenue compared with 12% for Q3 2017. Third quarter communications revenue of $19.2 million, increased $3.8 million, or 24.6% over the same period 2017. This represents the combination of share gains in our legacy markets and initial ramping in products for the 5G network. Revenue from consumer markets of $48.5 million, decreased $6.8 million, or 12.4% from the third quarter of 2017. Consumer revenue accounted for 30% of our total Q3 revenue compared with 43% in the prior year. While the loss of revenue in these high volume consumer markets is likely a reflection of geopolitical or trade policy changes, we did not lose projects and continued to gain market share. GAAP gross margin was 55.6%, 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2018 and 60 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2017. Our GAAP operating income was $33.5 million compared to $24.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2018 and $23.8 million reported in the third quarter of 2017. For the third quarter of 2018, non-GAAP gross margin was 56.1%, 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2018 and 40 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP operating income was $49.2 million compared to $41.4 million reported in the prior quarter and $38.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2017. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $55.5 million in third quarter compared with $52.7 million in the second quarter of 2018 and $47.0 million in the third quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2018 operating expenses were $40.5 million, up from the $36.9 million we set in the second quarter of 2018 and up from $32.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2017. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, third quarter litigation expenses were $343,000 compared with a $639,000 expense in Q2 of 2018 and a $327,000 expense in Q3 2017. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Total stock compensation including $471,000 charged to cost of goods sold for the third quarter of 2018 was $14.8 million compared with $15.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2018. Switching to the bottom line, third quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $31.6 million, or $0.71 per fully diluted share compared with $0.55 per share in the second quarter of 2018 and $0.54 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $47.3 million, or $1.06 per fully diluted share compared with $0.90 per share in the second quarter of 2018 and $0.84 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2018 were $44.7 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $353.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018 compared to $318.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2018. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $52.2 million compared with Q2 2018 operating cash flow of $25.4 million. Third quarter 2018 capital spending totaled $5.1 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2018 at $59.9 million, or 34 days of sales outstanding compared with $53.5 million or 35 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2018 and the $50.8 million, or 36 days reported in the third quarter of 2017. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2018 were $136.8 million, up from the $128.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2018. Days of inventory decreased to 175 days at the end of Q3 2018 from the 189 days at the end of the second quarter of 2018. Days of inventory are in our new range reflecting changing customer requirements particularly in automotive and computing and our new product introductions. Turning now to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2018. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $151 million to $157 million. We also expect the following, GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 56.2%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.6% to 56.6%; total stock-based compensation expense of $13.5 million to $15.5 million, including approximately $500,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $50.6 million and $55.6 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $37.6 million to $40.6 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; other income is expected to range from $1 million to $1.2 million before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 44.6 million to 45.6 million shares. In conclusion, as expected, we continued to execute according to our plans of diversification in both products and geographical markets. We grew in greenfield segments while gaining share in high-value products in consumer and communications amongst the uncertainty in the market and geopolitical environment. I will now open the phone lines up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open. Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations on a strong set of results with a lot of uncertainty out there. The question that we've been getting the most often is, there's a lot of new content growth and market share gains that are embedded into the long-term forecasts that investors have for your company across a number of businesses. Maybe Michael, you could talk about at a high level how you're progressing there and then just juxtapose that against a lot of concerns about a weaker macro environment. I know that folks have an expectation of 20% growth for your company over the next couple of years and we're just trying to understand the risks associated with that versus the opportunities for share gains. Thank you. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: All right, okay. As you know, MPS, we're not in a position to answer what the macro position is and we only heard from you guys. And we have a very small percentage of market share, particularly in those greenfield market segments such as auto, in data centers as well as the industrial side. And we have a very little market segment. Those segments should be relatively immune to what the market condition is and we expect it to grow according to our plan, and the next few years we are all set. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think one-point to add to that is that, we're continuing to be very aggressive as far as securing new design wins. And that as we said in our prepared comments, that while there has been a downturn that's reflected most in our consumer business, we didn't lose market share, in fact we continue to make gains. Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: No. That commentary is really, really helpful. And I guess, as a follow up, I've spent a decent amount of time with my team digging into the programmable aspect of many of your solutions as you sort of bring programmability into the portfolio. Michael, maybe you could talk a little bit about at a high level, what percentage of the products that you're shipping now and winning designs with, and then I guess second, winning designs with are programmable in nature today, and how you might see that trend going forward and what that might mean for market share? Thank you. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: All right. Okay. At this point, still probably single-digit percentage of our total revenues and we expect to quadruple in the next couple of years. And probably, most likely in the four or five years and a 100% of our products will be programmable. Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. No, that's really helpful and I'll jump back into queue, if you don't mind. My congratulations and well done. Cheers. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. I'll add my congratulations guys on a nice quarter. So maybe obviously auto and industrial, each up 50% plus in the quarter. I think the auto business is .tracking to something north of $80 million this year. Mostly it's been infotainment, and I think now you're starting to see lighting and motor control start to ramp. Maybe you could walk us through what that next leg of growth there looks like. I know Michael you talk a lot about having two, three years of really solid visibility there. I'm curious as ADAS and BMS wins ramp, kind of, a, what the timeline looks there and then what we could see for a margin impact? I guess when would we start to see sort of a noticeable margin impact within that auto business? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Even as I talk about infotainment, we still scratch the surface. We just start to periphery and as we just went through the auto business, the deep dive in the auto segments and we're just starting that. Even in those \u2013 in the infotainment. And for next couple of years, and we have all these products in designing such as the lighting, including headlights and also as Bernie said earlier, the body controls (19:04) models and any kind of moving pieces in a car. We have electronic control and we have those product design. In ADAS, I see it in three years out and all these activities and we have to pick and choose which product we want to do and we just don't have enough people and our name is out, our product reputation is out and we are proven to be a quality supply. And so the margin will stay the same as now or even be higher. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And maybe switching gears to e-commerce. I know it's something that I think a lot of people care about with you guys. Maybe start with any customer feedback or what the feedback has been from customers so far. I know you've talked about adding hundreds of customers there. I know you've also talked about I believe first revenues or material revenues sort of in 2020. I guess I'm curious, do smaller customers that e-commerce would be targeting, I mean do they need to go through a full call, like some of your more established larger customers? And I guess what I'm getting at is could we see revenues in e-commerce kind of pull forward? Could we see those start to hit before 2020? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Very possible, particularly those are smaller customers in industrial shops. They buy 10,000 to 20,000 units a year. And those are the ones \u2013 those are the customers in a \u2013 if we have \u2013 if we prove to be a quality supply, and they will stay with us for years and so those ones just starting now. So in terms of how their feedback is, so far our website still \u2013 it's not \u2013 we still have a lot more to do and particularly in the e-commerce market segments and how do we do digital marketing and we start to do it this year and early next year. You will see some significant changes. In terms of the current feedback, so far we hand them a floppy disk and they download it \u2013 almost every one of them, they're very happy. They want to see more these type of products and, well, I can't say every one of them and we have in recent months we gain a few, more than a few hundred customers and most of them said they wanted this kind of a product. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And have you seen any competitive response from some of the larger HPA guys? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think (22:37) we address the very segment in the market and we don't see any other players and that they do a similar thing as we do. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks a lot, Michael. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Congratulations again on the very steady execution. Michael, Bernie, just wanted to sort of address, I guess one of the biggest investor fears I hear is kind of the order rates declining in China region. Can you give us any sense whether those order rates which sound like they started to decline late summer, whether that stabilized or are they still sort of on a downward trend and maybe just address the sort of where you are in terms of starting backlog looking into the fourth quarter of 2018, I think the last few quarters you'd gotten in to the quarter with nearly 100% of plan in backlog and then maybe a couple of product follow-ups? Thanks. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. I think that you can see from the Q3 numbers that, and again the comments that we referenced that in the Greater China market that we did see a downturn in demand, particularly for consumer and so as a result of that, we are sort of monitoring to see if that branches out into our other end markets or if there are any changes in ordering pattern. You referenced also our last three quarters as far as what our experience has been with backlog going into the quarter, and in fact what we've seen in this quarter is that we've sort of returned to a more normalized level where we're not at the accelerated pattern that we've been experiencing previously but is really again return to a more normalized backlog for this time in the quarter. So it's something that we have to continue to monitor and certainly as there are different developments, we have demonstrated the ability to respond to that. But I think the thing that is most encouraging for us is that the targeted areas that we focused on, again the automotive, the computing and storage and the industrial, where they have long ordering visibility that those remain very solid and that we're just seeing gains that are significantly better than market. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. And then maybe Michael, could you just address, you know, as we look into the end of 2018 and 2019, Intel will be launching their Cascade Lake platform by the end of the year, and then the new Whitley or Cooper Lake platform, maybe second half of 2019. I know Pearly (25:50) was a big uptick for you in terms of server content. How do you feel about your position with Cascade Lake and Whitley or Cooper Lake over the next 12 months? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think that we \u2013 I expected that I think we grow just \u2013 we don't expect it to have anything different, again, in all the designing activity and all the new product release and we expected that same as the last couple of quarters and I think, we even grow faster. Then most of revenue in this world in the next 2019, all the way through 2022. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: So a steady \u2013 sort of a steady ramp in server power management over that 2019 to 2022 timeframe? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes. And the others in a similar way rate of before. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Quinn? Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Oh, go ahead, Bernie. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: No. I was going to say that what you were referencing is that Intel has been adjusting their product release schedule around a couple of different issues. And obviously, that's something we need to adapt to. We don't see it as a negative to or an impediment to the growth that Michael is referring to. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I care less about couple of... Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: ...plus/minus, a couple of quarters. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And that's out of our controls but the direction of growth and we cover not only from traditional servers, all these new AR systems and the new type of servers, we cover all of them. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi guys. Congrats on the resultant guide in this tough environment. Just wanted to get into the inventory in the channel side and dovetail that into the backlog question that was asked a bit ago here. Well, Bernie you said that the backlog coverage has returned to normal. Over the course of this year, correct me if I'm wrong, but have you guys been shipping to the elevated backlog? Have you been controlling it? And where does channel inventory stand today? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. So, in the reference that you're talking to is between Q1 and Q2 that we'd actually had a decline in terms of channel inventory, in terms of days and as we look ahead here both as far as how we finished Q3 and in Q4, a lot of the sales commitments that we have for both quarters are related to commitments that were made upwards of four to six months ago. And so, we are continuing to deliver against that but with the amount of uncertainty that is in the market, the timing of when that gets drawn from the channel is a little bit changed. And so, we went up a little bit in Q3. And I don't know, I don't have a forecast for how Q4 is looking, whether they'll go up or down a little bit. But again it's something that we have to continue to monitor. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I guess similarly to that, as the backlog falls, the fear people have for the whole market and companies like yourself is, what goes from 100% coverage plus to something that's normal, then the next step is a further step down. I know you guys have a great secular trend over the course of a number of years, but how do you guys mitigate that risk as we look into say the first half of next year? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, okay. The inventories (30:09) questions now, Ross. We have a lot of growth in the new market segments and it changes the pattern how we do inventories in auto, industrials and telecom. Now the 5G networks, although the revenue is small they'll start to ramping and also the \u2013 as well as the data centers and the cloud computings. We really need a lot of inventory to cover the ramp. And regarding all these traditional high volume business and those businesses we can go in or out within half years, so we're not worried about the inventory. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: So we're basically prepared to be able to service the targeted markets and we believe that as you look at the first half of 2019 that they are less impacted by the price sensitivities that might occur as a result of the tariffs or geopolitical trade policies. And then as Michael just said, that on the areas that are more affected, we have the ability to course correct and as we demonstrated in Q3 even within the quarter, to be able to achieve our revenue goals. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes, high inventory, I will say again is my favorite now, okay, high inventory in a company like the MPS, we have to build a reputation, regardless of the condition we'll ship and we will ship our product and that we are \u2013 we're the newcomer. We have a record of reliability as well as a continuation of delivery. We never have that kind of problem. Any one glitch that caused a lot more problems, a much bigger market cap hit than a few million dollars being a few days of inventory. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I guess as my last question, as you guys look back to the last cycle and kind of late 2015 and early 2016, there was barely a blip for MPS, you still in 2016 grew I think 16%, 17% year-over-year way above the analog market as a whole. If you just compare and contrast the positioning of MPS today versus what it was looking like back three years ago, can you just walk through some of the puts and takes as you see it? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. I think that obviously with all of the new product releases that we've had that really started to ramp beginning in the second half of 2017 and now we are in full swing. We have a much different portfolio that we're able to manage. And so, from that regard, I think that the diversification both in terms of products and markets and geographies, allows us an awful lot of flexibility that we didn't have back at the second half of 2015. Having said that, I would hate to try and draw a parallel between 2015, which ended up being a rather short-term and pretty much an issue specific to the semiconductor industry and what we're observing today. I don't think that people have enough visibility or confidence as to how long this current environment might last. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Congrats, guys. Thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to make sure I understand the sort of the narrative around end markets and demand trends. So consumer came in light as customers backed off orders in that end market that you think is attributable to tariffs. But you made up more than the difference in the comms' end market. I want to make sure I have that right and also understand better about what drove that upside in comms, is that something that perhaps if the consumer end market would have been fine, that you would have posted meaningful upside to the quarter or was this something that sort of came and surprised you to the upside or was there a lot of extra work that it took to drive this to allow you to deliver good results as you usually do? Helping me understand that would be great. Thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Will. There's a couple of observations. If you look at consumer sequentially from Q2 to Q3, this was a lower increase than we historically experience, and it was fairly broad-based as far as the number of areas that were impacted. Interestingly that's in traditional consumer or high value consumer end markets, we actually performed pretty well. And then as far as the ability to course correct within a quarter even with relatively short lead time, we play opportunistically in a lot of different markets. And historically, we have not taken on the comms business. This is referring to our legacy gateway and router business because it tends to be lower margin. And in this quarter, we were able to really just pivot. So it was not a lot of effort in order to be able to accept opportunities that we have an opportunity to quote on and bring that in within the quarter. So as I look ahead, I think the most encouraging thing is that we can have that opportunity. We see the comms business is actually lining up in very good shape for Q4. But I think one of the most encouraging things that might have been a slight upside surprise is that we started to see some very initial sales on the 5G side. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: The comm business as in the last few quarters, we are flat or slightly down. And so we have refresh, okay, and we're getting some market shares. But there's a significant portion of it, we see the 5G network and start to ramp. And those product we're designing back in a couple of years ago. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: A follow up, if I can. When people ask about what's perhaps something that investors don't understand about Monolithic, one of the answers I've heard you give is that well consensus for next year is up 16% and we think long-term growth is at 20%. Would you still endorse a 20% growth number for 2019 or would you think that's too optimistic given the geopolitical and other risks? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think that \u2013 we will clearly beat whatever your forecast is for the next year industrial growth, okay. We will beat it by 15 points or higher. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think that when we look at next year as far as our confidence in 20%, that remains very consistent and solid. Again, one of the things that we want to be known for is our consistency of execution. And that, we can support that again with the amount of visibility we have particularly in these targeted areas that have the longer design cycles and longer ordering patterns. Now having said that, we're not immune to the macro and certainly in the first half of the year, we feel reasonably confident that we have the shots on goal to be successful. We don't have clear visibility on how that's going to play out in the early stages of the year. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the record operating margin. A few questions here. So, first of all, I know you have some operations in China and certainly, your supply chain is there, any changes to that strategy at all? I mean, I know it's really early days, right? But just given some of the macro political turmoil, any changes to the thinking at all about your operations in China at this point? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: When we have diversified, and we have a lot of resources from \u2013 in China. But we started \u2013 two years ago we started diversify in the different political regions. And in terms of R&D, mostly on these development jobs and all these other geopolitical issues and that is out of our controls, if we see the one region down, the other region is up, okay, and that's the area we really want to focus on and diversify on our presence. Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And, Tore \u2013 go ahead. Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No, no, go ahead. Finish the answer, yeah. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, I was just going to say that on the supply chain issues right now, Michael's exactly right. We don't have control or visibility as far as what the next steps in the process. And again, to the extent that we diversify in the end markets that we sell into and the different customers we have, we would probably adapt similar profile longer term for our supply chain as well. Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's very fair. And a question on 5G. So you're starting to see some revenue contribution there. Is that power management that's based on Intelli-phase or QSMod just like in the data center market or are these different types of power products? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And other types of product in a different network segment. And as well, it's what you said that it is based on the Intelli-phase. And those products in a high-powered computing segment hub of 5G. Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good. And I think you may have already answered this question, Michael, but as far as your lead times, since you obviously are so focused on making sure the deliveries are there, I assume your lead times are still very stable. They were stable in the first half. They're stable now? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes. The lead times are very stable. Bernie can add on, okay. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. We've had no change in the lead times in all phases of production, whether it's wafer packaging test. Everything is going very consistently. Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good. Just one last question, you generated almost $50 million in free cash flow this quarter. I mean, I know sort of your approach to capital management, but just kind of based on where the stock price is, any thought about how to put that free cash flow to use? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Well, either we're going to increase the dividend or looking for some technology company to acquire. So, I'm not going to buy another company for revenue increase. Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. Congratulations again on all the record results this quarter. Thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alessandra Vecchi with William Blair. Your line is now open. Alessandra Vecchi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi guys, congratulations on a great quarter. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Alex. Alessandra Vecchi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Just to go in a little bit more on the consumer side and the weakness you've been seeing there, I think historically you guys have said that of your consumer revenue about 50% of it is traditional, I think 30% of it's high value and 20% of it's gaming. Are you seeing the weakness in gaming as well or is it only in that 50% traditional bucket, and if it's in the traditional bucket, should we consider the whole 50% weak or is only parts of that? Just sort of trying to quantify where consumer could go from here given that seems to be the one bucket that's the most at risk in the short term. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, I hate to say that in the last couple of times when we talked about gaming, our customer is not happy, okay. And one time I said it wasn't my favorite topic and our customer heard that too so really it's my \u2013 there is a lot of money to be made with 100% of support. But here is the \u2013 for that we got and we see high volumes in \u2013 we're not talking about what kind of gaming, okay. And then we see a bit softness in these high volume ones, and other than that and we see the connected devices or the IoT if you will, okay. And the variety of other gadgets and we see in our designing, we see the market demand still very similar. Alessandra Vecchi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then similarly just in terms of the Q4, you guys traditionally don't give us any sort of granularity on the directional segment or the direction of the different segments. But if you had to save on the segment from Q4, what's strongest to weakest. Should we still think about computing and storage as the strongest and then maybe industrial and optical or how has that shifted? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, again, I think if you look at the results, clearly what we saw in computing and storage, automotive, industrial, those weren't onetime drivers. This is all about the secular expansion that we've been discussing now for several years and we're now seeing the results come in full term. And so I don't see anything in the outlook that would indicate a diminution of those growth rates. And then as far as how we manage the margin with the consumer, that's something that we're adept at being able to do. So I think that as we look at Q4, we feel very confident not just in the number in total, but also the individual markets as far as we're going to source that growth. Alessandra Vecchi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Understand. That's very helpful. Okay. I think that's it for me. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Alex. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Just first question with regard to inventory levels. Can you talk about what your visibility is both to the distribution channel and to OEM inventories? And I know that through the year you guys have been taking steps to try to discourage customers, prevent customers from building excess inventory. Could you speak to some of those actions and your level of visibility and confidence in the inventory levels? Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, my favorite question. Inventories, I tried to convince you all of you guys, okay, it's good for us to increase. And now I think we are pretty normal. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And then as far as inventory in the channels, again, I'd just refer to an earlier response is that, in the prior three quarters we had experienced a pattern of over ordering and this is reflected in higher than normal historic backlog levels at certain points in the quarter. And while we've seen a moderation of that, that is changed because there is a certain level of uncertainty, and we want to make sure that we're really satisfying real demand as opposed to creating a problem for us down the road. Now, having said that, with the channel and we did a very thorough assessment of it at the end of Q3 as well as what we expect to be the sell through in Q4. And that all got taken into account as we gave our guidance for Q4 in total. So right now, we were feeling that we're getting timely feedback and we're managing it accordingly. Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, great. And I guess just following on from that. Could you talk about what you consider to be normal seasonal patterns in Q1? And I know there's not a lot of visibility right now and that you're probably doing a lot of work on that. But are there any aspects that we should take into consideration with regard to Q1 based on what you're seeing right now? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. We only provide guidance one quarter ahead. And so, I don't want to overreach with any comment. But if you traditionally looked at with the exception of last year which was an unusual set of circumstances because we had greenfield opportunities particularly in the compute and storage that were introduced, that we've traditionally had a step down from Q4 to Q1 of between 3% to 4%. Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we do have follow up from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey. Bernie, you kind of addressed it in answering Chris' question, but just I guess I wanted to ask specifically, as you look into your distribution channels. I think there's especially in uncertain environments, a tendency for the distributors to reduce their inventories into calendar year-end. And so I guess when you look at your fourth quarter forecast, you said you took into account sort of the supply chain in the disti channel. Are you expecting them to reduce their days of inventory in the fourth quarter? Or do you expect them to sort of keep a constant days inventory on hand, any guidance you could provide us would be helpful? Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, the formula sort of works that the channel tries to reduce the dollar value of inventory in Q4. But the denominator as far as the quarterly revenue in Q4 is less than Q3. So, my expectation is that the dollars will be at or below the Q3 level and the days may be at or maybe even a little above in Q4 and that's really a arithmetic exercise rather than anything that we're concerned about. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I show no further questions in queue so I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bernie Blegen for closing remarks. Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call. And I look forward to talking to you again in our fourth quarter conference call, which will likely be in February. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, and Form 10-Q filed on November 2, 2018, both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We'll be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q4 2017, Q3 2018 and Q4 2018 earnings releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. I'd like to begin today's comments with the two highlights of what was a very successful year for MPS. For the full year 2018, MPS achieved record revenue of $582.4 million, 23.7% higher than revenue from 2017. So $111 million increase in year-over-year revenue was the largest annual gain in the company's history. The 23.7% annual increase was the highest growth rate for MPS since the company redirected its focus in 2010 to the industrial, cloud computing, automotive and high-end consumer markets. Although we cannot escape the current macro-economic conditions, we see momentum in these segments continuing strong for the next several years. This was the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. 2018 was a significant year for MPS. On the technology front we widened our lead with BCD 5 solidly in volume production and with the development of BCD 6, a 55 nanometer process designed on a 12 inch wafer. Both of these advancements will significantly increase our product functionality, improve energy efficiency, reduce our solution size, ease our customers adoption efforts and keep our product cost competitive. In addition, we were increasing production capacity both in 12 inch and 8 inch wafer in anticipation of future revenue growth. On the customer front, MPS penetrated a number of new Tier 1 companies in the automotive and cloud server markets, generating initial and meaningful revenue. More importantly, we are co-developing next generation products with a number of these Tier 1 companies that will revolutionalize their industries. We expect these partnerships to drive substantial technological advancements and represent an important source of MPS's future revenue growth. A few examples include, developing specific leading edge system solutions, using QSMod technologies for GPU based artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, using MPS's 48 volt QSMod Technology for both cloud based and automotive applications, working with automotive companies to develop specific solutions for smart driving systems and unique lighting applications with a 2020 target for market introduction. Developing in mechanical relay replacement servicing the IoT and automotive markets, using MPS's high current high density process technology for improve reliability in a compact form. And we completed the integration of high current programmable power modules for communications application such as 5G networks. The target market applications for these modules are base stations and switchers, which require compact and reliable solutions. In addition to these exciting core development projects, 2018 was important as we launched our e-commerce website allowing engineers to design their own customized solutions from their desktop. This catalog of programmable solutions will greatly enhance our customer's time to market, lower their total cost of ownership and optimize the efficiency of their designs. Now let's look at our full year 2018 revenue by market segment compared with 2017. Computing and storage up 57.9%, automotive up 48.6%, industrial up 40.7% and communications revenue up 11.8%, consumer revenue was down 3.0%. Full year computing and storage revenue grew $58.3 million to $159.1 million in 2018. This increased primarily reflected strong sales growth for cloud computing, SSD storage, high-end notebooks and initial GPU power management sales. Computing and storage revenue represented 27.3% of MPS's total revenue in 2018, compared with 21.4% in 2017. Automotive revenue grew $26.2 million to $80.1 million in 2018. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive represented 13.8% of MPS's full year 2018 revenue compared with 11.4% in 2017. Industrial revenue grew $25.6 million to $88.5 million in 2018. This growth reflected sales for applications in power sources, security and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented 15.2% of MPS's full year 2018 revenue compared with 13.4% in 2017. Communications revenue grew $7.0 million to $70.6 million. This improvement was primarily due to higher sales of our legacy home router and wireless gateway products. More importantly, though, we see initial ramping in the 5G market segment. Communications revenue represented 12.1% of our 2018 revenue compared with 13.5% in 2017. Switching to Q4, while we started to see the impact of macroeconomic headwinds in Q4, MPS still had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $153.5 million, 4.0% lower than revenue generated in the third quarter of 2018 that's 18.6% higher than the comparable quarter of 2017. By market segment revenue for industrial grew 66.6% over the same period of 2017. Computing and storage grew 63.2% and automotive grew 40.2%. Communications revenue - communications grew 27.1%, due primarily to increase revenue from MPS's legacy home router and wireless gateway products. Fourth quarter revenue for consumer fell 25.9% from the prior year. MPS experienced continued weakness in high volume consumer related businesses, with especially the soft demand in the Greater China region. In the fourth quarter, MPS continue to see strong design win momentum. However, many customers concerned about the economic outlook and trade policies delayed their production ramps for new products in automotive, computing and industrial which resulted in a less desirable sales product mix. As a result, fourth quarter 2018 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.6% 50 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2018 and 10 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP operating income was $46.6 million compared to $49.2 million reported in the prior quarter and $38.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2018 GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, 50 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2018, but 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. Our GAAP operating income was $33.1 million compared to $33.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2018 and $25.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $51.5 million in the fourth quarter compared with $55.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $46.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2018 operating expenses were $38.7 million, down from the $40.5 million we spent in the third quarter of 2018 and up from the $33.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. On both the GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter litigation expenses were $409,000 compared with $343,000 expense in Q3 2018 and a $340,000 expense in Q4 2017. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed are stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Total stock compensation expense including $504,000 charged to cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $14.8 million compared with $14.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2018. Switching to the bottom line, fourth quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $27.6 million or $0.61 per fully diluted share compared with $0.71 per share in the third quarter of 2018 and $0.27 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $44.6 million or $0.99 per fully diluted share compared with $1.06 per share in the third quarter of 2018 and $0.82 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2018 were $45.1 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $380.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $353.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018. For the quarter MPS generated operating cash flow of about $47.6 million compared with Q3 2018 operating cash flow of $52.2 million. Fourth quarter 2018 capital spending totaled $4.5 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2018 at $55.2 million or 33 days sales outstanding compared with a $59.9 million or 34 days reported at the end of the third quarter of 2018 and the $38.0 million or 27 days reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 were $136.4 million, down slightly from the $136.8 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Days of inventory rose to 180 days at the end of Q4 2018 from the 175 days at the end of third quarter of 2018. I would now like to turn to the outlook. First, MPS is announcing a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.30 per share for shareholders of record as of March 29, 2019. We are forecasting Q1 2019 revenue in the range of $138 million to $144 million. We also expect the following. GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.8% to 55.4%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.3% to 55.9%, total stock-based compensation expense of $17.6 million to $19.6 million, including approximately $600,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $55 million and $59 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $38 million to $40 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Our income is - our other income is expected to be in the range of $1.4 million to $1.6 million before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 44.7 million to 45.7 million shares. In conclusion, despite uncertainty in the macro economy, we expect to continue winning market share in the cloud computing, automotive and telecommunications market. We believe the future is bright. I will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Hi guys. Congrats on the solid execution. Michael or Bernie, just wanted to get your view on the macro environment. You guys have a lot of company specifics where you can take share, but you're not immune the tide is rising or if it's falling like it is right now. So any color on the linearity of demand you saw and how you view 2019 growth potential relative to what the overall market is doing versus what sort of incremental share gains you guys can take in any number of product areas where you have new design wins? Michael Hsing : Ross, okay, so good question. All the MPS's growth is from the new product and then - you in the new market segment that Bernie mentioned the automotive and industrials and computing. And in later - in especially in the Q4 last year we see slowing down dramatically. And we asked around our customers and all due to the - it seems to me is all due to the economy uncertainty in the futures. And however in the middle of all of these we see not all the product though stopped, and delayed that their introductions. But some of their end product still introduced or still we have a replacement we gave some market shares. And in 2019 we still expect to grow and we'll have very healthy years, but the percentage - the growth whether the same as the last couple years that we cannot tell. Bernie Blegen : And if I could add to that Ross, that what we're observing, again, only from our specific position is that the design wins are in place, our end customers are interested in going to market, but there's just not the right conditions for them to invest in that type of new product ramp. And so, I don't have any view as far as how long this will last for when we start to see the improvements come around. But I do - I believe very confidently that we're well positioned to take full advantage of that turnaround. Ross Seymore : Thanks for all that color. I guess, as my follow-up just on the inventory side, I know you guys have talked about increasing your own internal inventory to be ready for those ramps. So, I guess, a two part question, one is, is that still the case or should that inventory come down if those ramps continue to be delayed? And then two, could you give us an update on what the channel inventory situation is and what your expectations are for that as well? Michael Hsing : Ross I like that question. The inventory I think we see it there's a lag. Clearly it is very valid. And in this kind of a transitional market conditions we watch very carefully. So that's why I like that question. And of course there's a delay and we see if it's - of course demand is slowing down, we control our - the inventory will come down can we control very highly. Now Bernie you can answer a more on the numbers. Bernie Blegen : On the second side of that question as far as how the channel performed is what we do is we fill orders based upon our customer demand and that's 90% distributor related. And then, the distributors are creating that demand with those orders on us based on the information they're getting from their customers. And the slowdown occurred during the quarter, so we ended up in a position where the - in terms of both dollars and days that the channel inventories did increase and managing that going forward some of the management of that is reflected in our guidance for Q1. Ross Seymore : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. I'll apologize because I missed most of the prepared comments, but obviously a slightly weaker guide from March. Just wondering as you look into the full year you typically see a much stronger second and third quarter in terms of seasonality, is there any reason to think some of the near-term effects you've seen that are hitting Q1 extend into Q2, Q3 or should we be thinking about a more traditional seasonal pattern as we get out to the June and September quarters? Bernie Blegen : Yes, I think when we responded to Ross on this is that we really don't have good visibility, there's a lot of uncertainty relative to the out quarters. So when we look more short-term at Q1 even - let me go back to our Q4 for a second. We've put up some very significant numbers in all of our groups except for consumer, which was most price sensitively impacted by trade and tariffs and the macro particularly in Greater China. So the point that we also observed is that a lot of the new product ramps that our customers were building expectations around have been pushed out in this period in time. And so, it's hard for us to say concretely how that's going to affect our overall growth rate for the year or when do we expect a turnaround to begin. Quinn Bolton : Okay, great. And then just a second question again I'll apologize. Did you sort of give a backlog number, I think you for most of the past three, four years you tended to be at 80 or so percent of guidance in backlog started in the quarter. Are we in that metric range for the March quarter? Bernie Blegen : Yes, we are. Quinn Bolton : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Yes, thanks and nice result in a tough environment guys. I guess, I was hoping to understand gross margin at least in the near-term just a little better I know it's obviously softer. I mean, is the primary driver that's just simply mix. I mean, I would have assumed a better mix in 1Q, but are we - Bernie, if you could provide maybe a little more color there what your expectations are by segment maybe it almost seems like consumer is going to be a bigger contributor to mix in the first quarter. And then, the second part of that question is just how fast - if you guys can give any color on how fast that gross margin might rebound? Bernie Blegen : Sure. So when we look at Q4 let's just start with that. That was clearly mix, because when you look at the influx of revenue into the communications that was predominantly lower margin business and we discussed that in Q3 as well. So the continuation is the same. But then you had some of our high margin and it was pretty broad based. For example SSD, power management for GPUs and a couple of things in industrial that underperformed expectations. And so as a result, those are very high margin and it was - the offset was against lower margin business and that accounted for the 50 basis points. When we look at Q1, we still have some overhang of mix issues. It's not all of it. And even though we don't have a specific number, we are anticipating that we will need to look at our inventory provisions in a different light with lower demand. Again, we've talked in the past that our inventory has a long shelf life and we believe that all the products are ultimately going to be sellable. But the mechanic of how we determine our inventory provision is based upon near-term demand. And that may not support or may support a higher inventory provision. And as far as looking forward, I don't have guidance beyond, but obviously with the new products that when they start to ramp as Michael was describing. Those will contribute very positively and immediately to our gross margin. Michael Hsing : What foresee going forward if all the new product delays and okay and the margin will stay as close as of now. We don't see a dramatic change. Well, dramatic change is all relative and now we have 0.5% change look it is pretty small to me. And - but we analyze it and that is against our very consistent result in last four, five quarters and that is due to the mix. And all the new product, new revenue high quality revenue gets delayed. And going forward we expect to grow the gross margin very consistently as the economy recovered. Rick Schafer : Got it. Thanks for all that color. And then just shifting gears quickly to server, you've talked I know in the past about the potential server content for you guys around 50 today, but going to 70 next year. And I'm just curious, because you were talking about 48 volt in your prepared remarks. How much of that 50 to 70 captures any content gains associated with 48 volt core power market share for gains for you guys? I mean is 48 volt a material content driver for MPS? Michael Hsing : Yes. We actually expected in Q1 2019 and obviously it's actually number is a much smaller I'm like I mean we - so all - actually as we see it, it's not in the first half anyway will be in the second half of 2018 in early part of 2020. Rick Schafer : Got it, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Great, thanks for taking my question. Based on the backlog and the order patterns would you expect or I should say it seems to me that we'd expect lower than maybe typical seasonality heading into Q2. Is that the right way to think about the model given that you maybe you sort of started seeing this weakness a little bit later than others and seems to be at least a couple quarters of weakness for what everyone else is seeing? Bernie Blegen : Yes, I don't see there being a quick catalyst that would create a quick turnaround. So I think while we only guide one quarter ahead that I could support that thesis. William Stein : Okay. And then as it relates to inventory Bernie, I think you mentioned that channel inventory on days and dollars were up again in the quarter. Does your guidance for Q1 combined with what you let's say expect to sell through? Would that support lower dollars and days at the end of Q1 or something different? Bernie Blegen : It's more likely that we will have been down in dollars, but probably close to flat in days because you have a smaller denominator. William Stein : Great, thanks, Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Thank you, Will. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you and congratulations on the record year. I'll start here from the macro stuff and I'm pretty interested in BCD 6. Could you elaborate a little bit more what that means for products going forward? I mean, you talked about 55 nanometer and 12 inch wafers, but any other color you could add? Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. These are - actually as usual. With every other years and every year we introduce, we develop a newer technologies and that is really our foundation for the future of growth. And so the BCD 6, we said BCD 5 we including memories and now we will include much denser logics. And so now we mentioned - Bernie, mentioned it is a 55 nanometers and we will have those type of logics design. So you can think of that way. We really put entire systems almost single chip, which means we included the microcontroller. And that will give access to lot more market segments and lot more capability. Bernie Blegen : And then from simply a cost point of view, there is a lower unit cost involved with this process and this geometry and how we choose to deploy that cost advantage will basically depend upon the end market. So for example in consumer that will extend our ability to be price competitive in other markets it'll allow us to improve our gross margins and in others still it'll make us able to with the technological advantage to compete in markets that we hadn't previously been able to enter into. Tore Svanberg : Thank you for that color. And also you mentioned obviously e-commerce and your website up and running last year. Could you give us some color on how the feedback has been so far, how the learning curve going for customers. Michael Hsing : Yes, we - yes you call a website. Yes, up and running. But I said we're still learning. As expected actually, this is the very new frontier to everybody it's an - nobody attempted that before. And we still try to figure out why the - when we give the floppy disk it is a lot more effective than we go through a website. So we still try to figure out, there's something obviously is not quite right. But the product itself when we give a traditional ways and give them all the tools and give them CDs and give them download the program everybody likes that. And we see more and more customers would rather use a fixed product and then they choose a programmable parts and they're going - we see a clear direction. And - but how effectively using the website, we're still trying to figure out. Tore Svanberg : Very good, one last question. Yes, go ahead, Bernie. Bernie Blegen : I just wanted to caution that I think we've tried to set our expectations around the fact that we would have zero revenue in 2018, zero revenue in 2019 that's not entirely true because we are generating revenue. But then, we'll have a good slow ramp in 2020 and 2021 and it's really 2022 is when we expect it to contribute materially. Michael Hsing : Are you talking about the e-commerce? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Michael Hsing : Yes. And that's strictly sales through a website. And now we see the early - actually we do see some revenues, some meaningful revenues. But in terms of a programmable site and why people just don't use the online tools whether the online tools are not good enough or whether have ordering pattern where that's too difficult for them to order. And in that respect, we haven't generated any revenues on a programmable parts revenue from our website. Tore Svanberg : Now that's very fair. Just one last question. You mentioned communications coming back, it sounds like that's more kind of your legacy business. Should we assume that the new 5G products will kind of get the gross margin going again and the communications revenue? Michael Hsing : Absolutely. As I said in - I remember the last year some quarters and I think it's Q2 I mentioned that and we will get some communication revenues and we see the opportunities. And it's even though a lower margin, but is good dollars. And the same time I mention I haven't given up as on the higher margin communications. Once we introduce the right product and we did have it in the - we did have in last year and we just haven't just released it. And now we designed it and when 5G happens we will be on the way. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Thank you again for the color. Michael Hsing : All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open. Matthew Ramsay : Thank you, good afternoon. Bernie, I wondered if you - I guess this is maybe a little bit of a different way to ask Rick's question from earlier around mix in gross margins, but maybe perhaps you could give us a little bit of color by division about how you're thinking a sequential growth or decline in the different business units might be going into Q1. I think that would be helpful. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Yeah sure. When we look at mix obviously the traditional way to sort of view it is that consumer is lower and also the legacy comps business is on the lower end. And just as far as the transition from Q4 to Q1 we've guided at about flat gross margin, but the mix is less bad in Q1 than in Q4 because we continue to see growth in our computing and automotive. And then there's some declines in industrial and that you have to have as a backdrop that industrial has the last two quarters really outperformed any of its historic patterns. So that's not coming as a total surprise. And then you have consumer that's doing a little bit of an exaggerated step down from Q4 to Q1. So that's really the mix that we're looking at is computing and automotive are continuing to perform - outperform expectations. And we've got some declines or exposure to both high end low margin opportunities. Matthew Ramsay : Got it, that's helpful on the mix. I guess, if we look forward in the computing and storage business, if you could remind us again about exactly the mix and exposure to the computing side and the storage side. It seems like there's some catalysts on obviously on the computing side from a share perspective and 48 volt, but this has been a pretty ugly environment on the storage side from a macro perspective. So some update on the mix and how you're thinking about those two different segments there recovering as we go through the year would be helpful? Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Sure, so storage is a significant part of our business, but it's declined as a percent only because it hasn't grown at the same rate as what we've seen on the compute side. And there was - if you look at last year 2018 SSD in particular ramped very early and sustained that growth all the way through the mid-part of Q3 before starting to decline. In that area I see sort of a stabilization and currently storage if you look at Q4 for example is about a third of that line item. Then when you look at the computing, obviously we've had significant run up in our server and workstation. So that's in an elevated level. And then, as we were talking about earlier is that some initial sales related to GPUs are falling off as that market or those customers take a pause. Matthew Ramsay : Thanks for the color. I appreciate it. Bernie Blegen : Thanks Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alessandra Vecchi with William Blair. Your line is now open. Alessandra Vecchi : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the extension of the end markets or segments in Q1. When you guys commented that you saw sort of new product launches delayed. Was there any particular vertical you're seeing that in? Is it a delay in for the new smart meter industrial products? Is it a delay in automotive products, if you could just give a little bit of color on that? Michael Hsing : So actually, Bernie mentioned it in the earlier. And we see a pretty much across the board automotive, industrials as well as computing. And is that answer your questions? Alessandra Vecchi : Yes. Does apologies if I missed it. Michael Hsing : No. It's okay. Alessandra Vecchi : All my other questions were answered. Michael Hsing : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Thanks for taking the follow-up guys. Any update on the e-motion product revenue traction? Michael Hsing : Yes. We're afraid of this is too much of a - and yes, we actually starting January pretty meaningful revenue. And the new integrated solutions and as you see it our website, we sell the reference design including the models. And we receive very good feedback on these. William Stein : Great efforts. Michael Hsing : But the revenue still it's early ramp is only a ramp, but it's ramping very high percentage. Bernie Blegen : Will, thanks for giving us a chance to respond, we actually had an internal discussion on whether we had too many items out there. So we're not shying away from it. It's just that we're competing against a lot of other opportunities to talk about. William Stein : I understand. One other opportunity you mentioned a couple times tonight is 48 volt. I think there's one small semi company that's pretty well known to have a big share in that market. And we're also aware that one of the main consumers is GPUs. Are you seeing revenue for that product today or is it more a couple quarters out? And is it - of course we know automotive is moving in that direction too, but in which market do you expect to generate revenues first how close are we? Michael Hsing : Actually both and automotive is being in a 48 volts already in the high end cars. I think now it trickle down. And last year we expected to have a - in the second half of 2019 and as we see it probably still going to happen because these are high end product. I think they still are going to launch because the demand still there. Is regardless of the market. William Stein : Your product, that's competitive and ready and recognizing revenue in the back half of this year? Michael Hsing : I believe so that in terms of what is impacted to our revenue that's difficult to say now and I think these are high - these IR - these AR systems and you always need somewhere it's just a matter of how many. William Stein : Got it, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Chris Caso : Yes, thank you. Good evening. Just one question for me, Bernie, could you clarify one of the comments you made earlier on the inventory provisions. You said you need to take another look on that is the right interpretation of that just changing the quarterly reserves that you typically make. What's about the magnitude is there any impact on margins from that? Bernie Blegen : Yes, I haven't specifically calculated any exposure to what we've done in the forecast for the guidance is just provide a little bit of a step up and the rationale behind it is that we have a mechanical way of determining that number, which is based upon the next six months demand. So it's sort of inferred that if your six month demand looks to be going down that that could increase your likelihood of having an exposure. That's not to call out any specific product or end market, it's just sort of being generally conservative in the guidance we're providing. Michael Hsing : Yes, as of today we don't see any dramatic change. And it's all small numbers of change. When Bernie is talking about when the market dramatically changes, again it's like in last year December at the end of the quarter. And then well it may changes again. So we at this times we see is pretty normal now. Chris Caso : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you. I just had a quick follow up and back to BCD 6. I think you've talked about having a $17 billion SAM and I'm just wondering what BCD 6 does to that SAM number? Michael Hsing : Yes, we haven't got to the point yet. That's very good questions and certainly we see in our - in the application that we targeted we can integrate a lot of mini micro control - micro controller features. Tore Svanberg : And just to be clear, so those micros you would develop yourself, right. I mean you wouldn't buy off the shelf ones? Michael Hsing : It depends on applications. Some of the - and as we know now, we rebranded and - but we do have our firmware in the micro. And as of - into the total integrated solutions and first of all - so our total integration has a clear reason, has a cost effective and - or by size limitations. And if they integrate it and then we have to - we are not going to give a grown up developed microcontrollers. And those are not cost effective for us and those are we most likely is licensing. Tore Svanberg : Sounds good. Thank you very much. Michael Hsing : Okay, thank you. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Bernie Blegen : I'd like to thank you all for joining us for the conference call and look forward to talking you again during our first quarter 2019 conference call, which will likely be in April. Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Bernie Blegen : Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter of 2019 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2019, which is accessible through our website www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2018, Q4 2018 and Q1 2019 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS had another record first quarter with revenue of $141.4 million, 9.5% higher than the comparable quarter in 2018. MPS continues to benefit from our technology leadership and diversified multi-market strategy. Looking at our revenue by market, first quarter 2019 communications revenue of $22.2 million rose $6.4 million or 40.8% from the first quarter of 2018. Communications revenue represented 15.7% of MPS' first quarter 2019 revenue compared with 12.2% in the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected an initial 5G networking sales, as well as higher sales in the residential gateway and router market. First quarter 2019 industrial revenue of $21.3 million increased 21.6% from the first quarter of 2018 and accounted for 15.1% of our total first quarter revenue, up from 13.6% in the first quarter of 2018. The increase over the first quarter of 2018 primarily reflected gains in power sources and security applications. First quarter 2019 automotive revenue of $20.5 million grew 15.7% over the same period of 2018 and represented 14.5% of MPS' first quarter 2019 revenue versus 13.7% in the same period of 2018. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. In our computing and storage market revenue $39.2 million, increased $8.2 million or 26.5% year-over-year. First quarter 2019 computing and storage revenue represented 27.7% of MPS' first quarter 2019 revenue compared with 24% in the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year revenue increase primarily reflected the sales growth for notebooks and servers. Compared with the first quarter of 2018, revenue from consumer markets decreased $9 million or 19.1%. The year-over-year revenue decrease reflected across the board reductions in traditional consumer markets. Consumer revenue of $38.1 million represented 27% of our Q1 revenue compared with a 36.5% contribution in the first quarter of 2018. GAAP gross margin was 55.2%, 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 and 20 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2018. Our GAAP operating income was $21.7 million compared with $22.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. For the first quarter of 2019, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.6%, matching the fourth quarter of 2018, but 30 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2018. Our non-GAAP operating income was $39.6 million compared to $37.2 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $56.3 million in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $49.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2019 operating expenses were $39.0 million, up from the $35.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2019, total stock compensation expense including approximately $531,000 charged to cost of goods sold, was $16.0 million compared with $15.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. Switching to the bottom line, first quarter 2019 GAAP net income was $26.2 million or $0.58 per fully diluted share compared with $21.9 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter 2019, non-GAAP net income was $37.9 million or $0.84 per fully diluted share compared with $35.0 million or $0.79 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2019 were 45.2 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $362.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019 compared to $380.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $38.8 million compared with operating cash flow of $16.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter of 2019 capital spending totaled $59.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2019 at $58.9 million or 38 days of sales outstanding, up five days from 33 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and four days higher than the 34 days posted in the first quarter of 2018 reflecting the back-end weighting of shipments within Q1 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2019 were $142.5 million, up from the $136.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. Days of inventory increased to 205 days at the end of Q1 2019, compared with 180 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and 177 days at the end of the first quarter of 2018. The 25 days sequential increase is primarily due to an unexpected delay in customers' new product ramps and legacy business push outs. As we've said in the past, we're comfortable carrying a higher than normal level of inventory during the downturn given that most of our products are not customer or application specific and carry minimal obsolescence risk. Having said that, while inventories are likely to remain elevated through the second quarter we do not expect meaningful reductions until early 2020. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2019. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $147.5 million to $153.5 million. We also expect the following, GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.9% to 55.5%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.3% to 55.9%, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $55.5 million and $59.5 million, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $38.5 million to $40.5 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Total stock compensation expense is $17.6 million to $19.6 million including $550,000 that will be charged to cost of goods sold, litigation expenses ranging between $300,000 to $500,000. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.4 million to $1.6 million before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted share to be in the range of 45.1 million to 46.1 million shares. For the second half of the year, we still see some uncertainty in our end markets and remain cautious. We will continue to adapt to the changing market conditions and execute as planned. I will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open. Josh Buchalter : Hey. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. I was hoping to dig a bit into the computing and storage portion of the business. The year-over-year growth is still solid, but it is below your expectations heading into the quarter. Given the overall weakness we've seen across the board in datacenter, storage and PCs, I was wondering if you could provide a little more granularity there and how that dynamic between weak units in your content increases and new platforms plays out. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Sure, Josh, and good to hear from you. I think what we're seeing is in Q3 of 2018, there was a step down in SSD revenue, and that's essentially stayed at that lower plateau in each of the two following quarters. And then in Q4 of last year, we also saw a decrease in server content. And the belief is that certain of the hyper scales have over build the data centers and are taking a pause as they justify the next round in investment. Michael Hsing : I think as an overall all the design win activities to the same and we compare the last couple of quarters on the server side we still gained shares and I think the revenues also increased. The momentum is the same. Josh Buchalter : Got it, thank you and then more broadly, given the soft start to the year. I was hoping to hear some thoughts on your seasonality into the second half. And sort of how you're multiple content verticals are paying off on this soft macro that we've seen throughout the entire industry. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the solid results. Michael Hsing : Yeah, okay. Well second half, that I recon [ph], we don't have a - last year we prepared all inventories and we expect to have a huge win 2019 and up till now still not very certain, and our customers give us a different signals and that came in. So we just are waiting to see. Bernie Blegen : Yeah, I think that you're aware of that MPS didn't specifically guide beyond the current quarter. But certainly, these are unusual market conditions. If you look at our seasonality going from Q1 to Q2, over the last five years, you'd probably see a trend that we've increased it between 10% and 12% sequentially. Currently, we are forecasting revenues grow at a slower 7% rate, which I believe is probably indicative of a more gradual broad based recovery in the macro environment. So I don't see any one catalyzing event that will necessarily turn the tide for us, as we said, MPS expects to see a more gradual improvement in demand through the remainder of 2019. Michael Hsing : And overall, we still expect to grow and just because the market share gain. And, but how much growth came in is very difficult to tell now. Josh Buchalter : Got it, thank you, guys, and congrats again. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. Couple of questions, maybe we can start off with some of the end markets for Q2 specifically. So, yes, Bernie you mentioned the growth is sub-seasonal, but it's still growth. So, are you seeing all segments recovering or are some still a bit slower than others? Bernie Blegen : Well, I think that we are actually very well positioned across the board and I think that speaks well on our diversification. If I had to pick out a high runner, as we look at going into - for Q2, I think communications which took a big step-up as a result of initial 5G investments will continue at a little bit elevated level over what we saw in Q1. And certainly that represents a significant improvement over the prior year. I think that computing, you're going to see that also is expected to take a step-up. But recognizing that it's been at a fairly, I don't want to say depressed, but lower level as the data centers have sort of hit the pause button. I think also that automotive, I don't see an immediate turnaround there, but I do see an uptick as we go from Q1 to Q2. And then, industrial, which has really been in a very elevated level for a number of quarters, would probably return to its normal cadence. And consumer again is still being impacted by soft demand. Michael Hsing : I think the worst one is as Bernie, even said, the last one is the consumer. And all the other one is we gain market shares and actually in Q2 we see better than Q1. Tore Svanberg : Very good and Bernie, I don't - did I catch - did you say CapEx was $59.4 million in the quarter? Bernie Blegen : I'm sorry, CapEx? Tore Svanberg : Yeah. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what that money was spent on because that's a little bit higher than usual? Bernie Blegen : Sure. We purchased a building in Kirkland, Washington, which we will be using as both our regional executive offices, as well as this is going to be our center for e-commerce, which will give us the opportunity to recruit software engineers with this experience in their background. And if you take sort of a larger view because if you look back, we have been purchasing office space over the course of the last two years and this is part of our geographic diversification program, which allows us to draw talent worldwide for specific end market applications. So as we look forward, we also completed the purchase here a couple weeks ago of a building in Detroit, which will allow us to create a Center of Excellence servicing automotive. And we're in the process of buying office space in Barcelona, where we have a design center. And then also, we are going to be building another location, a couple hours out of Stuttgart, Germany, in the Rhine Valley. So not only do these moves aid our future growth, but we believe that owning the buildings is accretive to the P&L versus the alternatives of renting the facilities. Michael Hsing : And those money - and we got a better return than we are putting in the bank. But it really help the - it's all EPS plus and particularly in Washington we need more space and so we can acquire building as the EPS plus actually. Tore Svanberg : Very good, just one last one for you, Michael, the e-commerce business, I always look for updates there. Could you maybe give us the latest and greatest there please? Michael Hsing : We're still learning. I think it's - overall, we launched websites and that came in - we launched the website frankly and the activities is not as high as we think, but on our distributed website our product sell well. And so obviously, we're still in the learning stage and also all the programmable parts, all the modules, if we give them a floppy disk they can download them and that is doing really well and we have to somehow had it linked to our e-commerce. Again, how do we provide a better usage for our website and how they solve their current problem of using those programmable parts? And we're still learning, but the product itself is not selling through e-commerce, and we're doing really well. It's a better than any - we really expected it. And some glitch on the websites, because there maybe or the way we told is too confusing. We may know to how to use it, auto program the parts. And every other week we are upgrading our website. But the concepts from feedback from our customers, these are revolution parts - these are revolution way of designing power supplied and that they are like that and obviously this still have some missing link. Tore Svanberg : Very helpful. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Thanks and I'll offer my congrats on a solid quarter in a tough environment, maybe my first question on server. I know your Whitley [ph] - we've talked about anyway your Whitley content going from, I think, something like $50 probably to $70 or something all in. I think most of that increase is QSMod, I believe. Is there any sense or can you give us any sense of how much incremental server contents you'll see as AI accelerator attach rates grow and we migrate to 48-volt? I mean I would assume that those two things would be incremental for you guys to that move to $70 a content, but I'm just curious what that looks like to you guys. Michael Hsing : Yes. We have all the design wins, and that came in, 48-volts. We now started selling - many customers, we started selling, designing the modules. And we expect the Q2 have some kind of a ramp, and it didn't happen. But we'll still hold the second half. And some projects, we understand it has engineering delay. Other ones, we're not very sure. But what we're for sure is we're winning all these projects. Rick Schafer : And Michael, to be clear, it is - you're not including 48-volt or GPU accelerator or FPGA accelerators in that move from $50 to $70? Michael Hsing : No, no, those are separate. Those GPUs and also the AR, these are the content that are much higher - much, much higher. And it's the same kind of thing for ADAS, Jim [ph] four or five. And these are essentially - is the same product, and we are on winning many of these sockets now. Rick Schafer : Okay. Okay. And then my follow-up question, and this is - I haven't asked in a while, on gross margin. As you guys ramp 55-nanometer, and I know this is a multiyear progression or transition, but as you ramp 55-nanometer on 12-inch wafers and you mix favors, increasingly favors server, auto, industrial and eventually SMB or e-commerce, can we see it kind of a similar scenario that we saw in your top line over the last couple of years where you saw the revenue top line actually accelerate? Could we see an acceleration in your gross margin expansion or just give us maybe some color there on what those puts and takes are as you see them? Michael Hsing : Yes. I think I mentioned it before. We are not going to - the current margin is not - it's not - we don't plan to use - we don't use this as our long-term model, okay. Our long-term model, the margin will go up. And because we're going after all these high-value products, these are with the higher margin associated with it. And in the next couple of years, these products - obviously, as Bernie mentioned in the - especially in the industrial/automotive and part of the servers and even high-value consumer, the consumer product line, the margin steadily move up and they move kind of slower. But all the other ones, the industrial, automotive and, in particularly, e-commerce, when those things taking off, I think our margin will, in a few years later, you'll see a dramatic improvement. Rick Schafer : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I want to offer congratulations in weathering a tough demand environment very well. I'd like to first ask, as it relates to the cycle, though, Monolithic was a little bit later to see the downturn. I think your company was still presenting this 20% through the cycle as also sort of the current environment situation a little bit longer or you saw the downturn a little bit later. Should we likewise see the recovery a little bit later for Monolithic as well? Is that a reasonable assumption? Michael Hsing : I think - because you said - as you said, it is a delay, but I don't see a delay, because all these activities, these are green fields. We didn't have it in the four, five years ago. And that design cycle takes two or three years. And all we see is either entered a new product market segments or share gain. And when it recovers - when the market recovers, I think it will accelerate the growth. It will grow faster, much faster than everybody else. And as I said, okay, we will beat the market by 15% at least. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. I think that's a key ingredient there, Will, is that part and parcel to our belief that we can model annual revenue growth at 20% is that we will outperform the market by 10 to 15 percentage points. So when you look at full year 2018, the market grew at about 11% and we grew at about a little over 24%. So that metric works out. When I look at the guidance for some of our largest peer companies and you aggregate it, there's sort of an acknowledgment, really, in just the last quarter that full year 2019 probably is going to shrink by about 4% to 5%. So if you look at us as being able to perform a 10 to 15 percentage points better, that gets you into the middle single digits, which is not our historic growth. But again, that margin of how we can outperform the market remains intact. Michael Hsing : So to your questions, I don't see how and why we can delay the recovery. So that's my take. William Stein : Okay. I appreciate that answer, maybe two other real quick ones. First, I think last quarter, inventory at distribution increased a little bit at the end of the quarter. I'd love an update on that. And also on E Motion please. Thanks. Bernie Blegen : Yeah, okay. I'll take the first question, and Michael will take the second. So on the channel inventory, and you have to kind of look at the cadence of how this quarter played out. In January, we actually had a very good month, both as far as new business that we booked, the business that sold as well as sell-through by the distributors. I think a lot of that was in advance of an earlier-than-normal Chinese New Year. February was a little lackluster, and what that ended up doing is making - the quarter was really backended loaded, which did not allow the channel time to sell that inventory through. So again, we went up a couple of days, partly because of the order - or the shipping pattern and ordering pattern as well as you have a lower denominator for the quarter. And a lot of that increase did occur in China. Michael Hsing : Okay. The E Motion - and actually, that product is doing great. And if you notice it, we have online MPS, we're selling small models, including the model now. So like these are meant to be for a demonstration purpose. Actually, we sell quite a bit models now. And overall, it's still too soon to break out the product line, and it's a meaningful to move the needle now and move the overall revenue needle. William Stein : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. I want to ask a couple of questions. The first one is on the inventory side of the equation. You mentioned that there were some push outs and obviously the end demand is weak as well. But when you talked, Bernie, about you didn't expect it to come down until early 2020, is that mainly on a days basis? Or are you talking in dollars basis? And is there some level at which the dollars become worrisome to you? And any sort of obsolescence, risk or anything like that, that we should be concerned about. Bernie Blegen : So when you look at the increase that we had in Q1 inventory, again, a lot of it reflected wafer starts that began in earlier periods and were now going through WIP and finished goods. And so that, in conjunction with the fact that we did have delays in some of our customers' new programs. And there were some legacy business push outs, particularly in consumer, accounted for much of the increase. We are taking steps as far as lowering wafer starts, and the impact of that should be visible here in Q2 in terms of dollars. But again, the reason we're not expecting the days in the inventory necessarily to come down rapidly is again partly a reflection of the continued weakness or the slower uptick in a recovery here. So I don't think that there is a dollar or a days' quotient that would really get me concerned. But I would like to believe that we're at a level that we're plateauing and then with the opportunity as the recovery gains steam to come down. And as I said in my prepared comments, that's more likely to be in the next year. Michael Hsing : Under this current market conditions, let's say, the business is same as the second half of the year, we don't plan to write off a bigger chunk of the inventories because these products are all good. We made those products - made a way - created this inventory for - prepare for a big ramp. And it may still happen for Q3. If you look at the inventory, 200 days, okay, 200 days is based on - was it the Q1's number, the Q2's number? Bernie Blegen : Q1. Michael Hsing : Yes, Q1 then. And if you're looking at a ramp to somewhere 170 million, 180 million, that's nothing and so we still don't know whether they're going to recover or not. We need this inventory. But this inventory, under an uncertain environment, it is too high to make it. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Ross Seymore : Got it and I guess on the comms side of things, great growth year-over-year. You mentioned, in the past, there was some of the gateway in the router side, and then you also mentioned the 5G side of things. Can you remind us on two aspects with the 5G side of things roughly what size is that as a percentage of either the segment or total revenues and then the content that you have in 5G, if you could just remind us of how to think about that. Michael Hsing : I think the increase are both similar dollar amount. And 5G, Ross, if you remember, a few quarters ago or a year ago or so, our communication was to go sidelines - or go sideways. And I mentioned that in the comms, we have some killer products come out in the comms. And also, we're waiting for new product cycles. And this product hit the market and now move the revenue needles now. In the gateway, it's very price competitive. And under the current situation, we want the revenues, and we just grab those market shares. Bernie Blegen : Yes. I think this is actually a terrific story. Michael, didn't necessarily take full credit because we have remained very committed to the comms market. But what Michael had just said is we never had a killer application to go after it. And I think that that's the reason that for years this segment has underperformed, really going sideways between $15 million and $16 million per quarter. But now - so we basically missed out on a lot of the 4G wave. But we've recognized the significance of this market, and we developed new products that are exceeding our customers' expectations and their requirements. And I believe that we're very well positioned in a time when the 5G infrastructure investments are about to explode. So as Michael said that we're about 50-50 as far as the mix between the lower-margin gateway and the infrastructure networking. But I think that that's going to tip very much in favor of the higher-margin networking and infrastructure as this rolls out over the next two years. Ross Seymore : Got it, then one last one for me, given the current market environment, you talked about what the implications were for inventory and revenue, et cetera. How do you guys think about the implications on your OpEx growth related to the aftermarket? Michael Hsing : I think that we're very selective about hiring. Our hiring plan we changed. They were much reduced. And that's our biggest expense. So we - but we're hiring still and only hire for the best talent. And overall for the company growth, we freeze. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. And I think just to add to that real quickly is that we also are continuing our investment with the 12-inch and 55-nanometer, which will continue through this year because we believe that's a strategic goal that we want to have in position by 2020. Michael Hsing : Yeah, okay. Ross Seymore : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hi, guys. Wanted to first follow up on some comments you made last quarter about the new product slips given the slower environment. I think you had mentioned a number of areas : China new model automotives, smart meters in China and then it sounded like a few things in the data center GPU server segment. Can you give us some sense when you think those programs may now start to ship? Michael Hsing : It's smaller amount. We expected more, but there's not as much. And order - however, all the activities, and especially these are first-tier customers, and we engaged a lot more than before. And we're engaging with - even at the executive levels. And before, like a couple of years ago, nobody knows who is MPS. Okay. And now all these activities went up a lot in the infrastructures as well as the server market segments. Bernie Blegen : And I'd just like to emphasize something is that if you look at automotive where the growth rate is definitely taking a haircut as a result of slowdown particularly in China, but also it's been - actually, geographically, almost every region was down this quarter. But I really don't want to - I want to avoid putting too much stock on a single quarter-on-quarter deviation and really focus, as Michael did, on sort of the macro view that in these areas where we have invested and we have new greenfield opportunities, we're still having a very high level of customer engagement. We're still achieving at the same pace our design win activity. And there have been delays in some of our customers going into markets, but we're not losing any competitive position out of it. And particularly, in the areas that we've said are going to be growth areas, for example, ADAS and lighting and infotainment and automotive, those are on track. Obviously, you saw the initial results in the comms market with the 5G. So I think that the basic cadence of the business remains very strong. And it's just a matter of - and I think we're going to be very well positioned when the market returns to a more normal level. Quinn Bolton : Understood, a second question, if the market is down 4% to 5% this year, and you can grow 10 to 15 points faster, it seems like that should get you somewhere between 5% to 10% year-on-year growth, which, if I'm doing my numbers right, kind of puts you around where the Street consensus is looking for 2019. But I guess, Street consensus probably had you growing at your normal rate of seasonality in the third quarter. And that's I think typically your biggest quarter-on-quarter increase. And then the Street is actually up a little bit in December, which is an atypical pattern. You mentioned in the prepared comments that you still see - you saw limited visibility. The industry is still sort of not yet fully recovered. So I guess I'm trying to get a sense, do you think then expectation for normal seasonality in Q3 makes sense? Or would you say that may be aggressive where you stand today? Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Again, if you use Q2 as an example, even Q1 as an example, our normal seasonality for Q1 would be down sequentially by four percentage points. So we came down at about 7.9% or 8%. So there is a four percentage point delta from our normal sequential movement. And then if you look at what we've guided here, again if you look back the last four or five years, the growth between Q1 to Q2 would have us going up somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 12% - 11% just call it. And we've guided revenue to grow at a slower 7% rate. And again, I referenced that as being a more gradual, broad-based recovery in the macro environment. So I probably suggest that the sequential growth rates for the second half of the year are probably - are likely to also be about four percentage points below their seasonal norms. Michael Hsing : All this, Quinn, are still unknown. And some of our products, some of the applications and market segments, we see pull in. And other ones push out. So as Bernie said in the script is it's uncertain. And so in terms of what's the numbers, okay, why don't you make a number lower, and let us beat it. Quinn Bolton : Understood and then last question for me. In the first half of the year, it looks like your benefiting, from a revenue perspective, from this residential gateway business. It is a lower-margin business for you. Can you give us any thoughts how long do you see residential gateways continuing at sort of an elevated level, which was maybe part of the reason why margins are lower than where they were second half of last year or third quarter of last year? Michael Hsing : Yeah. Okay. These are - okay, I want revenues now. I want revenues. And in this kind of things, a half a year ago, we're a little bit aggressive on it, and that's reflecting now. Okay. And we also try it to consumers, but it didn't have any effect. Okay and so we didn't increase - we're still losing - we still have a - this quarter, we have it significantly lower than last year, right? And - but it's not because of if we lower the price, okay, we can't - could not get more market share. And so we made a decision to stay as is. Okay. At least, we don't lose our bigger, major sockets in the consumer side. Come back to the comms, to the router business, we're still aggressive. And this period - and it still makes very good money but the margin is lowered. As we gradually - everything else recovers, speed ups or the new product in a ramp-up. And we can go less aggressive on that. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. And I think specific to the residential gateway, you'll remember that products stepped up in sales beginning in Q3 of '18. And if we hold with our forecast, we'll pretty much fulfill that opportunity by the end of Q2. So I think that there is an opportunity within communications to see a step up in the more favorable product mix. But again, Michael has said it three times, all there is - right now, there remains uncertainty. And so it's really hard to say how our margins are going to improve in the near term. I think when we look longer term, certainly there will be an accelerated impact on our margins. But timing that right now again is uncertain as timing the return to normal for revenue. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Actually, there's other reason why we do this, okay? We want to ensure our supply have a continued - have a continuity. And so we actually are doing a part of it for our wafer fab and we ensure they are constantly loading. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Okay. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Bernie Blegen for any closing remarks. Bernie Blegen : Great, I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which would likely be at the end of July. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator Instructions]. Also as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to the second quarter of 2019 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, Founder and CEO of MPS, is with me on today's call.In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today.Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release, and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2019 and Form 10-Q filed on May 10, 2019, which are accessible through our Web site, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call.We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings, on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2018, Q1 2019 and Q2 2019 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our Web site. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $151 million, 6.8% higher than revenue in the first quarter of 2019 and 8% higher than the comparable quarter in 2018. Looking at our revenue by market. In our computing and storage market, second quarter revenue of $41.6 million increased $2.4 million or 6.1% from the first quarter of 2019. Computing and storage revenue represented 27.5% of MPS's second quarter 2019 revenue.Storage revenue was down from the first quarter of 2019 with computing revenue increasing. Nevertheless, the growth in computing was slower than what we'd planned for back in the second half of 2018. The slower than anticipated growth rate was primarily due to customers delaying product launches, or absorbing overcapacity. Having said that, our design activity in the first half of 2019 with top tier customers reached an all-time high end server, storage and AI applications, positioning MPS for long term success in these critical markets.In our consumer markets, revenue of $43.8 million increased 14.8% from the first quarter of 2019, and represented 29% of our second quarter 2019 revenue. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected improved sales of products for wearable applications and a seasonal increase in certain legacy consumer market. Second quarter 2019 industrial revenue of $22.4 million increased 5.2% from the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to increased revenue for smart meters and point of sales systems. Industrial represented 14.9% of our total second quarter 2019 revenue. Second quarter automotive revenue of $21.2 million grew 3.5% over the first quarter of 2019.Similar to computing revenue growth in automotive was lower than we have anticipated three quarters earlier due to a slowdown in the broader market. And like computing, our superior technology in design activities both in standard and custom products have been widely accepted by tier one customers. The range of applications MPS encompasses includes infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. Again, we believe MPS is well positioned to accelerate growth in automotive when the market returns. Automotive was 14.1% of MPS's total second quarter 2019 revenue.Second quarter 2019 communications revenue of $22million was essentially flat with the first quarter of 2019. Sales for our legacy router and wireless applications decreased sequentially, while sales -- while infrastructure sales, including 5G networks increased. As 5G spending ramps, MPS is well positioned to benefit as existing design wins move to revenue. Communication sales represented 14.5% of our total second quarter 2019 revenue.GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2019 and 40 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2018. Our GAAP operating income was $20.1 million compared to $21.7 million reported in the first quarter of 2019, and $24.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2018.Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 55.6%, matching the gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2019 but 40 basis points lower than the second quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $43.7 million compared to $39.6 million reported in the prior quarter, and $41.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2018.Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared with $56.3 million in the first quarter of 2019, and $52.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2019 operating expenses were $40.3 million, up from the $39 million we spent in the first quarter of 2019 and up from the $36.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2018.The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2019, stock compensation expense, including approximately $663,000 charge to costs of goods sold was $22.7 million compared with $16 million recorded in the first quarter of 2019.Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2019 GAAP net income was $20.7 million or $0.45 per fully diluted share compared with $26.2 million or $0.58 per share in the first quarter of 2019, and $24.2 million or $0.55 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $41.9 million, or $0.92 per fully diluted share compared with $37.9 million or $0.84 per share in the first quarter of 2019, and $40 million or $0.90 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2019 were $45.5 million.Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $369.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2019 compared to $362.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $44.1 million compared with Q1 2018 operating cash flow of $38.8 million.Second quarter 2019 capital spending totaled $19.3 million. Accounts receivable end of the second quarter of 2019 at $55.4 million, representing 33 days of sales outstanding, which was five days lower than the 38 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and two days lower than the 35 days at the second quarter of 2018.Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2019 were $143.6 million, up from the $142.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019. Days of inventory of 193 days at the end of the second quarter of 2019 were 12 days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2019. As we've said in the past, we are comfortable carrying a higher than normal level of inventory during a downturn, given that most of our products are not customer or application specific and carry minimal obsolescence risks. Having said that, we do not expect meaningful reductions in the near term, and inventories are likely to remain elevated through the second half of 2019.I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2019. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $162 million $168 million. We also expect the following; GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.9% to 65.5%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range 65.3% to 55.9%; total stock-based compensation expense of $18.3 million to $20.3 million, including approximately $600,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $57.1 million and $61.1 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $39.4 million to $41.4 million.We are continuing to invest in our new 55-nanometer process technology on 12-inch wafers, and are selectively adding headcount despite slower revenue growth; litigation expense should range between $400,000 to $600,000; interest income is expected to range between $1.4 million to $1.6 million; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 45.3 million to 46.3 million shares. In conclusion, for the remainder of 2019, we remain cautious amidst the market uncertainty. I believe MPS is well positioned for long term growth.I will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rick Schafer : Congratulations guys on results. And I know it's not easy to it in this environment. So maybe my first question is if you could just give some more color, or maybe parse out the areas of relative strengths heading into 3Q, which segments, I mean just at a high level. Which segments you expect to grow and maybe which segments might be lagging a little bit? Michael Hsing : They're kind of all lagging a little bit. Bernie Blegen : Well, if you look at sequentially. Automotive is expected to probably contribute, both in terms of dollar and also percentage gain. Likewise, I'd say that industrial, which you know can be rather lumpy business, should show some improvement from Q2 to Q3. Again, when you look at the comparison against last year's Q3, to Michael's point exactly, consumer usually is the bellwether and in fact that has remained down from last year. And industrial would be flattish. But we do expect to see continued improvements in both automotive and communication year-over-year. Rick Schafer : And maybe on that topic to, Michael or Bernie, maybe just a little color on what's happening with China auto. There's -- it doesn't sound like it. But if there -- I mean I guess you did mention auto is picking up a little. So is China specifically is -- are you seeing signs of pick up there? And maybe as part of your answer on auto, I'm curious just if you could talk about some of the design win momentum you guys have there with auto OEMs, tier ones. How the pipeline is stacking up through all this downturn? I assume there's still a fair amount of design activity going on? Michael Hsing : Yes, our auto as that goes up slightly, I don't know this is from is it noise. It is from a noise or just on certain projects, we're still very small in the entire auto segment, our market share is very small. And in terms of engagements and the designing activities, and we actually surprised ourselves and again after we qualified from first tier suppliers and including OEMs, and the level of engagement and the level of meetings that they requested, and it cannot be better. Bernie Blegen : And just as a finishing point there, I think that the results that we saw in the first half of the year were colored mostly by the soft demand, particularly in the China market. And then the uptick that we expect to see in the second half of the year is result of the new model years being rolled out, particularly in North America, Europe and Korea. Rick Schafer : And then just as a quick housekeeping question, if I can, I'll sneak it on. Just on your Huawei exposure. I know it's small for you guys. I think you said low single digits. I mean, some companies have talked about being able to ship that there's not -- basically everything -- because they're not national security. Can you give some color on what you're able to shift to Huawei, how much of that low single digit exposure are you able to actually to ship out to them? Thanks. Bernie Blegen : Sure. There's a couple of points there. I mean, obviously in the middle of May, that's when the Department of Commerce added Huawei to the entity list. And so like our peer companies, we did an evaluation of how the ban would affect us and how to implement it. And after we completed that review, we concluded that the MPS ICs are really now subject to the entity list prohibitions. We basically determined that certain components working in compliance within the sales band framework. And so we have resumed shipping.One thing to add is that, historically, Huawei has been a very small percentage of our business.And I'm not talking through them in total here, but I am saying that in China, in particular with level of uncertainty related to tariffs and trade that we did see a step up in volumes in Q2 as certain customer build inventories in advance of any further bans. Michael Hsing : We are not depending on Huawei to grow. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead. William Stein : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Normally, downturns in my experience tend to trigger an increased pace of innovation. Customers sometimes look to use the weak demand environment to leapfrog competitors. And I'm wondering if you're seeing this trend now, and how it affects your view to your future revenue growth? Bernie Blegen : Will, I think that is a very accurate observation. And particularly when we look at areas that really are exciting for our future. In particular within computing, we've talked about cloud-based server and AI, even storage, which has been down now for about three to four quarters. We're seeing a very high level of engagement. And the same can be held true for automotive, in particular.And a point that Michael made earlier that I do want to emphasize is that in the past, we've had to go out and really get them excited at MPS. And now that engagement is starting to occur where they're calling us and setting up meetings at the executive level. So we're not going to try and tell you the timing of when market is going to turn around. From a theme for this quarter, we really believe that we're well positioned to take advantage of it. William Stein : Maybe one more if I can squeeze it in. The Q3 guide is remarkably in line with consensus. But I think, at least in my analysis, it looks slightly above typical seasonality. So still, not as robust year-over-year growth as we've come to expect from monolithic but looking like maybe we're passing through the bottom in terms of year-over-year growth. When we think about Q4, while you're not guiding it, I think normal seasonality is up mid to high singles. Any reason to think that would be better or worse than typical? Michael Hsing : I think of Q4 usually is that we are slightly lower and not up to single digits. And in the last few years and last two or three years, the seasonality -- we don't know what's our seasonality is. When you grow 16%, 17%, 20% some percent, and so the seasonality is not very clear to us. But the Q4, I think is that we are either flat or slightly down, and I don't know what the -- I forgot the last year number, maybe slightly up almost. Last year it was down. Bernie Blegen : Last year it was down, a year before we were actually up and that was after we've started to get traction in the server business. And we're actually continuing the theme. Well that in both Q1 and Q2, however, however you define our historic norms, we're underperforming in Q3 by about 2 to 3 percentage points. But I think that Michael's point is spot on that we've had a lot of volatility, particularly in the last two years as we've had the change in sales mix. So it's not as predictive as it once was. But I do feel good, to add to your point, that we basically stayed in a good position relative to expectations for the quarter. Michael Hsing : Yes, one more thing. So I very much agree with you. This year it's -- we don't have a clear views in how the industrials growth. And only we can do is do our best effort to have a design win and to engage with our customer closely. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you. And congratulations on the results in this environment. First question, the consumer revenue, the year-over-year declines continued to improve. And as we look at through the September quarter, should we expect that trend to continue? So again, I'm not asking for that to be up. But I think it does seem like the year-over-year declines are certainly moderating in each quarter and year? Bernie Blegen : Tore, thank you very much for your earlier compliment. Yes, the consumers are little bit hard to handicap. I think that you're aware that we parsed it into three general groups, high value, gaming and traditional or legacy. And historically, I think that legacy has had a certain seasonality, it was relatively predictable. But even that's gone out the window as we've seen a softening of demand more clearly in Asia, China, but not exclusively there.And actually the high value, which has a lot of exposure to home appliances, actually has rebounded nicely and is continuing strong. And I think you're also aware that as we start to go into the holiday season that gaming is going to pick up. So it's not clear that -- I would be cautious in using any term like bottomed out or that, it's more that we have a different -- slightly different mix within those three buckets. Tore Svanberg : And as we start to look at your design activity, it sounds like you're getting a lot of traction with what we'd referred to as really high end processors and AI engines and server, maybe even in 5G equipment. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? And should we start to see some revenues already from those high end processors this year? Or is this more of a 2020 growth goal? Bernie Blegen : I think those are, to the extent that they're commercially available, they're very early stage. And we don't have enough momentum to clearly identify a trend line, as we said that if we -- take 5G, for example. We're very well positioned with our technology on any number of different platforms with any number of different companies in any of the representative geographies. So we think that, again, the diversification, both in for the technology and what our point of entry is, gives us a lot of confidence that we'll do well. But again, it's going to take time for that market to develop. I think initially that and some of the other high end processing, which you can include AI in, are going to start out a little bit lumpy before a true ramp becomes apparent. Tore Svanberg : Just one last question. You mentioned 55-nanometer on 12 inch. I assume you're not getting any benefit from that yet. They're probably more 2020. But would that be more of an enhancer to gross margin? Or will you use that process node to basically continue to accelerate the growth? Michael Hsing : I don't know there's a 55 nanometer is the accurate enough, okay. Yes, we do use a 12 inch. And we starting to 12 inch wafers. And those are, as you said that these use -- we'll always use a trading edge of advanced equipment. And when we build -- these equipment available then we moved in. And those are with solid development always, not two or three years or two or three years later that will benefit our costs and also the features that we can offer to our customers. Bernie Blegen : And I think an example of that is, if you look at how our fifth generation rolled out. We're now getting the benefits of that, even though that that has been in the market for about the last 3.5 to 4 years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alessandra Vecchi from William Blair. Please go ahead. Alessandra Vecchi : Hey, congratulations on the good quarter. Just a quick question on the gross margins, it's not a surprise that they've been trending flat over the last few quarters. So if we look out into next year, what do you need to see happen to resume that 20 basis points of sequential improvement? Is it really -- is it a mix situation, or is it predominantly an in-demand situation? Bernie Blegen : The one we get to the other. We need to see an increased ramp in overall demand. That really if you look at each of the last four or five quarters, we've actually seen sequential decreases in the sales mix. Michael Hsing : We've build our productions for much higher capacities, and now we see the growth slower. So that has partially also impacted in the gross margin. Alessandra Vecchi : No, that makes perfect sense. And then just expand on Tore's comments or question with regards to some of the strong first half design wins ramping in the second half, or starting to go in, I should say. On the AI front, are you predominantly talking about the 48 volt product? Or how should we think about how you play in AI on the processor front?A - Michael HsingYes, we have a design wins, and we have a design win of -- 48 volts we believe is a inevitable solution as power goal keep going up. And so we started a few years ago we developed that kind of solutions. And it's kind of a widely accepted and we expect to have revenue to ramp now. But we don't know if the customers push out the projects but we're still expecting a ramp in the near future in the next couple of quarters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. Please go ahead. David Williams : First, I guess I wanted to see if you could talk maybe about your channel inventories, and how you're feeling about that. It sounds like maybe some of the appliance over inventory has been digested a bit. But throughout the other markets, how do you -- I guess, can you give a sense on how your inventory levels are there? And just how you expect those to trend over the next quarter or two? Bernie Blegen : And again, I just want to clarify, you said channel inventories? David Williams : Yes. Bernie Blegen : Yes. So I think at the end of Q1, we acknowledge that we were above our normal range for channel inventory. Some of that had to do with a backend loading of the quarter where sales that we made in the last month of the quarter did not go out to the final end customer. In Q2, we had much more balanced sales on our side by month. And the channel responded and actually, particularly in China and Taiwan, we've seen a significant reduction. We're back down within our comfort zone with the channel inventories. It's a little bit hard to call out by necessarily end market application. It's easier we have greater visibility as it relates to geography. David Williams : Great, thanks. And then Bernie you had noted prior that you thought that you could maintain kind of revenue growth that was 10% to 15% above what the industry was averaging. Do you still feel comfortable with that? And just kind of looking at where you are this year, do you think you can do better? Or how do you -- I guess is that still I guess stick to measure by? Michael Hsing : As I said earlier, this is a kind of uncertain market now, and our customers will not give us a very clear feedback. So that's all -- these are out of our control and what we do the best is have a product designing. And one way or the other, they will turn into a revenue. Bernie Blegen : And just to agree with Michael's point there is that it's just very difficult for us to project further than one quarter out. And there's sort of an interesting, we have the elements in the business that are within our control and then we have other elements that aren't necessarily directly within our control. And to the extent that we can continue to secure design wins and get the customer engagement, I think that we're doing a very good job both in execution within the quarter but also as far as securing our longer term future. Michael Hsing : Yes. We're doing a good because we ignored all the macro -- total macroeconomy, and we do -- we can do the best when we can control it. David Williams : Okay, great. And then one last one from me, if you don't mind. Just kind of look at the computing and storage. How are you seeing, I guess, the demand for the hyperscale data centers? And I guess if you're thinking about that segment, in particular, where do you think you see that the greatest degree of demand today and how do you think that plays out for the rest of the year? Bernie Blegen : I think that I can acknowledge that somewhere about Q4 and certainly in Q1 and for a portion of Q2, that we saw a dip in demand by hyperscale. We believe based only on our experience, as it was broad-based, it was not just related to an individual company. However, if you look particularly at the long-term demand forecast for e-commerce, eventually, we believe that a lot of it has to do with just absorbing excess capacity or inventory that is built on their shelves, and that the demand for e-commerce based solutions is going to expand and will have to be renewed investment. I don't know exactly when that's going to start to pick up and it might be not even across the board. For example, we might see a little bit more on the server side before we see it in storage. But I think that some time in the next few quarters it will return to building momentum again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Please go ahead. Michelle Waller : This is Michelle on for Quinn. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess the first one is, consensus estimates for 2020 as far as revenue growth, it looks like The Street has you at 19%. So given these macro uncertainties going on, just wondering if you could give us revenue growth drivers in 2020? What would be driving towards? Bernie Blegen : So let me restate the question, if you don't mind. You had two there. The one is that currently The Street has us growing at just under 19% for 2020. And within that, what growth drivers we believe are significant in those assumptions. Is that correct? Michelle Waller : Yes. Michael Hsing : I don't know, it's up 19% now? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Michael Hsing : I think we\u2019re kind of a committed we can grow better than the industry average by 10% to 15%. That's all we\u2019re committing that. And even that -- I look at our history, that's what we have done in the past. And this year, I think is the same, this year it\u2019s kind of not very certain. And we'll look back the same as like 2012 and 2008. And those are very uncertain years. And that's what we have -- what we achieved. Bernie Blegen : And I think that as far as the growth drivers, and again, Michael is right, there\u2019s too much uncertainty to sort of affirm or even not say that we can't live up to the expectations. But I think you're going to see continue increased demand for our products, particularly in computing, automotive. And we're also going to see the initial uptick in the communications markets. Michelle Waller : And then one just on the project delays. I think you guys kind of touched on that. But I was just wondering, if there's an update as far as it's been -- if you've seen an increase in these delays or how the delays you saw since our first quarter call, have changed over the past quarter? Michael Hsing : We don't -- it's difficult, some are big project delays and some small project advance. So the weight of each project, we don't have a very clear accounting -- method of accounting and the company is in a way migrated, we\u2019ve become like a 3,000, 4,000 products. And we have again -- at any given time we have a few thousand projects going on. And so we don't know. Michelle Waller : And just one clarification. For 3Q computing as far as did you say what was the trend that you set for that end market? Michael Hsing : Yes. So overall, we see a delayed launch and delayed project and we see overall slowing down. And starting from earlier this year and even now the similar conditions. Bernie Blegen : And one thing to add there is the second half of 2018, actually we did very well with computing and storage. So we're going into a situation where we see some signs of improving momentum. But we have more difficult comps in the second half of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Please go ahead. Josh Buchalter : Hey guys, this is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Let me echo my congrats on some solid results in a tough backdrop. I guess I wanted to circle back to industrial. It took a step down compared to last year but it's still growing solid double-digits in notably weak environment. I realized it's fragmented, but are there any verticals in particular that you'd like to call out that help insulating you here? Bernie Blegen : Yes, I think that if you're looking at sort of sequential growth, I think we called out the fact that smart meters and point-of-sale systems picked up to a degree that, frankly, we hadn't fully anticipated. And when you look at the year-over-year comparisons, remember, our industrial tends to be a little more fragmented. We've got like four verticals that we depend on. And in fact, power sources and security in addition to smart meters seem to be continuing with good momentum right now. Michael Hsing : I think that Bernie said is, our industrial market fragmented, our entire company is fragmented, and the beauty is, one segment slow down, other one will pick up. And so, nothing's more than a bigger percentage of total revenues. And when we look at it overall, MPS will grow this year. And will grow at the same pace as last year, we cannot say it. Josh Buchalter : Understood and appreciate the color. And then as I follow up, I think it's been a couple quarters I was hoping maybe you can provide an update on e-commerce and e.Motion. If there\u2019s anything to share there? Thank you. Michael Hsing : Still very early, early stage. We try to figure out the why people don't -- or why people tell us have a good solution but nobody buys it, okay. And at least not selling like hotcakes. And we're still in the midst of figuring out why and how we can. But we\u2019re committed. And as long as people say our customers this is a good solution and we'll keep figuring out. But overall revenues and also design -- customer request is -- I don't have a clear number but increases tremendously and we have difficulty to handle that. And that's a very good encouragement. And once we feel we have a handle on it we will give you a revenue commitment. Bernie Blegen : And again, most of the comments is related to the e-commerce platforms actually in e.Motion we're seeing very good engagement this year with products that are beginning to ramp in revenue. And there\u2019s a pretty broad and diverse number of end-state applications that we probably wouldn't have anticipated even as recent as two years ago. But I think that, that is holding up two expectations for the current year and also as we look ahead into the next year or two. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. I am showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer for closing remarks. Bernie Blegen : Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us to this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter conference call, which would likely be at the end of October. Thank you. And have a nice day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for attending today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Good day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chief Executive Officer of Monolithic Power Systems, Michael Hsing. Sir, please go ahead. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Hello, everyone. Good morning from Shanghai. We held our third quarter board meeting in a newly established customer support and marketing center for China. We had our board members for the facilities and to overseas operations here. In the last few days, we received many messages that have showed overwhelming support in response to a recent publication. I\u2019m representing MPS management to express our deep appreciation for your trust and support. Our reaction to this publication is that it is malicious and manipulative. We will not bore your intelligence to go through the details. Lastly, I assure you we will take appropriate actions, including legal actions, against any malicious and unlawful activities damaging MPS reputation and our shareholders interest. Thank you again. Now with that I\u2019ll let Bernie to speak about earnings. Bernie Blegen : Thank you for that. Good afternoon, and welcome to the third quarter 2019 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statements contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q3 release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2019 and Q2 2019, Form 10-Q filed on August 2, 2019, both of which are accessible through our website at www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2018, Q2 2019 and Q3 2019 releases as well as the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $168.8 million, 11.8% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2019 and 5.5% higher than the comparable quarter in 2018. Looking at our revenue by market; in our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $52.8 million increased $11.2 million or 26.9% from the second quarter of 2019. Computing and storage revenue represented 31.3% of MPS\u2019 third quarter 2019 revenue. The sequential quarterly revenue growth was broad-based for sales gains reported in power management for TPUs, high-end notebooks, servers and storage. Coupled with our recent design wins using QSMod, Quantum State Modulation, in server and AI applications, MPS is at the early stage of this important revenue ramp. I also would like to introduce a killer product, a next-generation 48-volt power solution for artificial intelligence, server and supercomputing applications. This solution offers one of the highest levels of energy efficiency with the smallest form factor of its class. Our customers have validated our solutions as we believe we\u2019ll win market share in this important segment. Third quarter automotive revenue of $24.4 million grew 15.1% over the second quarter of 2019, reflecting initial sales of product for infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. In addition, we were awarded a relatively large contract at a major Tier 1 automobile supplier. We expect to begin generating revenue from this relationship in the next two to three years. Automobile revenue is 14.5% of MPS\u2019 total third quarter 2019 revenue. Third quarter 2019 industrial revenue of $28.9 million increased 28.6% from the second quarter of 2019 due primarily to increased revenue for security systems, power sources and industrial meters. Much of this growth is projected to be project based, which can vary significantly by quarter. Industrial revenue represented 17.1% of our total third quarter 2019 revenue. In our consumer market, revenue of $43.9 million was essentially flat with the second quarter of 2019 and represented 26.0% of our second quarter 2019 revenue. Sequentially, third quarter revenue reflected a seasonal increase in certain legacy consumer markets offset by decreased sales of products for wearable applications and set-top boxes. Third quarter 2019 communications revenue of $18.8 million was down 14.5% from the second quarter of 2019. Infrastructure, 5G sales, along with sales for legacy router and wireless applications, decreased sequentially. Despite the sequential downturn in 5G revenue, we believe MPS is well positioned to benefit as existing design wins move to revenue. Communications sales represented 11.1% of our total third quarter 2019 revenue. GAAP gross margin was 55.2%, 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2019 and 40 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2018. Our GAAP operating income was $30.0 million compared to $20.1 million reported in second quarter of 2019 and $33.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 55.6%, matching the gross margin reported for the second quarter of 2019, but 50 basis points lower than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $51.4 million compared to $43.7 million reported in the prior quarter and $49.2 million reported in the third quarter of 2018. Let\u2019s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $63.1 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared with $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $55.5 million in the third quarter of 2018. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2019 operating expenses were $42.5 million, up from the $40.3 million we spent in the second quarter of 2019 and up from the $40.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2018. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2019, total stock compensation expense including approximately $641,000 charge to cost of goods sold was $21.3 million compared to $22.7 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. Switching to the bottom line; third quarter 2019 GAAP net income was $29.5 million or $0.64 per fully diluted share compared with $20.7 million or $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2019 and $31.6 million or $0.71 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $49.5 million or $1.08 per fully diluted share compared with $41.9 million or $0.92 per share in the second quarter of 2019 and $47.3 million or $1.06 per share in the third quarter of 2018, fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2019 was 45.8 million. Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $422.0 million at the end of the third quarter of 2019 compared to $369.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2019. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $72.0 million compared with Q2 2019 operating cash flow of $44.1 million. Third quarter 2019 capital spending totaled $9.1 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2019 at $58.3 million, representing 31 days sales outstanding, which is two days lower than the 33 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2019 and three days lower than the 34 days at the third quarter of 2018. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2019 were $135.6 million, down from the $143.6 million at the end of the second quarter of 2019. Days of inventory of 163 days at the end of the third quarter of 2019 were 30 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2019. The drop in inventory, both in terms of dollars and days, represent management\u2019s decision to slow wafer start in response to the market downturn. Under normal circumstances, we are comfortable carrying a higher level of inventory to support our accelerated rate of revenue growth given that most of our products are not customer or application-specific and carries minimal obsolescence risk. I would like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2019. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $160 million to $166 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.8% to 55.4%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 55.8%; total stock-based compensation expense of $18.3 million to $20.3 million, including approximately $600,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $56.2 million and $60.2 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses expected to be in the range of $38.5 million to $40.5 million. Litigation expense should range between $800,000 to $1.2 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.4 million to $1.6 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 45.8 million to 46.8 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to execute and deliver the results that speak for themselves. I will now open the phone lines for questions. Hello? Operator : Yes, sir. Are we ready for questions? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rick Schafer : Hi, guys, congratulations on a nice quarter and another tough setup, but a nice job on the quarter. I guess my first question is really compute, industrial, auto, I mean, all these sort of high-margin kind of new verticals for you, are all up nicely, I think, double digits year-over-year. Maybe could you talk a little bit about relative strength by region or any color you could give there and if you had any 10% customers or anybody close to 10%, any particular customer strength in the quarter? Bernie Blegen : Sure. Let me sort of stuck that off. It wasn\u2019t [indiscernible]. I think to restate Rick\u2019s question, if that will help [indiscernible] is that we are observing that there is a good relative strength in the quarter for automotive, computing and industrial. And so if you\u2019re looking for a little bit of color as far as the geographic distribution and if there are any 10% customers or what the level of concentration is like. So yes, I got it. So Rick, if you put your finger on that right mix of what drove our Q3 performance, so if I can comment first on the computing and storage. Computing and storage, for us, in the first half exhibited some weakness over what it has done in 2018. And we saw in Q3 strong momentum across all of our lines of business, and there was no individual concentration that drove that nor geographic. So that was nice to see just because in the first half of this year, there has been weak demand. In industrial, that has been an area that has been benefiting or maybe I should say affected by ordering ahead of demand today. And some of that is occurring in China, anticipating any further trading actions. So that was pretty concentrated in power sources and surveillance. Automotive is very broad-based as far as seeing a beginning of sales in new model years to Europe and Korea as well as return of some ordering levels in China. And while I don\u2019t have it exactly at my fingertips, I do not believe we have any 10% customers that we\u2019ll be expecting this quarter. Rick Schafer : Okay. Thanks. I apologize if it\u2019s difficult to hear me. My second question and my follow-up is just on 5G. It\u2019s obviously becoming a bigger contributor to the MPS growth story. And I know you talked about it being softer in the recent quarter, but obviously, the order book looks good. So what\u2019s your visibility on reacceleration in your 5G business? And maybe if you could provide a little bit of color about what that dollar content opportunity is for you guys, some color on your competition there and maybe share assumptions or expectations. Just some general color on 5G, please. Michael Hsing : Okay. General color on 5G? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Michael Hsing : Okay. On the 5G, what we see is that our customers telling us that there\u2019s more to ramp, okay, as they said, this current \u2013 this quarter than that. And I see this is very initial ramp. So it is somewhat lumpy. And for the next few quarters, our customers, they will follow \u2013 our forecast is that they will start pulling in materials. And so whether from the last few quarters to this quarter to the next few quarters, okay, our guess is that still the initial ramp, that kind of looks \u2013 the ramp is not very smooth, kind of lumpy. Rick Schafer : Okay. Michael, any comment on sort of dollar opportunity, dollar content opportunity when you think about a 5G base station for MPS? Michael Hsing : For us, it is difficult to capture because we provide the very basic building block. From the base station to signal chain and to central stations, we provide just the basic building block. We actually don\u2019t know where the product ended up. Rick Schafer : Okay. Understood. Thanks and congrats again. Michael Hsing : Thanks Rick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is open. William Stein : Great. I think it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re all having trouble hearing each other perhaps. So, I\u2019ll speak really slowly. I\u2019m hoping you can comment on channel inventory levels, perhaps remind us what the target level is, what that level of inventory was earlier in the year, where it was in Q3 and perhaps where you expect it to go in Q4? Bernie Blegen : Sure. So at the beginning of this year, and let me open up with, is that we haven\u2019t disclosed the range that we manage to. We talk in more qualitative terms. But certainly, as we look at the end of Q1, we finished above our normal range. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that in the quarter, we had higher sales in January and March with the March sales being disproportional to an even spread. The distributor did not have an opportunity to sell through to end customers. So that\u2019s why that was up. In Q2, we had a more even distribution, and days in the channel returned to normal \u2013 at the upper end but normal range. And then in the current quarter, we actually saw terrific sell-through. And again, this is broad-based in all of our geographies. And what we have seen is that we\u2019re actually at the lower end of our range as we finished Q3. So, I\u2019d make that similar comment as I did on the inventories on the book. But that\u2019s probably not a level that we care to sustain that, but it certainly was positive to show that, the strong sell-through. Michael Hsing : Yes. Let me remind everybody. I think that in the early \u2013 regarding to the inventory, in early this year, in one of \u2013 I think it\u2019s in February earnings call, we commented that the outlook was uncertain and our inventory buildup, that was due to last December quarters that we anticipated the normal growth for MPS is over 20% growth for the entire 2019. And in February, we started to reduce our wafer starts in reacting to more criticism. And also, we don\u2019t see clear futures. And now we ended up at the very low inventory days and low inventory. We have to build it up again. Bernie Blegen : And this is referring to the inventory that\u2019s on our books, not in the channel. William Stein : Great. If I can have one follow-up, please. I think we\u2019re all very interested in your expectations for growth in the coming year. I\u2019m not expecting you to guide necessarily for next year, but I think we have an expectation that through the cycle, you post something on the order of up 20 per year. Do you think next year is going to be typical or reflect a recovery in the broader market so you could at least get close to that number? Or do you think that the current trade situation or anything else would hinder that and keep you materially below it? Michael Hsing : Yes. Good question. And on this quarter, we delivered \u2013 remember, we don\u2019t want to forecast the next quarter \u2013 no, we don\u2019t want to forecast the next year. And throughout this period and I think last year, we said that it was not very clear. Now, we did say that all the greenfield products for MPS, our greenfield market segments, they will start to grow. And the initial growth, as we just said, even with the 5G ramp, it\u2019s not very smooth. It\u2019s not very \u2013 it\u2019s kind of lumpy. And we \u2013 this quarter, we see 5G is not as good as expected. And now the next few quarters start to put in. And so we do see all these \u2013 we see this very similar to other segments in auto and in industrial. And so next year, we can forecast our \u2013 what\u2019s the growth rate. I think we\u2019ll be better than the industry by 10% to 15%. William Stein : Good enough. Thank you very much and congratulations on the good results and outlook in this tough environment. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Let me echo the congratulations and especially on the record cash flows. So first question, and maybe just to get a clarification in here. So right now, your inventory days are at 160. So what you\u2019re saying is that they will probably go back up again in Q4? That \u2013 will they sort of go back to the level you were in Q1 of this year? Bernie Blegen : Yes. The range that we\u2019re trying to manage between is 160 to 180 days for inventory in our balance sheet. And that may be a little bit higher than what industry and peer norms would be. But again, just going back to Michael\u2019s point that we\u2019re growing at 10 to 15 percentage points ahead of the market. And as a result, this growth is coming from greenfield opportunities with new products and new markets. And so what we do is we invest above the initial demand so that we have positive experiences with our customers. Tore Svanberg : Very good. And yes, I mean that\u2019s obviously why you had record cash flows this quarter, right, that inventory started selling through. That\u2019s great. Second question is on automotive. So it\u2019s about $100 million a year business now. And I think there\u2019s no secret that you\u2019re starting to gain a lot of traction with \u2013 directly with some of the OEMs. And you even mentioned one big contract. So as you think about $100 million, that does not include any other sort of direct OEM relationships that you started to have, correct? Bernie Blegen : Sorry. I apologize. I didn\u2019t know which end market you were talking about. Tore Svanberg : Automotive. Automotive. Bernie Blegen : Automotive? Tore Svanberg : Yes. $100 million business now, yes. Bernie Blegen : Okay. And so the question then is how much exposure do we have to the OEMs. Tore Svanberg : No, no, no. The question is you started to establish some deeper relationships with the OEMs. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s sort of already contributing to that $100 million run rate. Or is that all new business that\u2019s still on the come? Bernie Blegen : So let me say back the question because we\u2019re having difficulty hearing you. And I apologize about that. So you\u2019re saying that on the $100 million run rate, as far as what is our exposure to the OEMs and how much of that is still \u2013 that\u2019s roughly the question, yes. Tore Svanberg : Yes, I mean that\u2019s fine, yes. I\u2019m just trying to understand how much of that business is coming from your more recent wins with bigger OEMs. Michael Hsing : Oh, yes, yes. Okay. Recent win and the recent award, which is a relatively large project from a Tier 1 automotive supplier, it\u2019s a relatively large project. This will be in the next two or three years. And so far, the existing revenues all ramp up from the Tier 2, some we\u2019ve got very little from Tier 1. And as we will see in the next six to nine months, we will win a lot more in this type of large project. So that will pave the next two to three, three to even four years away. Tore Svanberg : That\u2019s exactly what I was asking. Just one last question, and I\u2019ll ask a more simple question. When will you be in production with 48-volt? Michael Hsing : It\u2019s starting now. Tore Svanberg : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you The next question comes from Alessandra Vecchi of William Blair. Your line is open. Alessandra Vecchi : Hi everyone. Congratulations also on an amazing quarter in this environment. Just on the OpEx side, you guys have done a phenomenal job sort of holding that steady and managing it. How do we sort of think about balancing your operating expenses going forward with future revenue growth? And then additionally, sort of similar question on the gross margin front, as you guys similarly have done an outstanding job holding those steady. Where do we think \u2013 how do we think about the puts and takes of potential margin improvement next year or 2021? Michael Hsing : I think as we stick to our models, which I wrestled with our large shareholders, I want to spend more money and they want to see the EPS growth as well. And \u2013 but here, we stick to our models, which is now, I think that this year, we\u2019re slightly above, right? Bernie Blegen : Yes, yes. It\u2019s \u2013 again, Alex, it\u2019s a fair question. We have a model which I believe our investors are familiar with where we want to be able to provide operating leverage along with revenue growth. However, in the current market conditions, what we\u2019ve done is we tried to hold our gross margin steady while continuing to invest in certain of what we consider long-term strategic investments that will position MPS for the long term. Alessandra Vecchi : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then similarly, I apologize if I didn\u2019t hear it, but did you give any color on sort of what end markets you expect to be strongest or weakest within the Q4 guide? Bernie Blegen : When you look at Q4, there\u2019s actually a continuation of some of the positive trends that we saw in Q3 with respect to computing and storage and also with automotive. And as I said before, we think that some of industrial had to do with pull-ins. And I look at the 5G, just to echo Michael\u2019s point there, is that this is a lumpy business. And while it had down Q3, we still believe that, that end market has a lot of traction. Michael Hsing : So, the Q4 would be better. And consumer, like normal, would be slightly lower. And the other ones will keep a very similar level. Alessandra Vecchi : Very similar, okay. That\u2019s very helpful. That\u2019s it from me. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Williams of Loop Capital. Your line is open. David Williams : Thank you. And let me echo the congratulations, guys. It\u2019s an impressive quarter and guide, and happy to see that. But I was hoping you might be able to give maybe, a little more information on your 48-volt architecture, maybe, the benefits there and what that opportunity could be for you and maybe what traction that you\u2019ve already begun to see there. Michael Hsing : Okay. The 48-volt system, we started four, five years ago that we see the trend. And we \u2013 in the 48-volt system, there\u2019s many components that we ship, and we started shipment about a year ago for some power components. And for the \u2013 for converting 48 volts to the GPU, those are the products we started to win. David Williams : What do you think that total opportunity could be if we look a year or two out? What do you think the revenue potential is there? Michael Hsing : We have actually \u2013 we don\u2019t have any idea like what\u2019s the IRR and what\u2019s the artificial intelligence market, okay, and what\u2019s the market size. And for us, it\u2019s very big, and that will certainly move the MPS revenue needle. And we\u2019ve done some efforts to find out how big it can be. Certainly, hundreds of million dollars. And in the data centers, the adoption rate in the 48-volt as the income piece, we don\u2019t see many data centers going to 48 volts other than the one I can think of. They\u2019re advocating 48 volts, but that\u2019s still \u2013 their majority of servers still running at 12 volts. Bernie Blegen : David, if I can add one more comment. I think that the 48-volt is the direction that nearly all data centers, whether it\u2019s for supercomputing or for e-commerce or artificial intelligence, will be migrating to. Michael Hsing : That\u2019s what we believe. And we believe that those market segments, sooner or later, give us two or three years, they will merge to 48-volts. David Williams : Okay, excellent. And then just lastly for me. Can you comment just maybe, on the data center inventory? It\u2019s been obviously an issue. But what are you seeing now? And maybe, from your perspective, are you seeing inventory issues there? Or are you maybe, benefiting from just the design wins and company-specific drivers versus the macro? Michael Hsing : Well, if you\u2019re looking at it now, all the new product wins for us, including the \u2013 you just mentioned the 48-volt, these are new products. In the past, I\u2019ve said again and again, all these new products, our customers take a risk on new products and we\u2019re taking a risk. And we don\u2019t want to have any problem in the \u2013 during the shipping to the supply market. We don\u2019t have to have any interruption with the qualities or with all these annual issues. We want to build inventory. So, we have more material we can ship. Now, we are at the stage. We have to put a lot of effort to which \u2013 who do we ship, and we have to build more inventory. Bernie Blegen : David, were you also talking about the data centers as far as whether that was penetration in new markets? David Williams : Yes. I was just curious if there was still excess inventories within the data center that had caused some softness prior, if that had been mopped up yet. Bernie Blegen : Oh, the data center. Okay. Michael Hsing : I didn\u2019t get that. Yes. Bernie Blegen : So, I think that the way to characterize this is that \u2013 and what\u2019s interesting is that the downturn that we experienced as a result of overcapacity in the data center was broad-based. And likewise, with just our one \u2013 Q3 experience, that also was an individual customer, individual geography. It was an example of very diversified growth, both in terms of our products as well as customers. Michael Hsing : Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. David Williams : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Your line is open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to just start, and I know you probably haven\u2019t had a lot of time to go through Texas Instruments\u2019 results. But they had a pretty poor outlook, talked about, at the midpoint of their December guide, revenue being down 14%. And that\u2019s, I think, the eighth quarter in a row, where their revenue has decelerated on a year-over-year basis. So, if I use Texas Instruments as a proxy for the analog market, it certainly looks like Texas Instruments might be looking to a mid-single-digit revenue decline in 2020. And so I guess can you talk about, if the analog market is down again next year, how comfortable are you with kind of The Street consensus for 18%, 19% growth? And to the extent you\u2019re comfortable; can you give us some points, where you think you\u2019re seeing growth or where you\u2019re differentiated versus some of your broader analog peers? I know that\u2019s a big, big question, but let\u2019s start there. Bernie Blegen : Sure. At this point, we\u2019ve only had the opportunity to review the flash reports on TI. So, I am at a deficit to understand how much of the business was affected by downturn in analog versus other elements of their business. But certainly, the significance of the decrease that they projected, both from Q3 and Q4, along with the difference between them and consensus, I think they\u2019re a market driver. We found in 2019 that we\u2019re not \u2013 MPS is not immune to what the market movements are like. We continue to focus on the elements that are within our control, which is we introduce the new products. And as Michael said earlier on this call, we still continue to believe that we can outperform the market at 10 to 15 percentage points, but this market hasn\u2019t found its equilibrium yet. Michael Hsing : Yes. There is no comparison between MPS and TI, because they are so big. They are the markets. We are very small. We can\u2019t \u2013 but we do have a lot of opportunities. And so there\u2019s no comparison. But for us, our \u2013 we start building 5% to 10% of these market shares in the different segments. And \u2013 but at the same time, we\u2019re also expanding our opportunities, so that growth for us in this market segment is enormous and we \u2013 in the \u2013 we should be much less affected by the macroeconomic conditions. Quinn Bolton : Thanks, Bernie and Michael. The second question I had is, I think in the June quarter, you guys saw one customer that was over 10% of sales, and you thought that some of that activity was build ahead. You were able to provide and hit your guidance for Q3. You mentioned some additional build ahead activity in the industrial segment here in Q3 in power sources and surveillance equipment. Have you sort of factored that build ahead in Q3 into your fourth quarter guidance, meaning that if you did see some unexpected strength in build ahead demand in Q3 that you\u2019ve sort of tempered those segments in Q4 and that\u2019s still reflected in your 160 to 166 guidance? Michael Hsing : Yes. Well obviously, we\u2019re aiming for that in Q4. We don\u2019t know, but we have to be in it already for Q4. Bernie Blegen : Yes, he said it all. Michael Hsing : Okay. Quinn Bolton : Okay. So, the answer is yes? Michael Hsing : Oh, yes, yes, absolutely. Otherwise, we will miss quarter by quarter. Quinn Bolton : Got it. And then lastly, Michael, I just want to come back to 48-volt. You mentioned that you\u2019ve been sampling product, I think, for about a year. I think in the third quarter, GPUs was one of the areas, where you saw strength. And I just wanted to clarify, was that strength in GPU more from your existing 12-volt design wins? Or have you seen \u2013 was that GPU strength in Q3 from 48-volt product? Michael Hsing : No. It\u2019s \u2013 GPU is a more traditional. It\u2019s 12-volt. The 48-volt is not moving the needle yet, but we do see a healthy growth of a revenue stream coming. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Your line is open. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much. Good morning over there, guys. Michael, one relationship that my team has been watching closely that MPS has continued to grow is the relationship with Microsoft across the business. Maybe, you could \u2013 to the extent that you can, could you give us a little bit of color as to the nature of that relationship strategically and how it might benefit the different segments of the business as you move forward? Michael Hsing : Oh, sure. Yes. We don\u2019t comment on customers. But with all our customers, I \u2013 in the past, I\u2019ve said this, it doesn\u2019t mean, I don\u2019t like very cyclical business, which move our revenue up or down. And it\u2019s not as smooth as we can manage it. In that regard, I made a statement that is not my favorite, for gaming. And we want to \u2013 for our shareholders, we want to build a model that\u2019s very predictable and very predictable growth and \u2013 the top-line growth, margin growth. And so in that regard, in gaming, you have every year or every two years in that you have extra revenue, and then the next two or three quarters they start to get lower. So that is giving us difficulty. And then our customers said that this is not your favorite, and we are also listening. And in the following conference call, I clarified we love gaming, because that is still money for our shareholders, still value. And that\u2019s all in models. But that\u2019s all in business models. And as MPS grows, well, revenue grows in roughly over $600 million range. And we \u2013 in the last couple of years, we see that accelerating growth and that effect is much, much less. So, I love gaming. I love gaming. Bernie Blegen : If I can add one additional comment. While we do not talk to individual customers, one thing that I believe separates MPS from our peers and competition is that we\u2019re very responsive to our customers\u2019 requirements. So, if they have an engineering challenge, well, often than not, they turn to us in order to find a solution. And as a result, all of our customers benefit from the innovation, and the level of technology that we\u2019re bringing forward is differentiated. Michael Hsing : By the way, what we said, this is not corporate BS, our customers are telling us we provide the best support, we provide the best service. Matt Ramsay : Got it. No. I appreciate the sensitivity to the individual customer. As a follow-up question from my side, there\u2019s obviously been \u2013 not on the 5G side, but in just general, data center spending over the last 12 to 15 months, there\u2019s been some challenges. And it seems like the market now is anticipating a reacceleration in cloud spending in the server market. You guys have some great content with certain Intel-based servers, but my understanding is there\u2019s some diversity of that customer base into other computing providers. Maybe, you could talk a little bit about the data center customer base overall and how you\u2019re expecting that business to grow in the next few quarters. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think the strength of MPS is diversity. We have all kinds of different technologies that are suitable for different solutions. So, right now, we tend to think very much in terms of the e-commerce data center model. And while that model is very solid and is going to continue for several generations to come, we\u2019re seeing, as Michael mentioned earlier, the initial growth through artificial intelligence. And it\u2019s hard to really size what those market opportunities look like, but here again; we're positioned to take advantage of it. When we look at some of the applications, data center and support of 5G, we're also very well positioned and it's also very initial stage of growth. So I think that when you look at customer relationships we've developed and how adaptive our technology is for different power solutions, I think we're as well positioned as anybody to take advantage of the new developments of an evolving market. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much guys. All the best. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Thanks for the question or two. First on the 5G side, just want to understand a little bit better where you guys are playing there. Is the power management that you're doing largely for one form of processor versus another? Are you more FPGA related? ASIC related? ASSP related? Is there any kind of evolution of how you see that progress as people are a little bit worried that the FPGA side might come down and then other sorts of processors would backfill? And trying to figure out how, if that does occur, it would impact or benefit Monolithic? Michael Hsing : The answer is all of the above. I don't want to be vague, but we try to figure out where our product goes. We \u2013 just as a reminder to everybody, our products are fundamental blocks. And that's the power supply blocks. All the eyes are on value making. They all need power and our customers typically design several size of these power blocks with our products. And so when each segment from transmitters to the processing \u2013 the data processing to the communication to the fiber line, the optical line, they all need to build the power. And we \u2013 they don't \u2013 within their company we've become a standard product, standard component that their design engineers design to be in the same systems. So we actually really don't know where our product ended up. Bernie Blegen : I think you have two parts to your question here, Ross. The first is sort of we have an initial ramp and how defensible or predictable is that. And I think we've been very clear that we're in the early stages of 5G, and it's really hard to foresee how that's going to develop. But to Michael's point, as far as the long-term, when this ramp does occur, I think that we get to take advantage of all aspects of 5G and that's what we're looking forward to. Ross Seymore : Got it. My next question is it wouldn't be an earnings call at Monolithic if I didn't ask about inventory, so congratulations on that one as well. Michael Hsing : I've lost my focus in the February call after Ross. Okay, that's a fair question. Actually, we view it as a little too high still because we don't know what the market actually will do. Ross Seymore : Well, if I'm going to give you grief when it goes up, I have to congratulate you when it comes down. But not to blow too much sunshine at you guys, when you talk about it needing to go back up, how do I \u2013 one, is that a dollars or a day's comment? And secondarily, how do I reconcile kind of controlling utilization and lowering utilization with inventory rising? Bernie Blegen : Sure. So if you think about what you do to manage inventory levels and it starts with the wafer starts, so back in February, we really started to ratchet down the wafer starts. And we did that for an extended period of time [indiscernible] over the last six months. Well, those wafers are now coming into our balance sheet, we're receiving them and it's at a much lower level than we've historically seen [indiscernible]. And yes, we had at the same time, okay demand and there's a lot of good sell-through as well. So that means that our finished goods started to come back into aligning as well. So when we look at composition, we're a little bit light on the raw materials, work in process, and we're probably at about the right level of finished goods. When you look at the ramp that we expect for Q2 [Technical Difficulty] Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Chris Caso of Raymond James. Your line is open. Chris Caso : Yes, hello. Can you guys hear us now? Operator, we may have lost the management team. Operator : I believe. Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Apologize. There may be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold. The conference will resume shortly. Thank you for your patience. Speakers you may precede. Unidentified Company Representative : Bernie and Michael will back online. Operator : We'll go ahead and go to the next question. Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ross Seymore : Hi guys, can you hear me? Bernie Blegen : Yes, fine, thank you. Now it's perfect, yes. Ross Seymore : Yes. So I guess you were halfway through, and you probably continued talking even though we couldn't hear you. The inventory side of things, Bernie, you were walking through the utilization and the whip versus the raw materials versus all of that. I think the punch-line to it was what you didn't say. Does that mean that dollars of inventory are going to start going back up, days of inventory, both? And any sort of target range that you expect to get to? Bernie Blegen : Again, while we closed our range in days between 160 and 180, the fact is that we manage internally to dollars of inventory anticipating wafers starts about six months to eight months in advance of when the revenues are expected to ramp. So right now, we're starting to put wafer starts in support of business for Q2 and Q3 of 2020. And so in that regard, we expect to sort of see a replenishment on a dollar basis. And then obviously, as you look at the cyclicality of our revenues where normally Q1 is about two percentage points to four percentage points lower than Q4, that is a lower denominator, the days will also go up because of that. So my comment was really intended to talk in terms of dollars. And then I think that will have to reflect the impact on the days given our seasonality. Ross Seymore : Got it. Two relatively quick ones I just wanted to understand. One, the litigation expense seems like it's guided to be about double of what it usually is. Is that something a court case coming due? Or is it something that is one-time in nature? Or is that a new base we should be looking at? Bernie Blegen : Yes. We have... Michael Hsing : Definitely not a long time. Bernie Blegen : It's a worth one-time case, and we have a trial date coming up here in the next quarter or so. Ross Seymore : Got you. And then the last quick one is IT security camera side of things. I just wanted to \u2013 I know you commented on that earlier. But when you said that its customers who were building inventory, is that something that was meant to be a retrospective comment for the first half of this year or second quarter, whatever have you? Or did you see that as an ongoing benefit to your revenues in the third quarter? And then if so, what is it \u2013 what do you believe that will do in the fourth quarter? Bernie Blegen : Well, again, it just speaks to sort of the market uncertainty that we're all experiencing. And I think that if I look at the trend lines for industrial where we reported this revenue stream, it is then significantly higher than its normal run rate for us. And so I think you can infer that there were some pull-ins and that could have some impact on how this particular segment and market performs in the next quarter or two. Michael Hsing : We heard different messages from our customers and from our end customers. And so the good news is that they have a few new large projects and are starting to ramp, and at the same time, we also heard they're pulling in because of the tariffs. And so again, we're building very basic building blocks and we're not Intel. So we're building them a building processor, and you can see how many servers or how many PCs they built. We can help our still very small cost of the entire build of materials. Ross Seymore : Got it. All right, guys, that's it from me. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso of Raymond James. Your line is open. Chris Caso : Yes, thank you. Good evening and good morning for you guys. First question is with regard to the 10% plus customer that you had in the second quarter. It sounds like that customer wasn't a 10% customer in the third quarter. Could you give some color about what was going on there? And has the revenue level at that customer now normalized as you look forward into the Q4 guidance? Bernie Blegen : Yes. I think that we don't talk about individual customers since they get reported in our 10-Q for the Q2. We'll say that we have a number of relationships beyond this particular customer that are very broad-based and where they can have multiple product ramps that are occurring at the same time and that's clearly what transpired here. Michael Hsing : Yes. And we don't have consistent more than 10% customers. This quarter we don't have it, okay? And we don't have it. And in the past, I don't remember whether we reported it or not. There's one for a certain week and a certain period of time where they swapped all their simple things. But it can be different customers. And overall, we have a very long tail of a number of customers. That's due to our business. We build the building blocks and many customers, they can use that. Chris Caso : Got it. Thank you. I guess the last question is with respect to your goal of growing 10% to 15% above the industry, it's sort of an abstract goal that \u2013 the way I'm thinking about it, and tell me if you agree, is that you need to generate somewhere between $75 million and $90 million of incremental revenue. Perhaps your run rate business grows at the market rate, and this would be on top of that. And I guess if that's the right framework to think about it, what gets you to that? What sort of things can you point to as you look into next year that drive that visibility for that level of design win as you look into next year? Michael Hsing : Yes. It's a very simple business process and we have product line \u2013 we have sales \u2013 geographic sales group and we have a product line review there for projecting for the next couple of years and more in the longer term. And the sales is more immediate in the next few quarters. And we gather all these numbers, and the numbers, we're checking against the product line and also sales group. And also \u2013 and we see some wide swings in the last nine months due to the tariffs, due to what is modeled in the last year or so. And it's much more rougher than the previous two or three years. That's because due to the tariff, government policies and those, we cannot predict. We cannot predict. And now we're looking for next year why we can say we can do that. One is based on historical numbers and that we can always \u2013 we can do that. And what is that real theory behind it is this is more empirical than really a theory. And on the other hand, we're looking at all these sales numbers. These sales numbers are sometimes much bigger than we expected. And so we believe that, and we can grow a lot more than that. Even at the beginning of the year, in January, we forecast to grow more than 20%. But the reality is very different. So to our shareholders, we say that that's based on the historical numbers, we can grow this much. Chris Caso : All right, thank you. Michael Hsing : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bernie Blegen for any closing remarks. Sir? Bernie Blegen : Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us in this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our fourth quarter conference call, which will likely be in early February. Thank you, and have a great day. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Monolithic\u2018s CFO, Bernie Blegen. Please go ahead, sir. Bernie Blegen : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2019 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. I\u2019m joined today by Michael Hsing, Monolithic\u2019s CEO and Founder.In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today.Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2019, and Form 10-Q filed on November 1, 2019, both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com.MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margins, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q4 2018, Q3 2019 and Q4 2019 earnings releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.For the full year 2019, MPS achieved record revenue of $627.9 million, growing 7.8% from the prior year, while our industry segment experienced a significant downturn. As always, we executed our strategies consistently.In recent years, especially in 2019, more and more first-tier companies recognized MPS\u2019 superior technologies as well as our product quality and our excellent customer support.We see a lot more high-quality growth opportunities ahead of us. Our objective is to successfully manage our expenses to support our growth, which will, in turn, benefit our shareholders in both the long and short term.Here are a few highlights which we achieved in 2019. Introduced leading-edge system solutions using QSMoD technologies for GPU-based, artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.Introduced 48-volt QSMoD technology for both cloud-based and automotive applications, coupled with our design wins in QSMoD in AI applications, MPS is at the early stage of this important revenue ramp. Won a major contract to support a tier 1 automotive supplier, which will begin generating revenue in the next 2 to 3 years.Successfully co-developed cutting-edge solutions for smart driving systems and lighting applications. Began volume shipments of high current programmable power modules for communication applications such as 5G networks.Entered the high-performance analog market with the formation of a high-precision data acquisition business group. With input from our customers, we have completed the detailed product specifications. We expect to release these products in 2020.The initial revenue ramp is expected to begin in 2021. The rollout of these advanced products will mark MPS\u2019 introduction in the highly profitable, high-speed precision data acquisition market segment.We understand the road to success may not be smooth, however, we believe our commitment will pay off in the long term and our shareholders will be pleased with the results of these efforts in the coming years.Let\u2019s go through low lights. We really don\u2019t have any, except there is one item worth pointing out. We deliberately reduced our inventory in Q3 and Q4 2019, which in hindsight was not necessary. As a result, our current inventory level is too low for MPS to maximize our growth in the next few months.Although we can still keep up our growth rate as in the past, we, unfortunately, may not be able to take full advantage of all the potential upside. In order to fulfill customers\u2019 demand in the second half of 2020, we now have to commit tremendous effort in order to accelerate our schedule to bring up a second 12-inch fab. This has created an unnecessary hardship for our team.Turning back to our full year 2019 revenue by market segment compared with 2018. Communications revenue, up 20.1%. Computing and storage, up 18.9%. Automotive, up 12.8%. And industrial, up 12.3%. Consumer revenue was down 10.8%. Full year 2019 computing and storage revenue grew $30.1 million over the prior year to $189.2 million. This 18.9% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for cloud computing and high-end notebooks. Computing and storage revenue Represented 30.1% of MPS\u2019 total revenue in 2019 compared with 27.3% in 2018.Communications revenue grew $14.2 million to $84.8 million. This improvement was primarily due to initial ramping of 5G infrastructure sales. Communications revenue represented 13.5% of our 2019 revenue compared with 12.1% in 2018.Automotive revenue grew $10.2 million to $90.3 million in 2019. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive revenue represented 14.4% of MPS\u2019 full year 2019 revenue compared with 13.8% in 2018.Industrial revenue grew $10.9 million to $99.4 million in 2019. This growth reflected sales for applications in power sources, security and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented 15.8% of MPS\u2019 full year 2019 revenue compared with 15.2% in 2018.Consumer revenue fell $19.9 million to $164.2 million, with the exception of home appliances and wearables, all major consumer markets decreased between years. Consumer revenue represented 26.2% of MPS\u2019 full year 2019 revenue compared with 31.6% in 2018.Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $166.7 million, 1.2% lower than revenue generated in the third quarter of 2019, but 8.6% higher than the comparable quarter of 2018. Our market segment revenue from computing and storage grew 27.8% year-over-year.Automotive grew 8.6% and communications grew 8.5%. Industrial was essentially even with Q4 2018, while consumer revenue fell 5.7% from the prior year.Fourth quarter 2019 GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, 10 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2019, but even with margin reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our GAAP operating income was $30.7 million compared to $30.0 million reported in third quarter of 2019 and $33.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.Fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, 10 basis points lower than both the third quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018. Our non-GAAP operating income was $50.8 million compared to $51.4 million reported in the prior quarter and $46.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.Let\u2019s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $61.2 million in the fourth quarter compared with $63.1 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $51.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2019 operating expenses were $41.8 million, down from the $42.5 million we spent in the third quarter of 2019, but up from the $38.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.On both the GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2019 litigation expenses were $991,000 compared with a $692,000 expense in Q3 2019 and a $409,000 expense in Q4 2018.The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation and income or loss from an unfunded deferred comp plan.Fourth quarter 2019 stock compensation expense, including $574,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $18.7 million compared with $21.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2019.Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2019 GAAP net income was $32.4 million or $0.70 per fully diluted share compared with $0.64 per share in the third quarter of 2019 and $0.61 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.Q4 2019 non-GAAP net income was $48.4 million or $1.04 per fully diluted share compared with $1.08 per share in the third quarter of 2019 and $0.99 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2019 were 46.5 million.Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $458.5 million compared to $422.0 million at the end of the third quarter of 2019. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $61.0 million compared with Q3 2019 operating cash flow of $72.4 million. Fourth quarter 2019 capital spending totaled $8.7 million.Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2019 at $52.7 million or 29 days of sales outstanding compared with the $58.3 million or 31 days reported at the end of the third quarter of 2019 and the $55.2 million or 33 days reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 were $127.5 million, down from the $135.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Days of inventory fell to 155 days at the end of Q4 2019 from 163 days at the end of the third quarter of 2019.Before turning to our outlook for Q1 2020, I would like to remind everybody of our long-term non-GAAP financial model, which has been largely unchanged for the past 5 years.First, we target to grow revenue in a rate that is 10 to 15 percentage points greater than our peers. In a year where the market is expected to grow between 5 to 8 percentage points, we believe that MPS should be able to grow annual revenue from 15% to 20%. Second, we target quarterly gross margin to grow by 10 to 20 basis points sequentially.Third, to ensure continued growth, we target increases in our R&D and SG&A investment at 50% to 60% of the annual revenue growth rate. Finally, we expect to return 30% to 40% of the company\u2019s annual free cash flow to shareholders.This long-term financial model is an important tool in setting expectations for accelerated revenue growth and providing operating leverage while allowing for a proper level of business reinvestment.I would now like to turn to our Q1 2020 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2020 revenue in the range of $161 million to $167 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%.Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $18 million to $20 million, including approximately $600,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold.GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $58.4 million and $62.4 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $41.0 million to $43.0 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Litigation expenses to be in the range of $1.5 million to $2.5 million as NPS prepares for an upcoming trial, which is set to begin at the end of March. Interest income is expected in the range -- to range from $1.5 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 46.2 million to 47.2 million shares. Finally, we are pleased to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share from $0.40 per share for shareholders of record as of March 31, 2020.In conclusion, we will continue executing on our strategy and winning market share. I will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeremy Kwan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open. Jeremy Kwan : Yes, good afternoon. Congrats on the strong results and outlook, especially in a challenging environment. I guess my first question, regarding - you mentioned about not having sufficient inventory in hand to meet all the immediate demand you\u2019re seeing, is there a way you can kind of quantify what\u2019s kind of being left on the table? And is there a chance to capture this maybe later on in the coming quarters? Michael Hsing : All these products, which is design [indiscernible] and our customers have upside, there is - many of us - many of them, they told us. So we believe, okay, these are - these sockets are difficult to change. And they\u2019re not changing - it can change month by month, and those volumes still will be with us. Bernie Blegen : Yes. We\u2019re not trying to identify a risk factor with regard to our ability to execute against expectations. We\u2019re just saying that it would be imprudent for us to allow our investors to believe that there is even more upside beyond that because we may have some constraints with regard to inventory. Michael Hsing : Yes, our inventories, we involve a few thousand products. And very difficult to predict, which was the ramp ahead of - which ones to ramp first. And so that causes a lot of problems for our planning and also for our shipments. We\u2019re now doing partial shipment. Jeremy Kwan : Great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s helpful clarity. And I guess my follow-up would be, Bernie, you mentioned entering the high-performance analog market with the high-precision data acquisition group, can you give us more details about this, maybe you or Michael, maybe what initial application is going to go after first and how do you plan to compete in this market and maybe your sales strategy? Do you need more distribution partners or is this something that you can leverage your e-commerce platform? Thank you. Michael Hsing : The initial one is in - these initial market segments there in the communications and as well as medical applications. And we don\u2019t have a long-term strategy. I think through our Internet - through our e-commerce and we tried to push everything through e-commerce. Jeremy Kwan : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alessandra Vecchi with William Blair. Your line is open. Alessandra Vecchi : Thanks. Congratulations on a wonderful quarter. Just on 48-volt, you talked about the new product introductions in 2019 and I believe you guys said on the last earnings call that you\u2019d be seeing some revenue in Q1. Can you just update us on that and how we should think about the total revenue opportunity there as we look into 2020 and 2021? Bernie Blegen : Yes. I don\u2019t think that we guided, per se, on giving an exact revenue outlook for Q1 with beginning of 48-volt. But we said that it would be in 2020. And right now, it\u2019s - everything is tracking pretty much along our expectations.So what\u2019s really exciting is that I think that it validates our strategy to have gone into 48-volt and to enjoy and participate in many of the opportunities there it brings us. Alessandra Vecchi : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I apologize if I missed it, but Bernie, did you give us a little bit of clarity in terms of by segment in Q1. What segments maybe you thought would be the strongest sequentially? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Again, I think the broader question there is what\u2019s going to be -- what is the revenue drivers looking like. And at this point, I think it\u2019s a continuation of more of what we\u2019ve been seeing recently. So for example, the compute and storage market is very well positioned for growth in the early part of the year. Likewise, communication, we believe that there\u2019s also a significant opportunity for growth, particularly in Q1.When you look at - oh, I should make 1 asterisk on computing, notebooks, which are -- we report in computing, are seasonal. And coming out of Q4, they tend to have a seasonal decline, which we are anticipating as well. But when you look at storage or cloud computing, I think that they were very well positioned.And then after that, if you look at consumer again, that still has not hit a steady state or show any signs of being healthy. And again, consumer is also very seasonal, and it\u2019s normal to expect a decline from Q4 to Q1.And then when you look at Industrial, a lot of that was revenue performance, particularly in the second half of the year. It reflected inventory builds on the part of certain of our customers who are anticipating trade restrictions. And so that area may fall off in Q1. In automotive, that tends to go either on the plateau or when it fits designed in your new revenue opportunity, there\u2019s a spike. Alessandra Vecchi : Okay. Just on automotive, some other semiconductor companies have alluded to sort of a bottoming out improvement there. So are you seeing a similar situation? I know it depends on what model you\u2019re designed into and whatnot, but do you feel like the worst is behind you? Michael Hsing : I think that we are too small to call the industry. We are growing to all these Greenfield markets and the leasings that we say that isn\u2019t end of the world. All this is the beginning of the world. It\u2019s the beginning in the world for MPS. Alessandra Vecchi : Understood. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you so much. Michael Hsing : Thanks, Aless. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michelle Waller with Needham. Your line is open. Michelle Waller : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. So I guess the first one for me, in terms of the next-generation gaming consoles launching in 2020, could you guys walk us through what the ramp is expected to look like for MPS. Is it only a back half driver or do you think you\u2019ll see some meaningful uptick in 2Q? And from a gross margin perspective, how should we think about the impact of corporate gross margins during that ramp? Michael Hsing : Are you talking about gaming, particularly? Michelle Waller : Yes. And specifically, yes. Michael Hsing : Gaming is not a major part of our business. And that is all into the one product, is in a consumer segment, and it is in a share, the similar CPU co-power. And so the business is very lumpy. And - but we treat this very opportunistically. And our customers really like our solutions, and we will support them when the demands come. Bernie Blegen : And we probably expect to see a similar ramp as we did in 2017. Michelle Waller : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then for my follow-up, you guys mentioned previously that your dollar content opportunity with the Whitley server platform increased to $70 from $50 in the Purley platform.I\u2019m just trying to figure out - I know this is a bit further off, but with the equal stream platform that\u2019s expected to launch in 2021, how do you guys see your dollar content opportunity changing generation over generation? Or just any color you can give there would be helpful. Bernie Blegen : On the dollar content, we don\u2019t - we haven\u2019t seen an opportunity to expand beyond what we currently are getting on the V14. But then again, the specs are not entirely finalized. So if it turns out that the space of the power requirements are materially different from what V14 is, there might be an opportunity for pricing leverage. Michelle Waller : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all from me. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open. Josh Buchalter : Hey, guys. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results in a tough environment. I guess the first question was, if we think about your inventory commentary from last quarter, are there any couple of items in particular that you could point to that drove the change in your thought process from 3Q to 4Q?And then also, is there any margin impact from bringing on the new 12-inch fab and your sort of what sounds like capacity constraints? Michael Hsing : Well, we\u2019re talking about margins. And if you were 12-inch fabs, okay, every time we\u2019re bringing up a fab is and not - we will have a very immediate impact for the margin improvement. All these product - these products that are from new fab is always a year or 2 years down the road. We - in terms of which segments of where our inventory is tight and, again, it\u2019s actually across the board. Josh Buchalter : Got it. Thank you. And I guess, in the beginning of the call, you mentioned several tier 1 companies launching with your design wins. Were there any, I guess, if you could rank order 1 or 2 that you\u2019re most excited about heading into 2020? Thank you and congrats again. Michael Hsing : These are, we said it and Bernie said at the beginning of the call, so okay, these are things that were - these are the few things that we achieved in the 2019. And all of these will generate a significant revenue in 2020. Bernie Blegen : Yes, and it\u2019s not restricted to any 1 end market segment, it\u2019s actually very broad-based to the level of the customer engagement that we\u2019re receiving from Tier 1s. Josh Buchalter : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rick Schafer : Yes. Hi, guys. I\u2019ll echo everyone else\u2019s congratulations on another monolithic quarter, another great quarter. So good job. I just had a maybe question. On Coronavirus, since it\u2019s a topic, is your - you guys have 3 of your 4 production foundries in China, so I\u2019m just curious, Michael or Bernie, if you\u2019re seeing any signs of supply disruption? Or do you expect to see any signs once guys just start coming back to work next week. Michael Hsing : All the fab, as far as we know, they are all open. They are all operating. And they\u2019re in a really tight conditions, okay? And all the assemblies, same things, okay. And so far and really hasn\u2019t disrupted our supply. Bernie Blegen : And again, Rick, it\u2019s a very early stage to really fully appreciate or understand how any of our businesses will be impacted. Rick Schafer : Sure, sure. I understand. So maybe a follow-up, if I could. Just on your auto bus, I know you guys secured one of the, I think, the number 1 Tier 1 auto supplier a few months ago. I\u2019m just curious where we stand on securing the number 2 Tier 1 auto supplier.And as part of your answer, I\u2019m curious, I mean, from after you signed number 1, have you seen - is it too soon to have seen any noticeable uptick in design activity, and maybe also just a comment on China in general. I know - I\u2019d be interested. I know that it was kind of a slow year for China auto, they basically canceled\\ the design here, I think, last year or the model year. I\u2019m curious kind of what your expectations are for China this year, what you\u2019re seeing? Thanks. Michael Hsing : Well, okay. Overall, everybody told us, like, all those will not be a good year, okay? But from the NPS side, we are looking pretty good in fall of 2020. And all these number 1 and number 2 and number 3, all those and we are deeply engaged in that we see all the activities that we the more than we can handle it. And now we have to pick and choose. Rick Schafer : Got it. Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is Melissa on behalf of Ross. Congratulations on the really solid quarter. I know you guys don\u2019t guide out more than one quarter. But I guess, from a high-level perspective, now that we\u2019re coming out of this industry downturn, what are your expectations for returning to either seasonal or even above seasonal growth? Is this moderated by what - by your inventory constraints? And how are you thinking about the slip of the recovery from here? Michael Hsing : Well, you call it industrial out of the downturn came. And as you said - as Bernie said earlier, so we will grow above the industrial market, okay? Plus what\u2019s your upturn and about 10% - 15% to 20%. So we committed on that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And then does the inventory constraints, is that kind of restricting that growth prospect? Or do you think you can still kind of hit that target? Michael Hsing : We tried to - and I as we couldn\u2019t - as we said earlier, we cannot maximize it because our customers are pulling in those - pulling the requirements, okay? And so we have to keep them on line up and we have the partial shipment. And that\u2019s - our inventory is in a very low stage, okay? Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then the last one for me is your computing and storage segment has been driving really strong growth and I was just curious when you look into 2020, how are you thinking about this shape of that business?And in particular, are you worried about any risk of inventory digestion of lumpy buying or do you think that it\u2019s really strong secular growth that\u2019s driving the strength? Bernie Blegen : Yes. When you look at 2019, I think that first half of the year was an anomaly where the hyperscales were trying to digest excess capacity. And so I would see, with the V14 haven\u2019t been just recently rolled out a return to a more normalized adoption process. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you. And congratulation, again. Very nice results. First question on inventory being tight. I mean you\u2019re at 156 days. So how tight is it? I mean I know you want to run a little bit higher than that, but it doesn\u2019t seem alarmingly low either. So maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on that. Bernie Blegen : I think we\u2019re at 155 days right now. And if you were to look at sort of the industry standards, we\u2019re probably in at about the midpoint range of what people might expect. There\u2019s two things though that differentiate us. The first is the diversity of the number of products that we maintain and then the second is that we build inventories ahead of when we sell them. And as a result, because we\u2019re growing at a rate that is 10 to 15 percentage points faster than the industry that puts more pressure on us to have more inventory available in an earlier stage.So it\u2019s as much a risk management decision with the level we carry. And I think that we\u2019ve said previously that we\u2019re more comfortable with inventory levels between about 160 and 180 days. Michael Hsing : Yes. For the stagnant companies, inventory, yes, is very predictable. For the growth company and we have a particular for NPS, we have - it is not thousands, we have hundreds of projects and that they are taking off. And some of those faster, other ones the slowest, how do we pick on those? Very difficult to call. Tore Svanberg : Well, it\u2019s a good problem to have. Second question, and I always ask you this, Michael, if you could give us an update on your e-commerce business. We\u2019ve noticed that the website keeps changing. So if you could update on those, that would be great? Thanks. Michael Hsing : The e-commerce side, okay, other than MPS website, e-commerce and we\u2019re still learning from that one, okay. But our product to sell to the third party e-commerce site is doing really well.And so as a result of our learning and we\u2019re changing it. You\u2019ve seen that on our website. And so far, we can\u2019t give you the significant number yet, okay? But our views at 2020, end of 2020, I think that they will move some needles. Tore Svanberg : Great. So at least, you\u2019re now seeing that the traffic really moving in the right direction, it sounds like. Michael Hsing : Yes. The key is the traffic. But yes, your key is the traffic. So we can - I can give you analogies in a, we believe again, a year ago, we believe that there\u2019s a lot of fishing in the Pacific Ocean. So we dropped the fish in the middle of Pacific Ocean, we didn\u2019t comment anything.And our learning, we\u2019re fishing what kind of fish, where are they? We\u2019re a lot more targeted. So we went through - we have gone through that phase, okay? We\u2019re not a lot more targeted now. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Make sure you have enough date. Last question on the eMotion business, if you could also update us there, including, obviously, your system-level motor products? Michael Hsing : Yes. So the model is that the intended is just not selling the models motors and intended to provide a convenience for our customers for the initial ramp. So okay, we - those business at the very beginning, and I go through, we see quite a few orders from our Internet and then, typically, those customers are going very slow.And I mean, that - their project takes a year and 1.5 years and it - to ramp. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re selling a silicon piece, okay? And usually models for the guys that takes about 3 or 4 years.And in terms of eMotion, we have - I don\u2019t know what - Bernie, maybe you can say that, okay, $20-some million this year, more than $20 million - last year, $20-some million. This year, we\u2019re going to keep up a similar growth rate. And that - so we\u2019ll be - certainly would be a $30 million or $40 million. Bernie Blegen : I think that we\u2019re comfortable in saying that it can be a $30 million or $40 million business here in the next few years. I think, though, that Michael makes a very good point as far as the length of time between adoption and when you actually generate revenue, many of those applications, almost have characteristics similar to automotive. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Congratulations again. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Bernie Blegen for any closing remarks. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our first quarter 2020 conference call, which will likely be in April. Thank you, and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call to Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter 2020 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today's call.In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020 which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call.We will be discussing gross margins, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to financial measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2019, Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.Before going through our financial results, I would like to acknowledge the difficult circumstances we are all operating under. At MPS, we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our employees, our suppliers and our customers. At the same time, we remain focused on the need to execute at the highest level possible. Our worldwide efforts are reflected in our continuing level of innovation and customer support.In response to the news of extreme shortages of medical equipment, MPS rose to the occasion to fight the global pandemic. As described in our recent press release, MPS developed and assembled an emergency ventilator prototype in a matter of days leveraging a MIT open-source design concept. We demonstrated our technological superiority and deep system application knowledge to showcase our capability to advance from a component provider to a solution provider in a short period of time.We believe we can help our customers to do the same by taking advantage of MPS' vast and diversified product portfolio, which is highly programmable, flexible and feature-rich. We are also encouraged by the excitement we have received from our existing and potential customers that will lead to many promising opportunities in the medical device industry.Turning now to our financial results. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $165.8 million, 17.3% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. MPS continues to benefit from our technology leadership and diversified multi-market strategy.Looking at our revenue by market. In our computing and storage market, first quarter 2020 revenue of $52.0 million increased $12.8 million or 32.6% year-over-year. First quarter 2020 computing and storage revenue represented 31.3% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue compared with 27.7% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year revenue increase primarily reflected sales growth for cloud-based servers and storage.First quarter 2020 communications revenue of $27.9 million rose $5.7 million or 25.6% from the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year revenue increase primarily reflected higher 5G networking sales. Communications revenue represented 16.8% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue compared with 15.7% in the first quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 industrial revenue of $25.2 million increased 18.3% from the first quarter of 2019 and accounted for 15.2% of our total first quarter revenue. The increase over the first quarter of 2019 primarily reflected games and smart meters and security applications.First quarter 2020 automotive revenue of $23.3 million grew 13.6% over the same period of 2019, representing 14.1% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products.First quarter of 2020 revenue from consumer markets of $37.4 million decreased $700,000 or 1.9% from the same period of 2019. The year-over-year revenue decrease reflected continuing reductions in demand for set-top boxes and flat-panel TVs. Consumer revenue represented 22.6% of our Q1 revenue compared with 27.0% contribution in the first quarter of 2019.GAAP gross margin was 55.2%, 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 and flat with the first quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $31.0 million compared with $30.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the first quarter of 2020, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, matching the fourth quarter of 2019, but 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2019.Our non-GAAP operating income was $45.9 million compared to $50.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating expenses were $60.5 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $61.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2020 operating expenses were $46.1 million, up from the $41.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase primarily reflected higher Q1 payroll taxes and increased investment in new products.The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense including approximately $600,000 charge to cost of goods sold was $18.6 million compared with $18.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019.Switching to the bottomline. First quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $35.8 million or $0.77 per fully diluted share compared with $32.4 million or $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our Q1 2020 tax provision of minus 22% was due to a one-time discrete tax benefit resulting from stock compensation. First quarter 2020 non-GAAP net income was $44.3 million or $0.95 per fully diluted share compared with $48.4 million or $1.04 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2020 were 46.7 million.Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $492.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020, compared with $458.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $51.4 million compared with operating cash flow of $61.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $10 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2020 $54.3 million or 30 days of sales outstanding, up one day from 29 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was $131.5 million, up from the $127.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Days of inventory increased to 161 days at the end of Q1 2020, compared with 155 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2020. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $167 million to $173 million. We also expect the following. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.02% to 55.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.3% to 55.9%. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $60.9 million and $64.9 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $43.4 million to $45.4 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Total stock-based compensation expense of $18.1 million to $20.1 million, including approximately $600,000 that will be charged to cost of goods sold. Litigation expenses are expected to range between $1.7 million to $2.1 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.7 million to $1.9 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 45.8 million to 47.8 million shares.In conclusion, we are not immune to the macroeconomic reality. But our long term growth prospects remain intact. We will continue to execute to our plan and are prepared to manage volatility of future customer demand.I will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead, Tore. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you Michael and Bernie and congratulations on these results in a very challenging environment. First question and you maybe this is a bit philosophical but innovative companies tend to gain a lot of share during a downturn. We are obviously in a downturn. I was just wondering, Michael, if there are certain things that you are looking at to obviously come out of this even stronger than going into this? Michael Hsing : Tore, you remember the history. great. We tend to -- Tore Svanberg : Michael, you are breaking up. Michael, you are breaking up unfortunately. Michael Hsing : Can you hear me? Tore Svanberg : Yes. You might go to the handset instead of the speaker. Michael Hsing : Sure. Tore Svanberg : There you go. You are fine. Michael Hsing : Okay. Can you hear me now? Tore Svanberg : Yes, we can. Yes, it's much better. Michael Hsing : All right, okay. Yes, as I stated earlier, Tore, if you remember MPS' history, because you do cover those things since day one of MPS become a public company. And somehow, we tend to do that. And in the downturn, we tend to do well and relatively in the normal times, we are just as good as just everybody else. But the percentage of growth tend to be slightly slower or slightly lower. And how we achieved, I think is that we don't really, our target is many years out. And regardless of the downturns or upturns, we are very consistent. So it's not like other company maybe because they have all the large market share and they tend to react to a shorter term. So if you can think about it and the philosophy and we will tend to well during a downturn. Tore Svanberg : That's very helpful. And on a similar topic, but more specific, your e-commerce business. I do appreciate it's taken a while to get that up and running. But in this sort of virtual environment we live in, I would think that a business like that would be very, very welcome. So maybe you can elaborate a little bit on what's been going on, on that front? Michael Hsing : Well, as I said in last quarter, we said e-commerce, like we kind of drop a hook in the Pacific Ocean. There is a lot of fish there. But we didn't hook that. Too many things and all of that. So we are still in the early stage. However, in the last couple of months, we launched ventilators. That attracted so many of new customers or new potential customers and it overwhelmed us. And it's kind of a surprise to us. I think that we are a small company and we are relatively new company and people don't know us. Just we need time and we need to learn how to do it. Tore Svanberg : That's great. One last question for Bernie. Bernie, you talked about the computing and storage business being up quite dramatically year-over-year. Some other players in the space obviously are talking about similar strength. Did you get a sense that there is some pull-in activity going on there? Intel, for instance, they talk about obviously the second half being weaker than the first half. Any color you can add on that would be great. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think we are seeing a pattern that's probably consistent with other companies who have exposure to either 5G or data center or to notebooks as there is continuing investment in order to service the work from home aspect of the economy right now. So there has been a lot of activity, particularly in storage, particularly in data center and we are seen a continuing level of investment also in 5G. Again, as with any expectation of what the second half of look like, obviously, this is a challenging environment and we normally only forecast one quarter ahead. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Congratulations again. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead, Matt. Josh Buchalter : Hi. This is Josh Buchalter, on behalf of Matt. Thanks for taking my question. I hope everyone is hanging in there okay. I know you guys love questions on inventory. But given all the moving parts on both the supply and demand side, could you update us about how you feel and your comfort level after last quarter you sort of lamented bringing levels down? It would be helpful to hear an update on your visibility into both your on books and in the channel. Thanks. Michael Hsing : Well, in the last couple of quarters, we said that our bookings are very good and it is still is. And we have inventory problems, the problem to related to and deliver to our customers up and above. And this issues and this growth of this year, we didn't say is from the last couple quarters. We said it a lot earlier. But our macro market have some uncertainty and we were so criticized we have a way inventory. So last December, we took a step and reduced our inventory. And now, barely we can do beyond our forecast. So the condition is even more murkier now. And we had to just react accordingly. Bernie Blegen : And if I can add to Michael's good point there is that through the challenges that we are facing in the economy right now, as you can see that we continue to operate at nearly 100% capacity both in terms of our supply chain as well as our internal operations. Now, I do not want to minimize those challenges and anyway take away from a lot of very difficult and hard effort on the part of a lot of employees that made that all happen. But so far, we have had minimal disruptions to the supply chain. Josh Buchalter : Yes. Thank you. I appreciate all the color. And then as my follow-up, are you able to provide any color on your expectations by segment for the second quarter? Thanks and congratulations on the stellar results. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I can take this one quickly on the numbers front is, is responded to the earlier question is that I believe that much of the growth that we expect to enjoy, should come from the computing and storage as well as in 5G. There is a weakening in demand in traditional consumer and also in automotive. Michael Hsing : Here is, as added, okay. We try to have a very diverse growth. And my job is, if I do the best job, is for you guys not to know which segment is the growth. And we want to so diversify and you don't know which side, which one and we occupy a very small percentage of each market. And look at the consumer and actually within the consumer, there is a lot of fundamental shift. We shift from traditional TV set-top box and which still have some percentage and within that we have a huge change. We chose to do a much higher high-end of our consumer products and as well the Internet of Things. Josh Buchalter : Thanks guys. Bernie Blegen : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Go ahead, Quinn. Quinn Bolton : Hi guys. Let me offer my congratulations on the nice results and outlook. You guys are significantly outperforming a number of the analog peers sequentially and certainly year-over-year. And I think that that we have seen a number of the analog peers talk about in there forecast, I think they refer to seeing some customers buying ahead or building inventory. And just wondering if you might be able to address that specifically on the compute and 5G side? I know you mentioned that auto and consumer is softening. So maybe just kind of go through just whether you think there is there is any buy ahead activity that may be influencing second quarter guidance? And then I have got a follow-up. Michael Hsing : Yes. And of course, we are concerned. It's like a toilet paper effect, right. Just a few months ago, all the shelf and the toilet papers are gone. I mean and whether we have see the same kind of effect on us, we really don't know. In some of the areas like in PCs and data centers have a surge. But we kind of expected that. And other ones in the consumer area and it's actually slower than our expectations. But we have to be quick on the feet and we have to react quickly. And in the meantime, we ship as much as we can. Quinn Bolton : Got it. And then just looking in that data center business, I think Intel has recently canceled the Cooper Lake processor generation to focus on the 10 nanometer Ice Lake to launch late this year. Just wondering if that's had any impact on the Whitley ramp as if you see it? Or are you seeing pretty good design activity, either for existing Purley systems or the initial ramp of Whitley just over the balance of the year? Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Good question. So are experience has been showing that we are receiving the same level of customer engagement. And that going back to Michael's point about Q2, that the level of order momentum has continued unabated, regardless of the product change, the change in the product cycle. So at this point, we may not have the full benefit of how end demand will be shaped by this change. But I don't see any early indicators that give me pause. And one other thing to make this specific is going back to Michael's point on being diversified. The business model is not dependent on any individual product launch or the timing. So as I said, that's the advantage of our diversified portfolio. Quinn Bolton : Great. Congratulations again guys. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead, Chris. Chris Caso : Yes. Thank you. First question is just regarding product cycles for the year. And I would imagine much like last year, there is a certain part of the business, a large part of the business, which is just driven by product cycles getting customer designs out the door and another portion of it which is related to run rate business. So perhaps that might be affected by downtick in demand. Could you characterize the business? What parts would be more driven by product cycles? What parts would be driven more by run rate demand? And take a look and give us some sense of f how that plays out through the second half? Michael Hsing : The second half, okay, look, it's not just a philosophical rate, it's not very clear, okay. But our customers' demand is as high as ever. But we divided and we engage our customers in a variety of assignments. And so when they ramp up and it's kind of very short notice, a few and when they test the market and their market is reacting well then they have a huge ramp. And so that's why we need enough inventory to support these new product win. And to answer your question of which particular market segment, in the last couple months, there is the total ship target, the engagement with the customer's total ship in the medical field now. And a lot of parts and a lot of inquiries and all this is particularly helped by the ventilator is totally to our surprise. And at the same time, we didn't expect the computing ramp as this much, okay. And it's just and particularly in the memory side, in the memory power, what is the Bernie, SMD? Bernie Blegen : Yes, SMD. Michael Hsing : Yes. So that's our scenario now. And going forward, we are not very clear. And I know that if the new trend is you can work from home and you can work remotely and the cloud computing, the data center, the communication will keep going on. And we are accelerating. Chris Caso : Thank you. I am sorry. Bernie Blegen : I am sorry. I just had two small thing to add to that is that on the notebooks, seasonally, those are driven where you have a high Q3 and Q4 and then it tails off. But we see nothing in the aside from cyclical changes there. And then obviously, we have a gaming console that will start to ramp here in the end of the Q2. Chris Caso : That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, you talked about qualifying some new capacity on 300 millimeter into the second half. Could you give us an update on that? And you know, in the current environment has there been any change to your plans or your need for that capacity either greater or less? Michael Hsing : Yes. If we see some push outs, it is above and beyond. And if they don't have those push out we are even in deep trouble. And in terms of a customer relationship, not in terms of delivery the numbers. And we are working very hard. We try very hard to bring up another fab and as you know that this is not like an overnight, okay, at least take the half years. And I think that we can meet our demand and qualify some of the high runners. Bernie Blegen : Yes. We should be able to qualify the high runners before the end of this year and actually be shipping from that fab. Chris Caso : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead, William. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Michael and Bernie, congrats on the good result and outlook. Michael, you mentioned at the start of the call, a transition from a component to a solutions company and you highlighted the ventilator as an example. But at the Analyst Day, you also showed several things that looked like a precursor to this in a way, not only e.Motion, but these programmable modules. And I wonder if there is anything more sort of quantitative that you could disclose to us in terms of revenue or growth or designs or orders as it relates to that what we might describe as a transition or a new leg of growth to the business? Michael Hsing : Yes. We haven't really prepared a qualitative numbers to use. And as a business, that type of a business, we have to think about how we how we disclose it very accurately to our investors. And it is clearly that trend and we want to make our solutions like our product, a chip-based solution is really ease-of-use. That is the trick. And to lot of like power supplies, lot of motor controls, okay, motion controls and even for the power supply for the data center, lot of technology are maturing, okay. What is on top of that? It's really a plug-in place solution. And you want to take away all the design effort from our customers. And in terms of, maybe Bernie, our modules are doing really well, right? Our modules and if you are talking about only power modules, so we from two, three years ago, like in single low digit million dollars of sales, we now at least of $35 million, $40 million in last year. And that number is great. This is the fastest the growth in percentage wise in MPS revenue streak. Bernie Blegen : I think I would probably add to that, if I can, that Mike was exactly right, that we haven't really articulated a financial model where we can quantify it in a way that would be meaningful to you. I agree with Michael's assessment of how we are doing with power modules. The thing that I would add though is, whether you are looking at programmability, you are looking at e-commerce solution, you are looking at e.Motion or the power modules integrated solutions that we were just talking about it, it's all about an overarching strategy as far as how to differentiate and leverage all of our multiple technologies and differentiate ourselves in the market. William Stein : Well, that's helpful. If I can have a follow-up, please. I think last quarter, you talked a little bit about a new area that the business was on investing in and that was high performance converters. I am wondering if you can provide an update on design wins, revenue, any sort of traction that we could think about there. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. That group will be joining and they brought in opportunity. We have six, seven guys joining the company and they brought in opportunities. We have the customers, okay, now. And they engage with the customers for the medical companies for a while. And so actually we don't any significant inputs, not a change. And I think that we work with these kind of things that takes about, this is very unusual, okay. So it takes less than a year, we can some results. Usually our product, even internal developments and the ground-up development, we are taking about two or three years to see anything. And this one is, okay, so far is looking good. William Stein : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you so much. Our next question is from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Rick. Rick Schafer : Thank you and congratulation to you guys. In a tough time, you continue to execute. I guess my first question, talking about tough times. I know everybody's seen IHS forecast auto SAAR, I think, down over 20% this year. You guys obviously have a content and it's a pretty significant share gains in that vertical. Do you look at that this year and say that that's enough to offset down, let's say, 20% SAAR? I mean, could your auto revenues be flat for the year? Could they grow in this kind of environment? Michael Hsing : I think that we look at our history, okay. And we can tag on what is your macro economy segment growth in a downwards in our segment. And we are confident enough, we can say that we can beat it by 10%. Bernie Blegen : Yes. We got an education in 2019 when there was a complete falloff in production in China and a soft demand in North America and Europe in particular. So I think if you use that as a guide, you can say that the SAAR was down but we were able to grow at about 13%, 14% last year. So to Michael's point is, you cannot apply whatever you think the market is going to do and we are going to outperform by a minimum of 10 percentage points. And last year, it's closer 20%. Rick Schafer : Great. And then just pivoting into 5G and just maybe if you could provide an update on your 5G ramp opportunity? Maybe give us sense of the MPS dollar opportunity in a macro base station? And part of my question, I am just curious, it seems like such a massive opportunity for you guys. Could 5G be as big as server for you if we fast forwarded two or three years? Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. That's a good question. And I only can tell you this. We know 4G, we were out the door. We didn't have any chance. And this the first time we engage with a variety of customers and the ODMs and OEMs and event their suppliers. And so we engage both side, okay. And the real telecom companies and also their supply. And all we see of the opportunity is that we have never seen it before. How big the market is, okay? And we cannot quantify and I am not trying to tell we are in the dark here. We are new. We are a newcomer. And all I know, the opportunity is huge and we don't even try to quantify what's the opportunity. And we all notice as long it is very big. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And I think you were asking for guidance on the dollar content for the base station. And Michael was correct that we don't have a number. We are too new. Michael Hsing : Yes. I can tell you why we don't, okay. In a particularly and which segments of the 5G. Our product is in the building box of a 5G. So if you think about it as a brick for the building. And our product there is the standard product in those company and that's going to be use everywhere. Rick Schafer : Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Go ahead, Kamil. Kamil Mielczarek : Hi. Congratulations on strong results in this uncertain environment. Can you tell me how design win activity has been trending during the pandemic versus your expectations? And how do you balance growth and margin in this environment? What levers you have to maintain or potentially expand gross margin? Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes. The gross margin obviously wiggles a little bit on the sideways in the second half of last year and we are not happy about it. But we try to be very consistent. And given the macro conditions, it kind of makes sense to us. But the new product, particularly the new product is slower. It's ramped at a pretty good rate. But in some of the higher value product it was slower. So that's why the margins go. But in the long term and the margin will steadily go up. Kamil Mielczarek : And first part of the question was design activity? Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. Sorry, forgot about it. That was a very good question. And obviously normal activity slow down which doesn't impact us, okay. We are very much used to it in a work form from outside office. And we still very much engage with our customer but in a very different way, okay, very different market segments. Lot of them relates to medical equipment. And we shift our head where MPS in the past was always a pretty fast on the feet. And so we shift all our interests and we support those customers. But it's not like a normal business now. Bernie Blegen : One thing I can add to that is that interestingly our operations and our customers' operations in China and in Asia came back online about a month ago. And so not going to try to say that our business as usual. But in the area of the world where we have up to 90% of our employees including a large share of our design professional as well as a majority of our end customer engagement, we were actually seeing a good cadence, good momentum. And as Michael said, on the U.S. front where we are still in the shelter in place, both in our Washington and in our San Jose offices, we have developed over the last several years the ability to both do field application engineering and customer engagement via Zoom and we are fairly competent of that. Michael Hsing : Bernie, it's not like 90%. It more like a 60% some percent, okay. Yes, we do have a testing and a reliability center that's in China, but in terms of the number of people, Asia, across the Asia, including Japan and most of the U.S. and Europe is okay, including Japan, probably as some percent, okay. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Michael Hsing : Yes. So we are more diverse across the world. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our next question is from Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities. Kevin Garrigan : Hi guys. This is Kevin Garrigan, on for Hans. Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on the results. Just one quick one for me and my apologies if you had alluded to this already. You had mentioned that you are seeing minimal supply disruptions and that's driving good momentum with your Chinese customers. Can you give us any color in terms of if you are seeing any demand disruption? Michael Hsing : I don't know it was the Chinese customers. Did we say that, may be, okay. That's a misunderstanding, okay. And Bernie, you want to say that, okay? Bernie Blegen : Yes. As far as any demand disruption occurring, we haven't seen any cancellation of projects or push-outs in orders in a material basis. Obviously, the duration of the macro environment is not understood right now. So we are very sensitive to seeing any early warning signs that we need to react to in this volatile environment. But as at this point in time, we have not seen a step down in demand on a broad base. There are some pockets that we mentioned in an earlier answer. Kevin Garrigan : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you Kevin. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Williams with Loop Capital. Please go ahead, David. David Williams : Hi. Good afternoon and congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the question as well. I just wanted to see if you had any color on maybe the console launches that are expected, you said, in the second half. How do you think that will ramp? Do you have a sense of what the demand is going to look like or what those volumes could potentially be? Michael Hsing : Yes. We have a pretty good knowledge but I cannot say that, okay. But that business is very cyclical, okay. And that's a very, for MPS is good money. And for stock value, okay, it's very contrary to what we do. It is very cyclical and that it ramp up and it buys once a year and for most of the year, they don't do anything, okay. And we have, after that, we had to fill up the gas. We have done pretty good in the last two or three years. But as the revenue keep growing, that will be a small part of our MPS business. David Williams : Great. Thank you. And then just kind of thinking about the comm segment and the design wins and maybe design activity there. Are you seeing a broader base of designs outside of maybe Huawei or some of the other larger companies? Just kind of can you talk about where your seeing the most potential or the most opportunity there? Bernie Blegen : Sure. And if you look worldwide as far as where a lot of the deployment is, it is in those China and South Korea right now. Europe and North America has been a little slower. So most of our design engagement for now has been in the lab as opposed to actually being commercially rolled out. David Williams : Okay. Great. Sorry, go ahead. Michael Hsing : No. I just wanted to clarify, we don't employ any customers in our core. And we disclosed that we have large customers, okay. And by rules, okay. So in the 5G, as I said earlier, we engage not only one, okay and many different kind of different like telephone companies. We are also engaged with many different of their space. David Williams : Okay. Very good. And then lastly for me is, if you are thinking about the rest of the year and even the second quarter perhaps, what are your largest unknowns or potential hurdles that you kind of think about, areas of weakness could be seen? Or what are the areas, I guess, that you are most either troubled or concerned with or I guess paying most attention to, through the back of the year here? Michael Hsing : [indiscernible]. Bernie Blegen : Michael, you are breaking up again. I am sorry. You are breaking up. Michael Hsing : I will give you a philosophical joke, okay. Have a joke. We really worry about toilet paper effect. And it's actually, we don't know, then again the demands are very good for the second half of the year. And using, so as we do, okay. And when everything is good, they cancel and over order. And we won't see it, okay. Of course we try very hard, okay, to find what is the real reason, okay. And so far, we have a very good, that's what we try to do, okay. And until our customers start screaming at it. And then we are shipping a product. Bernie Blegen : Yes. So as opposed to a concern of a rapid fall off, right now we are managing is the toilet paper effect where there is so much in badgering the demand we want to make sure that we are not building inventory on in the channel or in the distributor's warehouses. And the way we do that is we don't ship to the level that they requested. And then if they really do have a stock outage where they are going to lines down, we will hear about it quickly and respond to that. So that's the issue that we are managing now as far as looking beyond that. Maybe we will have better guidance or outlook next quarter. David Williams : Okay. Well, thanks so much. I appreciate. And the best of luck. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back to Bernie Blegen for his final remarks. Bernie Blegen : Right. Thank you very much. I would like to thank you all for joining us in this conference call. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which will likely be at the end of July. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's program. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Genevieve Cunningham : Welcome everyone to the MPS Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q2 2020 financial results and guidance for Q3 2020, followed by a Q&A session. Analysts you are currently muted. [Operator Instructions] In the course of today's webinar, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and, other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings including our Form 10-K filed on February 28th, 2020 and our Form 10-Q filed on May 11th, 2020, which are accessible through our website www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D, and SG&A expense, operating income, interest, and other income, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2019, Q1 2020, and Q2 2020 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks Gen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $186.2 million, 12.3% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and 23.3% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. Second quarter revenue growth was broad-based except for automotive. Our strong year-over-year revenue growth for 2020, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, was a result of our diversified growth strategy and our technological innovation. Maintaining this level of superior performance and realizing future growth opportunities requires us to step up investments in capacity, infrastructure, quality assurance, and headcount. We are also expanding our operating capabilities outside China. Turning now to our second quarter 2020 revenue by market. Second quarter computing and storage revenue of $64.1 million increased $12.1 million or 23.3% from the first quarter of 2020. Computing and storage revenue represented 34.4% of MPS' second quarter revenue. The sequential revenue increase reflected strength in storage revenue along with increased notebook revenue. Second quarter server revenue maintained the elevated levels achieved in the first quarter of 2020 and server revenue was significantly higher than the second quarter of the prior year. Second quarter consumer revenue of $47.7 million increased 27.4% from the first quarter of 2020 and represented 25.6% of our second quarter 2020 revenue. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected improved sales of products for home applications, IOT, gaming consoles, and VOT, a new acronym which stands for a Variety of Things. Second quarter 2020 communications revenue of $30.1 million was up by 8.0% from the first quarter of 2020. Product sales for communications infrastructure, including 5G networking increased sequentially as did sales of legacy router and wireless applications. Communications sales represented 16.2% of our total second quarter 2020 revenue. Second quarter industrial revenue of $26.6 million, increased 5.4% from the first quarter of 2020, as increased revenue for power sources more than offset a decrease in security based product sales. Industrial revenue represented 14.3% of our total second quarter 2020 revenue. Second quarter automotive revenue of $17.8 million, fell 23.7% from the first quarter of 2020, as the number of automotive OEMs shut down production for most of the quarter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The range of applications MPS and encompasses now includes infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. Again, we believe MPS is well positioned to accelerate growth in automotive when the market returns. Automotive revenue was 9.5% of MPS' total second quarter 2020 revenue. I should point out that despite the past four months of COVID-related travel restrictions, our design activities remain largely unimpacted by the pandemic and have exceeded our expectations across the board. We have seen solid engagement particularly with top tier customers. These new and continuing customer relationships position MPS for long-term success in these critical markets. GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2020 and flat compared with the second quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $28.0 million compared to $31.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2020 and $20.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 55.7%, up 20 basis points from the gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $53.0 million compared to $45.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $43.7 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $60.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP second quarter 2020 operating expenses were $50.7 million, up from the $46.1 million we spent in the first quarter of 2020, and up from the $40.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarter as discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense including approximately $642,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $21.0 million, compared with the $18.6 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $30.2 million, or $0.64 per fully diluted share compared with $35.8 million, or $0.77 per share in the first quarter of 2020 and $20.7 million, or $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $50.6 million, or $1.08 per fully diluted share, compared with $44.3 million, or $0.95 per share in the first quarter of 2020, and $41.9 million, or $0.92 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2020 were $46.8 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $515.4 million at the end of second quarter of 2020, compared to $492 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $59.3 million, compared with Q1 2020 operating cash flow of $51.4 million. Second quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $14.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2020 at $55.1 million, representing 27 days of sales outstanding, which was three days lower than the 30 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and six days lower than the 33 days in the second quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2020 were $152.1 million, up from the $131.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Days of inventory of 166 days at the end of the second quarter of 2020 were five days higher than at the end of the first quarter of 2020. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2020. As we are still in the midst of COVID pandemic, demand visibility for the remainder of the year is not as crisp as we usually see at this point in the year. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $200 million to $210 million. We also expect the following; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 55.8%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%, total stock-based compensation expense of $21.2 million to $23.2 million including approximately $700,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $70.7 million and $74.7 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be in the range of $50.2 million to $52.2 million. Litigation expense should range between $1.8 million and $2.2 million, interest income is expected to range from $1.5 million to $1.7 million, and fully diluted shares to be in the range of 46.5 million to 47.5 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to grow year-over-year. We are excited about our design activities in the pipeline and expanding our reach in the new frontiers. I will now open the webinar for questions. Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. Analyst, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you. Michael and Bernie congratulations on another very strong quarter. Before I get into the near-term stuff, you did mention something at the beginning there that you are exploring some operations outside of China. I'm not talking about design centers here, but are you working on something else on the manufacturing side outside of China at this point? Michael Hsing : Yes. We try to expand another fab and we're exploring another 12-inch fabs, okay, as well as a 8-inch fab outside of China. Tore Svanberg : Okay, very good. And as we look at the September quarter and congratulations on getting to $200 million in quarterly revenue, could you maybe talk a little bit about some of the end markets that's going to drive that growth? I mean, I'm sure the storage and server business is going to continue to remain strong. But maybe give us the puts and takes on each end market going into the September quarter? Michael Hsing : Yeah. Tore, our product is a very fundamental use of building blocks, okay? And we supply all these power to power management for all electronic devices and including automotive. And now one segment clearly in this pandemic and everybody knows the infrastructures for telecommunications and data centers and as well as IoTs and the PCs and they'll grow. And MPS okay just supply these are building blocks for all these segments. And as Bernie said earlier other than automotive all segments are doing well. Bernie Blegen : Very broad based. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Just one last question. The DSO is pretty low now Bernie. And I mean, I assume that's just purely linearity. Anything else going on there? Bernie Blegen : No. I think we've always had a very good track record with credit and collections and the 27 days in the quarter really is a reflection of how front-loaded the initial sales were in Q2. Tore Svanberg : Congratulations again. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you, Tore. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Tore. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Thank you, and let me echo my congratulations. I guess Bernie, you made some comments about visibility being a little bit less clear today than in years past, obviously COVID it's understandable with the COVID outbreak. But I guess you guys have had a very strong sort of first three quarters of the year including guidance for September. Just wondering can you talk to us about your thoughts on the sustainability of this demand? Or are there certain factors perhaps the game console ramp that may be leading to some particular strength in the September quarter that may soften seasonally as we look out beyond the September quarter? And then I've got a follow-up. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think that just given the nature of the current macro environment where we did benefit from accelerated ordering patterns, particularly in -- at the end of Q1 that we don't want to become complacent, because we have seen falloffs in demand after we've had a big run-up like we just experienced. So it isn't that we're seeing anything specifically in the market that causes us concern, but just past experience tells us that it's something that we have to monitor. Michael Hsing : Yes. The Bernie's comment was very similar to our statement in the Q1 and Q2, okay? We didn't -- we expect at the time that all segment will grow including automotive. And so what is the magnitude of the growth is to our surprise. And even during the first couple of quarters, we -- first quarter, we mentioned again we have more order than we can ship. And so now we're going to second half of this year's the macro conditions to us is not very much -- it's not unsettled. And so we will prepare to change quickly. And -- but overall orders are still very good. Bernie Blegen : And one last thing just to follow-up on Michael's comment there is that in the beginning of the year, we did have concerns about supply chain capacity. And we've lowered that risk, but that's still an issue that is requiring ongoing management. Quinn Bolton : Understood. And then longer term, you mentioned you're positively surprised by the strength of the design activity particularly with Tier 1s. I'm sure you're not going to name customers, but are there a couple of applications you might be able to highlight for us that you're really excited about over the next year or two? Michael Hsing : It's -- a couple of them clearly is 48 volts and as we talk about it and the other one is in the data centers business. And also as Bernie mentioned earlier in automotive, we engaged with heavily and a lot of activity in ADAS. Bernie Blegen : And I think to keep in mind that in a lot of the markets that Michael just listed is that, we are relatively small players. So we have a lot of upside greenfield opportunities that should continue to drive our growth for the next two to three years at least. Quinn Bolton : You bet. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter from Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open. Joshua Buchalter : Good day, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results. I wanted to begin with storage and computing update. Given the size of the upside, I was a bit surprised to see server not called out as a driver of sequential growth. Could you maybe provide some granularity on was this a function of -- in 1Q was just such a high watermark? Or was there anything else going on within that market that allowed it to grow less than the other ones? Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes. Server growth is not a surprise to us. And we talk about it in the past quarters. And we expected a growth from -- say from a year ago. And this year we will grow substantially from last year. So there is no surprises. And so our product is as I remind everybody, it's still a power supply and we're powering up the CPUs and powering up all the electronics electronic devices using a server. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And I think we tried to add some color to that in the prepared comments by saying that, we enjoyed a noteworthy step up between Q1 and Q2 or Q4 and Q1 and we maintain that same high level in Q2. So when you look at the year-over-year server is one of our largest year-over-year growth drivers. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Great, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on these very strong results. I'm wondering if Bernie you can talk to us about backlog versus turns expectations. I think last quarter we had this sort of special situation where you essentially guided for negative net turns, maybe you can confirm my recollection and clarify what guidance implies in that regard for Q3. Bernie Blegen : I think that the term that we referred to at the end of Q1 was the toilet paper effect that there was an outsized ordering pattern in the last four weeks of March and so we had to take Q2 to more closely understand what that represented. And after we went customer-by-customer and geography to geography, we found out that there were a couple of drivers, well 3. The first was, that there was a increase stepped up increase in demand and particularly as it relates to work from home applications. And so that included storage and 5G and notebooks and then as I said earlier continued strong ordering within automotive. But there was also an acceleration of demand where the distributors and customers wanted to get in line to make sure that they were not. So what we've had to do is a very close evaluation to make sure that we don't let the channel inventories rise too much because of over-enthusiasm. But at this point, we enter this quarter again with a similar backlog profile, as we had last quarter meaning that there's low no reliance on turns business in order to meet our expectations. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Our assumption, the toilet paper effect wasn't quite right. There is very little, okay? And so the -- after we're diving and deeper into our customers, our distributors, and we found that these growths are real growth and somewhat is very sustainable. William Stein : Okay, got it. So the elevated orders last quarter were not a sort of a trick, they were for real and it sounds like you're seeing elevated backlog this quarter as well. So, maybe the other -- the other side of this of course is supply. And so that's my second question. Bernie, through the quarter, you talked about how supply was -- the company was more able to deliver. We certainly saw that in the quarter. I think you talked about increased supply at one foundry having a doubling of capacity that's sort of real-time and then another expectation for a ramped in Q4, at maybe a new foundry from one of your existing partners. I think together, it sounded like that was 40% additional capacity, which suggests maybe up to two years of sort of runway. Maybe you could clarify, I think you -- on the call earlier you talked about two fabs that are ramping now. Maybe you can just clarify for us where we are and where you expect capacity to go over the next few quarters? Bernie Blegen : Yeah. I think that to give full credit, our operations capabilities were put to the test in the early part of this year. And I think that, we responded as well as one could have expected. And most of the numbers that you cited as far as the capacity expansion are pretty close to the mark. I'm not going to confirm or reject them you're in the ballpark. And I think that, it remains an issue because as we look ahead our growth prospects for the next three to five years certainly are significant. And so what we're trying to do is get both capacity but then also get a geographically distributed. So, that's going to require a continuing level of investment, as we look ahead here for the next few years. William Stein : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : The next question is from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Chris, your line is now open. Chris Caso : Yes. Thank you. Good evening. And congratulations on the pioneering conference call format, which seems working very well. So my first question is just a follow-on from the other question. And with respect to capacity and the constraints that you're under right now, do you foresee a situation over the next few quarters where those capacity constraints could be an impediment to revenue? I guess, from where we are right now and actually we're seeing -- it appears that we're seeing some good upside the toilet paper effect is not having the effect that we feared. Is there still sufficient headroom for revenue growth as we go through the next few quarters as you're putting these capacity plans in place? Michael Hsing : Yeah. Let's put that way, our production people and they're working at over 100%. And we still have more revenue that we can ship. I mean, we can order than more than we can ship. And as we increase the capacities in the last six months, the issues are much better now. Bernie Blegen : And I would also probably just having learned from this recent experience that, we're more likely to also increase our internal inventories, so we don't have to rely upon necessarily in the moment production excellence. Chris Caso : Great. As a follow-up, with regard to the compute segment, we've heard from some others is that the market itself -- I guess, there's some areas of the compute market which look like they'll be slowing as you go into the second half. There was some of that work from home demand. In notebooks, for example, it looks like it was pulled forward to the first half. Intel had talked about some of the data centers -- the cloud data center revenue, which maybe showing some decline after a number of strong quarters. I know you have a lot of content increase as well. And I guess the question is, if the market should slow, one, is that what you're seeing? And secondly, the extent of your content increases, are they greater than what's happening in the market? Michael Hsing : We are the new players. Okay? We are a relatively small player in the market segment. And we don't see -- for our revenue growth we don't see any slowdown. And as we become a much bigger percentage then we can answer your question better. Chris Caso : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. David, your line is now open. We'll move to the next question. This comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Melissa Weathers : Hi, guys. This is Melissa on for Ross. Thank you for letting us ask a question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. I was hoping to get your opinion on the automotive end market specifically. Your larger peers were also impacted by the factory shutdowns around the world. As you're thinking about the recovery in the second half, how do you see this business recovering? And I know you don't guide more than one quarter out, but can you help us understand how sales into auto will resume? Bernie Blegen : Yes. I think that Q3 we're going to see a restabilization in the market. Interestingly, even though the manufacturing of the OEMs was shut down for two to three months, people still continue to buy cars. So there is some pent-up demand that they need to meet. But I think that the ramp may not be -- it won't necessarily snap back, I'm expecting to see some additional improvement in Q4, as they start to roll out the new model year. But I don't see it being the stair-step growth that we've experienced in past years. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question will come from David Williams from Loop Capital. David, your line is now open. David Williams : Perfect. Thank you. And thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the quarter. I guess the first question is really around the gaming console. And maybe if you could provide any color around the benefit in the quarter from the gaming console and then maybe how that layers into the remainder of the year. Bernie Blegen : I think that the gaming console is a very -- a somewhat predictable business, as far as there's almost a bell-shaped curve that occurs over five months beginning in June and ending in October. So that is pretty heavily weighted towards Q3 for what we sell into. And right now the visibility will not be crisp, is the word we used before, probably until late August or early September. Though, right now, we seem to be tracking very well against our expectations. David Williams : Okay. So you'd characterize that as maybe stable to towards your expectations? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Stable is not a word I normally assigned to gaming consoles, because it does create this bubble which has certain of its own management challenges. But, yes, I would say, that the demand is meeting our expectations and we have adequate supply chain to handle it. David Williams : Great. And then maybe thinking about the data center and maybe from the computing, how much of this do you think is maybe pull ahead versus more cycle related? Do you think this is sustainable? I realize you're a smaller player, but do you think you're seeing any pull ahead here? Or do you think all of this is maybe natural demand that would have come through pandemic or not? Bernie Blegen : No. I think the work from home phenomena is real and at some level, we are able to quantify it. But I do think that it is a more front-end loaded cycle as we sort of offered an earlier response. And the only thing to really add is that we're such a small player and this is sort of our first opportunity to really experience accelerated revenue growth, again our visibility and predictability is a little bit low for us right now. David Williams : Great. Thank you so much. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Thank you. Nice job, guys. I guess my first question now we've talked about or ask on 5G yet. So maybe -- I don't know if you could give a sort of progress on the 5G entry how are things [Technical Difficulty] the largest customer there. I know there's been some uncertainty. I know the government here has been trend you with that [Technical Difficulty] And then I didn't know if you can you talk about how many would be into shipping now? Or do you just [Technical Difficulty] and then I have a follow-up. Michael Hsing : Rick, your question is barely audible and barely interpretable. We can try it okay try to answer your questions. And 5G is our biggest -- one of the biggest opportunities and very highly concentrated customers. And as you know, the 4G we were not in that and we don't have any revenues. Okay, very little revenues. And now we became a significant player in there and that's because our technologies. And as far as where to grow and which regions? Clearly, China is emphasize it and the Huawei is the biggest players now. So all the other regions we engage with them deeply. And but I have to say they're much slower. And what is the impact for our future business? I believe it's a matter of time. The longer the times and the longer time give us it will be actually better for MPS. And all the other players and had the familiar with MPS and familiar with the MPS technologies. And the time is actually is on our side, but it may affect the revenues. But in China, we see it keep growing in a 5G network. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair. Kamil, your line is now open. Kamil Mielczarek : Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. First is I just want to follow-up on 5G. Can you provide some detail on how to think about the content you have and specifically the potential SAM given your POL products can be used in transceivers, base stations, fiber optic networks and back-end data centers. And I assume there's a potential for QSMOD as well? Michael Hsing : Yes. You're absolutely, right. Our opportunity we don't have a clear picture because again our product there is a very fundamental in us supplying powers and doing power management for each component. And it's really a rough calculation it's more than $40, $50 per stations. Kamil Mielczarek : That's great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. How should we think about your entrance into the HPA market? I believe you are initially targeting medical and communication applications. And what's your differentiation versus competitors like TI? And lastly is this a 2021 revenue event? Bernie Blegen : The primary competition is really with ADI and this is the advanced analog. And you're exactly correct that the first opportunity that we're pursuing is actually with a customer and they've provided us their spec and we would expect to be able to have a product that can be prototyped by the end of this year and have initial revenue after that. As far as the longer-term road map, we talked about communications because it is the next targeted market that were high-performance analog. Michael Hsing : Data converters. I missed the first part of the question. Okay. Go ahead. Bernie Blegen : Yes. So just finishing up where the need for high-frequency and high precision. And as I said there's only one or two other players out there. It's a very difficult market to penetrate. But here again, we believe, we're very well positioned to move into it over the course of the next three to five years. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Just a follow-up. And Michael, I'm asking this question because I really respect your view and if you look at Maxim, Linear, ADI, they've been competitors of yours for many years, whether for business or for engineers. They're now all going to be under one umbrella. What do you think that means for the analog space and perhaps for Monolithic power specifically? Michael Hsing : Well, thanks for saying you respect me. Yes, I think, it's the same the Maxim and Linear Technologies they are very proven and companies and they competed as -- in the past competes with them and MPS has a little bit agile and in terms of technology development and the product development. So our growth is faster. And I think going to futures MPS now has become meaningful players. And we are -- and if you look at the Linear Technologies with our $1.1 billion the MPS is very close to it. And so our customers were looking for a second of multiple suppliers. And with the superior technologies I think that will give us more opportunities. Tore Svanberg : Very good. Congrats again. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Yes. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Kevin Garrigan from Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open. Kevin Garrigan : Guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Just a quick one for me. Can you give us a little color on your e-commerce business? I know with everything kind of virtual now in your recent agreement with Farnell Electronics, can you kind of talk about what's going on there? Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. That's the e-commerce glad that you still remember that. And I have to say it's very slow okay, but I really believe that okay. I firmly believe that. We see some initial results. And after -- if you follow our website and our website change keep evolving. And up to a point now we know how do we double or triple the subscribers. And it's actually more than tripled and small start with small numbers. And so we're still doing a lot of surveys. And now I think the website is good enough and that we can work with our partners and online partners and distribute the message more -- much more clearly. And I will see in next few months and we'll see -- I hope to see a lot more result. But overall, we still believe it. And we much believe it in the plug and play solution, it will happen and online distribution, online sales, online configurations that will be the future. And so, for MPS opportunities instead of dollar, sub dollar parts, now, we're selling against $4, $5 or beyond for each component. So, the opportunities still remain and we are still learning. Kevin Garrigan : Got it. Thanks guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey great. Thanks for letting me ask the follow question. Michael, you said some of the applications you're most excited about or center around the data center as well as 48 volts, so just a couple of follow-on questions. With NVIDIA's latest 7-nanometer generation of GPUs going into the data center, wondering if you're able to comment whether you're supplying any power management devices for that new 100 GPU either in a 12-volt or 48-volt SKU? And then longer term, as we look forward to the new Intel VR 14 spec, do you have a sense how much of that market might be 12-volt versus 48-volt? Thank you. Michael Hsing : All right. Okay. Obviously, we don't mention customers' names and customers' project names. And let's put that way, so, all the 48-volt product that we have a product in it. And in terms of the VR 14 spec, we have a reference design in that. And MPS will be compared via 13s and we're also a small part of it. And I think, the opportunity for MPS. And it became a significant play as a main player in the VR 14 in the next few years. Bernie Blegen : Both in the 12-volt as well as 48-volt. Michael Hsing : Yes, for the 12 volts and 48 volts, my belief is mostly still 12 volts. And 48 volts, the application is still limited. Quinn Bolton : Great. Thank you for that color. Genevieve Cunningham : [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar. And look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you and have a great day.",

A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2019, Q2 2020 and Q3 2020 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our Web site. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $259.4 million, 39.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2020, and 53.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. As noted in our September 14, 2020 update to our Q3 financial guidance, our revenue increased beyond expectations for two key reasons; first, we were able to fulfill our customers' demand that had been delinquent due to past capacity constraints; second, certain China-based customers requested previously scheduled shipment dates be pulled into the third quarter of 2020. We believe this request was related to trade and regulatory policy changes that occurred during the quarter. These two factors contributed significantly to this quarter's performance relative to the prior quarter of 2020 and to Q3 of 2019. Looking at our revenue by market. Third quarter 2020 communications revenue of $54.7 million was up 81.8% from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to a pull-in of customers requested ship dates. Communications sales represented 21.1% of our total third quarter 2020 revenue. In our consumer markets, third quarter 2020 revenue of $70.2 million increased 47.4% from revenue reported for the prior quarter of 2020. This extraordinary growth in consumer reflects a combination of market share gains in gaming, wearables and IoT applications along with normal seasonality. Consumer revenue represented 27.1% of our third quarter 2020 revenue. In our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $75.3 million increased $11.2 million or 17.5% from the second quarter of 2020. The sequential quarterly revenue growth was broad-based with sales gains recorded in high-end notebooks, servers and storage. Computing and storage revenue represented 29% of MPS' third quarter 2020 revenue. Third quarter automotive revenue of $28.5 million grew $10.7 million or 60.4% over the second quarter of 2020. This improvement reflects a more normal ordering level following the Q2 2020 industrywide slowdown resulting from the pandemic. We believe MPS' market share will continue to expand in the coming years as we have been awarded multiple design wins in infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. Automotive revenue was 11.0% of MPS' total third quarter 2020 revenue. Third quarter 2020 industrial revenue of $30.7 million increased 15.3% from the second quarter of 2020, due primarily to increased revenue for power sources and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented 11.8% of our total third quarter 2020 revenue. GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, matching the second quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $60.0 million compared to $28.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2020 and $30.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 55.5%, 20 basis points below the gross margin reported for the second quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points lower than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $84.9 million compared to $53.0 million reported in the prior quarter and $51.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $63.1 million in the third quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2020 operating expenses were $59.1 million, up from the $50.7 million we spent in the second quarter of 2020 and up from the $42.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. The sequential increase in Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses primarily reflected higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue and an increased level of investment in securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, an income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $707,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $23.0 million compared with $21.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Switching to the bottom-line. Third quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $55.6 million or $1.18 per fully diluted share compared with $30.2 million or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2020 and $29.5 million or $0.64 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $79.4 million or $1.69 per fully diluted share compared with $50.6 million or $1.08 per share in the second quarter of 2020 and $49.5 million or $1.08 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares at the end of Q3 2020 were $47.0 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $554.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020 compared to $515.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $77.4 million compared with Q2 2020 operating cash flow of $59.3 million. Third quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $19.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2020 at $93.5 million representing 33 days of sales outstanding which was six days higher than the 27 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2020 and two days higher than the 31 days at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2020 were $148.1 million, down from the $152.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020. Days of inventory of 116 days at the end of the third quarter 2020 were 50 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2020. The sequential drop in days inventory on hand represented an anomaly due to a decrease in the dollar value of inventory and a 39% increase in quarterly revenue. Currently, our inventory levels are lean. We are working very hard to return inventory to the 180 to 200-day level necessary to support our future growth. I would now like to turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2020. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $218 million to $230 million. We also expect the following; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%; total stock-based compensation expense of $21.8 million to $23.8 million, including approximately $700,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $81.3 million and $85.3 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $60.2 million to $62.2 million; litigation expense should range between $1.8 million to $2.2 million; interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.1 million to 48.1 million shares. In conclusion, we will monitor market conditions closely and continue to execute. I'll now open the webinar up for questions. A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Congratulations on the $1 billion run rate. First question is Q4 guidance. Could you talk a little bit about which are some of the end markets that's going to be performing in Q4? Obviously, I know communications is going to be down but what about some of the other markets for the December quarter? Bernie Blegen : Tore, thanks for commenting on the $1 billion run rate. Yes, if you compare ourselves against Q3, obviously, that was a high watermark. So probably a more relevant comparison is against Q4 of 2019. And on that basis, we're expecting all of our major markets to be up significantly from the prior year. And then, when you do the comparison against Q3, you'll see that there'll probably be declines in communications and computing and also in consumer, the consumer is seasonally adjusted but we'll still expect to see improvements in industrial and automotive. Tore Svanberg : Very good. And as my follow-up, you mentioned inventories are pretty lean, so can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're doing to try and get the inventories back up? You said you had some OpEx to maybe secure some foundry capacity but anything else you can add on sort of how you're going to get back to that 180 days of inventory? Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think as we acknowledged in Q3 that we were able to catch up as far as having adequate capacity in order to service near-term demand and in giving guidance for Q4 that expectation follows along. When we look ahead over the course of the next 24 months, we previously mentioned that we're entering into new relationships with other fabs and expect to grow our overall capacity. So this will be an ongoing investment that we would project for at least about the next six quarters. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. David, your line is now open. Will Stein : I think there is a mistake. It's Will Stein from Truist. How are you? I guess I'll just go. Bernie, first a clarification. The inventory target that you called out in your script, I think you said 180 to 200. I think that's 20 days higher than what you said on the last conference call. Is that correct? And if so, can you help us understand what's changed? Bernie Blegen : The previous metrics that we had been using were about 20 days lower, but we've really made this change as far as what we've been trying to explain to the analysts and to investors over the course of about the last two to three quarters. But nonetheless, I do want to address your question, which is in order for us to sustain the level of growth that we have in excess of our market, the industry that we have to have a higher level of inventory, so in other words, there is a mismatch. In other words, we are building the inventory today, but we're not going to -- for the sales that will occur one or two quarters out. And so it's not a perfect reflection for other companies where they're not growing as fast. They can maintain lower levels in terms of days, but here, again, we have to make an incremental investment in order to allow to support our growth. Michael Hsing : Let me add. As you remember, end of the last year and we are at around 200 days of inventory. If we use that model and to meet this year growth, that probably -- that's about the right numbers. That's the basis that's where this 20 more days come from. And so if you go to a little more details and MPS is a fabulous company, and yet, we have own technologies. This is very unique. I can't think of any of our competitors, they're in the same way of manufacturing and they do to fulfill their manufacturing. Most of them, they have their own fab. And so given the volatilities and also given the growth that we have and also number of product and address all the greenfield market segment, we need probably more than 200 days inventories. Will Stein : Okay. That helps a lot. If I can have one quick follow-up. The guidance, while great overall on revenue and EPS, the margins are a little bit different from what maybe some would have expected. And Bernie, I'm just wondering if you can tell us if the model we should be thinking about, which historically was that gross would grow at 10 to 20 bps a quarter. And op margin, either there was a, I guess, change in that view that perhaps we wouldn't get an operating margin leverage for the next year or two. Maybe you could just update us on that model for both those lines. Bernie Blegen : Sure. And I think that you captured it very well is that obviously, our model has been to improve gross margin 10 to 20 basis points sequentially. Now a lot of factors weigh into being able to deliver against those results, including both our mix of business as well as what the market looks like. So again, you have to use these as guidelines, not as an absolute guarantee of what our performance will look like. And then, on the operating expenses, right now, we are going to be continuing to invest in capacity as I said in each of the next six quarters. So that will be an additional layer of investment from what we've seen and so as a result we're not projecting our operating margins to improve significantly over the course of the next two years. Will Stein : OpEx, I think, is that right? In other words, op margin would just expand with gross, which is 10 to 20 bps a quarter? Or... Bernie Blegen : Yes. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. David your line is now open. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Let me offer my congratulations on a very strong September and good December outlook. Bernie and Michael, these are sort of unprecedented times in the business and I know you don't typically look out more than a quarter. But I guess, one of the questions I'm hearing from investors is, whether there is any sort of inflated demand still impacting the business in the December quarter. And wondering, to the extent you can give us any sort of thoughts on March, would March show a typical seasonal decline from the December quarter of, say, 3% to 5%, what you would see in a typical year or do you think it could show a greater seasonal factor? I know you don't typically go out two quarters, but again, this is really strong results here in the near term. Michael Hsing : Let me answer that question. If you're talking about normal seasonality then the outlook is great. And we have so many design in activities and we see so many award projects and as well as you know as well as I know, these were in unprecedented era, pandemics and geopolitical issues and I can't predict and frankly, I care less. Bernie Blegen : And if I can just add to that is that. I really think that there are certain aspects of our business that we have in good control, as Michael hit on as far as the design wind activity, but right now, we do not have control over what the end customer demand is ultimately going to be about. So I think that as far as executing against our strategy and seeing it show up in our results, I think we're going to continue along that path but there are just too many factors for us, it would be pure speculation at this point. Quinn Bolton : Maybe I could ask, in past calls, you've oftentimes given us some idea of your sort of starting backlog coverage and I know that typically runs a very high percentage of the revenue guidance. I guess is, with some of the delinquencies you had a past quarter, you had very strong backlog. But as you head into the December quarter, so backlog sort of back to more normal levels that it would have typically run in the last couple of years? Is it still elevated? Can you give us any thoughts on kind of the backlog coverage? Michael Hsing : Well, as the December quarter -- go into December quarters, we are still facing delinquencies. So the capacity is still limited. Bernie Blegen : And I think what we're seeing here is that, as I said, in the guidance that we offered is it anticipates both the demand, including the backlog that we had coming into the quarter and it's matched with what our supply chain and capacity limits are. So I guess that I would probably offer that we have some ability for upside, but it's going to be a little bit limited by supply chain. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Alex Vecchi from William Blair. Alex your line is now open. Alex Vecchi : Michael and Bernie, congratulations, again, in a very volatile environment. If we can just touch base a little more on the automotive segment. This appears to be the highest revenue quarter you guys have posted since really starting to gain traction in the segment. I've realized the environment is just starting now to get a little bit better. But can you maybe update us on how we should think about the long-term growth targets there? In the past, you've said 40% to 60% growth, obviously, that may be a little premature at this point, but perhaps, update us on how you're feeling on that segment. Bernie Blegen : I would probably say that automotive is one of the more exciting end markets for us for the next several years. Now if you look at our track record in 2019 and 2020, 2019 was affected by the recession, 2020 by factory closings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. So again, those are circumstances that were largely outside of our control. But what we're seeing is that we're expanding now from our traditional infotainment base into some of these more exciting technologies, including the lighting systems, the ADAS and the autonomous driving. So we think that this is a sustainable revenue growth should be well ahead of what our corporate average is going to be. At one time, we were promoting the concept of being able to grow consistently at 20% to 60% per year, but that would probably back off of that down to a more reasonable between 30% and 40%, but still a very exciting end market for us. Michael Hsing : Bernie  talking. Okay. Frankly, I don't have clear pictures. And what's the growth? Frankly, I never put MPS' as we have to grow a certain percentage, okay? And what I'm looking at it is, what kind of product, which project and how well we're positioned and which customers, which projects we want designing. And a lot more importantly, okay, what kind of products in the pipeline. That really drives the top line. And so how we predicted what's the next lowest growth percentage, I can't tell you. Alex Vecchi : No, no, that's fair, but it's good to hear that the trajectory seems to be sort of back on track. And then, similarly, I don't think in the prepared comments you guys commented on the extent of the pull-ins into Q3. Is it fair to say that the vast majority of the sequential decline in Q4 is related to the pull-in activities or is there also a little bit of normalization of demand in there as well? Michael Hsing : Well, we had a lot of pulling from Q3 and partially in Q4. As I said earlier, we're still facing delinquencies. And so I think that's a combination of the growth and also in a capacity shortage from that past. Okay. Alex Vecchi : From that past, okay. And then lastly, if I can, on just on the days inventory, the 180 to 200 days, how long will it take you to get back to that level? Is that something you can achieve in Q4, we really looking to more the first half of 2021? Michael Hsing : Well, if the market slows down, we're going to get there quickly. Again, and this is -- we're at uncomfortable levels. I can meet that. And so we want to increase as much as we can. And now our engineers working the fabs, okay, working at the different fabs and to get the -- to qualify the process and technologies. And so, we hope that in the next six months, we can catch up. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter from Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open. Joshua Buchalter : Let me echo my congrats. As for my first question, earlier this year, you'd mentioned bringing in additional 12-inch fab online in the second half. As I was wondering, was this the primary driver of the additional capacity you were able to secure in the third quarter? And then looking ahead, how much more capacity do you feel you need to both serve your customers and get the inventory levels up to that that you raise 180 to 200 days? Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. The first question is, yes, absolutely, okay. We said earlier this year, we expanded another 12-inch fab, wasn't in our plan, but we hurried up and get that thing going. And we start shipping product in Q3. That's unprecedented and thanks to our people. And they really worked in day and night to manage and qualify these products. Going forward, we just want to expand the capacity to reach 180 to 200 days inventory. And going in the future, if we have a very linear world and then it is very easy to calculate. I think we are living in a very non-linear environment and 200 days inventory, that's what we want to do. Joshua Buchalter : Got it. That's very helpful. And then for my follow-up, a bit of a bigger picture question. I mean, you guys are now $1 billion or you reached $1 billion run rate this quarter. Are you seeing any increase or changes in the competitive responses from your peers as you move higher on both a unit basis and as well in the socket value? Michael Hsing : Our ASPs increasing and when we move to high-end market segments. And so, our competitions are always pretty similar. I mean our customer doesn't even know MPS' is $1 billion. There are no MPS. MPS is very small potatoes against all these giants. Bernie Blegen : But I think you go back to what our competitive basis is, and it really is that we're winning with superior technology and a higher level of customer service and I think that's what our customers are recognizing as far. Michael Hsing : That's right, yes. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Maybe just a quick follow-on, if I can, on that production question. I know you guys have been pulling in new production and foundry partners pretty aggressively. I mean, I know you've spoken, I think in the past about sort of once it's done, the goal is to kind of be at that $1.2 billion or so in kind of annual revenues. And that's not a lot of headroom for you guys at your current run rate at your current growth rate. So I'm curious, is that $1.2 billion still the right number we should be thinking of in terms of your capacity when all said and done? And maybe what does the time line look like for that now since you're pulling stuff in? Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. Obviously, the $1.2 billion is not enough. And if you want to building a fast on the 200 days inventories, it's more than double it right now. So that's what we try to do and it's not easy and that's what we're aiming for, just double it. Bernie Blegen : And I think that in the past, securing fab capacity and being able to introduce new products at the rate that we are is really nothing new to MPS. But the scale has been getting bigger and so that's why the investments and the time that we have to plan ahead makes a difference. And so all we're doing is preparing both for the capacity but also recognizing acknowledging the investment that goes with it. Rick Schafer : So if we fast forward 18 months, 24 months, I mean, is there a bogey for where you think your capacity will be? I mean if it's not $1.2 billion, I assume higher than that, but I'm just curious if there is a number you can share or if you know at this point? Michael Hsing : I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. We're shooting for $2 billion. Rick Schafer : $2 billion? I'm sorry, I misunderstood. Sorry. Thanks Michael. And then just maybe a question, if I could on 5G. And maybe I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your exposure to the Tier-1 5G ran OEMs, the one that you're allowed to sell to, of course. Where you are in terms of revenue ramp or design win activity? I mean, are any of these guys buying QSMOD yet? Or are you sort of initially seeing more POL issues kind of similar to what you saw in the early stages of your cloud server ramp? Michael Hsing : I think 5G overall at an early stage. And all I can say now that we engage with all the 5G station makers. And we do have a designing activity and we do have award projects but it's not significant revenue yet. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : I want to give the same congrats that everybody else did, stupendous work here. A couple of quick questions. First, when do you expect the delinquencies to be gone? Michael Hsing : If the market slows down, we're going to do that next quarter. If the demand is still that strong, we continue to face that. And we see some not as bad as last quarters -- last two quarters. Ross Seymore : And then on the supply side of the equation somewhat, but maybe even more of a regulatory issue. What's the exposure? And how are you dealing with the Huawei ban? And does the SMIC band have any impact on you, whether it's in the supply side or otherwise? Michael Hsing : Well, Huawei is not our supplier. But SMIC, it is our supplier. So far, it's not affecting us, and we don't know. We can't speculate, what does all these policy means that came in. But on the other hand and we diversified our foundry sources. We're starting from a beginning of this year. We speed it up. Ross Seymore : So on the Huawei side, just to be clear, you had them as a customer, I believe, in the first half of the year one way or the other. And I assume you're no longer shipping to them and I just wondered if that's part of fourth quarter guidance is then going to zero. Michael Hsing : Well, we can say zero or some non-zero, and so far, we cannot ship. But there is other rules and regulations coming out and all the other permits, I mean, we cannot speculating or what kind of things we can do and it's all depending on our government now. Ross Seymore : I guess the last question then away from government type questions is, Bernie, you and Michael have had a framework in for many, many years about the percentage superior growth versus the analog market that you guys have delivered. I think it's been kind of a 10% to 15% positive delta in your favor. Is that rule just thrown out the window now? This year is 25, 30 points above that peer group. And I know one year doesn't make a trend, but as you look at it, is there something that's creating some semblance of escape velocity where that delta expands meaningfully just due to the breadth of your design wins, the markets you're targeting or do we expect a little bit of a reversion to the mean in 2021 after such a great 2020? Michael Hsing : Well, as I said, the world is not linear. And I remember and I was facing a lot of, I was facing a lot of questions about when our model is like a 20% to 25% growth rate. In 2016, 2017 or 2015, 2016 and we will criticize you will never get there, although we're somewhere around 17%, 18%. And you asked so many times, you forced me say it at the time. I think around 2016, I said that -- but 2018, 2019, we're going to get it over 20%. And that comment is pulling off from my ears, this is not a science. I mean in a non-linear world, it's very difficult to predict. And so I said earlier, we only can anticipate it and by staffing the inventories and by stock inventories. And just get ready, and of course, and the world crashes. Of course, we're not we're going to start to depleting inventories. And we're not building as many as much and so we can modulate the inside a little bit. But for the growth rate, I see all these designing activities and all these projects, I will say last couple of years is better than two, three years before. And we awarded a lot more high-value products, high-value sockets. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : I just had a follow-up, Michael, on e-commerce. That's obviously a business model that could help you manage capacity, inventory and so on and so forth. Have you been able to keep up with the investments there in this environment, maybe you could just update us on where the e-commerce business stands today? Michael Hsing : We didn't prepare the numbers. We're doing really good. And I thought that there was nobody going to ask the question because... Bernie Blegen : We have so much other news. Michael Hsing : It is okay. I feel, I can say, we've figured out the way to do it. And so until we prove ourselves wrong again. The new website as I think you see it. It's very different and we increased a whole lot more clicks and the customers stay on the pages for a lot longer. And also, we're creating a virtual labs and that part also helps the e-commerce. So we don't have the product FAEs and have them pounding the payment to generate opportunities and we're using the Web site. And the numbers and the increase by increased weekly and I'm very pleased and so we're talking about a few hundred percentage increase from a small number. It doesn't mean a lot, but for us and we learned it. That's the trick. That's the area we're going to do. We're going to enhance that. Bernie Blegen : I didn't know that there's an even higher arching strategy here where e-commerce is a significant part of and it's really how do you go after underserved customers. And what was surprising to me is, we did look at the last three years as far as how many customers did we have that were under $100,000 and how is that base growing. Because if you can use the linear model, where what they used to do is get in there early... Michael Hsing : The linear technology. Bernie Blegen : ..linear technology, getting there early and then develop these long-term relationships and then you grow with their growth. And so as a part of that strategy, I think we're -- the numbers I looked at, we're doing a very good job. They're starting to bear dividends. Michael Hsing : We increased these number like three or four times. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Michael Hsing : And from a small base. And that is a significant and it has happened in the last few years. And now clearly, we can put the metrics. And so, an old saying is that, what you measure what you get. And we know how -- start to know how to -- what to measure and that's to me, is very important. But I'm looking at the revenue-wise, it became meaningful, but I don't have clear details. I don't want to have a pull out my higher numbers. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : And speaking of things that haven't been talked about as much maybe in the last couple of quarters. I'm curious if you could give us an update on the design win pipeline or revenue color for your converter business. I'm just curious, has ADI, Maxim opened any doors for you guys? And have you seen the level of engagement with customers increase maybe as a side note or are you seeing more analog, does it line into your resumes or is it easier to find guys? So I'm just curious if you could give us any update there. Michael Hsing : Finding good people as always hard. All these good company that keep the good people and that's always a challenge. And so we know that we need a diversified. And that came in a lot of times in the last 10, 15 years or more likely the last 20 years. We have a lot of people from China came in. And now two or four, five years ago, we migrated to Europe and the Taiwan and outside of the Mainland China. Now in the last couple of years, it will come back to U.S., and we do see, not necessarily in the Bay Area but other parts of the countries, we do find some talents there. Rick Schafer : And Michael, any update on what's happening with converters for you guys? Michael Hsing : The converters, which... Rick Schafer : The signal chain stuff the team you brought in. I think it's been a couple of quarters since we talked about ADAS. Bernie Blegen : High-performance analog, yes. Michael Hsing : Oh, yes. The data converters. Okay. Yes. Okay. I think we received the first chip. Bernie Blegen : This is prototyping. Michael Hsing : Yes. And I think we're building solutions and as most of the time, the first chip will have some bugs, it's  and we are building a prototype. We still can't put in a system yet now. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. Will Stein : Follow-up from before. We're just -- someone else asked about e-commerce, but I'm hoping you might give us an update on the eMotion and module business and maybe the programmable traction generally. I think about these as sort of separate from e-commerce, maybe they're not as separate but an update on this part of it would be really helpful. Michael Hsing : Yes. I think we use that e-commerce platform to promote those products. And that eMotion side, I think the revenues, I had to say some number now otherwise I don't know whether you guys think of whether I do have numbers. I want to have Bernie's. Sometimes it increase almost double. The motion side. Bernie Blegen : Yes. The eMotion is right in that sort of transition phase because we have a lot of design wins that are going in. So last year, the revenue run rate was somewhere in the $10 million to $12 million, but now the doubling is going to start, particularly as we go into both automotive and industrial applications. Michael Hsing : Yes. So I'm correct. It was about double. Bernie Blegen : I think also when we look at the modules business, that is taking off very nicely. Michael Hsing : The modules started with a smaller base, like a few hundred percent increase. That was $30 million, $40 million. Will Stein : And is the strength that you're seeing there at all related to the pull-ins and delivering against delinquencies that you had previously or is this part of the rest of the business? What I want to think of as core that might not have... Michael Hsing : No. It's a small part of it is due to delinquencies. I mean this is a new market segment. And people order from online and we never see those. I mean, it is not our own internet and our own Web site from our distributors and these are very small customers. They never all those parts before. And that's although the numbers is small, but the revenue is still small, but the large number of our customers and they use -- these are plug-and-play modules. And so what and they can just plug-in and they don't have to do any design. And since you mentioned the programming portion and that's part of what we learned that our customer doesn't even want to do programs. They want us to do it. And so we created virtual labs and customer tell us what they want and we show, in our labs, we program everything and then we ship. So now what we are talking about, it's really a custom design for each customer and that is taking off and I'm very glad to see it. Will Stein : And just a final comment there is on the modules, they're not necessarily tied to any one end market. They're actually very broad-based, initially, we thought that they would be plug-and-play solutions, particularly for prototyping or small volumes, but it turns out that they're actually going to mainstream production. Michael Hsing : Yes. And so that's something we learned and I'm a former engineering. I'm skilled engineer, our people and we created a great product that we see it and we're reporting like 30 parameters, 70 parameters on the Web site. They can program it and they can see what the result from simulations. And it turned out to be and we put a lot there nobody looking at it and we're wondering why. So we reduced to half and then we cut another half the reduced to five, six, seven, they still don't want to see it. And they want to pick the numbers in a total, you do that for me and that's great. We can do the work, they pay for it. That's fine. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Just wanted to see if you might be able to give us an update on your efforts in the GPU space for either desktop or data center GPUs. Just looking at the power consumption of those devices, I think you're seeing desktop GPUs now consuming up to 300 watts. I think data center, maybe up to 400 watts. You guys, I think I talked about that back at Analyst Day as a potential opportunity. Just wondering if you're starting to see any real traction or if you start to need in the curve on either the sort of the gaming or the data center side of GPUs. Bernie Blegen : Yes. We're seeing substantial movement on both. We probably started out earlier on the desktop, where we started generating revenues with this about 18 months to two years ago. And now we're moving into the data center where we actually are starting to ramp and in particular, 48 volt for artificial intelligence. So the opportunities are significant, but we're still at the very early stages of this market. So fundamentally, we're very well positioned, but it's still going to be another year or two before we still -- we move the dial with revenue ramp. Michael Hsing : Those are AR, Bernie is talking about, these are over 1,000 watts, and it's not 200 or 300 or 400-watt levels. If you get to that high level, you're only talking about only a few companies, they can supply those types of product. Again, in I think we are in good positions and -- but always can be better. Genevieve Cunningham :  There appear to be no further questions. I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Great. Thanks, Gen. I would like to thank you all for joining us for this conference and look forward to talking to you again about our fourth quarter results which will likely be in early February. Thank you and have a nice day.",

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Bernie Blegen : Thanks Gen. For the full year 2020, MPS achieved record revenue $844.5 million, growing 34.5% from the prior year. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and being recognized by more first tier companies for superior technologies, product quality and excellent customer. As we see more high quality growth opportunities ahead of us, we continue to successfully invest in our infrastructure and capabilities that support that growth. Here are a few highlights, which we achieved in 2020. Brought online a new 12-inch fab one year ahead of schedule allowing for qualified parts to be shipped in Q4 of this year. We will continue to invest in the capacity and diversity of our supply chain with plans to bring up a new 8-inch fab in 2021; began volume shipments of 48 volt QSMOD technology for AI applications, proving the commercial viability of our leading edge system solutions in this critically important market; Designed an integrated power management solution for autonomous driving vehicles. Shipments began to ramp in Q3 of 2020. Launched our ESG website, aggregating all of our environmental, social and governance values, policies and practices into one easily access location. Customers, employees, shareholders are now able to fully appreciate MPS's commitment to sustainability, transparency of our business practices and our ongoing social responsibility. A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question is from Matt Ramsay from Cohen. Matt, your line is now open. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Good evening everybody. Hey, Michael and Bernie. Hope you're well. My first question is around the supply that you guys are bringing online. You talked about a couple of different efforts and you have done over the last few quarters to add supply. And I guess, Michael, I wonder if you might characterize it as -- anyway, one, how much supply can you bring online and say the immediate term versus over the next couple of years to support what revenue levels? Michael Hsing : Well, we said in a couple of quarters ago, we're building a capacity to bidding dollars capability. And so that's all our long-term strategy. We'll do that anyway. And just reason -- in a reason from a last year we pulling a little faster, like we can active -- anticipated these goes up and down. So, as we play for a long-term futures and -- but in the recent years, obviously, with the pulling and increased capacities, okay, as we started in the early last year and we are a little bit ahead of the game -- ahead of the market demands. And from -- looking at near futures we are continued to do so. We still facing delinquent. Matt Ramsay : Got it. No, that makes sense in the long-term. I guess for my follow-up question is a more near term oriented one. Bernie, if you might give some color as how you're expecting -- I mean, the guidance was well above consensus for the March quarter. Maybe you could talk about it by segment what you're expecting the trends to be as you move from December into March. Thanks guys. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think that we saw in 2020 that revenue in both automotive and industrial were probably most heavily impacted because of the COVID pandemic. So what we saw in the second half of the year is that both of those two markets showed marked improvement and have significant momentum as we go into 2021. But really we're broad based. So a lot of the trends that we saw that we benefited from in 2020 will continue on, possibly the only exception is communications, which had a strong three quarters that would be difficult to compare against. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on the execution. So far I think you're the only company that I've seen actually increasing your inventory days. So, congratulations on that too. Last quarter you talked about the size of the delinquencies you had in 2019. Could you give us a ballpark for where they stand right now? Michael Hsing : I think last quarter -- we talk about last couple of quarters, we have continued facing a delinquent -- delinquencies and this quarter is in the last quarter we are relatively similar and two quarters ago we're facing a bit quite more. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. And I think that that's a reflection of continued strong demand in the face of industry-wide capacity constraints. So, we've actually had to manage at this level now for about the last three to four quarters. And I'm not saying that we're getting good at it, but we're certainly believe we have it as well under control as possible, a good handle on it. So that we're escalating shipments only based on the needs of the end-user, as opposed to anyone building inventory in either the channel or on customer shelves. And the reason we can meet the most off our customer's demand is -- due to we end -- we add a capacity at the beginning of last year and now we can fulfill most of it. Tore Svanberg : Very good. And as my follow-up on capacity, you talked about the second 12-inch, also new 8-inch. I know you typically don't name your foundries on these calls. But could you at least talk about sort of the geographical aspect to where your foundry partners are at this point? Michael Hsing : Now, we tried to diversify outside the China as we speaking and these fabs what could be -- we're still exploring and engaged -- at the beginning of the engagement with both -- with a fab within China and outside of China. Tore Svanberg : Great. Thank you very much. Congrats again. Bernie Blegen : Thanks Tore. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is for Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Michael Hsing : Yes. Loud, clear. Bernie Blegen : Hi, Ross. Ross Seymore : Hi, there. So congratulations on the growth, especially impressive, not only relative to the analog group, but the diversity of it. As you looked at 2020 is a whole, other than the year-over-year in coms, which I know is difficult. You talked a little bit about you expected to be diverse. If you just said, what some of the idiosyncratic drivers, company specific things in 2020 would be just a kind of by end market, obviously not customer specific. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think that in the computing, we had seen in 2018 and 2019 a run up in notebooks and really in 2020 it was increased demand in the data center, both in terms of powering servers, as well as the storage. In the consumer market, we've benefited from the once every three year refresh of the gaming console. And also we saw a nice uptick, both in home appliances, as well as wearables or mobility. And then when we look at industrial and automotive, as I said earlier, both of those seem to be handicapped at the beginning of the year where we have design wins, but we can't guarantee what the market circumstances are going to be. So, the unit sales on some of the new products we were introduced were a little limited, but certainly showed a lot of strength in the second half of the year. Ross Seymore : And actually, Bernie, forgive me if I misspoke. I was actually talking more about 2021. What those drive -- similar sort of story, but 2021 more looking forward then back. Michael Hsing : I think it's a repeat of same -- it\u2019s a 2020 to 2021. Bernie Blegen : I'd say the only thing in the first half that gives us a little pause aside from the communications comparable is that there's probably going to be some softness in the first half of the year related to computing on the -- at the data center. But outside of that, Michael's exactly right. Ross Seymore : Well, maybe that's a good \u2026 Michael Hsing : But the softness -- it's not going down. So, still going as not as a strong, but the demand is still -- slightly more than we expected. Yeah. Ross Seymore : Got it. And then I guess as my real follow-up. A lot of companies are questioning the sustainability of this demand and I know crystal balls are always foggy. But you guys would grow if I just analyze your first quarter guidance, 15%. I know seasonality might not be the breast framework, but there seems to be an active debate amongst investors on is, are things just too hot and there's got to be a stumble because there's excess ordering, inventory is going to build et cetera, et cetera. How are you guys viewing that kind of supply versus demand balance and the trust in the quality of the orders? Michael Hsing : Well -- and if you look at it in the past three or four years, okay, I mean, we grow some things like in -- from 17% to 25% in the levels. In 2019, right, we grow only 8% and -- but our designing -- all these opportunities still there. Okay? I mean, we just shifted to -- from 2019 to 2020. And so again, in the automotive, industrial in the first half a year, wasn't there. So like a catch up in the second half a year. And in a computing, communications and -- what else I'm missing Bernie Blegen : Consumers. Michael Hsing : Yeah, consumers, okay. In the beginning, is a stronger than -- a little bit stronger than normal. And I will say that it's probably even out from 2019s and this year we can see that -- we never forecast a macro economy condition, but we do see these product and we facing a shortages on Amazon's on these the Best Buy and we believe these all are real. Ross Seymore : Okay. Thank you and congrats. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Thanks. And let me add my congratulations on the execution guys. I'm sure it wasn't easy up there this quarter, especially. A couple of questions. I guess I'd like to ask about a couple of your bigger growth pillars, maybe start with auto. I think it grew about 15% last year, with SAR down about 15. So just optically, it looks like you guys could do something around 50% growth this year. I mean, maybe you could talk about what leads that growth. I mean, is it ADAS, body control? Does BMS kick-in at all and kind of add -- give a little more wind to the sales this year. And I guess the second part of that question, I'm just curious, are you worried at all about indirect supply constraints, potentially limiting -- limiting your upside here? Michael Hsing : Let me talk about your second part first. Growth overall for MPS is limiting by our capacities and utilization of a total capacity. As you know, we have a few thousand -- 4,000 parts and it's inconceivable. We can utilize it in the entire capacities. For the auto growth, yes, okay, we -- as Bernie said earlier, we have ADAS in the stock to rent in the last quarter or so. And we have more customers start to ramp that can -- these are the very high end product and we are very pleased with it Other products in orders, we talk about it in the past, okay, from a lighting to liftgates to -- all the other power modules in auto and now we see start to ramp. We just -- just at the beginning we see all these products start to ramp. But these are still at the beginning. Bernie Blegen : And Rick, just one more point is that, I think we've read that the auto industry is suffering from its own capacity issues or being able to have a stable supply chain. As I look at our Q1 numbers that is not directly impacting our demand or our ability to ship. Michael Hsing : Yeah. We are so small in a market presence in auto industry, but all of these initial ramp and it changes the needles in a revenue stream. Rick Schafer : Thanks. And that's kind of what I was asking about. Just worried if those secondary supply constraints could end up hurting -- somebody else can't ship. Maybe my second question, Michael, just on cloud server. If you could talk about how that data center ramp looks like for QSMOD this year? I mean, it's isolate still a needle mover, or is it really more Sapphire Rapids later this year where you were kind of maybe potentially see a step function in revenues as that starts to pick up? Michael Hsing : Yeah. I can't relate those acronym, these names with that. I know the VR 13.5 is mostly -- is a ramp -- is a ramping now, as we see the revenue growth. Now VR 14, I think is a -- that'll be a next year story. Rick Schafer : Thanks. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Alex Vecchi from William Blair. Alex, your line is now open. Alex Vecchi : Hi, guys. Congratulations on the impressive quarter from me as well. Maybe Bernie, just on a more housekeeping question, your guidance for gross margin at the midpoint is looking flat quarter-over-quarter. Is that a -- is that due to end market mix or are you seeing any increasing manufacturing costs weighing on margins? And then, how should we think about sort of that resumption back to the 10 to 20 basis points going forward? Michael Hsing : Yes. We -- obviously now you see the consumers segment is growth too, and we have some -- and the slightly, or even with the lower gross margin. On the other hand, yes. The manufacturer costs is going up. Alex Vecchi : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on your inventory days, you guys have talked in the past about the 180, 200 day target. You've made some improvements quarter. How do we think about getting back to an ideal inventory level in terms of timing? Michael Hsing : Well, it's -- demand keep coming as is now. It wouldn't be difficult. We think about it end of the end of the year, we hope we will can go back to 180 to 200 days of inventory. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. I think if you look at whether it's the inventory that we hold on our books or particularly in the channel, it's very lean right now, and then we've already discussed delinquencies. So, we have a lot of catch up to do before we really can get the model to the 180 to 200-day goal. Alex Vecchi : Understood. That's it for me. I'll pass it along to the next. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. I will offer my congratulations as well. Just wanted to follow-up on Alex's question on the delinquencies and your ability to catch up with some of those delinquencies. I mean, how much of the ability to meet those delinquencies is going to come from the new 12-inch fab that you brought online in the fourth quarter of last year. Are you able to qualify more parts and other high volume runners on that fab? Or just kind of curious your ability to actually get to secure more wafer capacity from your five foundry partners in this very tight environment. I guess, a lot of companies are saying that they think supply constraints -- supply is going to remain constraint all year, which makes it sound like being able to get back to 180 to 200 days, delinquencies is a pretty tall order in calendar 2021. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. It's a great question. And thanks for allowing us the opportunity to give a little more context here. With the new fab, I mean, we were very pleased to report is one of our highlights that we were able to qualify parts and be able to inventory and ship them. But that process of qualifying more parts so that it can be meaningful as far as both deliveries and the dressing our delinquencies is ongoing. And it's going to require an investment both in the 12-inch capability, as well as this new fab that we're bringing up in 2021. So just because we've qualified a few parts and we've got the process started, it still takes about nine to 12 months before you have the full capability of. Michael Hsing : In 2020, we increase our capacity by 25%. It's -- pointing of off from my head, my rough calculations is about 20% to 25% increase last year. Quinn Bolton : I guess, my follow-up question was just on the comms space. Obviously, you had three very strong quarters in 2020, and then one of your large customers was no longer able to ship. I believe you may now have a license to resume shipments to that customer. And I'm just wondering if that's the case, do you have now perhaps a better outlook than you might have 90 days ago for the comms business in 2021? Michael Hsing : Absolutely. We will have a more clear -- and the customer start to place -- placing orders now. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. And I think there's two forms. There's a -- you identified one customer in particular. And I think we might see that begin to ramp in the second half of this year. But I think more broadly other opportunities are starting to come on not just with the top tier, but some of the second tier customers in the 5G and infrastructure area. Quinn Bolton : Great. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Stein from Truist. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, I'm wondering if you can update us on the longer term transition to selling more modules. I know that's something that is from a long-term perspective, potentially very creative to growth and margins. I think we're still pretty early in that process, but any movement in the quarter that you'd like to highlight? Michael Hsing : I think it's -- the result is a very good in the middle of this high demand. Actually, Bernie can tell you what is the ramps, okay, what is the increase. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. We had -- revenue doubled in 2020, and we exited the year where it continued to increase sequentially quarter. And it's interesting because we thought that it would have more narrow applications, particularly in industrial. But in fact, it's proven to be very broad based and also is sustainable. What I mean by that last point is that we thought that if people want to unit volumes, they might be more likely to go to components and just buy Silicon. And in fact, we're seeing a lot of people that are going into volume shipments with the modules as well. Michael Hsing : Yeah. It's all across our product lines. That's so I don't have total numbers for the modules that are -- in roughly, so like a $30 million, $40 million now, okay, I mean, compare a year ago. As Bernie said, it is half of that. William Stein : Great. And then one other thing I'd like to ask about is your MPS NOW service, did you see any change in that in the quarter? I know that's something that seemed to come online sort of just in time for the work-from-home COVID situation that I think was very helpful for you. Any change in that and any anticipated change if we hopefully are able to return to offices in the next quarter or two. Michael Hsing : Yeah. This is -- it's a great help. We set it up, okay, just at the beginning of our -- just the right before pandemics. All these softwares, videos everything's and also the bench, okay, the working bench, we just set that up we turn it on when the pandemic happens and it's receiver enormous praise from our customers. And in terms of how many new customers, we are really, really careful about. We increased a few thousand percent from the videos, from the virtual bench. Yeah. William Stein : Great. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan from Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open. Kevin Garrigan : Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one for me. You alluded a little to this earlier, but in your automotive segment, you've expanded into several other features of the automobile besides kind of infotainment. But can you give us -- can you talk a little bit about some of your design wins there? Are you kind of seeing more design wins and the ones you already have, how are kind of those progressing? Michael Hsing : Well, I think I should answer Rick Schafer's questions the more precise. The BMS is not -- we don't have a clear design wins in all those sites. And -- but to answer -- your question is we have pretty much across the board in from the body controls to ADAS and to lightings and to ADAS and also to all the sensors. And we have pretty much across the board, but our content that we expanded from $150, $140, and essentially doubled it. And -- but everything's at the beginning, while MPS' revenue so small, so we just -- but you see the net change. Bernie Blegen : On the dollar content, I just want to go back to that because it's an important part is this is not just unit sales, but some of the new applications that we're bringing on. We go from having $10 of available content to upwards of $40 or $50 for a complete system. So, we're getting both the unit as well as the ASP expansion. Michael Hsing : We're not talking about revenue small as a compare the market opportunity. As we said, we address the $6 billion market segments. And as now all MPS' product became as a total -- that's a total state. And we only have over hundred some million dollars in revenues. Bernie Blegen : $110 million. Michael Hsing : Yeah. $110 million in the most of a new product and ramping started from last year, second half of year. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Kevin Garrigan : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Hey guys, thanks for letting me ask a couple of quick follow-ups. Just two quick ones. First, you mentioned an answering a prior question about your ability to ship to the formerly banned product or banned customer. Is that just in the comms space or is that ban some of why your computing and storage segment also went down sequentially in the fourth quarter? Bernie Blegen : Again, we don't generally talk about individual customers. Sine this one's gotten so much visibility. We actually have three primary lines of business with them. One is in the consumer, one is in the data center and the other is an infrastructure. Ross Seymore : Infrastructure meaning comms, right? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Ross Seymore : Gotcha. Okay. And is there any difference in what you're able to ship going forward out of those three things? Are you able to ship all of them, or is it just -- not the 5G stuff, but the other two? Michael Hsing : Well, our products there -- again, there's a -- says the building blocks, okay. I mean, particularly in form former comm business and also \u2026 Bernie Blegen : Data center. Michael Hsing : The data centers, okay. And the shared same product. And we don't know exactly what they -- how they divide it. But consumer device -- consumer device more in the chargers, in the -- that we know. It's a pretty much -- it's continues. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Ross Seymore : Gotcha. And then, the last question is a little bit more housekeeping wise. Bernie, what are you thinking about tax rate for 2021? Bernie Blegen : Yeah. So, on a non-GAAP basis, we've historically used 7.5% and now we've moved to 10%, which represents that there's certain stock comp that is not as a deductible as it was in prior years. And then, looking ahead, we're not going to try to out guess what the Biden administration is going to do. But I think that we need to be sensitive to the fact that there may be increases both in the domestic rate as well as a higher tax rate on any international profits. Michael Hsing : Yeah. We don't know at this point. Ross Seymore : Got it. Thanks guys. Genevieve Cunningham : If there are any follow-up questions, please click the raise hand button. As there are no further questions, I'd like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Great. Thank you everybody. Appreciate your joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again the first quarter of 2021, which should likely be in the April timeframe. Thanks again, and have a nice day.",

Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Bernie Blegen : Thanks Genevieve. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $254.5 million 53.5% higher than the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly, broad-based market share gains resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions. 37% of our first quarter 2021 revenue resulted from new products introduced in the last three years. New product acceptance on this scale has paved the way for accelerated growth. Looking at our revenue by market, first quarter 2021 revenue from consumer markets of $66.2 million increased $28.8 million or 77.1% from the same period of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected a broad increase in overall demand. Along with the initial ramp - revenue ramp from our new mobile device charging IC. Consumer revenue represented 26.0% of our Q1 revenue compared with 22.6% contribution in the first quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 automotive revenue of $44.9 million grew 92.5% over the same period of 2020. This growth primarily reflected continuing sales growth for infotainment, safety and connectivity application products and first time revenue from products introduced in the 2021 model year. Automotive revenue represented 17.6% of MPS\u2019 first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.1% in the previous year. Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. . Our first question comes from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open. Joshua Buchalter : Yes, thanks for taking my question and congrats on another set of solid results. I was hoping you could elaborate on the inventory dynamics. You're one of the few companies that invested proactively ahead of the supply issues across the industry, but you're still not near your 180 to 200-day target. So just wondering how you're thinking about balancing rebuilding the channel versus, taking businesses some of your peers can serve or endorse of your share gains? Thank you. Michael Hsing : Well, as we expand, continue to expand our capacities, as we said it earlier - as we said it in last quarters. And I think that - we expected it with a current rate of increase the capacity will be at the end of the year or early next year. So we achieved that type of inventories. So if the demand is not continued to increase this much. Bernie Blegen : And I think it's notable, Josh, that we did increase both in terms of dollars and days, the amount of inventory we had from Q4 to Q1, which runs counter to the capacity constraints that some peer companies are experiencing. Joshua Buchalter : Got it, thank you that makes sense. And any more granularity you can provide in the guidance by end market for next quarter, any of the buckets moving materially more than the others? Thanks and congrats again. Michael Hsing : Yes, I would probably look to computing where there was a couple quarter gap in data center that data center should begin to take off again. I think automotive appears to be continuing to grow nicely both in terms of year-over-year performance and sequentially. And also we're seeing that same continuation in consumer. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to talk about the sustainability of demand. Recently in this earning season, a lot of semi-stocks have sold off on really good numbers. And it clearly looks like the market is worried about double ordering those sorts of peak cyclical activities? Michael Hsing : Yes, okay and of course, we concerning a double okay I mean in the past, we said okay, we have a rigorous procedures and okay to prevent that, okay. And we partial - we practicing partial shipments in the last six quarters, and we make sure so like - our customers have a very minimal on hand inventories. And the same times - we're not preventing their line downs okay their production line downs. To go back to your questions what's the demand and okay we believe and a lot of our demand is sustainable. The reason we said that, Bernie said earlier in a script and that for us these are Greenfield market, Greenfield product lines, we started to grow and as Bernie said, 37% of our products, we grow all from new products that we released from last three years. And there is no reason to believe next two years, and next years and not even talking about next six months. I'm talking about next couple years. These products will continue to grow. And at the same times, and with the product that we released in the last two years, that will continue to turn into revenues in the 12 months later. So we believe our growth is sustainable. Ross Seymore : Okay, thanks Michael. I guess for my follow-up a little more specific on one of your segments, the communications area has been very, very volatile. I know there is bans on different customers that can ship at different points in times. But can you talk a little bit about what's driving the sequential growth that was up so much in the first quarter, admittedly off of a weaker fourth quarter? And then as this year progresses, how do you see that market specifically more at the 5G side of things rather than the networking and gateway sides? Michael Hsing : We see as a matter of fact, I see have talk to - we have a committee casing meetings with the top tiers and a non-Chinese 5G makers okay and that market segment. So we're picking up and we\u2019ll believe, okay they believe this year and in the next year, they're on the delinquency to. Bernie Blegen : We believe we're very well positioned just as Michael said there, because the reach of new customers that we're addressing the 5G solutions is very broad. So, we think that as the market gains momentum, we're very well positioned to take full advantage of it. Ross Seymore : Great thanks, guys and congrats again. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you, Michael and Bernie, congrats again on a very strong quarter. First question, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your share gains especially during times when capacities really tight. So your solutions tend to be more integrated especially versus discrete and a lot of those discretes are in shortage. So I'm just wondering if you are seeing and acceleration in your share gains during this very tight semiconductor environment? Michael Hsing : Well, if examples and I can give you a couple of example - couple of scenarios and okay, if we were in a - it\u2019s a dual sources and our competitors using - our customers using dual source or triple source. And I was tend to be in a lot more a fewer components, then our competitor. And that is a one interpretation why the demands and we\u2019re gaining so much demand. And another scenario is for the futures, and we gain a lot of market shares, because just recently, because - for those new - there are new project the shippings, they were putting up production for next six to 12 months. And we have a lot of design win lately. Tore Svanberg : Great and as my follow-up, and you talked about the contribution from the new products, I know you're not going to give us specific information on pricing. But is it fair to say that the ASP is now of those new products are considerably higher than perhaps the last year or two? Michael Hsing : Yes for the gross margins we stay on course and we are not looking for a price hiking, price hikes okay I mean and that's probably is not sustainable? So like I think probably protects our models and again and going the same train as before, okay and Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Yes, and just to add to that yes, certainly the new products that we're introducing, and particularly those that are more heavily integrated. The mix of business does favor higher ASP for those new products. Tore Svanberg : Yes, that's what I thought. Okay thank you congrats again. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Bernie, you think it was you in the opening remarks? You said something about paved the way for accelerated growth? We all know Monolithic done pretty amazing job with regard to growth relative to the industry. But should we interpret that as meaning perhaps we stay above 20% for a more protracted period of time? Michael Hsing : I think that's all we see announced. And what we see announced and that could be in a year or two years ago. So that can only grow like 8% again mean the last year 30 somethings and that, and this year so far sort of we're in a very high percentage. And so we're look this kind of way it will continue. Bernie Blegen : Yes, I think that's the message that we've tried to say in the formal comments. And Michael added to that, if you look at the reason for our growth, both last year and this year, it has much more to do with market share gains and new products and having developed our supply chain than it does necessarily rely upon just the broader market. And so, certainly in 2019, we had high expectations, and we were - we're not immune to downturns in the market. But I think that if we have a more normalized demand, that we can perpetuate this accelerated rate of revenue growth, perhaps in excess of the 20% mark. William Stein : And then along these lines, I think a couple of other questions might have even alluded to it with regard to higher ASP, I think of a big driver of that is your transition to selling more of these modules those types of more complex integrated solutions? Is that the case and I'm hoping you might quantify that for us I think in the past you've talked about growth rates at least to offline of the module business maybe you can talk about whether this is reaching a size where it makes sense to disclose revenue from that piece? Michael Hsing : Yes, the module business is doing really well and like I mean and a modules/e-commerce business is doing really well. And I think we're beginning to find a way how to grow that. That business by no mean this is a - full blown business yet again, we haven't really break it out. And but that business announced and okay, IC it in - it's much higher ASP. And that will start to grow like a two years out will be a significant difference - and a significant contribution to the revenue growth. Bernie Blegen : One other aspect to add Will is, that if you look at certain of our end markets, and I'll pick automotive as an example, much more of what they're demanding is not for a specific IC, they want to have a system solution. So if you look for example, autonomous driving or ADAS there has to be built in failsafe redundancy. You have to have system communications throughout and the example I'm using here, that coordinate that the cameras, the sensors and the processor. And so you're buying, you're creating entire chipsets for a dynamic solution. And just by the natural consequence of how you're designing those solutions that have significantly higher ASPs. Michael Hsing : Yes, and to elaborate on that, and that these are not restricted to only a semiconductor that we design and we offer an entire solutions. And we design like and MPS don't produce anything, but MPS okay, including semiconductor, we design a semiconductor at the same time, we design other components. And we'll - now as Bernie said earlier, even in the automotive business, we're selling solutions, rather than in the past, we\u2019re selling a single piece of silicon in a two or three years later. I don't know - how can you specify as MPS is a semiconductor company, but we're a solution providers. And then we sell solutions, much higher, higher ASP. William Stein : Yes that's great. Thanks, guys. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from David Williams of Loop Capital. David, your line is now open. David Williams : Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. Michael Hsing : Thanks, David. David Williams : I wanted to touch on the capacity expansion and you had mentioned this earlier. But how is that progressing? And I guess, is it moving at the same pace as you would have expected just kind of given some of the tightness that we're seeing within the industry - or maybe is that moving - at your the pace you expected and maybe the pricing of that anything surprising there? Michael Hsing : Yes, capacity expansions - we mentioned about six quarters ago. So again I mean we steadily an increase in the last years and we did some extra work okay, to increase the capacity okay and from now on probably pretty continuous - kind of increase okay. And so Bernie, you can comment on that okay. Bernie Blegen : Yes, I think that we've been clear that in 2020, we brought up the 12-inch fab. And now we're continuing to qualify parts on that. In 2021, we're midstream and bringing up an 8-inch capacity. We're continuing to qualify parts. One of the underreported stories here is that we have existing relationships with our fab partners that date back as long as 15 to 20 years. And they're excellent relationships. And we have been able to manage both in terms of when there's under capacity and over capacity, where we have very even handed relationships. So even within our existing foundation or base, that they've been encouraged and been very positive contributors to helping us add capacity as well. So I think the important point here, as we said in our earlier comments, is that continuous investment has always been a part of MPS. It's a differentiator and that we see it as being able to expand over the next several years in order to keep up with the increased demand that we're anticipate. David Williams : Great, and then maybe just on the leverage, do you think that's remaining in the model here? Obviously, there's quite a bit that's embedded but how - we're thinking that gross margin at the brand and maybe even the operating margin. Where do you think those could go to as you really start to hit on all cylinders and get the revenue acceleration that you've mentioned? Michael Hsing : Well as revenue acceleration, we need to continue to invest. And obviously, as we can't grow out of thin air so many times, okay. And as long - as the growth rate there, can we see the growth rate in the next four years in the next four months. And once we see that we will invest. David Williams : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Thanks. Hey guys, I'll add my congratulations as well. Maybe a couple questions by end market I guess the first one is automotive. I think you guys outgrew SAR by 35%, 40% last year. And I know tight component supplies, kind of curved first quarter auto production didn't seem to hurt you guys too much. I know your auto business I think was up almost 100%? So I guess my question is, do you see that as a as an ongoing risk or something, that could impact your auto growth I'm curious. You almost doubled it this past quarter I mean, could it have been better if it weren't for components, supply constraints out there, whether they're direct or indirect or I guess any signs things - are things getting better yet in that auto food chain? Michael Hsing : Yes, whether as our growth is restricted by the shortage of a component from our customer size, okay we don't really know okay. I mean but on the other hand, we have total market share is addressable market where MPS is so small, so teeny tiny. And so, we will notice it, and all these Greenfield product growth okay I mean and these are new demand. And right off the bat okay and these products is just taking off. Rick Schafer : Okay thanks sorry Bernie. Bernie Blegen : I'm sorry, just to add one more quick comment we have seen nothing at this point, to indicate that there's necessarily been a slowdown in ordering and automotive. So again as Michael said, we can't make a guess as far as you know, whether there is a limit on demand. But we see continued strong numbers of our backlog. Rick Schafer : Great, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on hyperscale as you highlighted, Bernie. I think you've mentioned hyperscale spend kind of picking up or data center starting to show signs of life. So I'm curious, just with the launch of Ice Lake and things are - we are picking that up hearing that elsewhere as well, but hyperscale is getting better. How do you see I guess QSMOD data center? How do you see that ramping this year? I mean, is it relatively linear from here? Are we going to see a second half inflection of some kind? Is that kind of build some inertia? And I'm also curious, I think last quarter, you talked about 48-volt a little bit. I don't know, is it - is it still much too small to kind of break out or talk about, or can you give a sense of what kind of contribution 48-volt QSMODs is now? Thanks. Bernie Blegen : Sure. So let me start with the 48-volt question. I believe that there is significant growth opportunity for us in 48-volt. I think we're very well positioned as far as both GPUs and down the road in the eventual. Michael Hsing : AI. Bernie Blegen : Yes AI applications and there are even automotive applications that were positioned there. Michael Hsing : And that these are - it\u2019s not in the six months, probably nine months will the revenue will be significantly up. Bernie Blegen : Yes. So then turning to your other point, the point of inflection for QSMOD, and remember, just for everybody else's benefit that's our dynamic power management for the CPU processor. That really, we see good growth in what we refer to as VR 13.5. But it's when it goes to seven nanometer VR 14, which is expected for next year that, that's where we might get much more of an uplift market share gains. Rick Schafer : Got it thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Thanks, I will offer for my congratulations. Michael and Bernie, I guess my first question is I think you've sort of said 2020 and 2021 would be investment years, which would somewhat constrain your operating margin. Here in the near-term, it looks like your revenues is coming stronger than expected? And so even with that investment, your up margin is expanding, and if I'm doing my math right, it looks like up margin will be over 31% in June. How should we think about your level of investment as revenue continues to come in better than expected? Will you continue to invest or do you think you'll drive further operating leverage going forward? Michael Hsing : I think up to - from now we see the growth opportunity is, even higher than the last - than the three years ago. And so we will continue to invest and okay, as long as we see that okay as long as we can keep up that kind of growth rate. And if not - we\u2019ll definitely slow it down okay and until we regroup okay. So far - we see too much opportunities. Bernie Blegen : I guess that's a good problem. Michael Hsing : Yes. Bernie Blegen : Yes Quinn, I do think that there are further opportunities for operating margin expansion. But I think that we've tried to be clear on this Quinn. In particular the last 18 months, that we see that there's more value to our shareholders in being able to accelerate the rate of revenue growth. And that's really where we've been putting most of our emphasis on. Quinn Bolton : Got it? And the second question is, I think you touched on some of this with your disclosure, that new products were 37% of sales, but obviously, is the investment community worries about how much double ordering may be going on, given the overall industry tightness? I guess I'm wondering, do you guys have a figure you can give us for the percentage of your products that are either sole sourced, and/or new products? Because I think where, you know, the threat of double ordering maybe would be on older products that are dual source? And so I guess I'm trying to figure out, what percent of your revenue today might be from older products, that that could have alternative sources? Michael Hsing : Yes, let me put it that way okay. We have 37% of our products, okay, we have a 4,000, 5,000 products. So think about it and again, and these are 37% and okay of our product in January all these revenue as a portion of our revenue still relatively small. And still in the ramping stage and those products - they are mostly a single source. And as you say that these are legacy products and okay, once the production volume ramps somewhere into the stabilizer and that they will have a second source. And of course, we clearly, we experienced some urgency for - even double ordering okay. And as we said we try to keep them very, very minimal, and okay I mean and just prevent them from lying down at the same times and prevent - we prevent them to have - to carry too much of inventory. I don't know if I answer your questions maybe Bernie you can. Quinn Bolton : Yes that's helpful. I guess my last quick one for you. Bernie, do you expect to increase your absolute inventory dollars on hand in the June quarter? Bernie Blegen : Yes, currently, that's what we're modeling yes. Now again, Michael is careful to add that, this is the supply chain, we have pretty good visibility on the demand. We have to continually try to test and make sure we understand that. So on the supply chain we are looking at continuing to increase the dollar value of inventory sequentially in quarters. And demand, we just have to continue to reassess. But as Michael also said, our time horizon has more to do on the demand front, over the next 15 to 18 months as opposed to anything that we're concerned about in the next quarter or two. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open. Kevin Garrigan : Hi guys, let me echo my congratulations on the quarter. Just a quick one from me, you alluded a little to it before, I was just kind of wondering how your MPS now service and e-commerce business did this quarter. And how that compares to last quarter, which I believe also had some pretty strong growth, and just kind of looking a little further out, as things start to open back up, do you think that business will take a pause? Michael Hsing : I don't think it's a business taking a pause, and we just started - that would be very upsetting us, is simply just taking pause okay. And if we\u2019re taking a pause okay I mean we probably won't. At this time, we're still learning and may take a pause okay I mean and that's something we haven't really figured okay I mean. But so far as in the last - four, five quarters okay I mean, and the measurements that were in place, and that we\u2019re putting place and okay they are keep going up and orders and the interacting and demand creating the value for the index for demand - creation is to keep increasing. And I think they were turning to our revenues and okay and turning to a much bigger revenues. Bernie Blegen : Yes Kevin, if I could add to that a little bit is the e-commerce and the MPS now are just two legs or two aspects of the much larger story of how we transition from an IC company to a solutions provider. That also includes providing fully complete reference designs and a broad array of solutions in all of our different end markets. So this is really proving the longer-term model. And while we are still learning and the numbers are still relatively small, we're in the early innings of this. Everything is very encouraging that we're headed in the right direction and on to something that is very sustainable. Kevin Garrigan : Got it, that's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham :  As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Genevieve. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for the Q1 2021 earnings webinar. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call which will likely be in July. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q2, 2021 financial results and guidance for Q3, 2021, followed by Q&A session. Bernie Blegen : Thanks Jen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $293.3 million, 15.3% higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 57.5% higher than the second quarter of 2020. This broad based year-over-year revenue growth was a result of our diversified growth strategy, technological innovation and investment in production capacity. Turning now to our second quarter 2021 revenue by market, computing and storage revenue of $87.7 million increased 30.0% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential revenue improvement reflected increased demand and market share gains for servers and data centers and notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 29.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter consumer revenue of $76.1 million increased 14.9% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected earlier than normal sales of gaming console products.  Consumer revenue represented 25.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 25.6% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter automotive revenue of $48.7 million increased 8.5% from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to increase sales of infotainment products. Second quarter 2021 revenue was up 173.9% year-over-year, automotive revenue represented 16.6% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue, compared with 9.5% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 Industrial revenue of $43.3 million increased 8.9% from the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased sales of products for power source applications. Industrial revenue represented 14.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.3% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 communications revenue of $37.5 million was up 3.9% from the first quarter of 2021. Most of this sequential revenue increase was due to higher product sales for networking and wireless applications. Communication sales represented 12.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 16.2% in the second quarter of 2020. Operator :  Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. ToreSvanberg: Yes, thank you, Michael, Bernie, congrats again on another strong and record quarter. I was hoping you could update us on your capacity plans. I know you've done a pretty good job here, the last 18 months, your inventory seem to be in good shape, perhaps a bit at the lower end. But yes, maybe you could help us understand a little bit more what you specifically are doing on the capacity side. MichaelHsing: Thanks Tore. Our capacities as always in the past three or four years and we keep expanding. And now we continue that. However, we do have capacities of over $2 billion and before the middle of next year. So we have enough capacity for us to grow. And now we have just qualifier more product and release to productions. And ultimately in our customers' hand. BernieBlegen: And at the expense of repeating our self story. You recall that last year, we brought up the 12 inch fab. And this year, we've brought up 8 inch fab which is already contributing to inventory. So in both cases, what we're continuing to do is expand out by qualifying more parts so that we will be able to meet the $2 billion level by the middle of next year. ToreSvanberg: Very good. Thank you for that. And your cash balance has doubled here over the last couple of years. And it's now at $670 million. Obviously, it's a luxury issue to have. But what do you intend to do with that cash? Because obviously, you don't need that much. So do you plan to return that more back to shareholders? Are you potentially looking at M&A? And the reason I'm asking this is because it's so high now, right? I mean, I know historically, you've grown your business organically, but it's so high now that I just have to ask the question what you intend to do with it? MichaelHsing: That's a good question. As a company, I keep saying we transforming the company from a semiconductor to more solution providers and so we can utilize our cash much better than we can in the past and the strategy is  okay, we will buy in a tuck-in technology companies which comparable to MPS revenues, MPS as a general market coverage. So on the other hand we are also consistently raising dividends. And that's our strategy but we're not excluding buyback shares. Operator : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. QuinnBolton: You guys hope you can hear me but let me echo my congratulations on the strong revenue and the very nice, gross and operating margins. Bernie, I guess you teased us there at the end of your script, saying that you've got the capacity now to support acceleration in revenue growth. If I look at revenue last year, you did about 35% growth looks like this year; you might do better than that. I'm just trying to interpret when you talk about acceleration in revenue growth, what should we read into that? BernieBlegen: Yes, I think that you're familiar with our model, which is to outperform the industry by 10 to 15 percentage points. And, obviously, that's a model, that's a guideline. And there are certain periods where we have the right factors both strategically as well as from a market perspective, that allowed us to do better, and sometimes not as well as that model. So for example, if you look at last year's results, you could argue that at 34.5% growth, that we exceeded the market, which was right about 5% to 8%, depending on what you're looking at, by somewhere in the neighborhood of, 15-17 percentage points. And so we look at that is, well above our model, in the current year, obviously, we only guide to Q3. But it's not unrealistic to expect that within the range of possibilities that we could match that performance, or in fact do just a little bit better. So what we're trying to observe here is that in this two three year period, we're actually benefiting from a lot of factors that have us exceeding what our normal model is. QuinnBolton: Great, thanks for that additional color. Bernie, I also wanted to ask on the compute and storage business up 30% sequentially, I think you mentioned that it was share gains in both servers as well as notebooks. On the notebook side, I thought you already had pretty high share at the high end of the notebook market. So I'm wondering if you could comment, are you starting to see share gains and maybe more mainstream or even low end or Chromebooks on the notebook side. And are there any notable areas of share gains on servers? Thank you. MichaelHsing: Yes, so we do have some of the share gain across the board in a notebook market segment, as our technologies advanced in which lower the cost, our die size become much smaller. So the cost, the lower costs allow MPS enters a lower notebook segment. BernieBlegen: And then as far as server, we've been fairly consistent in articulating our strategy as far as being able to grow our market position with each succeeding next generation, particularly Intel and AMD products. Not limited to that though, but also on 48 volt GPUs. So it really expresses the point that we're branching up in share gains within the Intel family, but also branching out into these other opportunities. Operator : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. RickSchafer: Thank you and I'll add my congratulations. Just kind of keep amazing, everybody, I think I'll ask one more capacity, if that's okay. And it's coming from a spending kind of standpoint. Can you Bernie maybe remind us what the outlook for kind of spending just as a general rule as a percent of revenue, maybe starting next year, once all the new capacity is installed? I mean, I think you're getting so many questions, because everybody sees the kind of growth you guys are putting up. And it's awesome that you have $2 billion in capacity onboard by this time next year. But at this rate, it's only going to in a couple years, right you're going to be bumping your head-on by so. I'm curious because how soon would you have to look to begin ramping incremental capacity again? And what might impact beyond on spending? I'm curious what like, just hypothetically, in two years, three years time, if you're at $2 billion top line, like what would gross margin look like, for instance? BernieBlegen: Rick, thank you. Good question. Something that's really important to comment on here is that a lot of companies and a lot of analysts and a lot of investors are focused on capacity as if this is a new aspect of the semiconductor business. In fact, capacity is something that we have been managing for the 10 years that I've been hearing before that. It's an integral component to our growth strategy. And so the way that we've been doing it is sequentially adding new fabs and also assembly houses and testing capacity alongside of that to accommodate to be in front of what is expected revenue growth. So while we have made public comment on the fabs that we've invested in to date, we're still continuing on with ongoing relationships in order to secure more fab capacity for the future in order to accommodate that growth beyond $2 billion. MichaelHsing: Yes, as I said earlier, so we keep expanding and we will never stop. But sometimes faster, other ones -- other times it's slower, again, other than the capacities, physical capacity itself, we have to increase a lot of haircuts, and MPS is a very, very lean, and so we will hire -- we are hiring a lot of people. RickSchafer: Thanks. Sorry, I was having some trouble on my end. Thanks, Michael. And thanks, Bernie, quick question on auto, if I could, I mean, by my math, it's on track to maybe grow sort of an 80% or better range this year for you guys. I mean, I'm curious how much of that is being either directly or indirectly limited by supply? And if you could give a sense of what growth could be or talk about growth, maybe demand that's pushed and how that ultimately would show up in the model say next year? I don't know if you could maybe quantify or talk about your auto backlog and maybe where it is today. MichaelHsing: Maybe Bernie can, this year you said that you mentioned that whether the automotive product is limited by the capacities and the answer is not as much as other segments. Because automotive company, they give us a long lead times. And so we prepare the last year, the last didn't, our customer didn't consume that many of our products, okay and so it all translate to this year. And so we'll be able to ship them now. BernieBlegen: One of the aspects of automotive that's getting a lot of attention in the press has to do with the fact of electronic component shortages that are shutting down plants or limiting their ability in order to kit a car and put it assembly and as Michael just said we're actually not capacity constrained there. We are meeting all demand from them. And what's been interesting is one of the reasons that automotive got into this bind is because they were working with a just in time inventory model. And I think that they've learned from that that when the parts the electronic components are available, that they will stock them even though they don't have a complete kit to build the car. Now in our conversations and feedback that we're getting is they're actually only trying to satisfy real demand. But that is the timing of when the build plan, when they'll have the complete kit that they can then build the cars. So it's something that we want to monitor because there's been no change in the ordering pattern or our shipment schedule versus expectations because of the other limitations in automotive. MichaelHsing: Yes, I might as well add it, okay, about a year and a year and a half ago our inventory were at all time high. And that was one of the reasons that why we do that because we were a newcomer in automotive industries, okay, even though with this type of a current revenue. We're still in a very, very little on a market -- in a market percentage of a market, and so it's a clear as a newcomer, and you don't want to upset the customers, okay, and you don't have a product. So as all these as a lack of what we do to all these key customers, we have an inventory, even though they don't have a clear forecast. And so now is a really benefited us. And we gain a lot more design win activities. And because our competitor couldn't, cannot ship a product. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. WilliamStein: Thanks for taking my question. I hope you can hear me. With regard to first sort of maintenance question with regard to your capacity and inventory, which you've already explained quite a bit about on this call. Are you supply constrained at this time? Are you able to meet all the demand whether it's upside, or maybe customers stretching and trying to build a bit of inventory? Or are you in fact capacity constrained? And our lead times extended as you're communicating them to customers? And then I have a big question of more sort of strategic question after that. MichaelHsing: Yes, let me explain that way. Okay, we have less capacity constraints than compared to like a half year ago also, and however, as a customer's -- when you call, after you qualify all these new fabs, and we have a month or couple months delayed of a qualifying these product. And to qualify in the fab, it's not exactly science, okay, mean you use different supplier or different equipments, okay, mean different materials and all the problem, all these issue comes -- have an effect on how you qualify products in the end. So this time, okay, we just have to release a lot of new product, lot of existing product from different fabs. And so it's kind of a -- to answer your question here is the kind of a constraints, we have a lot more orders, and we couldn't fulfilled, okay mean but just only a couple of months late. BernieBlegen: And again, what we're trying to do here is make sure that we're servicing real demand, and not building up inventory, either in the channel or on our customer shelves. So what we've done is we've actually have very transparent relationships with our customers so that we make sure that we're in touch with their business sufficient to be able to make those trade offs. WilliamStein: Great, thanks. And then the follow up if I can, or the more strategic question, Michael, you refer to this transition from a semi company to a technology solutions company, and it's something I've written about specifically to transition from semi devices to modules. Any quantification around this and perhaps it relates to the ecommerce strategy as well. Any update in that area would be very helpful. Thank you. MichaelHsing: Yes. Thanks for asking for that question, now is overwhelming by the revenue growth and the company but not only from analysts from outside and the company inside company is overwhelming by the revenue growth, that allocations and the product allocations and in a lot of strategic things, okay, as less pronounced, okay but the module you're absolutely right module business is for a solution, as a solution transforming to a module company as we transforming, we're transitioning from semiconductor to a solution company. And the ecommerce, we have a teams and we finally, we have organized like a product line. And I know the activities in the last quarter also are quadruple. And so the revenue is still small, but is in the millions of dollars. Okay. I mean, it's more than a million dollars, okay somewhere $30 million - $40 million. WilliamStein: With a module and service? MichaelHsing: Yes, with the module and service and is growing, as you recall in about five years ago. Three years ago, it's almost zero. Yes. And four years ago, almost zero, okay, I mean we started that. And so we'll continue to focus on that. And so I truly believe that's our future. Operator : Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen. JoshuaBuchalter: Hey, guys congrats on the results. And thanks for taking my question. Gross margins in both the print and guide were meaningfully higher than your usual 10 to 20 basis point trajectory. Can you elaborate on the key drivers of the leverage there? And I guess speak to the sustainability? Was it driven by mix or something on the cost side getting wafers through your recently ran fabs? Thanks. BernieBlegen: Sure. I think that we've discussed in the past that, again, it's our model is that we want to be able to grow gross margin at 10 to 20 basis points sequentially, over the long haul. And we've demonstrated very good consistency in being able to do that. But much like I was describing before, this is an unusual period of growth for the company, both in terms of how fast the revenue is growing. And then obviously, as we described in the narrative, it was that the overheads is not, which would be like direct spending or inventory provisions or anything like that is not growing at the same rate as the revenue growth. And that's where we're getting the near term leverage. As we look out, obviously, we don't want to create an expectation that we're going to be able to grow at the same rate. But by the same token, we have established another floor level for what we expect sustainable gross margin to be. JoshuaBuchalter: That's helpful. Thank you. And then also on the model, I guess, you mentioned that consumer in console was a bit accelerated versus your normal seasonality. Can you remind us what you would expect the shape of the console business to look like in the second half? And maybe just give us some clues on revenue growth by segment? Thank you. MichaelHsing: Sure. I don't know if we call it normal, okay. I don't -- I can't think of a normal anymore. Okay. Regarding to our console business, yes, we win a lot of designing, wining the next design, okay, I mean I think the business continues, okay, I mean I think you have a better judgment than us what's the seasonality now for console. BernieBlegen: I think that Michael makes a very strong point there is that we've had so many puts and takes and different lines of businesses that have been added that the rule of thumb is not as applicable as it might have been back in 2018 or 2019. I would comment on is that we believe that we are optimizing across all of our different end markets. And again, it's really the strength of the model is in the diversification. And whereas a lot of the traditional seasonality would have been tied to consumer for example. Now we have much higher percentage of our business that is tied to computing, automotive and industrial, and they don't necessarily recognize the same level of seasonality. But then to sort of complete the question, I think if you look at the near term growth, obviously, the current year is benefited significantly from automotive and computing storage in particular. And we believe that going forward automotive along with communications should be our longer-term drivers. Operator : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. ToreSvanberg: Yes, thank you. I just have a few follow up questions. First of all, I have a question on your ASPs, which obviously tied to your revenue growth. So now that you are sort of growing in the 50% range, how much of that is units versus ASPs? BernieBlegen: Yes, I would say if you look at last year, and last year is representative what we're doing in 2021, is of the 34.5% growth 25% of that was tied to volume, 10% was tied to price. And I think when Michael talks about the solutions business; you're looking at previously selling an individual piece of silicon for $0.20 to $0.25. And now depending on the module, we can get between $1 to $3. And what we're looking to be able to do is design complete integrated solutions for different end applications, where those will be able to achieve for the total cost for that solution can be somewhere between $60 to $100. So, there's the ASP on the individual component, but it's more importantly, it's having that attach rate with the total solution. ToreSvanberg: Very good. And talking about systems, how's your motor business doing? I know that's probably the highest ASP products you have. So how's that business going? MichaelHsing: It's doing well, but the rest of our company is growing much faster. So it's still small. And you can't break out a percentage yet. But I think that was a -- we will more -- have a -- give a more category of our product rolls. Okay, as we divided into a more finer product line. Yes, we'll give it that number later. Okay. ToreSvanberg: Sounds good. Michael. And last one, about a year ago, you talked about getting into the medical end market any updates there? I mean, I know it's still probably very, very smallest percentage of revenue, but just trying to understand how fast your traction is in the medical end market. MichaelHsing: Yes. We have our product now. And that's a well, we're -- we have a several things that we have ultrasound and the ultrasound, we do generate revenue, we see the revenue now. Okay and the other one is x-ray machines. Okay, x-rays. And we put -- we have -- we are evaluating the first silicones and from our design size is  but we have some issue with the fab. But that's a very minor issue, okay, I mean we will be able to solve that problems. And it is outstanding, thank you for bringing it up this. And the performance is like a 5x, 6x better than existing solutions. So the image is a lot more cleaner now. And we couldn't deliver. And so I think the customers are waiting. And we're very excited. BernieBlegen: One other comment to add here is the technology that we're referring to here is related to our high performance or precision analog converters, right. MichaelHsing: Data converters, yes, right. BernieBlegen: And this has been something that we've been working on for I think about 2.5 and three years now. MichaelHsing: Two and a half years. BernieBlegen: 2.5 years. And I think what is really exciting is that this is incredible opportunity. And we're very close to being able to declare that it's commercially viable in the market. So it's not just a medical which is the first end market we're going after with this technology. But the other opportunities this opens up for us. MichaelHsing: Yes, it's same technologies, similar technologies that we'll be able to use in the telecommunication side. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt. KevinGarrigan: Hi, guys, congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one for me. I was wondering if you could tell us what percentage of your business or percentage of backlog is based on three year newer products. I think last quarter; Bernie and you had said new products introduced in the last three years were about 37% of sales. So just kind of wondering if this was in the same range this quarter? BernieBlegen: Yes, the reason that we use that stuff on sort of a one time basis was to really give order of magnitude to just how dynamic this new product introduction is as a component to our growth. So right now, obviously, in such a short one quarter term, it hasn't changed a whole lot up or down. But it's really not something that we want to be reporting on an ongoing basis. MichaelHsing: Yes, I think the last time we reported, is that 37%? Yes, I actually went back and look at it and was-- we actually cannibalize ourselves. And I think that's a better way, okay, rather than other big guys eat us alive. And I think that we cannibalize a quite a bit, okay; I think is somewhere as a 10% range. Okay, all these new products, we cannibalize it. And that's why the numbers are so high. BernieBlegen: But I would say that when there's cannibalization involved, you can bet that for market share gains against our peer companies that's really the leverageable part of this story. Operator : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. QuinnBolton: Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow up on Joshua's question on gross margins. I know in the near term, better overhead absorption is driving the better margins. But if you guys have access to capacity, and most of your competitors getting strained, I'm wondering, is there any room for you to get a little bit more to raise pricing in certain segments to take advantage of that capacity support? Or will you just continue to kind of put your foot on the pedal and try to drive as much revenue through that additional capacity to support rather than trying to do it through pricing? MichaelHsing: Well, yes, MPS is still a smaller, is a smallest analog semiconductor business, and at the same times, we want to have a deliver a consistent result. And so now you see the margin even in this period, we don't fluctuate a lot because we don't -- we just pass on our costs to our customers, and we don't randomly just raise because we can now the shortage, we can gouging a price, okay, and that affected our long-term relationship with our customers. And so we just maintain that and maintain our margins. Okay, I think this strategy fits everything, fits for us, yes. Operator : As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar and look forward to talking with you again during our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you and have a nice day. Michael Hsing : Have a nice day.",

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, as CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q3 2021 financial results and guidance for Q4 2021, followed by a Q&A session. In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q3 2021 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, and our Form 10-Q filed on August 9, 2021, which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2020, Q2 2021 and Q3 2021 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. Now I would like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Jen. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $323.5 million, 10.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2021 and 24.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. Looking at our revenue by market, third quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $52.2 million increased 20.5% from the second quarter of 2021, due primarily to increased revenue for industrial meters and power sources. Industrial revenue represented 16.1% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 communications revenue of $44.7 million was up 19.3% from the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased infrastructure demand. Communication sales represented 13.8% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. In our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $98.6 million increased $10.9 million or 12.4% from the second quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue growth primarily reflected sales gains in storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.5% of MPS' third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter automotive revenue of $54.4 million grew $5.7 million or 11.7% over the second quarter of 2021. This improvement reflects continued gains in applications for infotainment, lighting and ADAS. Automotive revenue was 16.8% of MPS' total third quarter 2021 revenue. In our consumer markets, third quarter 2021 revenue of $73.6 million fell 3.3% from revenue reported in the second quarter of 2021. This decrease in consumer revenue reflected lower handset sales. Consumer revenue represented 22.8% of our third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 GAAP gross margin was 57.6%, which was 160 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021 and 245 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 57.8%, 148 basis points higher than the gross margin percentage reported from the second quarter of 2021 and 231 basis points higher than the third quarter from a year ago. Third quarter 2021 gross margin on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis included a $4 million litigation settlement. Excluding this onetime benefit, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 56.6%, essentially flat with the second quarter of 2021 and 110 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $77.1 million compared to $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2021 and $60.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Our third quarter 2021 non-GAAP operating income was $108.4 million compared to $94.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $84.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 and $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2021 operating expenses were $78.7 million, up from the $70.3 million we spent in the second quarter of 2021 and up from the $59.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. The sequential increase in Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses primarily reflected in increased spending in R&D for qualifying parts for production and securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $922,000 charged cost of goods sold was $31.6 million, compared with $32.1 million recorded in the second quarter of 2021. Switching to the bottom line. Third quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $68.8 million or $1.44 per fully diluted share compared with $55.2 million or $1.16 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $55.6 million or $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $98.6 million or $2.06 per fully diluted share compared with $86.5 million or $1.81 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $79.4 million or $1.69 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2021 were 47.9 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $744.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021 compared to $672.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $117.8 million, compared with Q2 2021 operating cash flow of $96.9 million. Third quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $18.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2021 at $79.9 million, representing 22 days of sales outstanding which was two days lower than the 24 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and 11 days lower than the 33 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2021 were $208.1 million, up $30.8 million from the $177.3 million reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 134 days, which were nine days higher than at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 135 days, 18 days higher than the 117 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and six days higher than the 129 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Currently, our inventory levels remain lean. We are working very hard to return inventory to the 180 day to 200 day level necessary to support our future growth. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $314 million to $326 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.0% to 56.6%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.3% to 56.9%; total stock-based compensation expense of $30.8 million to $32.8 million, including approximately $950,000 that we'd be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $107.8 million and $111.8 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $77.9 million to $79.9 million. Litigation expense is expected to be in the range of $3.5 million to $3.9 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.9 million to 48.9 million shares. In conclusion, we are continuing to execute our strategy. I will now open the webinar up for questions. A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie and analyst. I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you and congratulations on these continued stellar results. First question, and not to, sort of, pick on segments there, but your consumer segment was down sequentially, and you talked about cellphone. I wasn't aware -- we don't think power had that much exposure to cellphones. Is this mainly on the charger side or anything else there that we should be aware of? Michael Hsing : Hi, Tore. Yes, I think, It is on the charger side. And we do these fast chargings, and we picked up some revenues in the last few years in those cellphone companies. And they thought that they can have a more adoption in the market. So they have some inventories, but it's an unusual way of charging of phones and that came in still not very popular. Tore Svanberg : Great. Thanks for clarifying that. And as my follow-up, you have a luxury problem now. You have about $0.75 billion in cash on your balance sheet. I know you're out there trying to secure more capacity. So first of all, could you update us on where you are on securing capacity, especially for the next few years? And related to that, will you start to use some of that cash more aggressively to potentially buying more equipment as you continue to obviously show very strong growth? Thank you. Michael Hsing : All right. Let me answer the first part first. It is -- the expansion is still on track, okay. And the fab issues, we don't have -- we have less fab issues. And we came -- we are on the way to expand our capacity in sometimes in the middle or -- middle of the next year to over $2 billion -- supporting $2 billion of sales. But at the same times, we do have to buy more equipment for testing, for qualifications and also, we need to hire more people. And as you know, to qualify each part it takes time. And the revenues there, opportunities there, it's just a matter of time. And so the second part is buying more equipment. On the other hand, as an investor, our shareholders, investors are very critical about our -- criticized in the past our spending, okay? I mean, we are out of -- we are slightly out of our model now, okay, and I -- we spend money on -- what I mean, a lot more careful, okay? But the opportunity is there, but we do more sensibly. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. And I think if I can just add to Michael's comment there is that as far as the model that we've always pursued, it was to have our fab partners and our assembly house partners absorb much of the capital required in order to build up capacity, and that remains our being as a fabless company. So nothing has changed in our model. We're just adapting it to this rate of growth that we're enjoying right now. Tore Svanberg : Thanks again. I\u2019ll go back in line. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. For my first question, Michael, I wanted to ask about a couple of the different computing markets that you guys have product to support. The first one, I think you could -- I don't know, from my perspective, if you could kind of drive a bus through what different PC expectations are for next year. And I wonder if you might touch on what -- rough percentage, Bernie, of revenue might come from the notebook market? And what your underlying planning assumptions are on the PC market for next year? And I guess, in contrast to that, how -- Intel is launching Sapphire Rapids, AMD is launching Genoa next year. What kind of a tailwind from a content perspective could those upgrades in the server market be? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks guys. Michael Hsing : Okay. For the notebook side, obviously, we gained some market shares in the high-end notebook in this -- after the pandemic, okay, or it was still the tail end of the pandemic. And we increased quite a bit of our market share. And -- but the story there is not -- it's not just we're gaining, that's all we can get. We -- as we increased our new generation with our technologies that's in place, and we will further reduce the cost, and we will address the high-end of our consumer side. And allow me if I address the -- answered your questions, Matthew. And on the server side, we are still a very, very small players. There's a lot more room for MPS to gain. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. And I don't think that we've ever specifically broken out what percent of the group's revenue is tied to any one of the categories that we track. But I think we have been clear that in each of the last two years, that the growth in notebooks has outpaced the rest of the sectors, including server and storage. Now having said that, one of the things that we're benefiting from is that diversification of how we're positioned in this group. As Michael indicated, we are a relatively small player when it comes to core power management for servers and we believe that with both the next generation of Intel and AMD processor releases, that we stand to benefit from market share gains. And in the more near-term element, as we called out in Q3, we're actually seeing a nice increase in storage sales, which is usually a precursor to ongoing infrastructure spending within the data centers. So I think that we're having a great difficulty, as anybody, in understanding when work from home or work from work, as it relates to notebooks, begins or ends. But I think that we're well positioned because of our diversification to enjoy continued growth in this category for a number of years. Matt Ramsay : Yes. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Let me go back to the notebook side that I can -- I think that part of the question, I didn't answer. And again, we're still facing shortages and still a lot of demand in the notebook side. And we don't see the -- we see revenues from -- in the middle of the next year even. Matt Ramsay : Got it. Thank you very much for all that commentary guys. Just a quick couple of things on gross margin. One, Bernie, the one-timer that was in Q3, any particular reason you didn't pull that out of the non-GAAP number? And secondly, with the pricing environment that we're feeling today, how do you guys think about price increases going forward relative to input costs and what that could mean to margins? Thank you very much. Bernie Blegen : I'll take the first half of that question real quickly. And then Michael will give comments on the second. As far as how we try to manage GAAP and non-GAAP reporting, is really to be a reflection of what is cash. And in this case, we highlighted that there was a settlement, and that was a cash payment that we received. And so that's the thinking behind not adjusting it as a non-GAAP item. Conversely so, if we have something that works to our detriment and it also has cash implications, we wouldn't non-GAAP that out either. So the two areas that we stay pretty closely to, or three, I should say, are only stock comp, gain and loss from a deferred comp plan and if we have any intangible acquisition amortization. Michael Hsing : Okay. The second part is how it affected our gross margins on the current supply shortages. I think, as I said, all these new -- well, let me say this, yes, we do see the cost increase in, fortunately, in all the product that we released have gained market shares as all these greenfield products. We started to gain momentum a couple of years ago. And these all have higher margins. And our customers give us a very long-term forecast commitment, and we honor those. We can absorb some in -- some of the cost and -- because the way these products have a much higher margins. And -- so during this time, we value the customer relationship and we don't gouge price. Genevieve Cunningham : All right. Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on continued strong reports and guides. One question on an end market. The communications side, Bernie or Michael, you guys said that, that was up because of infrastructure. That's been a really choppy market for you guys between the infrastructure side going on and off and then the kind of the access side. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you meant by the infrastructure side? And is that the start of something that's going to continue, or should you expect that segment to continue to be lumpy going forward? Michael Hsing : Well, Ross, you know then that we're transitioning from a these Wi-Fi routers and those to more in real infrastructures like I mean in data centers or these communication between the data centers and the switchers and even towers. So the last years, our customers are pulling a lot of revenues. And this time, then we see all the other things are going like 5Gs and including the commercial Wi-Fi systems and then and \u2013 where we play a critical role on these in these areas. And we see the expansions, and we will see a further \u2013 continue to expand in the next few quarters. Bernie Blegen : Yes. I think we remain very optimistic about our long-term positioning within the communication sector and in particular, infrastructure as it relates to 5G. But I think that right now, we have not hit a constant investment cadence on the part of the carriers in either Europe or North America. So we think that as that starts to gain momentum and gets more predictable, we're very well positioned to participate in that. Ross Seymore : Thanks for that color. I guess as my follow-up, seasonality versus kind of cyclicality and/or supply-driven moves. Obviously, your fourth quarter has guided a bit better than your traditional seasonality kind of flattish this year. But how are you thinking about that as we go into next year and beyond? Is it mainly going to be driven by the product cycles you have in short supply in aggregate? So those would be big tailwinds, or do you believe seasonality is going to become a framework that's something that investors should consider as we go into 2022? Michael Hsing : Well, Ross, you see the \u2013 this market is an exceptionally strong market, I mean. And like I mean, a lot of demand is everywhere, so like I mean, also are constrained by the supply. And we do have a delinquencies. And I mean, but that's we're facing delinquency for many quarters, like I mean \u2013 and for \u2013 I think we still have the \u2013 my opinion is that we still have some kind of seasonality in fourth quarters because all these holidays, all these and it will kind of affect us. And so we see the \u2013 as I said earlier, we see the demand is still very strong. So like I mean we're just cautious, and we are on our guidance. Ross Seymore : And just to add to that is that right now, what we are continuing to do is investing and expanding our capacity because we do believe that this robust demand that we're experiencing will continue, and we want to be able to participate, optimize to the best of our ability, this growth opportunity. Michael Hsing : Yes, let me clarify the shortages, okay. All these \u2013 what I mean with shortage is that we have a few thousand products and always have some mixed issues. And as we don't have a serious \u2013 we don't have fab capacity issues. And \u2013 but all these are mixed in the \u2013 for particular product that we may have \u2013 we have a few products that have a \u2013 are facing shortages now. So \u2013 and as we transfer to a different fab, it just takes time to qualify this. Ross Seymore : Got it. Thanks, guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open. Alex Vecchi : Hey, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Maybe just to piggyback on Ross' question a little bit with seasonality. Bernie, can you give a little color on how we should think about the sequential growth rate by end market for Q4 in terms of maybe strongest end market to weakest? Bernie Blegen : Sure. So, when you look at Q4, I think that the two primary drivers are going to be computing and continuation of automotive. And then you would normally expect and we expect to see a slight downturn in consumer. So, I think many of the trend lines that we're familiar with are continuing and ongoing, but the amplitude might be a little up or down from what the traditional seasonality has been. Alex Vecchi : Great. that's helpful. And then similarly, I think on the communications line as well over the last couple of quarters, I believe you guys have pointed to ramp up to that Tier 2 5G OEMs. How should we be thinking about the opportunity eventually next year to crack into a Tier 1, or just generally, how to think about how you're positioned there geographically? Michael Hsing : Yes. We are designing all -- in all Tier 1s now. And we are so small still like I mean in these big growing market segments. As you know, we don't have anything in 4G, and we expect that we'll be a significant players in there. Alex Vecchi : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. With that, I'll go back in queue. Michael Hsing : Okay. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hi guys. Let me offer my congratulations. Michael or Bernie, I guess I wanted to -- I know there have been a lot of disruptions in Southeast Asia, more on the package and test side. Wondering if you could just say whether or not you have any exposure to Malaysia subcons and whether that affected your ability to ship or receive products here in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter looking forward? Michael Hsing : Yes. There's not so much that affected it. Maybe some products, not I mean -- because we control a lot of our -- the new product, we control our own package technologies. And so we always qualify in a different locations. And so we came in that -- the Southeast Asia problems, okay, we can go through it. We didn't have that much of issues. Bernie Blegen : Correct, in either Q3 or our outlook for Q4. Michael Hsing : Yes. Quinn Bolton : Got it. My second question just on the supply chain is it sounds like from your comments, you're not seeing some of the fab constraints that you'd seen earlier. And inventory increased by $30 million sequentially. I guess my question is, as that capacity comes online, as you ramp inventory on hand, do you think that, that could lead to an acceleration in your ability to meet former delinquencies and see revenue growth rate potentially accelerate as you meet some of those delinquencies, or it -- does it really all come down to that product mix of what customers are demanding versus what you have in inventory that you see that mismatch potentially continuing for several quarters? Michael Hsing : Yes, to answer your question, as today, absolutely. And we have a lot more we can chew off now. And as the shortages go on or the new product adoptions in all the greenfield products that we ramp up much, much faster than we expected, and we have a normal out-of-forecast orders and we cannot fulfill. And these ones, our customers understand that. I mean -- and so we -- so now, as of today, we have a blue skies. And -- but doesn't mean -- we're not regulators, so I can't forecast it. Bernie Blegen : Just to add, it's a balancing act, as you can appreciate, because for some of the more mature products that we have, they already have developed markets and a fairly predictable growth in the current market. But what we're trying to do is make sure that these new product introductions can be successful, because that is going to be the future growth opportunity for the company. So, we're trying to satisfy sort of the run rate business in this heightened demand, a period of heightened demand, and at the same time, have very successful new product launches with new customers. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Can I squeeze one last one in? Do you guys have any meaningful exposure to Chromebooks? And is that a share gain opportunity as you look into 2022? Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes, we have. And it's -- if we have a local product, we might as well make them and go design, I mean, everywhere. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Chromebooks are unique, because while they're considered a -- we tend to go after high-value notebooks, and Chromebooks are known to be lower priced. But they depend on the access to the cloud and good processing power. So the power management, our power management solution is very key. It's a high value for the Chromebooks. Michael Hsing : Yes. As I said earlier, as our technologies bring online in -- become more mature, so that can mean why not just attacking all these other markets that we're not in. Quinn Bolton : Yes. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. Q \u2013 William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the great results and outlook. I'm -- I want to ask one question about supply chain stuff and one about long-term growth. First, on the supply chain, it seems -- certainly, if we look not just at your business but across semis, that customers have been in sort of freak-out expedite mode for quite some time. I wonder if you could give us a sense as to whether that abated at all. Did the level or breadth of expedite requests change meaningfully in the quarter? Is it getting hotter or colder in any end market with regard to this sort of urgency of expedites and pull-ins and upsides and all that activity we've heard about? And then again, I have a long-term growth question. Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. The answer is okay. I wish that they come down a little bit, then I mean -- and that they're exactly the same as the last quarter and the quarter before. And -- yes, okay. William Stein : Okay. So the long-term growth question, Michael, I think we've discussed this many times, but we're aware that there's this long-term potential to transition to more of a solutions provider with modules relative to your traditional semi device business. Can you talk about the trajectory of growth of the modules business? An update on perhaps percent of revenues today relative to a quarter ago and where you think it -- that could go over time? Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes. I -- our homegrown modules, okay, well, all this strategy, there's MPS involved. There are a lot of technicals in the gate in terms of delivering the end product. Okay, it feels -- there's no end project, it's a mid product, as I feel it well. So our strategies are move up to a food games. And since we put -- we have the knowledge and why win are not captured all the values. And for currently -- current, our module growth, okay, I mean it's much faster than other semiconductors side or selling the chips. But the volume overall is still very small, so like I mean, compare the entire revenues. We tried it different ways in like a launch our websites and like a NPS analyses. And then, they're also using e-commerce, okay? These are doing well. And -- but -- now I'm thinking about it, why we're just applying companies, like I mean, -- and we know that, we need to gain knowledge, gain sales channels, like I mean -- and have those company adopting an MPS technology, we can provide them with better tools, again. And I think the first field attempt in -- are very, very, very encouraging. So like I mean, obviously, I can't talk the detail now. So again, -- and I think that's our strategy. Bernie Blegen : And if I can just remind you, Will that we talked about this -- touched on it last quarter. And we indicated that what we're trying to do is source different technologies through either IP acquisitions or talent acquisitions that are complementary to our business. And that will accelerate our ability to be a solutions provider for our customers in the next seven, eight years. Michael Hsing : Yeah. I just don't like it. We have so much knowledge to put an end to it. And in the end, we sell a piece of silicon averaging well below $1, okay? We should sell our solutions at much more than $1, so like a $5, $6, $10, those type of things. And those customers will really appreciate it. They don't have to design from scratch. William Stein : That's helpful insight. Thank you both. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Wei Mok : Hi. Good afternoon. This is Wei Mok on the call for Rick Schafer. I just wanted to echo congrats on the results. So for my first question, it's in regards to auto, so it's pretty much well known that the market is supply constrained though you guys are still growing nearly 90% this year. With industry reports showing vehicle unit production improving in 2022, how should we think about your auto business as we look into 2022? Michael Hsing : Well, it's a very -- at this time, we see everything is very rosy now. And we -- but on the other hand, in -- we are so small. There's no reason, we would not grow, even the downturns. And as we have looked at the addressable market is that this is like over $6 billion, okay? I mean that's conservatively numbers. That's a conservative numbers. And as we introduce more products in especially in ADAS and the EV proportion size. And, okay, we are developing products. I mean, all of these, and again, we can address the future growth really well. So like I mean, there is 2022 -- and okay, there's no reason not if it's a -- I would not say there's a lack of tool like last year, so like also in the auto industry just stopped like I mean, it was a in the normal times. And there's no reason for us not to grow. Bernie Blegen : And I think to just follow on to the previous question. When we look at automotive, we actually have system-level design wins in ADAS, regenerative braking systems and in external lighting. And all of these solutions have much higher dollar content for us, $60 to $100 per vehicle. So I think this is a very exciting example of how the solution strategy could play out in different end markets for us as well. Wei Mok : Got it. Great. Thanks for that. As for my second question, it's regards to the console. You guys highlighted consumer being down in 4Q. So is this more of a reflection of normal seasonality, or are you seeing any supply constraints impacting consoles? Thanks. Michael Hsing : Well, Q3 -- in Q3 in consumer side, it shouldn't be the highest to us. And I think at our customer side, they have too much inventory in the -- for the cell phones in like I mean that affects us. And then in the cellphones especially that's in China, like I mean when they \u2013 when the US had an embargo on one of our companies, but the other ones, they thought they can gain the market share. Like I mean, actually, they didn't. And so they're stuck with the inventory. Bernie Blegen : And I think that what we tried to do in our prepared comments is really make that dip more narrowly defined, but it is really the fast charger in the handsets as opposed to anything that is more broad or pervasive in the rest of consumer? Wei Mok : Okay. Thanks for that. Michael Hsing : Yeah, we didn't have much of an exposure in the handsets, and that wasn't my favorite either anyway. So we've got the least products, however in the last years and okay, why not, okay? But now it's okay. We thought it would be a good. Bernie Blegen : The technology has actually been very well positively received. It's just the imbalance as far as the demand that was expected has trailed those expectations. And so we believe that they have excess inventory and so we're seeing a slowdown for that particular individual category. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open. Hans Mosesmann : This is Hans for Kevin. Congrats. A couple of questions. Along the lines of inventory, I think AMD, Micron, on the PC side of things, and Texas Instruments on a broader basis, are indicating that customers are changing their behavior a bit in terms of how they take in components in a supply-constrained environment. So rather than just take everything they can get, they're being more selective. Is that something you guys are seeing? And is that unusual if you are seeing that? Thanks. Michael Hsing : We are too small, but these \u2013 we're a very small player, much smaller players compare with the Texas Instruments or the other guys. We don't have a luxury of picking market segments. We're only focusing on long terms. Focus or not focus. We don't do short-term business anyway. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. To answer your question really succinctly, we haven't seen any change in ordering patterns or our delivery schedule and really don't have an opinion on what the broader market or other market participants are experiencing. Hans Mosesmann : Fair enough. And so just the last question, your visibility in terms of when you can capture or get back to that 180 to 200 days of inventory, has that changed? And what is that time line? Is it the end of next year? Is it 2023? Thanks. Michael Hsing : I think the end of the next year would be a good number. Yeah. That's what we \u2013 that's a \u2013 if the market goes \u2013 continue to go this strong, so like I mean hopefully, some we can catch up at the end of the next year. Hans Mosesmann : And that's \u2013 is that a push-out, or is that a pull-in from last quarter? Bernie Blegen : I'm sorry? Michael Hsing : Again, you said I talked about last quarter, pull-in or push-out. And like I mean, as I said earlier, we have a \u2013 we still have a delinquent season, like I mean \u2013 and we're having more delinquency than a customer push-out let's say it that way. Hans Mosesmann : Okay. Bernie Blegen : I think the important thing is that, even with the demands that are placed upon us and Michael is correct that we saw no change in Q3 from what we experienced in Q1 or Q2. We were able to increase inventory in a meaningful way this quarter. So again, I refer back to an earlier answer. We said the balancing act that we're trying to do between satisfy more run rate business at the same time as we're meeting demand for our new products as well as building inventory that gives us more flexibility. Hans Mosesmann : Great. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Okay. Genevieve Cunningham : Next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. I just had a few follow-ups. First of all, Bernie, the gross margin guidance for Q4, that does not include any more litigation impact, right? That's... Bernie Blegen : That is correct. Tore Svanberg : Okay. Great. So the other question is, a lot of your competitors are discrete companies, and they're probably allocating their products all over the place right now, which I assume means you're gaining share. Can you just talk a little bit to the stickiness of that? I mean I assume once they go with an integrated solution there, they're not going to go back Michael Hsing : That's very true. And when they've tasted a simple, easy solution, it's difficult. And for these high end -- a little bit of high end in the market, that's what we focus on. The customer pay for it, and they deviated from the way they -- their behavior, how they design product. And I think that's a huge benefit to us. And our other customers, the more in the low-end consumer business, we don't care. Tore Svanberg : Got it. Just one last question. Michael, in the past, you've talked about, especially in servers and automotive, kind of just getting the side dishes. But eventually, you'll get the main course. Should we expect those two segments to see some main course revenue in 2022? Michael Hsing : Yes, yes. We are keep eating the crumbs, okay. We eat a lot of crumbs like a whales. Well, not whales. We -- we're small fish trying to eat a lot of crumbs. And now the fish is like, we grow ourselves a little bit, we can eat the real meals, like I mean we -- as you we keep saying, okay, we have the reference design in Intels, and then the real OEMs pick up a onesie and a twosie for these projects and but these are the real beast, like I mean, end up a little bit small. So I think in the next years, we will grow much bigger in so called VR14s and VR13.5. We benefit a lot in -- and other than the point of loans and the E-Fuse and that kind of growth came in, now we really have a core power, have a meaningful revenue coming next years. And now talking about VR14 yet again. And the other thing that worth to mention about and there's about a 48-volt process, as we said earlier. And like I mean by these years, and we forecast about this year and the next year, the cross point had to happen. And like I mean we're waiting -- we were waiting about three, four years ago. And we said that until we end up -- when the powers keep increasing and the heat generation, heat dissipations, they cannot handle anymore, they have to use the 48-volt solutions, and this has happened. And start from AR and next year, we see many data centers adopting 48-volt solutions. And well, we have a benefit of a large lake. Tore Svanberg : Great. Thank you very much Michael Hsing : Okay. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham :  As there are no further questions, I would like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call, and we look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter conference call, which will likely be in early February. With that, thank you, and have a nice day. Michael Hsing : Okay. Goodbye.",

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, as CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, and Form 10-Q filed on November 8, 2021, both which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q4 and full year 2021 earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC and is currently available on our website. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Jen. In 2021, MPS surpassed the $1 billion revenue milestone by achieving record full year revenue $1.2 billion, 43.0% higher than the prior year. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and being recognized by more first tiered companies for our superior technologies, product quality and excellent customer support. As we see more highly \u2013 high quality growth opportunities ahead of us, we continue to invest in our infrastructure and operational capabilities. In 2021, MPS grew capacity by 40% and we are on track to expand capacity in 2022, well beyond $2 billion allowing the company to successfully ramp new product revenue and achieve strategic market share gains. Here are a few highlights, which we achieved in 2021. Brought online a new 8 inch fab and continued to qualify parts in the 12 inch fab, we brought online in 2020. We will continue to invest in growing fab and assembly capacity. We design processor cores and MCU technology into products requiring more sophisticated power solutions such as USB power delivery, smart motor drives, and high power electrification. Our first prototype of a high precision analog digital converter product for medical applications achieved outstanding silicon performance and lab evaluations. We have started customer sampling in Q1 2022. Validation of this technology is a strong first step in developing a new business segment supporting both industrial and infrastructure end market applications. We believe new product revenue from a large number of previously released designs will ramp in 2022. The representative sample includes product supporting applications in VR14, 5G, BMS, ADAS, AI, USB PD, DDR, and many more. Turning to our full year 2021 revenue by market segment compared to 2020, automotive revenue was up 87.5% computing and storage revenue up 47.0%, industrial revenue up 54.5%, consumer revenue up 28.1% and communications revenue up 15.3% demonstrating just how broad based our full year 2021 revenue improvement was. Automotive revenue grew $95.4 million to $204.3 million in 2021. This 87.5% year-over-year gain primarily represented increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting the digital cockpit, automotive \u2013 automated driver assistance systems and connectivity. Automotive revenue represented 16.9% of MPS\u2019 full year 2021 revenue compared with 12.9% in 2020. Full year 2021 computing and storage revenue grew $119.1 million over the prior year to $372.3 million. This 47.0% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for enterprise notebooks, cloud computing and storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.8% of MPS\u2019 of revenue in 2021, compared with 30.0% in 2020. Industrial revenue grew $65.2 million to $184.8 million in 2021. This 54.5% year-over-year increase was broad based with each our primary product lines enjoying better than double-digit revenue growth. Industrial revenue represented 15.3% of MPS\u2019 full year 2021 revenue, compared with 14.2% in 2020. Consumer revenue grew $61.9 million to $282.3 million reflecting increased product sales for home appliances and smart TVs. Consumer revenue represented 23.4% of MPS\u2019 full year 2021 revenue, compared with 26.1% in 2020. Communications revenue grew $21.8 million to $164.1 million. This 15.3% improvement reflected higher sales of products for both infrastructure and wireless riders and gateway applications. Communications revenue represented 13.6% of our 2021 revenue, compared with 16.9% in 2020. Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $336.5 million, 4.0% higher than revenue generated in the third quarter of 2021 and 44.4% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. By market segment, revenue for computing and storage grew 91.6% year-over-year, communication grew 54.7%, automotive grew 43.2%, industrial grew 33.3% and consumer grew 1.9%. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP gross margin was 57.6%. Same as third quarter 2021 and 230 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $78.6 million compared to $77.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2021 and $40.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 non-GAAP gross margin was 57.9%, 10 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2021 and 220 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. The year-over-year expansion in fourth quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was largely due to a shift in sales mix, favoring high value greenfield products and operational efficiency gains, which more than offset higher product input costs. MPS achieved noteworthy market share gains in 2021 due in large measure to product availability and discipline sales price management. Our non-GAAP operating income was $112.0 million compared to $108.4 million reported in the prior quarter and $66.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. Let\u2019s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $115.3 million in the fourth quarter compared with $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $88.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses were $83.0 million up from the $78.7 we spent in the third quarter of 2021, and up from $63.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2021 litigation expense was a credit balance of $420,000 compared with a $3.4 million expense in Q3 2021 and a $1.5 million expense in Q4 2020. The credit balance in fourth quarter 2021 litigation expense reflected it an IP settlement refund of a legal retainer and lower than anticipated fees. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2021 stock compensation expense including $921,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $31.2 million compared with $31.6 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP net income was 77 \u2013 $72.7 million or $1.51 per fully diluted share compared with $1.44 per share in the third quarter of 2021 and $0.90 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Q4 2021 non-GAAP net income was $102.1 million or $2.12 per fully diluted share, compared with of $2.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021 and $1.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2021 will $48.2 million. Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021 cash, cash equivalence and investments totaled $727.5 million compared to $744.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021. For the fourth quarter of 2021, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $28.2 million compared with Q3 2021 operating cash flow of $117.8 million. The between quarter drop in operating cash flow primarily reflected a $51.3 million increase in inventory and higher accounts receivable. Fourth quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $17.6 million. Accounts receivable end of the fourth quarter of 2021 at $104.8 million or 28 days of sales outstanding compared with the $79.9 million or 22 days of sales outstanding reported at the end of the third quarter of 2021 and the $66.8 million or 26 days reported at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 were $259.4 million up from the $208.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice and as you can see from the webinar video, days of inventory rose to 166 days at the end of Q4 2021 from the 134 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Historically, we\u2019ve calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter\u2019s revenue provides better economic match. On this basis, again, we can see days of inventory increased to 152 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 from 133 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2022 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2022 revenue in the range of $354 million to $366 million. We also expect the following. GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.4% to 58.0%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.7% to 58.3%. Total stock based compensation expense of $36.9 million to $38.9 million, including approximately $1.1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $119.2 million and $123.2 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $83.4 million and $85.4 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Litigation expenses to be in the range of $2.3 million to $2.7 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.8 million to 48.8 million shares. Finally, I\u2019m pleased to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.75 per share from $0.60 per share for stockholders of record as of March 31 2022. In conclusions, MPS\u2019 strong financial performance in 2021 was largely due to a 40% increase in fab and assembly capacity, which supported our high-value, greenfield-product, revenue ramp. Looking ahead, MPS is on track to expand capacity in 2022 well beyond $2 billion, allowing the company to successfully ramp new product revenue and achieve strategic market share gains in 2023, 2024 and beyond. A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. And congratulations on the very, very strong results. So I\u2019m going to ask this question differently. Usually, people ask you how come you carry so much inventory, this time I\u2019m going to ask you, how were you able to actually get your inventory there\u2019s that high. How are you both finding the capacity and again being able to build the inventory in spite of this very, very tight environment we\u2019re seeing in the industry? Michael Hsing : Well, as you know, in this business, building a inventory a qualifier fab, okay. These are now one day, two day things, enough short-term. These all we planted a few years ago. And now we are cut just the opportunity presents it and we just catch it. And nothing was short terms and okay, we couldn\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have a crystal ball for the futures and we just react, we just plan ahead and react as fast as we can. Bernie Blegen : And I think to add to that, that shows that we have a lot of inventory on hand that presents the capacity to allow us for sales in the next two quarters. So what we\u2019ve done is made conscious investments in inventory, in the supply chain. And what we\u2019re trying to do is manage such that we hold the inventory, we\u2019re still keeping channel in the \u2013 channel inventory lean. And we\u2019re trying to make sure to the best of our abilities that we\u2019re in touch with the inventories that our customers are keeping. So they\u2019re likewise lean. Michael Hsing : Yes. I also want to add and okay, as you remember and a few years ago, and I talk about it. MPS is going for well beyond million or a couple million dollars. And I wasn\u2019t joking and we plan ahead for our business. That\u2019s what we saw a few years ago and now you grow this much is, of course, we didn\u2019t expect that. But we do have a capacities and okay \u2013 and we do have to do some creative ways in the scrambling to get to 45%. And so that\u2019s all that is, like, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have a magic tricks and then in the last six months or so. Bernie Blegen : And it\u2019s good as you have note \u2013 as Michael noted, we crossed the $1 billion revenue threshold and our revenue growth rate is accelerated from historic precedent. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Well done. As my follow-up question, could you just add a little bit more color on the $2 billion worth of capacity? You\u2019ve talked about now, ramping in on 8-inch, you\u2019re also qualifying products on 12-inch. Will there actually be 12-inch product sales this year? Michael Hsing : Yes. We\u2019re qualifying, as you know, so MPS don\u2019t build a fab. And we don\u2019t have a lot of capital spendings and again, but we do have a increase all these capacity qualifier fabs, that cost money. And so to answer your questions, like, and we do transitions \u2013 nowadays. Okay. We get all this capacity whether it is 12-inch or 8-inch as much as we can. Bernie Blegen : And just add to that, that was our second 12-inch fab that we brought online in 2020. Michael Hsing : Yes. Tore Svanberg : Right. Very good. I\u2019ll go back in line. Thank you and congrats again. Michael Hsing : Okay. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the odd popping results and outlook. I want to ask about the module business that you\u2019ve spoken about in the past, this thing that might even accelerate growth further over time. I\u2019m wondering what percentage of revenue modules contributes today and how we should think about the trajectory of that business. And if you could also comment on any potential tuck-in acquisitions that were either executed or contemplated for in the future to fulfill your strategy in that area. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. I\u2019m glad you asked the question, the module business I think it\u2019s a side of a 10% for this year. Bernie Blegen : It\u2019s actually mid single digits. Michael Hsing : Okay. Yes, yes. And so you can quantify as a much more accurately. Okay. I don\u2019t know the others of numbers in detail. All I know is, and okay, we grow 100% every years in the last couple years. And now you using the word accelerating this years and the next couple years, that\u2019s what I see it now. And the other things, okay, the second part of your questions about acquisitions for the tuck-in technology or to enhance our future growth on the \u2013 using our MPS technology for those companies. Yes. We are engaged with handful \u2013 as a handful of a company, like, more than six companies and we\u2019re \u2013 so far we\u2019re engaging with it and nothing we \u2013 nothing materials lies. We should announce it now. William Stein : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open. Alex Vecchi : Thanks for taking my question. And I echo the congratulations on the outstanding results. Just maybe to expand on Tore\u2019s question with regards to the capacity expansion from $2 billion on, can you quantify how much more capacity do you think you\u2019ll be adding in the next year or two or three or the right way to think about it? I think in the past, you\u2019ve alluded to the fact that the current product portfolio can support upwards of $3 billion to $4 billion in revenues. So is that sort of the right way to think about the long-term trajectory? Michael Hsing : Yes. That\u2019s absolutely correct. And for the semiconductors, yes, we have to have a fab capacities for that kind of revenues. But even going the features, because we\u2019re selling more high-dollar modules and solutions and which utilizes silicons even less. So we have \u2013 we should have \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t \u2013 and our CIMIC wafer capacity even so will be less factors. Alex Vecchi : That\u2019s actually really helpful. And then similarly with the comments on \u2013 in terms of the segment breakdown, the Storage and Compute segment was very strong in the quarter. And I think you\u2019ve talked a little bit about enterprise notebooks. It seems like that\u2019s one of the areas, notebooks in general, where there\u2019s a little investor trepidation going forward. Can you maybe talk about what the opportunity there is and \u2013 or maybe what the SAM is for your notebook outlook over the next few years? Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think it\u2019s important to qualify that the growth that we\u2019ve experienced, in particular over the last two, three years, has really been at the enterprise level, where we\u2019re selling into units that would retail for above $1,200. And we\u2019ve been very successful as far as capturing a large part of market share that really is not necessarily driven by consumer trends. So they\u2019re not as prone to the downward unit numbers that are being projected for notebooks. Michael Hsing : Yes. Overall, we want to achieve a balanced growth. We don\u2019t want to be known as a notebook company. And that\u2019s MPS\u2019 strategy is diversify the growth. Bernie Blegen : And just to pick up on Michael\u2019s point, we saw a very strong uptick in our cloud and server business, particularly in Q4, which we expect to continue to ramp into 2022. Michael Hsing : Overall, the notebook revenue is very, very \u2013 is a single digit now. Alex Vecchi : Okay. Thank you. With that, I\u2019ll hop back into queue. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. I offer my congratulations as well. Bernie and Michael, I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t gotten the question yet, but I followed the company for a long time. I think this is the biggest gross margin beat you guys may have ever put up. If I got my numbers right, you beat gross margin by 130 basis points in this quarter. Looking back to the third quarter, I think you had a $4 million litigation revenue in the number that drove strength in gross margin, but that was clearly a onetime issue. So can you talk first about what drove the strength in gross margins and you\u2019re guiding them effectively flat, up 10 basis points technically in the first quarter. So it looks like that margin strength continues. Can you just talk about gross margin? Bernie Blegen : Sure. We tried to reflect on that a little bit in the prepared comments, where I indicated that we\u2019re benefiting right now by a more favorable shift in our product mix, which is higher margins on the new greenfield business, but also operational efficiencies. As far as we indicated earlier, the percentage of silicon that\u2019s coming from 12-inch, but also is a reflection of our improved quality standards. So I think that as we\u2019ve reflected on what the sustainable margin going forward that we\u2019ve offered sort of a new floor, which we look to grow again 10 to 20 basis points sequentially, although obviously, we\u2019ll keep our eyes open if there is an opportunity to have another step-up. Michael Hsing : If there\u2019s another side, okay. A few years ago, we talked about a greenfield product. And then you actually, I remember, asked, there is no headwind in \u2013 is there any headwind in the gross margins. So the answer was all these new products, greenfield product will aim at the high-end products and high values. And so the gross margin should be better. So this time, we didn\u2019t increase the price that much. We pretty much passed the cost to our customers or not even passed to our customers. But as Bernie said, shifted to 12-inch and also the internal efficiency improvement. And with a high gross margin product, that is the majority of the gross margin improvement. Quinn Bolton : Got it. And as a follow-on, for two quarters now, you\u2019ve seen a pretty nice increase in your internal inventory levels. Wondering if you could just comment, as you\u2019re building that internal inventory, how much of that is for new greenfield products versus, say, the run rate business? Michael Hsing : Clearly, we shifted away from a consumer side. And so that we allocated a lot of products for these high-end targeted \u2013 MPS targeted market segment. So we grow the inventories for those segments. Bernie Blegen : I think something to add there is that we do have some high-volume business, and we\u2019re treating that as a run rate. So we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s probably the area that has the tightest capacity. But where we have these new products, the greenfield opportunities, we have new customers and new markets as an insurance policy to make sure that they\u2019re perceived very positively and that we can cover upside potential. We have been building inventory to support that. And I think that\u2019s been reflected very well as far as the customer acceptance of the new products as well as market share gains afforded by appropriate inventory levels. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : I\u2019ll echo the congrats. I wanted to follow-up on the second half of your answer to Quinn\u2019s question there, Bernie. And in the past, you guys have always gained market share and very consistently so. This year was \u2013 well, this past year was no different. But you also had significantly greater availability than your competition. So I just wanted to see what the client or the customer relationship, how that\u2019s been enhanced because of the availability. Do you believe that the wins you\u2019ve gotten from availability will lead to sticky relationships going forward? You mentioned moving up into kind of first tier customer base. I\u2019m just trying to figure out the sustainability of the revenue growth because of that availability dynamic? Michael Hsing : That\u2019s a very, very good question. So okay, how do we grow like 45% over \u2013 close to a $1 billion base, okay? Well, you think about it, okay, all these products that we released in greenfield products and these two first-tier customers. And usually, these are large customers that they\u2019re ramping a new supply very carefully. So they don\u2019t allocate a large percentage. They always have a second source. And now we have shortage everywhere. MPS have capacities. So everything shifted to MPS. That\u2019s one factor. And the second factor is that we talk about MPS products are more programmable and our customers find out before they care less. And now they find out, our product \u2013 single product can do multiple purpose and that contributes in other factors. And so we can replace and we can \u2013 shortly, we designed \u2013 our customers redesign and the source out to adopt the MPS solutions. So \u2013 but these two points is very sticky, especially the second point, and our MPS products are more programmable, and they enjoy that. And they solve their problems and they realize the values. And so I would say they\u2019re very sticky. Ross Seymore : Great. And I guess as my follow-up question, I thought you talked about another greenfield opportunity, which is a huge part of the analog market which is getting into the converter side of things. Can you just talk a little bit about your aspirations there, some of the applications you\u2019re going after? And what sort of opportunity you see unfolding in that? Michael Hsing : Yes. We just \u2013 we did \u2013 we do have a silicon [indiscernible] and the performance is outstanding. And these are the new market segments, and these are purely in a single side, which we never have. These are internally developed. We have a group of people and they have a lot of experience, and that\u2019s a new market segment for us. So the focus will be the communications and also medical applications, like imaging, x-rays and ultrasounds and those type of things. Bernie Blegen : And just to add, as far as the characteristics of this technology, there are not a lot of companies that have been successful with this. And the ones that have, have carved out pretty exclusive markets. And as a result of that, they command very high gross margins. So we look to be a new market entrant, but also with a very \u2013 a big competitive advantage. Michael Hsing : Yes. So it\u2019s \u2013 yes, it is a milestone for MPS. As so-called high-performance analog company, they tried it and they achieved a mediocre result. And now, see what we can do. And we do have a product and so for the next couple of years, and we\u2019ll see what we can do. Ross Seymore : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Chris, your line is now open. Chris Caso : Yes, thank you. For my first question, talk a little bit about seasonality. And obviously, the Q1 results are better than what we normally expect in a seasonal Q1, and I suspect that\u2019s because of some of the capacity additions that you\u2019re bringing on. Can you talk about these capacity additions as we go through the year? Are they brought in, in the road to the $2 billion revenue level? At capacity level, is that going to come on fairly evenly during the year? Is there a step up at some point? And then when that happens, do you think that you will be fully able to meet your customer requirements presumably this year? Bernie Blegen : Chris, I think you get credit for three questions there. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be able to keep the thread going. The first issue had to do with seasonality and generally speaking, from Q4 to Q1, we observed a modest dip. In fact, because we have such an imbalance, an unprecedented demand supply and balance, that in fact seasonality is not as much a function today as opposed to your second question, which has to do with product availability. And that\u2019s sort of the gating item for how fast a company can grow. And as Michael pointed out earlier is that as part of our company, we\u2019ve always built capacity alongside the development of our new products. So we, in fact, got out in front of this upsurge in the market and have been able to participate and, in fact, accelerate our capacity build out. And that\u2019s really a reflection of how we\u2019re looking at 2022. But I think that one thing that we\u2019ve always done is we\u2019ve had to make intelligent decisions many years ahead of when the capacity has been needed. So in fact, we\u2019re in discussions in order to be able to get capacity for 2023, 2024 and beyond. And we feel very secure in what we\u2019re capable of doing in 2022. Michael Hsing : Well, to answer your questions, honestly, if it gives us another 50% growth for this year, we\u2019ll be in trouble. Okay. Chris Caso : Okay. I think that will be welcome trouble if that were the case. Michael Hsing : Yes. Chris Caso : I\u2019ll take liberty to ask one more that you were nice enough to answer, Mike and Bernie, which is with regard to pricing. And Bernie, you made a comment on the call, you spoke about disciplined sales price management as I think how you termed it. Could you explain what that means and the extent to which pricing has been a contributor to year-on-year growth and whether that\u2019s something that\u2019s in the rearview mirror where you\u2019d expect to continue to increase? Bernie Blegen : I think that most people have recognized within the semiconductors and even specific to analog that, that created an opportunity for many companies to affect price increases with their customers. And a lot of them implemented that as early as Q1 of this year. We showed \u2013 we made a conscious decision not to increase our prices on a broad base or selective market opportunities, but broadly, we did not. And we did that along with having a product availability as a means of being able to secure a higher level of market share. And so now as we look at 2022, we are going to implement selective but more broad-based price increases, but they will be at a more modest level than some of our peer companies have implemented. Michael Hsing : Yes, when we look at it, we invest in our customers for the future growth and for the future opportunities. And \u2013 but we do have a modest gross margin expansions as our model, okay. We keep saying it, and we have a steady state growth in every segment. Chris Caso : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Hi, thanks and look \u2013 my congratulations guys on the next quarter, another nice quarter. Maybe if I could, just a quick question on 5G. I mean you guys have talked in the past about 5G as a pretty significant opportunity for MPS. I think, Michael, I think you said potentially hundreds of dollars of potential content there, sort of similar to server or data center cloud for you guys. So I don\u2019t know if you could give us any update on design momentum since or when the revenue contribution might sort of start to inflect if that\u2019s still kind of the second half of this year? And I\u2019m curious, as part of that question, are you going to see QSMOD sort of be part of that initial ramp this year? Or is it going to be more sort of point of load ECUs sort of how you began during your journey in server. If you could give any color there, that would be great. Michael Hsing : Yes. So to answer your first part of the question first, like I mean in the 5Gs, and I give is actually 5G \u2013 a lot of products in \u2013 especially in the high current side all relate to QSMOD. And similar technology-based product, again, we power up the 5Gs in all areas and from a single size and all the way to transmitters. And we don\u2019t see a very high rate of ramping. And so they\u2019re still steady state. And the other question is QSMOD so like I mean for the data centers. We are \u2013 this year, okay, we have to say we occupy is that still less than a single-digit of a total percentage of the total 10 of the market. But the significance is from almost nothing and to a high end of a single-digit. And earlier I said that if we don\u2019t occupy the 30% of the market, we should not be in the business. So we still have a lot of room to grow. Bernie Blegen : And Michael, with the release of VR14 that we\u2019re in a very good inflection point on the \u2013 in the cloud and in the data center. Rick Schafer : Yes. And Michael, just to follow that, but it took, I think, about three or four years to sort of get point of load need you share today, which I think is about 30%. So I think are you saying that\u2019s sort of a good proxy for QSMOD could be in the next couple of years? Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. Yes. So let\u2019s take actually longer than that, more than three or four years. And I was wondering why it so long within \u2013 in the early days, I\u2019ll say that we could grow very quickly. I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about, okay? And for the next, as Bernie mentioned, the VR14s, and VR13.5 sort of MPS accepted as other players, okay? And VR14s, I think, we have pretty good shares to start to ramp, but it\u2019s not happening now, and sometimes this year, right? Bernie Blegen : Yes. VR13 has been delayed again, it\u2019s more likely to be Q3. Michael Hsing : Yes, yes, yes. Bernie Blegen : But you are right, we\u2019ve observed in Q4 an uplift as a result of 13.5. Michael Hsing : Yes, yes. Okay. Rick Schafer : Thanks. And if I could ask just a follow-up to Bernie probably. I just wanted to ask, I\u2019ve been asked in a long time. Balance sheet looks great, obviously. I was just curious if you could give us an update on use of cash going forward. I mean, obviously, you\u2019ve done a really good job of investing in future growth and R&D, but I\u2019m just curious how much you need to run the business here and feed R&D, et cetera? Thanks. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And it\u2019s a great question because you want to look at it sort of three levels for our particular story. One is we have to keep a certain amount of cash available in order to fund our growth, particularly as it relates to receivables and inventory, but also we\u2019re expanding operating expenses worldwide at an accelerated rate. And all of those demand a level of liquidity. The next thing that we\u2019ve talked about is building infrastructure and capacity. And even though we\u2019re outsourced as far as our fabs and assembly, we do a lot of our own testing. In fact, with the quality requirements of some of the new markets we\u2019re going in, we can\u2019t outsource that. We do all of our own testing and that requires an additional investment. And then you have buildings, which, as you know, we\u2019re one of the few companies that we purchased our own footprint to house our growing staff headcount. So we\u2019re going to continue to leverage the balance sheet in order to help accelerate our growth while at the same time, as we announced in the prepared comments, we\u2019re increasing the dividend by 25%. So we\u2019re also mindful that we need to return some of the cash back to shareholders. Michael Hsing : Yes. Well, Bernie said that said accelerated expense growth. No, we\u2019re not accelerating. No, absolutely no. Let\u2019s make that clear. And so we are pretty a little bit above our model, okay, growth \u2013 MPS growth \u2013 the expenses growth, okay? And for the return of cash to our investors, and we have an overwhelming case support for \u2013 from our investors in dividend and not buyback. So we are thought about buybacks again now, okay, we still okay, let\u2019s delay it because we get the feedback, okay, they want to divide. I don\u2019t know whether this related to a tax issue or not related, okay. So I think is in a \u2013 in the past, we said our models are consistently increased dividends, okay? And the other side of the using of cash is we want to acquire a company, not for revenue growth, is cheaper to grow MPS revenue by zone. But we can do this. So we can \u2013 MPS has a lot of garden variety of different products and can fuel some \u2013 can enhance a couple of areas to the end product. And we want to acquire those small tuck-in product, very unique and a sustainable growth and a sustainable. And based on MPS technology, we can grow those companies. And that\u2019s the company we\u2019re really interested. And so the earlier, I said were engaged with a few companies now. Rick Schafer : Thanks for all the color guys. Congrats. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Michael, I\u2019ve been asking you about this for, I don\u2019t know, three, four years. But in the last, I guess, three or four months, you guys talked a bit more about opportunities for MPS in the electric vehicle market, some in drivetrains, some in regenerative braking. I wonder if you might talk a little bit more about the revenue opportunity per car with your lead customer, the timing of that, and how wide is the pipeline in terms of the number of engagements that you might have in the EV market? Thanks. Michael Hsing : EV market, we are in the ADAS area, I think that we are in the ADAS 2.5 or 3.0. We almost engage with everybody. And so I can\u2019t give you numbers. For pure electrical car, MPS has about somewhere $80 to $100 shipping to date. And we\u2019re starting this year. We\u2019re starting not this year, starting actually last year. If you involve with a regenerative braking and a drive trend, those will add another over $1,000. And we don\u2019t have those revenue yet, but we do release those products. Matt Ramsay : Got it. Any \u2013 are those larger ASP products, any thoughts on timing? Michael Hsing : We are \u2013 there\u2019s several \u2013 there\u2019s many products that we are talking now, we have released a couple of them already or more than a couple of them already. And the key is we want to offer the total solutions. And customers pretty much can use MPS reference design. Matt Ramsay : Got it. As my follow-up question, it\u2019s a different topic. And one of the things that I\u2019ve been having investor conversations about is the broad-based industry adding \u2013 investing a ton of CapEx and adding a ton of capacity and this fear that the industry is adding it at a peak, right? You see a couple of new fabs coming online from Texas Instruments in the next number of quarters, Infineon is up in CapEx, pretty much everyone is. And so you guys have been in a unique position to have a ton of capacity come online when others have struggled to do it. And it sounds like that\u2019s going to continue for you. I just wonder, any concerns as the industry catches up with capacity, Michael? And maybe you could contrast the type of capacity, the process node that you\u2019re on, the nature of the capacity that you\u2019re bringing online for some that the rest of the industry may be adding. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes. That\u2019s a good question. So okay, you know that okay, first thing I should answer that. MPS don\u2019t build anything. We don\u2019t build anything. We don\u2019t have a fab, but we do have all the technologies. And usually, how we\u2019re getting a fab capacity is those fab are empty. And we go in there, we wonder, we say, okay, we can fill you up. It\u2019s a long-term partnership. And so \u2013 and like this year or the last year, okay, and you want to add capacity, forget it, okay? I mean those guys are busy shipment, okay? I mean, there are no fabs. And so we engage with them in the downturns. And we implement our technology. Remember, we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not like building a fab. We don\u2019t build a fab. The cost is minimum. And \u2013 but we do have some commitment, and we do have \u2013 give some consignment on some equipment, okay. But these costs compare building a fab is much, much less. Okay. Matt Ramsay : Thanks very much guys. I appreciate it. Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. Just two quick follow-ups. I know it\u2019s early in the year, but would you have \u2013 so you have four horses that are running really fast. You have one horse that\u2019s kind of just running slowly. If we look at this year, which of the horses do you think will grow a bit faster? I know there\u2019s a lot of talk about auto and server, but yes, which horses should we bet on this year? Michael Hsing : We don\u2019t want to be in those. MPS is all of company. Definitely not a noble company. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 we are shifting \u2013 clearly, this year, we\u2019re shifting from our consumers to \u2013 well, at least the last couple of quarters. We shifted from our consumer to automotive and server and service from a cloud computing side. And again \u2013 and so these are, for this year, probably remain similar. So okay, that\u2019s why we see it. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And I think that when you say that we\u2019ve got five strong horses, that\u2019s a more accurate reflection because I\u2019d say that in the current year, we were surprised by the strength of Industrial. So \u2013 and I think that\u2019s going to continue on into the next year. And as we talked about earlier, the communications market, while it may not be coming on as fast as we had originally hoped for or expected, still looks very promising in the second half of this year. So I think really the thesis remains being broad-based growth. Michael Hsing : Yes. But in \u2013 who knows? And let\u2019s say, all these other market segments slow down and as a consumer business in every half year, we can shift it. And we can shift quickly, okay. That\u2019s \u2013 currently, it\u2019s not a favor, but we can shift quickly. And by end of the year, maybe we grow Consumer business. Tore Svanberg : Sounds good. And coming back to the data converter topic, new segment for you. What are some of the things that we should track for your success there? We all know it\u2019s very difficult to crack into that market. And are you going into that market really, really at the high end of data converter technology? And will that be the way for us to track your success there? Michael Hsing : So far, yes, it\u2019s a very, very high-end product. And - but that\u2019s a new market segment. Like earlier I said \u2013 we said that we\u2019re going to ramping the data center very quickly, okay. Turn out to be \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the case, okay? So I don\u2019t want to predict that. But I know the technology is good and the test data showed we can be \u2013 we are far better than on the existing market of product. Tore Svanberg : Great. Yes. I mean if you could even get the $100 million there, I\u2019d be very impressed. Michael Hsing : Oh, yes. Okay. It\u2019s a matter of time. I\u2019m confident of that. And along the way, probably we learned [indiscernible] Yes, okay. Tore Svanberg : Okay. Thank you. Michael Hsing : All right. Okay. Genevieve Cunningham : [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Well, once again, I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us in this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again about our first quarter, which we\u2019ll likely hold in April. So thanks again, and have a nice day.",

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO.  In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2022, which is accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call.  We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q1 2022 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website.  I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Gen. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $377.7 million, 48.4% higher than the first quarter of 2021. The year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly broad-based market share gains, resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions.  Before looking at our revenue by market, I would like to call your attention to a change in our reporting. In order to provide increased visibility on data center and cloud computing revenue, a growth reporting for computer and storage to get 2 separate line items. The table has been included in this webinar showing the company's quarterly revenue on this basis since 2017. The first line item is called storage and computing, which primarily refers to total storage and client computing revenue. The second line item is called enterprise data, which captures revenue from data center and product.  In our storage and computing market, first quarter 2022 revenue of $96.6 million increased $18.6 million or 23.9% from the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to higher storage and commercial notebook sales. Computing -- storage and computing revenue represented 25.6% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 20.2% in the first quarter of 2021.  In our enterprise data market, first quarter 2022 revenue of $42.5 million increased 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to continuing strength in data center and workstation computing sales. Enterprise data revenue represented 11.3% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 6.4% in the first quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 communications revenue of $55.6 million rose $9.7 million or 21.1% for the fourth quarter of 2021. The quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflected higher revenue related to 5G build-outs and satellite communications. Communications revenue represented 14.7% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 14.2% in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 revenue from consumer markets of $80.0 million increased $13.6 million or 20.6% from the fourth quarter of 2021. This sequential quarterly improvement of the sequential revenue increase reflected a broad-based increase particularly related to our IoT business. Consumer revenue represented 21.2% of our Q1 revenue compared with a 26.0% contribution in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 unearned revenue of $54.5 million decreased 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Unearned revenue represented 14.4% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 17.6% in the previous year.  In our industrial market, revenue of $48.5 million was essentially flat with revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. Industrial revenue represented 12.8% of our first quarter revenue compared with 15.6% in the prior year. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 57.9%, 30 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 and 250 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $96.1 million compared with $78.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the first quarter of 2022, non-GAAP gross margin was 58.3%, 40 basis points better in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 250 basis points better than the first quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating income was $133.6 million compared to $112.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, the sequential quarterly gross margin improvement was primarily due to a better product mix as revenue from higher value, new product introductions are ramping.  Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $122.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $115.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2022 operating expenses were $86.6 million, up from $83.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2022, compensation expense, including approximately $1.3 million charged to cost of goods sold was $39.8 million compared with $31.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Switching to bottom line. First quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $79.6 million or $1.65 per fully diluted share compared to $72.7 million or $1.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 non-GAAP net income was $118.3 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share compared with $102.1 million or $2.12 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2022 were 48.2 million. Let's look of the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $775.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022 compared to $727.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $107.4 million compared with operating cash flow of $28.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 capital spending totaled $26.5 million.  Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2022 at $120.3 million or 29 days of sales outstanding, up 1 day from 28 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2020 were $311.0 million, up from the $259.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Days of inventory increased to 178 days at the end of Q1 2022 compared with 166 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.  Historically, we calculated days inventory on hand as a function of current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue provides a better economic . On this basis, again, as you can see, days of inventory increased to 159 days at the end of the first quarter of 2022, up from 149 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q2 revenue to remain of $420 million to $440 million. We also expect to follow -- at gross margin in the range of 58.4% to 59.4%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.7% to 59.3%, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $132.7 million and $136.7 million, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $90.0 million to $92.0 million. This doesn't exclude stock compensation and litigation expenses.  Total stock-based compensation expense of $44.2 million to $46.2 million, including approximately $1.5 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold, litigation expenses ranging between $2.3 million and $2.7 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.8 million to 48.8 million shares.  In conclusion, we will continue to execute on our long-term plan for sustainable growth. I will now open the webinar up for questions. A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie, analysts. I would now like to begin our Q&A session. . Our first question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Bernie Blegen : Ross is not there. Perhaps we can move on. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Alex Vechhi of William Blair. Alex Vecchi : Congratulations on a great quarter in a tough environment. Maybe you can address a little bit the supply constraints in some of the China COVID impact. It seems like you guys came out from that completely unscathed, be interested in some of the dynamics that's allowed you to do that. Michael Hsing : Well, Alex, we plan this kind of ramp not from last year from -- not from this year last year, many years ago. And as you remember, in 2017, even '16, we said that we're going to on greenfield products will grow and exactly we don't know at plus or minus a year or so. And so we plan every aspect, including logistics and staff, assembly house and our internal testing. And this is not a 1-year thing. We planned a long time ago. And now when the revenues rent is a little better than we anticipated. And so that's where you see the result. Bernie Blegen : And if I can add to that, we've also built inventories so that in 178 days, we're just at the lower end of our goal of being between 180 and 200 days, which provides us a good insurance policy as we look ahead to achieving our numbers for the second half of the year. Michael Hsing : Yes, even the end of the second half of 2019 in -- the business is not as great, but we built according to our plan, and we know the business will come. Our -- at that time, I remember, our inventory is over 200 days. And that part of it, inventories made us -- our customers feel a lot more long more reliable, like MPS as a major player. Alex Vecchi : Okay. That's really helpful. And then maybe one for you, Bernie, just on gross margin. Margins have been very strong, as I believe. You've alluded to product mix. Just on that front, how much more runway do you think you have on the gross margin front from the uplift on sort of your new products going forward? Bernie Blegen : Sure. As you've seen both in the results that we had for Q1, along with our guidance for Q2, which positions us around 59% gross margin, I think we've done a fair job of -- digesting is the incorrect word, but acknowledging the uplift in our margins as a result of our product mix. So again, I'll give the same answer I did last time that we believe that we've created a new floor gross margins once we can expand 10 to 20 basis points sequentially. But again, if opportunistically, we see a back set, which allows us to take it up another, we will be happy to take that.  I want to emphasize that, well, most of our peer companies have benefited both in terms of revenue growth and margin expansion from price increases, Ours has been driven primarily by the change in revenue mix, which is favoring these higher-value products. And it was only in February of this year we did a broad-based increase of our prices but that was still far below what the market has seen. Michael Hsing : Just a pass on the cost to our customers. And as the margin expansion for our case, we said earlier, okay, setting in 2017 or '18, we don't have a headwind in -- by 2019. The, market slowed down a little bit and we built up a lot of some amortizations that -- in a production pipeline. So our margin went slightly lower, but it's not much lower. And now and you see this margin continued to grow. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matthew Ramsay : Can you guys hear me all right? Michael Hsing : Yes. Matthew Ramsay : Michael, I guess, for either one of you guys, it was interesting that you're breaking out sort of the data center piece from the PC and storage business. And I guess I wonder a couple of things about that, like what may be you our guys are trying to signal by breaking those out separately, in particular the new enterprise data segment is up, I don't know, 160% year-over-year, but that's really before the 2 primary server processor vendors launched with new sockets this year. So Michael, could you maybe talk a little bit about the reason for breaking that out and the relative growth rates you guys expect of these 2 new segments as we go forward? Michael Hsing : If you combine all together, it's a kind of -- we're going to answer -- in the past, we answered those questions anyway and -- but when we reported on some numbers, and so which is more clear and publish you guys know it, have a less meaningful questions and any other reasons. Bernie Blegen : I think, Matt, you did a good job of saying that this is clearly an inflection point for us, inflection year which will gain momentum as we see both Intel and AMD position for product releases are coming up here. So that, in addition to the expanding footprint we have in both 48-volt and artificial intelligence, we believe that this will be one of our areas for sustainable growth for certainly next 3 to 5 years. And exactly as Michael said, we believe that providing better transparency is definitely a better information for our investors. Matthew Ramsay : Thanks to both for that. That's helpful. I guess if you look at the second quarter guidance that you provided, $430 million at the midpoint was quite a bit above where consensus was and certainly where my model was. Bernie, if you might take a second to walk us through by segment, how you're thinking about the growth being concentrated, that would be really helpful. Bernie Blegen : I think that on a dollar or percent basis, we're going to see an accelerating ramp in enterprise, particularly during the second half of the year. I think we're going to see continued growth in our storage and computing albeit probably not at the same rate. Part of the reason for that is that storage tends to be a precursor at least from our experience to a data center ramp. So I think in each of the 2 prior quarters, we've seen a good, strong ramp in storage, and now we're expecting 2 to 3 quarters in the data center.  In the rest of the business, communications, as we said, we've broadened into not only 5G but also into satellite communications. And that's going to continue to be a driver for the foreseeable future. In the other areas, obviously, consumer, that is coming along, we emphasized Internet of Things but we -- actually, the growth there is broad-based. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Nathaniel Bolton : Let me offer my congratulations as well. I wanted to come back to Alex' question about China. Obviously, you source most of your assembly and wafer capacity in China. And I just -- given the zero COVID policy in China and some of the resulting lockdowns, are you rethinking the need to diversify outside of China either on the assembly and test or assembly and wafer foundry side? And then I guess, a related question, I think most of your final test takes place in Chengdu, have you any contingency plans in place in case Chengdu is put under lockdown due to COVID? Michael Hsing : Yes. We started a couple of years ago. We already started doing so. And as you know that China and manufacturing in Asia is the center of the work, and we can't debate too much or not if they have a serious problems, I think everybody worry about it, even the bigger things. And yes -- the answer is yes, okay. We already started and establish in a different clinical environment. Nathaniel Bolton : In Chengdu, Michael, do you have test capacity outside of Chengdu, if Chengdu goes under lockdown? Michael Hsing : Yes. As we're starting to about a couple of years ago, but maybe it's a little more than 12 months ago, we're starting. Bernie Blegen : With the testing capacity in Chengdu. We've concentrated that on some of our higher value parts including automotive. And now as Michael just said is now we've started transition where we can actually have third parties. So we actually have a built-in contingency plan. Michael Hsing : Yes, outside Chengdu only, yes, we have -- other than these high reliability product in retesting in our side. And other than that, okay, we do pretty high volumes if it's about half of it. It's in a different facility. When I talk about -- I just mentioned about it is outside China. Nathaniel Bolton : Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up question is around the internal inventory level that you guys have done an absolutely fantastic job of increasing that in a very tight supply environment. I guess my question is, as you're approaching now the low end of your target range of 180 to 200 days, can you tell us what's going on with lead times? I would think as internal inventories get up to your target level, that may give you the ability to start to reduce lead times to potentially gain even more market share. But wondering if you could give us a sense of what's going on with lead times given that increase in internal inventory levels. Michael Hsing : Our lead time is in this quarter is the same as the last quarter. So probably even our booking even -- I don't see anything. The rate of our booking is now reduced and Bernie, you said. Bernie Blegen : And you took my answer on both ones that lead times have remained very consistent each in the last 3 quarters. And again, what you're seeing as far as the build of inventories has been a very conscious and deliberate decision to build the inventories in advance, particularly on the enterprise side, to meet the demand we expect for the second half of the year. And then I think that we've done a good job of positioning ourselves under what has now become uncertain environment. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William Stein : Congrats on the very strong results, especially the outlook. We understand though that while we see a great number overall, in particular for the guidance, there's always moving parts when we look at it on a more detailed level. And I wonder if you're seeing either perhaps owing to customers focusing on getting balanced kits or full sets or however you want to call it or if you're seeing anything related to Ukraine or the lockdowns in China, whether any of these factors is influencing either the order rates or the backlog. For example, if none of these things were happening, the outlook would have been even stronger. Any qualification you can provide us would be helpful. Michael Hsing : Yes. Well, MPS is like selling . And we are not a dominant application supply. We got something in a. -- I mean so whatever we ship is that these are the small part of the solutions. And so we don't know, okay? That's -- actually, that's our model. That's a billion. We don't know where these costs -- and so whether the wall effectiveness, okay, and we're very, very much diversified. We actually don't know it. And okay, they call you there.  So the -- to answer your questions, I mean, only things, yes, we do know where the product was the data centers. The product if it goes to a car, mean these are we're pretty much not a lot where the product ended up, okay. And other than that, we don't. Bernie Blegen : Just reinforcing the answer from before, there is no significant KPI, whether it's in the bookings or any other area of our business that we're seeing a change over the past 2, 3 quarters. That's helpful. William Stein : Bernie, you've talked about various levels of revenue that you could achieve at full utilization. In other words, the capacity that you're building for. I know they started couple of years ago. Well, I'm sure it's ongoing really. But the capacity and the upside that we've seen over the last few quarters, of course, those were not planned very quickly. They were planned a long time ago. Can you remind us or maybe update us on the medium to long-term capacity planning that's in place today? What levels of total capacity we can expect over the next few quarters? Michael Hsing : Yes. That's a good question. I think that we answered the questions in last quarter, okay, we said that we're going to play in the $4 billion of revenues in the next couple of years. And so that's what we do and we continue to invest. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And I think just to sort of lend some credibility to that, you recall about a year ago, that we offer by the end of Q2, in 2022, that would be at a $2 billion run rate. And with the guide that we have provided and the expectations ahead, I think that's a milestone that backs up the amount of visibility in our supply chain. So right now, the goal as Michael said, $4 billion. Michael Hsing : Yes. If the demand is there in this year, we will do it, yes. What will do $2 billion, as we said in a couple of years ago. And we continue to see the demand in, and we see the demand will be there. Okay. This is not a one -- a short term, okay, things. And if it does not happen that year, that will happen the year after. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Richard Schafer : I'll echo all the congratulations on other stellar quarter for you guys and outlook. If I could, my first question, I'm just kind of following up on the server breakout and obviously, a big ramp ahead for QSMod and cloud this year. I was curious kind of below that line a little bit, if there's any updates you could give us, like your 48 volt expectations this year or next?  And within that, I'm curious, I sort of assumed 48 volts virtually all AI accelerator for the next couple of years. But I'm curious when you see 48-volt sort of move into other areas like CPU or some broader markets like auto or industrial because I'm curious if you've looked at sort of what that 48-volt SAM looks like for MPS because it seems like an awful big opportunity. Michael Hsing : Yes. 48 volts actually started in the automotive and also the silver and AI, okay, these CPUs. And for the 48 volts for the car, that's a different thing. but the same technologies. And also, we see these telecom areas, 48 volts, it's all standard and -- so now the 4Gs and the compliance with the 48 volts, again, we have a solution there. So there's a lot of areas we can grow. Bernie Blegen : And I think that the 48 Volt, not only are we seeing the ramp, its adoption more broadly, but competitively, I would offer that we're very well positioned with some of the new technologies that we've rolled out and expect to roll out during the course of the next 18 months. So I think here again, we time our product releases pretty well with the inflection of this market opportunity. Michael Hsing : Yes. And as we're talking with the product, the module is ramping, yes. So we provide -- we're providing whatever customer needs. We had a chip level on module level or solution levels. Richard Schafer : Okay. And then maybe as my follow-up, just on 5G, I haven't asked the 5G question in a while. I mean you guys are engaged with the sort of the big 3 Tier 1 OEMs. And I just was curious if you can give us an update on your expectations. I know you flagged 5G here from 1Q results. So I'm curious what your expectations are for this year. And if there's any update you could give us on sort of how content compares with what you're seeing in server or data center and sort of how that ramp looks. And maybe if you could talk about how you quantify that opportunity in macro base station. Bernie Blegen : The 5G is a relatively new market segment for us. So it's not like we can draw from our prior experience and calibrated up or down. We're sort of living a little hand to mouth on what demand looks like and how fast we're shipping. So we don't have a real good predictive model. What we talked to you about in the past has been that, again, we believe on a broad base, not only with as you referred to the top 3 but with a number of partners related to 5G infrastructure, we're providing content.  And while it's easy to look at the base station as a means of calculating out what the SAM is available to us. I think that we're also in fiber optic in the data center support for 5G as well as in the transceiver of the base station. And again, I think, as we pointed out, a lot of the initial technology that we're putting in is tending to be lower end and not necessarily specialized or adapted to 5G specifically. So we don't have the same level of visibility on how it's being deployed, and we've used this strategy in the past with data center. We comment with lower dollar value content, build the relationships and then we're able to go to higher value content. Michael Hsing : Let me say that we do have a custom design for each of the areas that Bernie said from fiber optics to all the single chain, all the way to transmitters. And we do have a customer design. And based on our standard product modules -- and these are the products. It's not really a low end. It can be, but these products can be used for any other telecom, which provide a building market, it provide power solutions for each of these blocks -- each of these categories. And we do see a lot of activity now in the revenues is ramping now. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Chris Caso of Raymond James. Christopher Caso : I guess a question about the profile of revenue growth as we go through the year. And thus far, over the past several quarters, your revenue growth has been pretty broadly based, seeing growth in most segments. I know we've been speaking about and we've been anticipating for a while the server ramp as we get to the end of the year. But as we look through revenue in the next kind of 2, 3, 4 quarters, do you expect that revenue growth to continue to be broadly based, where you think this is going to be concentrated in any particular segments? Michael Hsing : Well, the strategy is we're fired as many cylinders we can, okay? Whenever it grows, we grow, okay? And I think that's the strength among the diversifications. And in the next few quarters, we see the demand even for 2023 and '24, and these are pretty much similar, okay? We don't see that much of a difference.  And one thing we see it, okay, they -- we -- our customers demand more high-value product, which means they can easily adopt in ease of use and a much higher efficiency product and an energy using efficiency product. And so these are much better for us. Instead of our customer do lot development work, we do a lot of development work for our -- we develop the solution for our customers. So that means a higher dollar amount -- a higher dollar content. And so that's really we see that as only difference. Christopher Caso : Got it. My follow-up question is about the impact of some of the China lockdowns and not from your production side but rather from your customer side. And what we heard from some others or at least one other is that part of the challenges in China right now are customers having facilities that are closed or that freight forwarders simply unwilling to accept product because of some of the logistics challenges that are going on right now. Is that something you're facing as well? And is there any impact on your revenue right now, which might mean some of those issues get solved, that some of that goes into the second half of the year? Michael Hsing : Absolutely hit us. And don't get me wrong. Even though we grow this much, if we were not that problem, so we ship a whole lot more but we just have -- we anticipated that a little better. So we can still roll in our -- one of our models, can mean there's not much of our model. And for the portion is above our model, even a year, 2 years and again.  And on the other hand, in -- other than our logistics and production limitations, our customers, they have a mix, too. And clearly, you see the auto business. I mean we have less problem of shipping product than other suppliers. So -- and you can't speculate in okay, because of in limited or -- they are buying -- they're purchasing of our product and for because they miss other parts. Bernie Blegen : And I think that we continue to be very resilient under a number of environmental circumstances. Part of that is the planning that we've set 3, 4 years ago, and some of it is how diversified long is and some of it is how adaptive we can be in the moment. So again, we did acknowledge the impact our customer supply chain affecting us, but I wouldn't say that, that is a pronounced element and we're continuing to monitor it. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Tore Svanberg : Congratulations on another record quarter, quite stunning. First question is on long-term growth. So you grew more than 40% last year. It looks like you're on track to growing another 40% this year at least. Michael, in the past, you've said there's no reason why you can't accelerate growth even though you have higher revenues. Michael Hsing : You remember that. That's good. Tore Svanberg : So I'm just trying to understand what you think about long-term growth at this point. Is 40% the right number? I know you're probably not going to commit to a number, but yes, anything you can add on that would be great. Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay, as always said, okay, about a few minutes ago, I said that our customers even demands the more higher value product, can be in a solution kind of related products, not they wanted a low their engineering effort to MPS. And I see that opportunity is the opportunities for accelerated growth because think about it, if it's MPS, we don't make any and we're just only testing the final control -- quality control.  And that can apply to anything else. And I apply to models, apply tools okay, applied to any other solutions at all, but it's all related to power all related to OEM. And so from now on, you will see MPS, okay, we provide plug-and-play solution for all kind of robotics, for industrial automation and for building controls. And those type of product and -- which has a lot higher ASPs, we buy those components or we specify those components and we incorporate to our solutions. So the unit price will be much higher.  And now it's how fast we can put all these solutions together and turn it into a meaningful revenue. And that, I can't predict. And then you have that product, a lot of knowledges too. Now at the same time, MPS is a semiconductor chip business, keep growing. So I don't see in the near term in the next year or so. I don't see any slowdown, and it's actually accelerated.  And so to the other model is at the very infancies. And if you go 3 or 4, 5 years from now, I think as we will be real solution companies like silicon semiconductor is only a part of it out in the total content. So I want to grow more. I've seen more than $10 billion of companies, I mean $10 billion, $15 billion company, and there is no reason why not? Tore Svanberg : That's great perspective, Michael. As my follow-up, I wasn't aware you had a lot of traction in the sat comm market. I was just hoping you could add a little bit more color there, what types of applications, what are some of the strengths the company has today in that market. And are you continuing to introduce new products? Because that's -- to me, it's obviously a very high-margin business, right, but it's also a very difficult market to crack into. Michael Hsing : Yes. It's or committed to sell our communications and not only in the cell like self the grand station there's a huge amount. There's new standards, and again, there's a lot of new activities in that. And we designed it into a few years ago. And mostly, it's a power modules. And also, we have related to these in the cell and I mean this a controlled the solar panels and also a lot of power box. And I think the value in this is so -- this is everywhere, okay -- and these are for antenna to powering up the antenna to power the receivers and also all the way down to the user interface, and we all benefit from. Tore Svanberg : Excellent. Very good. Congratulations again. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thanks. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Can you guys hear me this time? Michael Hsing : Yes, Ross, you're there. Ross Seymore : I've been here the whole time. I'm glad that we got it to work. So I guess the first question is a longer-term one, then I'll follow up with a shorter-term one. Michael, you talked many times on tonight's call about moving up the value chain, adding more value. Customers want to use Monolithic for more and more. And in the past, that's going from kind of the second or third tier folks in various markets up to the first tier. So really what I want to get at is, are you seeing evidence of moving up to higher and higher value customers? And does the fact that you didn't raise prices as much as your peers and that you had availability, is that giving you longer-term design wins, higher value design wins? Anything you could do to quantify that dynamic? Michael Hsing : I don't know how to qualify that, okay, because we don't -- we didn't really -- we didn't increase the price, okay, for those customers the first tier, the value the strategic customers because this prices are negotiated way before that. And we have the audit. And so we always said what we do. It's what we said what we do, okay? So we have to honor that.  And I think that also is a part of MPS branding and so that benefits the for long term. And for other high-value customers or high-value products and it's sporadic. This is the very beginning, a lot of customers don't even know or you offer these solutions but you offer that the entire solutions and -- so they don't even know that, okay. MPS is just starting to. And that actually relates to a few years ago, we said that we're going to do e-commerce, okay? We do e-commerce plug-and-play, programmable, all these things. And these are all related. And so we do solar only for large customers, and I said we're a satellite company. We have the EV companies. We have a day 1 MPS, do a lot more or even the data centers and the demand of all these, we provide the entire unit. And they don't have to design it. So that's actually a across the board. I just named a few. But revenue is still small. We're starting. Ross Seymore : And for my follow-up, a near-term question, Bernie, this could either be both revenues and/or the gross margin and your answer on this, and it's really about the mix. You've talked about the gross margin rising because of mix and new products being the driver of that. So if I look at the industrial and automotive businesses, the last couple of quarters, they're great year-over-year, but they've been flat to a little bit down sequentially for the last 6 months or so. Is there anything going on in that business? Is it just lumpiness? Is it waiting for some design wins?  And on the mix side of that equation for gross margin, I think most people believe those could be some of the more accretive areas. So how is the mix such a positive for your gross margin if the 2 areas that are supposed to be the highest margins are actually slightly underperforming the others? Michael Hsing : Makes sense. That was good question. Bernie Blegen : Let me reference wehat Michael said earlier. It's the power of our model of diversification of the end markets. And if you go back to the performance, the revenue performance that we demonstrated in industrial and automotive last year, they were leaders in our growth drivers. In the current year and reflected what's the health of the 2 end markets, it really came down to it being the timing of shipments.  So we believe that as far as the design rules that are coming in, that we don't believe that we overshipped them to the extent that that's going to cause us a problem. The orders on the book remained incredibly positive. So again, it's just -- it's more different to quarter-over-quarter as opposed to anything fundamentally different about the market. Michael Hsing : And also, one of the questions is why the margin goes up and if these are 2 segments go sideways, okay? I mean the year-to-year -- year-over-year growth, I mean, if you look at it from a Q3 last year to now, those segments -- that contributes a lot of margins, okay, gross margins.  And the other segments, like consumers, I mean we phased out and there can be this not on the last year. So maybe the year, beginning of the last year. When the capacity gets issues, as you know, we always phase out these lower margin. That's another part of it. And -- but overall, the greenfield products drive the margins. Bernie Blegen : And just to add to Michael's point, as far as phasing out lower margin business, we're trying to rationalize our wafer starts to capture the largest opportunity. And as a result, some of the lower-margin business that we would have used to have in our portfolio, we haven't emphasized that in our production planning. It's just not there as a component of our business like it has been historically. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt. Hans Mosesmann : Congratulations, like everybody else has mentioned. Good stuff. I have 2 questions. Michael, if we were to split 48 volts as an opportunity. So I'm thinking it getting 48 volts to the rack in your data center and within the rack, getting that 48 volts to the board and every board has to deal with the accelerators and there's power issues there. So there's 3 touch points. If that's the way to look at it, what is the opportunity for each? And where would you be seeing the first incremental business for 48 volts for MPS? Michael Hsing : I think it's the solution, yes, you're right, okay? And then now the question is does depend on applications, 48 volts, down to 12 volts, down to directly to 1.2 volts. That's at the last part, okay, we don't do that and our customers -- and there's the few providers of the solution is not come -- and so we play in the market. I mean it's not to 12, 48 convert to 12 and convert 5 -- 4 or 5 volts, okay? That's the market we played. We came in and it's open builder materials. Everybody else can jump into it. And we -- so our competitor provides a similar solution.  And so that kind of -- we know this is the application, but which one, we don't know. Which one is hard to tell. All these high current products, and you probably know more than I do, okay, goes to 600 watt to 1,000 watts and even some of the couple of 1,000 watts. You see these are all MPS solutions now and these are -- the higher wattage you go, the volts get smaller.  And so in the coming years and those accelerate the costs, okay, the population in the data centers. And that's where you see it. These are 48 volts that convert to 12. And then you have a new solutions that we provide so you can to a firewall. So okay, an increase close to 1% of efficiency, which is a lot. Hans Mosesmann : That was very helpful, Michael. My follow-on, just to end this, what is the view of the PC market for MPS? I think Intel mentioned that the low end of the PC market is weak, but the other parts are okay. What's your view to the degree that you have participation there? Michael Hsing : Yes. We obviously -- okay, and we do well. And we do PCs and case PC, the commercial PCs, that even the low end of business from OEs. And -- but for us, it's a very opportunistic because we have a product developed for server. And without much of an engineering effort, we can spin off to do other products. We did a product for commercial PC and for commercial norms. And on the other end, we do battery management. We do actually panel. And -- pretty much, we can offer an mobile solutions other than memories, other than the CPUs. And so that's -- it's very opportunistic. And we -- currently, we see the demand is very strong. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And just to add to that, Michael, is we have a very good footprint in the commercial side. And because we have so many different client offerings, what we're seeing is being able to sell additional content into those same platforms. Genevieve Cunningham : . As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Great. Thanks, Gen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the Q1 2022 earnings webinar. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which we would like to be in July. Thank you, and have a nice day.",

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for 1 year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s webinar, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filings that can be found on our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q2 2022 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $461.0 million, 22.1% higher than the first quarter of 2022, and 57.2% higher than the second quarter of 2021. This broad-based year-over-year revenue growth was a result of consistent execution against our strategies. Turning now to the second quarter 2022 revenue by market, in our enterprise data market, second quarter 2022 revenue of $65.2 million increased 53.4% from the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to an accelerated ramp in our data center and workstation computing sales. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 117.9% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 14.2% of MPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 10.2% in the second quarter of 2021. Storage and computing revenue of $122.3 million increased 26.6% from the first quarter of 2022. The sequential revenue improvement reflected higher commercial notebook and storage sales. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 111.6% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 26.5% of MPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 19.7% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter consumer market revenue of $97.3 million increased 21.7% from the first quarter of 2022. The sequential quarterly revenue improvement was broad-based with particular strength noted in home appliances and gaming. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 27.9% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 21.1% of MPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 25.9% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 industrial revenue of $55.9 million increased 15.1% from the first quarter of 2022, reflecting increased sales of products for power source and security applications. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 28.9% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 12.1% of our total second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 14.8% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter automobile revenue of $61.0 million increased 11.9% from the first quarter of 2022. Primarily \u00e2\u0080\u0093 due primarily to increased sales of applications for advanced driver system systems, the digital cockpit and lighting products. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 25.3% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 13.2% of MPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.6% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 communications revenue of $59.3 million was up 6.7% from the first quarter of 2022. Most of the sequential revenue increase was related to 5G infrastructure. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 58.3% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 12.9% of our total second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 12.8% in the second quarter of 2021. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 58.8%, 90 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2022 and 280 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $141.9 million compared to $96.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2022 and $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 59.0%, up 70 basis points from the gross margin reported for the first quarter of 2022 and 270 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to operational efficiency gains and a more favorable sales mix. Our non-GAAP operating income was $179.4 million compared to $133.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2022. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $129.1 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with $122.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2022 operating expenses were $92.7 million, up from the $86.6 million we spent in the first quarter of 2022 and up from the $70.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2021. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2022, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.2 million charged to cost of goods sold was $42.9 million compared with $39.8 million recorded in the first quarter of 2022. Our second quarter 2022 GAAP other income \u00e2\u0080\u0093 other expense was $5.1 million compared with $634,000 in the first quarter of 2022. Our second quarter 2022 non-GAAP other expense was $7,000 compared with non-GAAP other income of $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease is due to a $2 million increase in charitable contributions, partly offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. The difference in non-GAAP other income and GAAP other income is the income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $114.7 million or $2.37 per fully diluted share compared with $79.6 million or $1.65 per share in the first quarter of 2022 and $55.2 million or $1.16 per share in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 non-GAAP net income was $157.0 million, or $3.25 per fully diluted share compared with $118.3 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2022 and $86.5 million or $1.81 on a per share \u00e2\u0080\u0093 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2022 were 48.3 million. Now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $814.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022 compared with $775.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $105.2 million compared with Q1 2022 operating cash flow of $107.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2022 at $125.5 million, representing 25 days of sales outstanding, which was 4 days lower than the 29 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and 1 day higher than the 24 days in the second quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2022 were $359.6 million, up from the $311 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Days of inventory of 172 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022 were 6 days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current order revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory of 162 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022, which were 13 days higher than the 149 days at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and 44 days higher than the 118 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $480 million to $500 million; GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.4% to 59.0%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.7% to 59.3%; total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $42.8 million to $44.8 million, including approximately $1.3 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $136.2 million and $140.2 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in the range of $94.7 million to $96.7 million; litigation expense in the range between $2.3 million and $2.7 million; interest and other income in the range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains and losses; fully diluted shares in the range of 47.9 million to 48.9 million shares. In conclusion, we are continuing to execute on our growth strategies, including expansion and diversification of our R&D centers and manufacturing partnerships in multiple countries. I will now open the webinar up for questions. A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Thanks and congratulations to you guys. Another great quarter. This may seem like a silly question given the guidance. But I am just curious, are you seeing any impact from the delayed launch of Sapphire Rapids? I mean I know your accelerator content is a lot higher than your CPU core power content. I think 48-volt, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think our math shows 48-volt track into sort of $100 million this year, so I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just looking at sort of the puts and takes. I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is a pretty much a monster guide. But I am just a little curious if you were seeing any drag there from that delayed launch? Michael Hsing : So far, we see it for the next year or so. All our growth is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you know, these are all growing fields. And again, I mean we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t own the products that were designed in the last few years, like I mean, for whatever the divulging of it, okay. And so if there is a delay the one thing is that we actually care less and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out of MPS control. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but overall, we have a new \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has a higher power processor and MPS can provide a much higher benefit to those market segments. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off for about 1.5 years and 1 years and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice it as in this period and where we gain more market shares. And in a way, we grow from this existing business that we have plenty of it to growth. Rick Schafer : Okay. Thanks a lot, Michael, for the color. And if I could follow-up maybe on the supply question, majority of your wafer supply is still in China, plus you have got to pay your big Chengdu back end facility. So I guess, how concerned are you if with trying to derisk supply chain as we keep watching headlines with the U.S. government trying to tighten restrictions, etcetera on equipment and everything in China? So just curious, your thoughts there? And maybe as part of that, if you could talk about where things stand now with TSMC and give a sense maybe of timing and capacity plans there? Thanks. Michael Hsing : Yes. Just like any other companies, okay, clearly, we are transitioning out from the last 20 years of manufacturing from China to other places. And all this infrastructure had to be built up. And we are just like other companies. Like we are in a transition, so actually, we started transitioning earlier. We first started from our engineering manpower. So that came in and we transitioned out of 6, 7 years ago \u00e2\u0080\u0093 6 years ago. And manufacturers, we started like 2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 about 3 years ago and as you know, we always use a trading edge of a DRAM fab, okay or a digital fab. And 3 or 4 years ago, clearly, okay, these are higher node, okay, 60 nanometers and 40 nanometers fabs. Okay, they are all engaged with the MPS, okay. And as we have a reputation, so we will fill up all these fab. And now it opens up in careers and I mean Taiwan and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these are the places now, okay, we are only talking about a fab this one now. And in the next few years will be, again will be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a move out of China soon, okay, we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and a still bigger capacity, okay. And we have a large market segment in our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 30% of our revenues still from China. So in the next year or a couple of years later, next year, we probably will be very diversified. Bernie Blegen : And just to add to that, that as the capacity restrictions are becoming less of a concern for the market in general, customers are asking for diversification as in a China plus one strategy. So we are working along those lines in companion to expanding our overall capacity. Michael Hsing : Yes. They all require \u00e2\u0080\u0093 each region center require their local supplied. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we are playing the game. I mean that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our customer request. And so we are fully aware of that. And so we engage with all these fabs. And okay, across South Asia and Europe and Korea and Japan. And so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how I see it. Rick Schafer : Okay, thanks a lot for the color. Congrats again. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much, guys. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. Congratulations on the results. So I had two questions, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just go ahead and ask both at the same time because I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got multiple calls going tonight. The first one, Michael, both in the server business, so the new enterprise data segment and in the PC business, could you give us some indication of how far ahead of the unit sales to your power \u00e2\u0080\u0093 your core CPU power or accelerator power products actually sell in versus the unit shipments that they get reported by the end customers? And burning the second question, completely unrelated, like $800 million in cash, give or take, if you could kind of walk us through some of the uses of cash there. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure Michael would like to build some inventory, which is kind of always the case. But if you have any new things to say there, that would be really helpful? Thanks, guys. Michael Hsing : Well, first, your first question, honestly, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know. I mean it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult. And as you know, we sell \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these are building blocks. And for more or less in a server and data center areas, and these are more generic parts, and they can be used multiple awake. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to track. And frankly, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really care. And as long as we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our revenue goes up, right? And for very high powers, and these are power like a 48-volt power, okay? We do have pretty good dominant players in that segment. And so the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think a ramp hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really just started recently. I mean we will be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the future, there will be a lot more. But mentioning about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you mentioned about notebooks, I mean we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mostly in high-performance gaming or mostly in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in commercial notebook. And number of assets and versus the CPU \u00e2\u0080\u0093 versus CPUs, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also hard to match in because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling these power devices, they can be through 2 phase, they can be 3 phase, They can be 4 phase. I mean we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite note. And also we care less. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to answer it. So all these notebooks are all the high end, the high-end gaming side and gaming notebooks and commercial. And so these are the ones that they have a variety of a use. Bernie Blegen : And on the issue as far as our cash position, which, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s put it on the table, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of an enviable position to have over $800 million of cash and cash equivalents. And there is probably three things that we look at. The first is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been consistently paying out a routine dividend. This year, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $0.75 per quarter, $3 for the full year. and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re evaluating the sustainability at a even higher level. We generally announced dividend increases in February, comparing with our Q4 operating results and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect to do so again this year. Another area that we found is very key and strategic to us is building out capacity. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking, as Michael said earlier, for different avenues in order to build out additional capacity. And in some cases, that may require additional investment. And then finally, as you also added is working capital, making sure that we have adequate inventory on hand in order to sustain our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 demand profile. And so right now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still below our target of 180 to 200 days of inventory. So we will continue to be investing in inventories as well. Michael Hsing : Yes. Might as well, all these are Bernie add all the expenses, that they are small compared \u00e2\u0080\u0093 relatively compare the cash that we generate every year. And so what we want to do is that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably MPS know the best, be consistent. And we give \u00e2\u0080\u0093 increase our revenue yearly. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we have been doing in the past few years, and we will continue to do so. And also, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we will do some acquisitions, but not acquisition for revenues. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results and outlook. Something I tend to ask about is traction in the module business because I know that this is something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helping boost the revenue growth and the margins. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping you can maybe update us on the traction in that business, please? Michael Hsing : Yes. The module is doing well, I mean, but the revenue is still quite small. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hundred-some million dollars, but in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but I know in the next few years will grow double or triple it. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the pipeline, in the design win activities. And so as we said a few years ago, we do e-commerce and okay, we do programmable modules these show true benefits to our customers truly realize it in the end. Bernie Blegen : Yes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that particularly as we had this supply/demand imbalance and our customers are also looking for enabling technologies that the decision process for earning a design win where historically had been just on the lowest cost provider. Now things like the programmability, the flexibility, the time to market, the total cost of ownership are taking a larger weighting in the decision process, and we feel like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very strategically positioned to take advantage of that change in the market. William Stein : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great. And as a follow-up, if I can. I am wondering if you can talk about your lead times now and how they might have changed in the last, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know a couple of months and to the degree to which that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a competitive advantage. My understanding is that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re offering lead times that enable customers to switch away from competitors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 products that have lead times that are so long that it suddenly makes sense to switch. Any sort of comments or update on that would help a lot? Thanks, guys. Michael Hsing : Our own lead time really hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed that much. And we still \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still in a lot of delinquencies, okay? And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good thing, okay, because as Bernie said earlier, in all the benefit of our product technologies. Okay, finally, our customers realize it, and it became a high demand. And even though and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s due to the new design win activities. And they all switch to this type of a new technology or new design methodologies. And now that really benefit MPS. And at the same time, we had to increase our capacities. I mean not only from China and globally, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what our customer demands. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And just to top off that answer is that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think our lead times were necessarily different from anybody else necessarily in the industry. But we have the advantage of having so many new products coming on the market, Greenfield opportunities, that we invested ahead of the curve, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we were able to have product availability when others didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. William Stein : Thanks, guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hi, guys. Congratulations on the nice results. I guess I would love to ask, obviously, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen some in the compute space Intel and Micron offering much more subdued outlooks for the second half. I think there is clearly some inventory purge going on in the channel. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just wondering, obviously, your September guidance is very strong. But as you look at the order book, have you started to see any changes in the notebook or computer and storage and enterprise data center segment that might echo some of the comments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard from folks like Intel and Micron in the broader market? And then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a follow-up. Michael Hsing : We \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for the notebooks, okay. And for our side, still \u00e2\u0080\u0093 demand is still pretty good and still good, like I mean, and I think as the orders and the orders slow down than before. And but we still have delinquency. And for memory side, for memory side, and there is a lot of new format, okay, starting, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still facing shortages now. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And if I could just add to that is that we are looking at any areas of our business that might be susceptible to either backlog that is canceled or is pushed out. And keep in mind that cancellations are always a part of all semiconductor companies. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a one-time or a new event. And the fact of the matter is, is that any influence relative to the size of our overall backlog today is very minor. And so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s given us very confident outlook for the second... Michael Hsing : The rate of a booking and the rate of cancellations and I would say they are very similar in the last few years. I mean last few quarters, yes. Quinn Bolton : Okay. So no noticeable uptick in cancellations or push-outs, it sounds like is what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Quinn Bolton : Got it. The second question is just enterprise data showing very strong growth, and I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be one of the biggest drivers for the business over the next couple of years, given the Greenfield opportunities. And just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 can you guys size for us, is the accelerator card and 40-gig volt opportunity larger than the share gain on CPU power? Do you think they are both equally sort of driving the growth? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just trying to sort of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the biggest driver, do you think, for the enterprise dataset? Michael Hsing : I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both. And not only the CPU size for the servers, we gain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we gain the market share. We stepped into \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in that game a couple of years ago, but a very small percentage, and we start to ramp. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still far distance, then they need a bigger suppliers. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from the server side. And the 48-volts, as you know, we talk about it. And we talked about since 2017 or \u00e2\u0080\u009818. And we said that this is the inevitable and a trend. You had to go move to 48 volt. And we are now in the forefront of, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not replacing anybody, okay? We set up this market trend. And so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and also in the data center and the rack itself is a big opportunities and MPS are ramping revenue from there, to from the AC power, and these are 380 volts and I guess, 240 volts input convert into 48 volt. And also the battery backup, and we provide the same \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we provide the solutions for battery management and also cooling side. And so MPS is almost one-stop shopping place for data center. Quinn Bolton : Thank you, Michael. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. First one for Michael. Michael, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re known for driving a lot of new innovative business models and as we now start to think about adding capacity to get to $4 billion, given the geopolitical dynamics and so on and so forth. I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked a little bit about this, but are you thinking or working on new business models to try and secure more capacity for your continuous growth? Michael Hsing : Well, these are one thing, right? We do \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of course, we have the fab, we have the mobile. And we will have increased more capacities outside of China. We started about a couple of years ago, also more than a couple of years ago. And now we engage with some bigger DRAM fabs, okay? We will fill that up in the next couple of years. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but going to futures, MPS actually require less semiconductors and because a lot of products are more programmable and we can use for multiple use. And at the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re growing our revenues. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling a lot more than semiconductor. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling power solutions, more modules. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so we kind of move up the food chain as the new requirement comes in, we play in the market, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not competing with anybody. And we just provide the solutions. And so those are manufacturer. These are clearly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are different. They are building modules. And we sign up partnerships, okay, for assemble these new modules. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unprecedented. And a lot of testings, a lot of qualifications, MPS designed the whole system from a ground up. And so these are the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there is no such a facility out there. So we had to invent it, that work. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And I think just to echo a point there is, if you look at our revenue for the quarter, we grew 57%. And keep in mind that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had one price increase, and that was in February this year for 5%. And so if you actually look at where the source of revenue growth came from, about half of it is volume related, and the other half is higher ASPs because the higher value products are selling. So that means that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve differentiated our supply chains. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just dependent on silicon-based products. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s making total solutions. Michael Hsing : But these are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the bigger effect hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really taken place yet. That would be a couple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a year or a couple of years down the road, you will see much bigger effect and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so there is a lot of the new \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a lot of work to do ahead of us. And these are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly, these are new types of modules. Nobody else build the kind of things, okay? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ground up, we developed and we even develop a manufacturing and as well as testing the qualifications part of it. Tore Svanberg : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great, great perspective. Thank you for that, Michael, as my follow-up, and this is related to what you just mentioned there, Bernie, which is pricing. I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re obviously growing by adding more value and higher ASP products. But you mentioned that 5% price increases. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well documented that your competitors have raised prices by more than that. So I guess my question is just simply that, are you gaining a lot of share because you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t engage in aggressive price increases as some of your customers? I mean, your competitors, sorry. Michael Hsing : Gaining share, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 gaining share is a difficult to count because gaining share, if the equals product is gaining share and going to be in a similar product. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our price betters, our performance better, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gaining shares. Okay. Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about completely different things. And those market segments we want to get in there is less price sensitive, but quality, performance a lot more important. And now okay, we offer something that is a lot more than that. And 10 years ago, we said who do we compete with? And not a company sell controller and power MOSFET, they are separate, MPS is integrated. And now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about MPS, we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our product even on the silicon side. And we have microcontroller, we have a memory, we have digital, we have power. And very unique how we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who do we display. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to say it. Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting to use these type of silicon-based technology, we migrate out. We became a provider of total solutions. So how do we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who do we display, and okay, how we gain market share? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very difficult to say. Tore Svanberg : Yes. No, it sounds like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re displacing more and more companies than before. Just one last quick one for you, Bernie. Most companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 DSOs were up this quarter because of the China lockdowns, shipments being later in the quarter. Your DSOs actually went down this quarter. So, can you just talk a little bit about how the China lockdown impacted you? I mean obviously, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t impact it the same way, but any other color you can share with us, that would be great? Thanks. Bernie Blegen : No, we really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much impact from the China shutdown. Obviously, we were able to record revenue growth that is well above the industry average. And the concern we might have had is if our customer supply chains got impacted. But we continue to hit our delivery schedules. And if there was an impact, I am sure we felt some of it, but it was very marginal. Tore Svanberg : Right. Thank you and congrats on the strong results. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Thanks guys for asking question. First question is really kind of a high-level one. Over the years, you guys have generally outperformed the analog market by maybe 10 or 15 percentage points of growth and gain share, etcetera, etcetera. Even last year wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t terribly outside of that range. But this year, it seems like that delta probably doubles at least, maybe something more. So, I do get investors that are concerned that your increased availability versus the peers allows you to ship and then it can be double shipping in response to the double ordering. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cyclical phenomenon that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widening that gap. Can you just talk about the reasons you think that gap is sustainable? And then looking forward, do you think that gap will continue to grow despite the fact that you are operating off of a larger base? Michael Hsing : Yes. I think what you said partially is correct. I mean the other company couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ship, okay, we have the inventories and again, we have a capacity to ship. But this year, particularly, we see things are very different. And a lot of products, especially we ship to these Tier 1 companies are from the industrial side, from automotive side and even the data centers. And they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intend to have MPS has a big \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has a majority as a bigger supplier, where they give us as a backup and to test a lot. And in the last years, we shipped all these units, our failures, okay. We are far better than everybody else, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing. The quality of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 quality is everything. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but they took a chance when they have shortages. And so we proved that, give us a bigger opportunity. We proved it, these products as better. Okay, as good as better than our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whatever the parts they design them out. And in the last year, this year, all the new product or the new segment start to grow out. And as our product, we can change it, we can reconfigure it. And that will continue, we continue to grow up. And as we see it at, we cannot handle all the projects. And so in the foreseeable features and these products will continue to grow. Bernie Blegen : And keep in mind that we are still facing large delinquencies ourselves. And so we have had to be very cautious and opportunistic as far as how we allocate our wafer starts in order to meet real customer demand. So, I think we have been clear that during the first half of the year, we did a cleanup of double orders and have confirmed, as I said earlier, the MPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backlog still remains very healthy. And then when you look at the inventory in the channel, we are at lows. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very lean. And we believe we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have perfect insight, that the inventory on our customer shelves is likewise very lean because we have only been doing partial shipments there. So, as far as the markets we feel reasonably confident, obviously, notebook or some of the consumer could give us, we are trying to stay very close to that and evaluate its impact. But as Michael said, a lot of our new growth opportunities are in these large Tier 1 opportunities. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that secular growth that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really driving it. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different from just building up in the channel or on customer shelves. Michael Hsing : Yes. I will come back to your questions. Okay. Now you said that you are growing a large basis, so you grow, okay, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to grow. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a built in everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, okay? In my mind, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a limit. And the limit is within yourself, what to do. And people told me, okay, early on $200 million, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your barriers, like $500 million of barriers. $200 million at the time, it was a barrier at one time. It happened. And $500 million, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t okay, then people tell me, okay, you are going to grow $1 billion, you need to slowdown. And at the time seriously, that was 2017, 2017 or \u00e2\u0080\u009818, yes, \u00e2\u0080\u009817, I actually said it, okay, when we get to $1 billion, we are going to accelerate it. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the time, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how I see it. And now, okay, MPS, we are not selling silicon anymore. We are selling raw more than the silicon, and why not accelerating the growth. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of course, I am not saying that now okay, a lot of things still depend on our execution. But only thing is the mindset when not dwell on selling semiconductors. And selling semiconductor is limited, but you have a lot of service engineering manpower, we can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our customers can benefit to it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlimited almost. Bernie Blegen : And supporting Michael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point there, you might remember six quarters or seven quarters ago, we made the statement that by the end of Q2 of \u00e2\u0080\u009822 that we would have capacity to support a $2 billion revenue run rate. And I think that the key there is the execution and the focus and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what we have done. Ross Seymore : Hi. Thanks for all that color guys. I guess hopefully, a quicker follow-up to all of this as you expand beyond the semiconductor side, you get into \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say systems, but more solutions in general, some of the stuff you talked about with the entire rack, the AC to DC, the cooling, all the above. What do we look at the gross margin doing in that? That sounds like higher gross margin business. And I know consistency of gross margin expansion is the mantra that you guys have lived by and delivered on. But it seems like mix would go in a big tail or would be a big tailwind for you going forward from a gross margin perspective. So, just talk about what this changing in your revenue mix means, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end market or system solutions versus chips to your gross margin? Michael Hsing : Yes. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of things we are going to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of course I can all I will say, okay, we can charge as much as our customers available, okay. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a half BS , okay. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but the reality is I think that we are comfortably stay around this mid to high-50s and 55% to 60% in the range. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sweet spot for us. We are not going to print the corners for us to grow to over 70%. And when we get that, we get that, okay. So far, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have headwinds. And I think the opportunity drives the model itself. In the next couple of years, I think that we are going to stay around this as we are now. So, maybe move up a slide later. I mean we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at least we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the headwinds. And so after 3 years or 4 years we will see how we change our models. Bernie Blegen : Right. I would just add that I think that we reported gross margin of 59.0%. And as Michael said, somewhere in that area is sort of the sweet spot for our model that allows us also to accelerate our rate of revenue growth. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that we will continue to evaluate. But I think right now, we are very comfortable with this being our model. Michael Hsing : We are not chasing the volumes going down. We are not actually MPS is not good at chasing our volume. We are not doing these manufacturing, okay. Actually, MPS doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t manufacture anything and the high-volume things, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not MPS forte. Ross Seymore : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Melissa, your line is now open. Melissa Fairbanks : Hi guys. Thanks very much. I will echo the congratulations on another great quarter. I just had two really quick ones for you. First, could you remind us what your inventory target or ideal levels of inventory would be in order to maybe clear some of the delinquencies? And then second, on a somewhat related note, what should we be thinking about for CapEx this year, either as a percentage of revenue or absolute investment. And then what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the longer term requirements you need in order to meet your demand or your growth plans? Bernie Blegen : Good questions. So, as far as inventory, keep in mind that being so much of our positioning is around growth that as sort of a risk management decision. We believe that 180 days to 200 days of inventory is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed so that we can manage an upside in customer demand, but also if we end up in an unfortunate situation where we have lots of inventory that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sellable that we can compensate for that without having any disruption to our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 production lines. So, I think that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been difficult to manage delinquencies while increasing inventories in order to support our model. But I think we have done a pretty good job in these really unusual times. And then as far as the capital requirements, I think we have talked in the past as far as what our spending rate is. It tends to be on a quarterly basis, can be somewhere between $14 million and $18 million per quarter with a lot of that being testing equipment or even if we are purchasing buildings, we purchase our own office space. And the first half of this year was a little bit lighter than our normal run rate. But I think 14 to 18, absent a big building purchase, is probably a good run-rate. Melissa Fairbanks : Okay, great. Thanks very much. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all for me. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Alessandra Vecchi of William Blair. Alex , your line is now open. Alessandra Vecchi : Sorry, I was muted. Apologies. I will start over. Bernie, can you hear me? Michael, can you hear me? Michael Hsing : Yes. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Hi Alex. Alessandra Vecchi : Apologies about that user error here. I was saying apologies again, if someone has already asked this question, but I wanted to expand a little bit on Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099 question, just in terms of the competitive dynamic in your products being superior to those of the competition as well as more of the solution sale. How do we think about power management, in particular, and your positioning within the customer as these products become more complicated, you take up more space on the board, I would assume that those conversations are becoming more tightly coupled and that you guys are becoming more important to the customer in terms of conversation? Michael Hsing : Yes. Look, I mean we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and as a matter of fact, the form of MPS, from the beginning, so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sell pin-to-pin comparables, okay. We \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in a similar product, we offer the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 actually, we are always a far better product. And much compact, much higher efficiencies. And as an also cost to play without the armor charge on the late and that is known for MPS, okay, and a one-time it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early period of time, the MPS is like a price, kind of companies. And we actually \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, that means that we left a little lot of dollars on the table. And of course, we are not competing in that market segment anymore. Now okay, we offer either total solutions. And if you do \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you are mentioning up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you are talking about any applications, they need power. And we are talking about electrical car, MPS can build a whole car and use electronics. And you want to build the data centers, MPS provides the entire product for data centers, and we are mostly there. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we sell value. And we are not competing on this product competes with that product. We have all software behind it. And we have user interface, okay, software that changes the game. We are not competing with the product per se anymore. Bernie Blegen : I think an interesting dynamic that we have been observing is that power management was always an afterthought. It was the last thing after you designed your board and you came up with the least bad solution. Now, we are introduced at the very front end of the development of an application. And the reason is, is because our power solutions enable our customers to be able to develop higher-power solutions than they would otherwise. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an interesting twist in the relationship where we are being introduced more earlier to the process and able to jointly come up with the development of shared solutions. Michael Hsing : As you see \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you remember, MPS like 4 years ago, we actually built a car. Built a very advanced car and far advanced than any car that you see in the market. And with battery management and same time, all the motor controls, a lot more complex than the existing EV. And so just for the purpose, we can demonstrate we can do it. And now we can do it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and 4 years later, actually, we can do a lot more than that. And so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of examples. Alessandra Vecchi : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremely helpful. And then, Bernie, just one last quick question, in terms of the guidance, any end market that we should think of or how should we think about the end markets in terms of strength versus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 strongest versus weakest strength, any notable things to call out? Bernie Blegen : Yes. I think that the themes that you are going to be seeing for the next 2 years to 3 years are the enterprise data and automotive. Automotive had a relatively slow first half, but that was exactly what we had in our expectations. There was no new surprise there. And we believe that in the second half, it looks very healthy as does the data center. Michael Hsing : Yes, as we see it. And okay, as we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 okay, what will we provide, not customer asked for it? Yes, we will do that, a customer do that. We should lead to customers. So, what you should need. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the game we are really playing, okay. We are playing ahead of game. And I think that all the power stuff like 48 volts, we said that this is like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we said that in 2017, okay, this is the futures, and we anticipated that. Electrical cars, we anticipated that. And so now we can, in the next few years, and we will see the very similar things that we will see all of these will happen. Alessandra Vecchi : Perfect. Thank you so much. Congratulations again. Bernie Blegen : Thank you, Alex. Genevieve Cunningham :  As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Great. Thanks Gen. I would like to thank you all for joining us on the webinar and look forward to talking to you again during the third quarter, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

Please note that this webinar is bring recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today\u2019s webinar we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 2022 earnings release and in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filings that can be found on our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call.  We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q3 2022 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Gen. First of all, today I\u2019m greeting you from Europe. We held our third quarter Board of Directors meeting in our Barcelona office. We have our Board Members tour of the facility and oversee the operations here.  Now, to the financial results. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $495.4 million, 7.5% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2022, and 53.1% higher than revenue in the third quarter of 2021. This broad based year-over-year revenue growth was the result of consistent executions against our strategies.  Looking at our third quarter 2022 revenue by market. Third quarter automotive revenue of $87.1 million increase 42.7% from the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to new platform launches. Third quarter 2022 automotive revenue was up 60.0% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 17.6% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  Third quarter 2022 communications revenue of $72.3 million is up 21.9% from the second quarter of 2022. Most of the sequential revenue increase was related to the continued communications infrastructure ramp. Third quarter 2022 communications revenue was up 61.8% year-over-year. Communication sales represented 14.6% of our total third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 13.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  In our enterprise data market, third quarter 2022 revenue $75.3 million increased 15.5% from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to continued strength in our data center and workstation computing sales.  Third quarter 2022 revenue represented 15.2% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue, compared with 9.2% in the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter 2022 industrial revenue of $58.7 million increased 5.1% from the second quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2022 industrial revenue was up 12.5% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 11.8% of our third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.1% in the third quarter of 2021.  Storage and computing revenue of $112.9 million decreased 7.7% from the second quarter of 2022. The sequential revenue decline was primarily due to softening of customer demand from notebooks. Third quarter 2022 storage and computing revenue was up 63.9% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 22.8% of MPS\u2019s third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 21.3% in the third quarter of 2021.  Third quarter consumer revenue of $89.2 million decreased 8.4% from the second quarter of 2022. The sequential quarterly revenue decline was primarily due to softening of overall demand. Third quarter 2022 consumer revenue was up 21.1% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 18.0% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue, compared with 22.8% in the third quarter of 2021. Let's talk about the general business conditions. For the prior six quarters, we have faced product shortages, especially in consumer, storage and computing. Now we have started to see our customers reduce their orders and push out shipments. We\u2019ve experienced similar patterns in the past. We anticipate order patterns might oscillate in the near future. This is not a surprise to us. As a result of this change in ordering patterns, our inventory level will catch up to our target of 180 to 200 days and possibly be higher in the near term.  In addition, we have over 4,000 different products which are required to support thousands of our customers' applications. On average, our product lifecycle succeeds six to eight years, so we are not concerned with carrying an inventory level above target. MPSs business is in a better position today. Rather than managing product shortage problems, we can now focus on long-term business development.  For longer cycle, business like automotive, enterprise data, coms infrastructure and industrial, both our customers and MPS have extended significant effort and made joint investments in the development of multiple leading edge products and applications. As a result, we have secured business which we believe will ramp over the next several years driving revenue growth.  For shorter cycle consumer related business, we will continue to proactively support our customers' needs. We have established MPS as a reliable supplier with excellent customer support during this extended period of product shortages. Accordingly, we believe both longer and shorter cycle customers value MPS as a strategic partner.  We are cautious about the overall business conditions and believe we can swiftly adapt to market changes as we have done successfully during similar macroeconomic changes in the past. There have been recent changes to export control rules and additional companies have been added to the MPs list. As of today we see immaterial revenue impact, directly or indirectly from those new trade restrictions. Our products utilize process nodes in excess a 40 nanometer, which falls well outside the current restrictions. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin and operating income. Third quarter 2022 GAAP gross margin was 58.7%, which was 10 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2022, and 110 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2021.  Our GAAP operating income was $151.9 million compared to $141.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2022. Non GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 59.0%, essentially flat from the gross margin percentage reported in the second quarter of 2022 and 120 basis points higher than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $193.7 million compared to $179.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2022. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $139.0 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $129.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, and $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our non GAAP third quarter 2022 operating expenses were $98.4 million, up from $92.7 million in the second quarter of 2022 and up from the $78.7 million reported in the third quarter of 2021.  The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or expense from an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the third quarter of 2022, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.2 million charged to cost of goods sold was $43.0 million, compared with $42.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022. Switching to the bottom line, third quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $124.3 million or $2.57 per fully diluted share compared with $114.7 million or $2.37 per share in the second quarter of 2022 and $68.8 million or $1.44 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Q3 2022 non GAAP net income was $170.7 million or $3.53 per fully diluted share compared with $157 million or $3.25 per share in the second quarter of 2022, and $98.6 million or $2.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3, 2022 were $48.3 million.  Now, let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $738.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022 compared to $814.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $18.2 million compared with Q2, 2022 operating cash flow of $105.2 million. The decline in operating cash flow and increase in other long term assets reflected a $170 million prepaid payment made during the quarter to secure a long term purchasing commitment.  Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2022 at $153.4 million, representing 28 days of sales outstanding, which was three days higher than the 25 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2022, and six days higher than the 22 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2022 were $397.4 million, up $37.8 million from the $359.6 million reported at the end of the second quarter of 2022. Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2022 represented 167 days, which were five days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2022. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current order revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter\u2019s revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2022 represented 189 days, 29 days higher than 160 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022 and 56 days higher than the 133 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $450 million to $470 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 58.1% to 58.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.3% to 58.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $37.7 million to $39.7 million, including approximately $1.1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold.  GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $131 million and $135 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $94.4 million to $96.4 million. Litigation expense in expected to be in the range of $1.3 million and $1.7 million. Interest income is expected to be in the range from $1.1 million to $1.5 million. Fully diluted shares are expected to be in the range of 48.2 million to 49.2 million shares. In conclusion, even though business conditions are softening, our market share gains continue to expand reflecting high customer engagement and our ability to secure design wins. We can now focus on growing our long term business.  I will now open the webinar up for questions. A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt your line is now open. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much. I guess good evening guys if you're in Europe. So Michael, Bernie can you hear me, okay. Bernie Blegen : Yeah, buenos noches. Matt Ramsay : Thanks guys. So two different questions from me. One sort of related to the model and the near term and the other one on a different topic. So the first question, Bernie, if you could help us a little bit, I mean the guidance was a bit light and you talked about some of the macro conditions, but it seemed like weakness was concentrated in the storage and computing segment. So if you could maybe talk about things by segment and what you're guidance implies on a quarterly basis by segment. I think that would be helpful and then I have a follow up. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Sure, just to clarify that the softness that we're seeing is both in the storage and computing as well as consumer. The other segments are still positioned to show growth between Q3 and Q4. The only sort of qualifier that we're still trying to learn about the strength and the runrate of the communications of that segment. So I think what we've done is we feel very, very comfortable with both, how we've been communicating our expected results, but we've added a little conservatism to the outlook. Matt Ramsay : Got it. Great! And thank you that. Michael, my second question is on the topic of China, and over the last, I\u2019d say three or four weeks since some of the new commerce and BIS restrictions have come into place, I've been getting a ton of investor questions about this topic with relation to your company on two fronts. I guess the first being, MPS has a significant employee base in China. If you could maybe quantify what maybe percentage of your employees and in what functions are actually in China, and if you've heard from any of these restrictions that there could be any restrictions on those employees need to relocate anybody, those kind of things? And then the second part of the question is on your manufacturing footprint. I know it\u2019s spread across China, Taiwan, increasingly in Korea. We've heard some stories from semi cap companies needing to pull employees out of SMIC for example, in other places because of these new restrictions. So anything in your manufacturing operations that might be disrupted at all because of some of the China restrictions and how far are you guys along or maybe the mix of your capacity that's now outside of China.  You get this nature of the questions, but they've been a pretty frequent and acute over the last three or four weeks. So, it would be great if you could just kind of address some of those topics. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes, very nice questions. Michael, I'm glad you asked, that what all your concern is I think most of the people totally misconstrued whatever the regulation is. And we do have a presence, we have a large presence within China. This is a U.S. companies, okay, and we\u2019re not subject for sanctions at all. We don't have to have the people to leave \u2013 Americans have to leave an MPS office within China and that's not in the sanction entity list, and we are not in a sanction entity list.  And other one is the manufacturing in the last couple of quarters, we already talked about it. We\u2019ve diversified out of China and we\u2019re starting five, six years ago. Also, I should mention that we talk about it on the engineering manpower. This MPS started at 2017, and we are in Barcelona now. We\u2019ve moved a very large team here with the local government support. We are outside of China, and that's not because we \u2013 because of sanctions, because we want to diversify. Geometrically we\u2019ll \u2013 we will grow into a different region, in the same time zones, wherever we want. We give our customers the better support. Bernie Blegen : And just to finish up on Michael's comment there, to be perfectly clear, our technology and our products are not subject to restrictions. Matt Ramsay : No, thank you very much. Just a really, really quick follow-up. What would you say the percentage Michael of the products or the revenue that is actually sourced from manufacturing footprints inside of China today versus outside. And thank you very much for indulging my question guys, I appreciate it. Michael Hsing : It is very convoluted and it is very convoluted and packaging\u2019s and also the process wafer manufacturers, and it's very convoluted, we don't have a clear figures now. But going back to the Bernie\u2019s question and of Bernie\u2019s answers, our technologies, we're using 40 nanometer above and the current sanction is a 14 nanometer below. We are far \u2013 as Bernie mentioned in the script, we are far from that sanctions in the way using the trading edge. We are really using the trading edge of a fab equipment. Bernie Blegen : And if I can just follow-up on one quick point as we made in our script here, is that as the supply demand imbalance has normalized, that frees us up from just being in pure production mode to actually be able to invest time in business relationships, to be able to expand and diversify our capacity, which we talked about about three quarters ago, where we're going to go from $2 billion of capacity currently to $4 billion within the next two years, two to three years. Michael Hsing : These are mostly, we planned these outside of China. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is open. Quinn Bolton : Thanks. I don't want to pile on the export control questions that Matt was just asked, but I have one other clarification. You're at 40 nanometer and above and so you're not directly affected. But my understanding is that to the extent a facility, a manufacturing facility in China has multiple process nodes, some above 16 nanometer and some below 16 nanometer that that mixed-use facility would be affected.  So I'm just wondering you know, for those Chinese manufacturing facilities, the fab-by-fab, are any of the fabs that you're running 40 nanometer and above, do they also produce 16 nanometer and below and might therefore be affected by equipment and/or support restrictions. Michael Hsing : No. These are fab usually, they don't \u2013 advanced fabs, okay, these are 14 nanometer below, and I did not share where these outdated fabs like 40-nanometer above, okay. We're primarily using 65 nanometer. So these are totally different fabs. Quinn Bolton : Thanks Michael. That's right, but I just wanted to clarify because I know that yeah, as Matt said, there have been lots of questions on this topic. Maybe one for Bernie. I know you're not guiding beyond the December quarter. But obviously the environment is pretty tough right now, especially on orders. And so I guess as you look out beyond December, can you give us any thoughts as to whether you would see less than normal seasonality in March as some of this weakness continues into next year? And I guess the offset would be, Monolithic Power has some pretty, I think meaningful market share gains, both on the server CPU side, as well as the data center GPU side. When would you think that those share gains start to kick in and might get you back to normal seasonal if not better than seasonal patterns. Bernie Blegen : Sure. So \u2013 and again Quinn, thank you for focusing on more longer-term and strategic issues here. I think it's very easy to get caught in thinking about next quarter and just the quarter after that. And everything, all the indicators that we're receiving as far as the share gains occurring in the data center are on track. Nothing has been changed there at all.  And then as far as how we look at the next few quarters. Again, when we apply cautiousness to Q4, I think we could expect that anything \u2013 that any growth opportunities are more likely to be weighted in the second half of 2023. Michael Hsing : Yes, that's our guess and that's our experience. And I might as well add. You mentioned the CPUs and the CPU power, data centers and MPS is a lot more than that. And you look at Bernie\u2019s, read our script and you have automotive and the data \u2013 the enterprise data centers and other ones in communication - the other ones, the communications, these are still, all of them are grown, except the consumer related notebooks, gaming, those type of things, and as everybody is aware of, they are softening. They swings from shortage to oversupplies and then you know kind of almost overnight.  These kind of things we cannot predict. I mean you guys probably predict it better than we know. We just have to react fast, and the overall MPS business, all these are greenfield products will start to ramp in the last few years and will continue to ramp. Quinn Bolton : Sorry Michael, I didn't want to shortchange it by only focusing on the data center opportunity. So, thanks for that color. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William your line is now open. William Stein : Hey! Thank you so much for taking questions. I have one near-term one and then a longer-term one. From a near-term perspective, I'm hoping you can talk about pricing trends and also how your backlog might be changing in terms of the duration of what you have on the books today versus where we've been recently? And then again, I have a sort of longer-term follow-up question, please. Michael Hsing : For shorter terms and I can name this. Here what we see is for the long cycle, longer cycle business is continued. And because there is no questions related to price, okay? Because all the products, they will last four, five years or even longer, okay, and these products are in the ramping cycles. In the shortest \u2013 in the shorter cycle, consumer related, as I said it earlier, I\u2019ve got notebooks and gamings or the other personal electronics, and these ones okay, they are oversupplied. There's no question \u2013 we don't have any questions about the pricing. And that probably will come in, like in later, another quarter later, what will be a new project design, that\u2019s where we, that\u2019s pricing \u2013 a question, pricing questions will start to emerge. Bernie Blegen : And well, you also mentioned backlog, the sort of condition in the backlog overall. And relative to historical norms, we still remain very \u2013 you know we're much higher than we have been historically, and \u2013 but this has given us an opportunity to address with our customers. In fact, we've been engaged in these conversations for several quarters now, on what they expect real demand to be. So I think that as far as our book of business is looking ahead, it remains very healthy. William Stein : And then the longer-term question, I tend to ask each quarter about some of the you know more differentiated products and services MPS has, modules in particular. I wonder about the traction of those products and whether you're seeing the uptake of that either expand or falter given the current environment? And then same thing with e-commerce, like you have seen more or less of that given the changing demand environment. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes, all the products, the modules and the e-commerce business okay, and we don't see any changes and they are just continuing and that's where MPS future business would be and we're even more diversified than MPS' current business. Bernie Blegen : And I think it's interesting as far as market acceptance for the modules. It really is not concentrated in any one \u2013 any market. It's actually pretty evenly distributed against all of our markets. So that to me is a real clear indicator that it fits in well with our diversification strategy. Michael Hsing : Yes, frankly if you ask me where these module goes, we don't have ideas and that is the beauty of it. William Stein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Kwan of Stifel. Jeremy your line is now open. Jeremy Kwan : Yes, good evening. Can you hear me okay? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Jeremy Kwan : Great! Just a couple of questions. First, just looking at the lighting business, it looks like it had a nice increase sequentially this quarter. Is there anything that you can call out there? I just want to understand some of the dynamics in that business. Bernie Blegen : Automotive. Jeremy Kwan : I'm sorry, the lighting \u2013 oh! It\u2019s automotive. Okay. That's what's been driving it. Bernie Blegen : Yes. As we said in the prepared comments, that there were new platforms that were launched, most of them are tied to the 2023 model year and there were probably three areas, lighting being one of them that really contributed to the uplift in the automotive in Q3. Jeremy Kwan : So this is something that we can look at as a new baseline and the sort of like a steady ramp from here or should we expect kind of more step functions with each new model here? Michael Hsing : Well, the lighting is \u2013 in automotive lighting have a variety. You have a down light, you have indicators, all kind of indicators, you have the signals, then you have the headlight, okay. So this is the last couple of quarters you see stepping up and that's kind of, that's part of the Greenfield product and automotive start to ramp. The content in the cars, we're growing the content. For the number of cars we have okay, and just at the beginning, we still have a small, very small market here, so it will continue to grow. Jeremy Kwan : Got it. Great! And just turning to the long term purchasing agreement that you talked about Bernie, can you give us a little bit more details on this, maybe the magnitude or the size of this deal and you know how different is this from things, the way you may have done business in the past. Just any more detail and help us you know to understand your strategic thinking behind this, that would be very helpful. Bernie Blegen : Sure. So when you think about the period of the supply-demand imbalance that we came out of, we had actually a superior competitive position because we had invested in our supply chain earlier than our competition, and that allowed us to have part availability when they didn't and that allowed for incremental market share gains. So as we continue to expand capacity, we're looking for new opportunities and with existing as well as with new fabs, and so in this instance we wanted to secure a purchasing agreement that in order \u2013 that gave us dedicated capacity regardless of what the economic environment was. Jeremy Kwan : Got it, thank you. And then just one last question, just touching again on the modules. Can you give us any insight into the other differences in terms of the manufacturing supply chain that needs to be managed here? And you know in terms of whether it's sourcing or whether it's the geographic footprint. Are there things that you can call there as well? Michael Hsing : Most of it \u2013 let me answer it that way. Most of our modules assembly is outside of China. Jeremy Kwan : Great! Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Bernie Blegen : Rick, can you hear us? Rick Schafer : Yes, sorry I was muted. Can you hear me now, Bernie? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Rick Schafer : Great. Well hey guys! Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Maybe my first one just on supply. You know TSM, obviously your newest foundry partner, I was just curious if you could kind of level set us on where you guys are at in terms of the qualification process, you know eventual capacity ramp, sort of maybe even get a sense of how much capacity they are going to have for you ultimately and how much of that might be eight versus 12-inch? Just trying to get a better handle on them as a partner. Michael Hsing : Yes, most of what we use is 12-inch and also the advanced process modes, of course that thing is in the TSMC. We do use the advanced nodes of gaming and these are for microcontrollers, that type of a product that we do use them and these are not winning in China at all. And a lot of these are product at the very beginning of a ramp and so now we have all the capacities for these new products. Mostly these are for automotive and communications and so now it gives us a lot more room to grow. Rick Schafer : So Michael, just to kind of get a sense. I mean, is this \u2013 could TSM be sort of a 10% contributor to capacity in say a year's time or is that too aggressive to kind of think of how quickly they could ramp? Michael Hsing : On the lower side as we see now. Rick Schafer : Thanks a lot and then a follow-up, I'm just curious to get an update on silicon carbide progress, particularly traction inverters. I mean how many customers you're engaged with now and when we might expect to see initial revenues? And I know you've talked about it in the past Michael, but just kind of remind us what that dollar content for MPS looks like ex-EV? And I'm assuming it would be sort of subsystem, but would anything be discrete or would that all be sort of module/subsystem? Michael Hsing : Yes. Thank you very much to ask that question. Yeah, that kind of things, the silicon carbides and the high-power modules okay, that work gets me excited. We do have our first product going through the qualification now; it's working. MPS does not intend to sell as a power device, as a power device only and like a power set only. We will sell within using our combined with our silicon technology produce these small modules.  And we do have many customers engaged in automotive, automotive sections and also the large energy storage and as well as BMS, the car charging stations and those kind of things, we don't have any revenue yet, okay, but it will be in the next few years. Rick Schafer : And Michael, just a reminder just sort of what it does to content for you guys or potential content in a car or a vehicle? Michael Hsing : I think these content will be enormous, okay? I don't even have a - that would be in the billion, and I don't have a \u2013 a couple of billion dollars of opportunity is a smaller. It's a very conservative estimate. Just thinking about it, all the power trains okay, driver trains, all the charging stations, MPS is not going to make and sell a chip only, we\u2019re selling the entire systems. Rick Schafer : Great! Thanks a lot for all the color. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open. Alex Vecchi : Hey everyone! Thanks for taking my questions. Bernie, maybe one for you just on a housekeeping question around gross margins. Can you elaborate a little bit on the down sequential? The only reason I'm asking is given the end market weakness and notebooks in consumer I would have thought is lower gross margin mix. So anything you can do to help on that and how to think of it like from here. Michael Hsing : Sure, Alex. So there's a lot of ingredients that play into the gross margin outlook and certainly the direct margin by end market is a significant part of it. Another is the amount of - I don't like to call it necessarily unused capacity. The fixed cost that isn't necessarily absorbed by the same volume. So it's really the fixed cost issue as opposed to the sales mix that's putting a little bit of downward pressure on the gross margin. Alex Vecchi : Okay. And then similarly to that extent, just expand on Rick's questions regarding the new fab partner or TSMC. Do you view that relationship eventually being gross margin accretive or dilutive versus your Chinese partners? Michael Hsing : Well, these are the events note and we're moving that towards that \u2013 in the territories and therefore these are more microcontrollers, and more highly digital content products and it's a different product. We \u2013 there is no gross margin issues. So in that case we don't go down compete with the price. All the products that we add is more. These are values more in the software side. Bernie Blegen : And I think that when you look at TSMC, these are new and advanced products that we're developing with them, whereas we're at the same time doing an expansion and diversification away from China and that would include other fabs, both in South Korea as well as in Taiwan. Alex Vecchi : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. With that I\u2019ll go back into queue. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Melissa, your line is now open. Melissa Fairbanks : Hi guys! Thanks very much. We saw CapEx \u2013 maybe a little longer-term question for you. We saw CapEx dip a little in the third quarter. Maybe could you give us an update on your longer-term capacity planning, not just with TSMC, but more broadly? Does the near-term demand weakness impact those longer-term plans? And then when we're looking at getting to $4 billion in revenue, what's the path to that ramp and the cadence of the investment needed to get there? Michael Hsing : Well, it's a \u2013 we always \u2013 if you look at our past. If you look at how we expand our capacity, what is our investment, and if you look at the past eight, nine, 12 years, it's the same pattern as the next four, five years. And we're not going to over invest. We're not going to less invest it, okay.  So the trend, if you look at it. If you're plotting our OpEx and also the growth rate, and it should remain pretty constant in the past four years and in the past eight years, in 12 years, in also the last two or three years the growth pattern is really different from previous four years, and whatever the growth rate we have in the next four years, you can use the plotting \u2013 you can use the same kind of percentage range. Bernie Blegen : And Melissa, keep in mind that when we do the fab expansion, the capital expenditures are borne by our partners not directly by us. So when you look at our run rate that Michael is referring to, that's more heavily concentrated in test equipment, which can fluctuate from anywhere between $8 million per quarter to $14 million per quarter. It just so happens that we made a lot of those investments earlier in the year, and that's why we're lower.  The other thing that we invest in is that we do buy or we develop our own facilities and those can be layered on and currently there are no investments of any material nature. Michael Hsing : Yes, let me clarify this a little more, rather than give you a model. You know MPS, we don't own the fab, we don't own fab equipment, and the cost of associating with capacity expansion, one is we have to qualify the process, and the large portion of it is to qualify our products. We have 4,000, well over 4,000 products, and each product to go through a qualification, that takes about eight to nine months. That cost, that's very costly and so that's \u2013 if we don't \u2013 if we slow down and the demand slows down, we don't have to qualify as fast okay, and so the cost will be spread out. Bernie Blegen : And those costs are borne in our R&D expenditure line. Melissa Fairbanks : Okay great, that\u2019s very clear. Thanks very much guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Thanks Jen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter conference call, which is likely to be held in early February. Thank you and have a nice day!",

    "content": "\ufeff Genevieve Cunningham : Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 2022 earnings release and in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filings that can be found on our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q4 and full year 2022 earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC and is currently available on our website. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Gen. For the full year, 2022, MPS achieved record revenue of $1.79 billion, growing 48.5% from the prior year. This is despite industry-wide supply chain capacity constraints. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and having more Tier 1 customers recognize MPS for advanced technologies, product quality and excellent customer support. Here are a few highlights from 2022. We introduced a new product line of isolated power modules for applications exceeding 1 kilowatt with a fully integrated controller, isolator and power devices. Our initial revenue ramp for this highly integrated and reliable solution is targeted for 2024. These modules are critical building blocks for power management applications for data centers, EVs, plug-in traction inverters, EV chargers, solar power, wind turbines, battery power storage and other industrial applications. Our products are designed to set the industry standard for these critical system-level applications. MPS\u2019 first advanced data converter products for high precision industrial and medical applications were made commercially available during 2022, and we expect to have an initial revenue ramp in 2023. We continue to diversify our global footprint in the expansion of our R&D centers, supply chain partnerships and facilities outside of China to better match our resource distribution with our customers\u2019 geographic demand profile. With our global presence, we believe MPS is in a strong position to support our customers worldwide. Turning to our full year 2022 revenue by market segment compared with 2021. Enterprise Data revenue was up 116.1%, Storage and Computing revenue up 76.8%, Communication revenue up 53.2%, Automotive revenue up 46.8%, Industrial revenue up 18.6% and Consumer revenue up 13.2%, demonstrating broad-based full year 2022 revenue improvement. Full year 2022 Enterprise Data revenue grew $135.1 million over the prior year to $251.4 million. This 116.1% increase is primarily due to higher sales of our power management solutions for cloud-based CPU and GPU server applications. Enterprise Data revenue represented 14.0% of MPS\u2019 total revenue in 2022, compared with 9.6% in 2021. Storage and Computing revenue for 2022 grew $196.7 million over the prior year to $452.6 million. This 76.8% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for storage applications and enterprise notebooks. Storage and Computing revenue represented 25.3% of MPS\u2019 total revenue in 2022, compared with 21.2% in 2021. Communications revenue grew $87.4 million to $251.5 million. This 53.2% improvement reflected higher sales of products for both 5G and satellite communications infrastructure applications. Communications revenue represented 14.0% of our 2022 revenue compared with 13.6% in 2021. Automotive revenue grew $95.7 million to $300.0 million in 2022. This 46.8% year-over-year gain primarily represented increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting automated driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and connectivity. Automotive revenue represented 16.7% of MPS\u2019 full year 2022 revenue compared with 16.9% in 2021. Industrial revenue grew $34.4 million to $218.2 million in 2022. This 18.6% year-over-year increase primarily reflected higher sales in applications for smart meters and industrial automation. Industrial revenue represented 12.2% of MPS\u2019 full year 2022 revenue compared with 15.3% in 2021. Consumer revenue grew $37.2 million to $319.5 million in 2022. This 13.2% year-over-year increase primarily reflected increased product sales for home appliances and smart TVs. Consumer revenue represented 17.8% of MPS\u2019 full year 2022 revenue compared with 23.4% in 2021. Let\u2019s talk about the general business conditions. During our Q3 2022 earnings call, we highlighted that customers were becoming more concerned with near-term business conditions and order patterns might oscillate in the near future. As a result of this change in ordering patterns, we indicated that our inventory levels would likely catch up to our target of 180 to 200 days and possibly be higher in the near-term. During the quarter, ordering patterns stabilized as customers requested push outs slowed. While this is positive, customers\u2019 orders are still trending below historic norms. In our Q4 2022 inventory is above our target levels. As a result, we remain cautious about near-term business conditions. We also believe MPS can swiftly adapt to market changes as we have done so successfully during similar macroeconomic changes in the past. Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $460.0 million, down 7.1% from revenue generated in the third quarter of 2022, but up 36.7% from the comparable quarter of 2021. On a year-over-year basis comparison by market segment, fourth quarter 2022 revenue for automotive grew 72.8%. Enterprise Data revenue increased 69.0%. Storage and computing revenue grew 55.0%. Communications revenue grew 40.1%, and industrial revenue grew 13.3%, while consumer revenue decreased 20.1%. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP gross margin was 58.2%, down 50 basis points from third quarter 2022 with 60 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $136.9 million compared to $151.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2022 and $78.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP gross margin was 58.5%, 50 basis points below the third quarter of 2022, but 60 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. The year-over-year expansion in fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was largely due to a shift in sales mix favoring high-value greenfield products and operational efficiencies, which more than offset higher product input costs. Our non-GAAP operating income was $174.1 million compared to $193.7 million reported in the prior quarter and $102.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. Let\u2019s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $130.9 million in the fourth quarter compared with $139.0 million in the third quarter of 2022, and $115.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2022 operating expenses were $94.8 million, down from the $98.4 million we spent in the third quarter of 2022 and up from the $83.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2022 litigation expense was $3.2 million compared with a $2.1 million in Q3 2022 and a $420,000 credit balance in Q4 2021. The fourth quarter 2021 litigation credit reflected in IP settlement and refund of a legal retainer. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2022 stock compensation expense, including $1.0 million charged to cost of goods sold was $35.3 million compared with $43.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022. The quarter-over-quarter change in stock compensation expense reflected a change in the planned vesting assumptions. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $119.1 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share compared with $2.57 per share in the third quarter of 2022 and $1.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Q4 2022 non-GAAP net income was $154.0 million or $3.17 per fully diluted share compared with $3.53 per share in the third quarter of 2022, and $2.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2022 were 48.5 million. Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $739.6 million compared to $738.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. For fourth quarter \u2013 for the fourth quarter of 2022, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $52.2 million compared with Q3 2022 operating cash flow consumed of $18.2 million. Fourth quarter 2022 capital spending totaled $12.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2022 at $182.7 million or 36 days of sales outstanding compared with the $153.4 million or 28 days of sales outstanding reported at the end of the third quarter of 2022, and the $104.8 million or 28 days reported at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 were $447.3 million, up from $397.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice, and as you can see on the webinar video, days of inventory rose to 212 days at the end of Q4 2022 from the 167 days at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Historically, we\u2019ve calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter\u2019s revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, again, you can see days of inventory increased to 214 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 from 188 days at the end of the third quarter of 2022. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2023 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2023 revenue in the range of $440 million to $460 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.4% to 58.0%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.7% to 58.3%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $40.2 million to $42.2 million, including approximately $1.2 million that would be charged cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses including litigation expenses between $135.1 million and million $139.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $96.1 to $98.1 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense. Beginning with the Q1 2023 outlook, MPS will no longer separately forecast litigation expenses. Interest income is expected to be in the range from $1.8 million to $2.2 million before foreign exchange gains or losses and charitable contributions. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 2023 will be 12.5%. The non-GAAP tax rate remains unchanged from 2022 as there have not been any material changes in tax regulations. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 48.2 to 49.2 million shares. Finally, I\u2019m pleased to announce a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1 per share from $0.75 per share for stockholders of a record as of March 31, 2023. In conclusion, while we remain cautious about near-term business conditions, we believe MPS can swiftly adapt to market changes and take advantage of the current environment to focus on business development and investing in infrastructure necessary to support long-term growth. I\u2019ll now open the webinar up for questions. A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. Congratulations on the strong results and the nice outlook in this environment. I guess I wanted to start Bernie and Michael, the computing storage business was much stronger than at least I expected in the fourth quarter. You grew revenue quarter-on-quarter when the rest of the PC [ph] market is clearly experiencing softness and inventory correction. So I guess, can you give us sort of your outlook? How do you see that business trending over the next couple of quarters? And then I\u2019ve got a follow up. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think that there\u2019s been a lot of press recently around weakness in notebooks as far as unit sales. And in addition, we\u2019ve started to see some word [ph] here about declines also in the memory market. Interestingly, memory continued to be very strong for us offsetting a decline in notebooks. And as we look ahead here, we actually see notebooks beginning to improve in the early part of 2023. And probably those gains will offset a decline in memory. So we\u2019re basically looking at this category at least for the first half of the year to be flattish. Quinn Bolton : Okay. Michael Hsing : The one component the AI portions still remain to be very strong in the near futures. And then we see a very high growth. Bernie Blegen : Absolutely. In the enterprise data we\u2019ve really got good traction with the GPUs for artificial intelligence and so that should really be one of our growth drivers in the first half of 2023. Quinn Bolton : That was going to be my next question, enterprise data was down slightly in the fourth quarter. But it sounds like you see the ramp or just strong results in the first half driven by. It sounds like specifically GPUs, is that right? Michael Hsing : Yes, that\u2019s related to artificial intelligence. Bernie Blegen : Yes. When we look at CPUs in the enterprise data, there\u2019s still initial softness as we\u2019re waiting for the platform launches for both the Sapphire Rapids and Genoa to take off. Quinn Bolton : Do you expect that in the second half than the CPU to on a take [ph] in more second half of the year? Bernie Blegen : Yes. Quinn Bolton : Perfect. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. And congratulations on another record year. Michael, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the power isolation module business, they expect to ramp in 2024. Is this still based on the company\u2019s BCD technology or are you now starting to venture into some newer technologists? I\u2019m just curious, because you haven\u2019t talked a whole lot about potentially getting into silicon carbide or GaN or anything like that? Michael Hsing : Yes, so we do have programs that are going to a wide bandgap materials, okay? And in the past, I think we talk about it in, we have a program to make to investigating and develop those devices since 2017. And now we see the first result and we do have some samples ready, but not in the production yet. My prediction is that are somewhere in the middle of the years, okay, or second half of the years. And related to the \u2013 your questions about the isolated modules, when any higher powers is pressuring inverters, solar and solar inverters and data centers also chargers, onboard chargers and all these in the wind turbines. All of these have one basic component in all these very high power applications, which is all the power devices driven by using the isolated modules. And MPS is using, again, using our own BCD process and as well as our bandgap materials and we combine togethers and making a very simple [indiscernible] and a very ease of use power modules for those type of applications. Some of these products already in production in the EVs currently. And things that we expected higher growth in the next couple years. Tore Svanberg : That\u2019s very helpful. And as my follow-up, could you just give us an update on the manufacturing footprint both from a capacity perspective, but more importantly about diversification. You talked about, looking at all sorts of regions to partner with some new manufacturing partners, so yes, both capacity, but then also from a geographic \u2013 geographical perspective perhaps an update that? Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes. We see as everybody else see in the geopolitical tensions and as you know MPS in the past, we always want to be a local company in every political regions. And we did that successfully in R&D site. And because for one thing is close to customers, other ones and \u2013 other ones we isolated from these tensions from between the countries. And for the manufacturing side, currently, we can fulfill all our customer demand to \u2013 demand for wherever they want to manufacture it. And we want to \u2013 by end of the year or by the next \u2013 by end of the year or next years, we will have fully rent and for the new capacities just in case the [indiscernible] really separated. Tore Svanberg : Great. Thank you so much, and congrats again. Michael Hsing : Thanks, Tore. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open. Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open. MattRamsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me, okay? Michael Hsing : Yes. MattRamsay: Hey, Michael. Hey, Bernie. The \u2013 one question that I wanted to ask you that we\u2019ve heard, I mean, you guys \u2013 I guess, addressed in your prepared script how you are working to move sort of the operations at manufacturing footprint and other pieces outside of China to in the long term, more sort of align with your TAM and revenue mix for the really, really long term in the company. And you\u2019ve been very clear about those plans. But there\u2019s been some more, I guess, acute reports of maybe some customers that want to very quickly use product sources outside of China. And you\u2019ll probably know some of those reports that I\u2019m talking about. I guess, have those impacted your revenues at all? Are you seeing any strange behaviors from customers that maybe you want to move and source product outside of China more quickly than you\u2019re able to? Or are you already sourcing outside of China to support many of your global customers? Thanks. Michael Hsing : Yes, it\u2019s a misconception for MPS is that we are \u2013 lot of manufacturers that\u2019s in China. That\u2019s true. But it\u2019s a misconception. So, okay, we do in a prior COVID \u2013 we do \u2013 most of, we do at least half of it manufacturer and at least we have capacities is outside the countries or outside of China. And to answer your question, whether zero impact in the \u2013 for whoever customers request to manufacture in the outside of China in the past and the futures. MattRamsay: All right. Thank you for that, Michael. That\u2019s really clear. Just a question we get a lot. I wanted to talk a little bit about the consumer business, which is kind of the \u2013 maybe the least important strategic segment, but also the most volatile. If you look at where, I guess the numbers came in the fourth quarter. And I guess what I\u2019m wanting to understand a little bit is the philosophy that you guys might have if and when some of those consumer markets and the China market in general recover. Are you excited to keep that segment down around 10% of revenue and will continue to prioritize everything else? Or is that a business that you want to serve Michael as it potentially rebounds? Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes, and again, I would say that I mean, in the past, last year capacity issues like a constrain the consumer growth. And we do have a lot of opportunity. We just didn\u2019t pick it up because of the capacity issues. And in the downturns in the past, as you know, that again and will be a lot more aggressive for in these consumer market segment because when you react to a price and you react to the opportunity how fast you react to the opportunity. And within the six months, you\u2019ll see the \u2013 you\u2019ll see the bigger number change in a consumer segment. And that\u2019s what we would do. Bernie Blegen : And Matt keep in mind, the resilience of our business model has to do with the diversity of the end markets, the customers, the geographies that we serve. So consumer, well, it has dropped to around 10% of the quarter remains a very important part of that strategy and will continue to invest in it. MattRamsay: Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open. Michael Hsing : Hello? Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo. Gary, your line is now open. Gary Mobley : Hey, Michael. Hey, Bernie. [Indiscernible] And thanks for taking my question for the first time as a covering analyst. And related to that, I apologize in advance if I ask an uninformed question here. But the inventory for you guys, that 212 days, that\u2019s internal inventory. I believe, however, your sales, 83% of your sales roughly go through distribution. So maybe you can give us a view in terms of distribution inventory and did it increase and if so, to what extent did it favor revenue? Bernie Blegen : Gary, opening up, welcome to the party. This is Gary\u2019s first call with us. Michael Hsing : And welcome to the inventory question. Bernie Blegen : Inventory question. I thought we finished this question. Michael Hsing : For Gary\u2019s, okay. Bernie Blegen : Okay. Gary, it\u2019s okay. So when I look at the channel inventories from Q4 to Q1, or I\u2019m sorry, from Q3 to Q4, they basically stabilized. So we didn\u2019t see a significant increase either in terms of dollars or days in the quarter. Likewise when we talk about inventory on our balance sheet, and I\u2019ll address that out as well. There\u2019s about a six month lead time from when we can slow down wafer starts when you see it on the balance sheet. So likewise, as we\u2019re looking now to head to Q1, we see both inventory in terms of dollars on our balance sheet as well as in the channel, stabilizing sell-through in the channel remains very good. And then it should normalize in the second half of the year. Gary Mobley : I apologize if I step into\u2026 Michael Hsing : It\u2019s fair to say like I mean, in 2019, we deliberate build 200 days plus inventory because we did see all these opportunity. And then now the inventory goes this highs because go over 200 days again. And that is because the customers demand start to pushing out and this is on the high side and we will cautiously and reduce it. And it\u2019s not \u2013 this is not the same as it was done in 2019. Gary Mobley : Got it. Thank you for that. And I wanted to ask about contributors to the revenue growth for the fiscal year, for the quarter, 48.5% is quite commendable. I was hoping maybe you can deconstruct that between ASP increases and unit increases and how you see that playing out for fiscal year 2023 as well? Michael Hsing : It\u2019s very diverse to growth in \u2013 with a little more aggressive activities in the consumer segment. And this is different from 2020 to 2021. And everything is the same because we are not \u2013 we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not a one trick ponies, and like not a two trick pony either. So I mean we have a multiple product. We have a product like 5,000, 6,000 different products. We have a few thousands of customers, large customers, let\u2019s say, biggest customer is less than 4% in a different industry. And with our \u2013 that\u2019s the same way as we do in the last 10 full years. And we\u2019re still continue to pass. Bernie Blegen : Clearly, as you look at a business driver in 2022 and as we look ahead, you can also see the impact of selling higher value technologies and higher ASPs that go along with it. So while many companies use this supply-demand imbalance as an opportunity to raise prices to their customers, we only had one single-digit price increase back in February and all of the other is representative of higher ASPs and volume gains. Gary Mobley : Helpful. Thank you, guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Hi guys, can you hear me? Michael Hsing : Yes. Its fine. Ross Seymore : Perfect. Well, first, I also want to welcome Gary to the call and thank him so much for being the one asking the inventory question\u2026 Michael Hsing : You still remember. Ross Seymore : I knew you would. So I had just one question, one follow-up. The question on the near-term first was, you talked a little bit about stabilization in your orders, but said they\u2019re still below normal. So any color on that? And then folding another near-term follow-on is the first quarter, you said it sounded like Storage and Computing would be flat and Enterprise Data would be up a bit. If you\u2019re flat overall, what\u2019s going down sequentially in the first quarter to get you to that? So that\u2019s kind of an aggregate first question. Bernie Blegen : So when we look at Q1, and obviously, we\u2019ve guided down about 2%, which is sort of consistent with seasonal trends. And it\u2019s \u2013 the industrial is likely to come down. And I may have left you with an incorrect impression because Enterprise Data is likely to go down even though GPU, AI will improve. And then on the plus side, the momentum in automotive continues to be very strong. Ross Seymore : In the stabilization color geographically by end market, the order stuff you said? Michael Hsing : Yes. We\u2019re seeing better activity. I think that we commented both in Q3 and repeated it here, that customers have gotten a lot more near-term focused and you can point to consumer, you can point China as being areas that was very observable. And right now, we\u2019re seeing a lot better activity but it hasn\u2019t necessarily translated into what I call a normalized ordering cover. Ross Seymore : Got it. Thanks for that. And I guess as my longer-term follow-up, a question I get a lot from investors is the really impressive growth you guys did in 2022, up about 50% round numbers. That\u2019s about 30% faster than the SIA defined analog category. And that delta is kind of 2x what you guys historically have done. And some people are concerned that that\u2019s just because of insufficient supply and competition and assume fungibility that you guys are just growing because other people can\u2019t, or some of your competitors had some product issues that they\u2019ll soon rectify. And so those tailwinds could turn into headwinds this year. I know you\u2019re not going to guide for the full year. But are you at all concerned about those two dynamics having kind of overinflated 2022 and turning into headwinds this year? Michael Hsing : Okay, tell those customer \u2013 tell those not customers, okay? Ross Seymore : Investors. Michael Hsing : Our investors, our customers choose to buy our stocks. And hey, we don\u2019t do it in the pay to pay, the me-too products. Everything is pretty much single source product. And our products a lot more programmable, a lot more versatile and gave me and our customer can configure those products. And of course, we\u2019ll take advantage of it, okay, in a shortage. Our customers can use our product in a multiple way, I mean, lot of them are software based. And announced and as you know, in the software side and I mean is a lot more stickier. And we will continue to use our technical strengths and to gain the market share and I mean headwinds, okay, for those people they don\u2019t believe that, okay. We have a hearing I mean that\u2019s fair, but our numbers delivered like our past number to show that. Ross Seymore : Thanks, guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Thanks and I\u2019ll add my congratulations, guys. If I could ask my first question, it\u2019s kind of a broad question on your module, just your overall module strategy. I mean, say, it doubles this year to sort of 10% or so of revenues. Bernie, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll correct me if that\u2019s all base there. But sort of what\u2019s the right contribution long-term? I mean, Michael, I mean, eventually, do you want sort of everything to move in that direction toward module, or is it weighted more to specific end markets, maybe a couple of them already. And I\u2019m curious if you can comment on the margin implications as module becomes a bigger contributor. I think in the past you said this a 5x type ASP multiplier. But again, please correct me. Bernie Blegen : So I\u2019ll give you the numbers correction and Michael will give you this strategic answer. Modules currently are about 5% of our business. Michael Hsing : Yes, and it has doubled. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Michael Hsing : In a double the year, year-over-year for the last two years. Three years or two years? Bernie Blegen : Yes, three. Michael Hsing : Three years. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Michael Hsing : Yes. And so it\u2019s a significant business now. I mean and eventually, yes, that\u2019s what all I want to see. And MPS all going to move into a new type of modules I mean in modules, power module has a bad connotation, I know that I mean lot of companies in a power module business and those are 30% gross margins and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the right word to use it, it is a power modules and like in place okay with, but that\u2019s not your old grandpa\u2019s, again, power modules. And again, this is very different. Our margin is above core average. And some of the solutions much, much higher. But \u2013 and we sell it was all well over $100 stuff, and that\u2019s kind of I see as a part of its hardware plus service and customers, the users, they don\u2019t need to know like how does \u2013 how to use the product or how to \u2013 you have to have a very deep knowledge how to design a power supply, okay. And they should use very simple solutions like what we provide. They don\u2019t need the headaches to design a power supply, I think that we\u2019re going to end up with MPS or without MPS will be that, okay, but MPS want to be a leader in that. Bernie Blegen : And I\u2019d like to go back to Rick\u2019s earlier question, I would say that back in the day, the single biggest ingredient as far as making a decision for design win had to do with the lowest cost. And I think that what our customers are seeing, particularly in the last three years is there are other value drivers consider as far as time to market how much design resource they want to be saved from having to do a total cost of ownership. And those are areas that we\u2019re able to meet our customers\u2019 demand as well, if not better than any other analog or power provider\u2026 Michael Hsing : Yes, as well to give you examples and okay, we build our own test equipment, semi equipment test equipment and all based on the MPS power modules. And if you buy those kind of power modules, they can selling well over $50. And so that in semi equipment market segments that\u2019s a perfect thought for that. And these are very high ASP and very much, much compact than on the current market. Rick Schafer : Okay. Thanks for that color. And it actually leads you to my next question. I appreciate all the color that and you guys have certainly discussed with the power isolation module. But just specific to the silicon carbide update, just it does \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019ll be sampling this year. Do we \u2013 should we expect any material contribution from silicon carbide this year? Or are we kind of looking at 2024? And Michael, I mean, we\u2019ve heard different numbers, but what is the addition of silicon carbide modules for traction inverter, et cetera? What does that do to your potential content per vehicle? Michael Hsing : Our trashing inverters and using silicon carbide, okay, it\u2019s not this year and maybe even if we will see it next year. Our silicon carbide devices, okay, we design our own \u2013 we develop our own, okay. And we want \u2013 we picked up some market segment that proves our products are reliable in the first. And that\u2019s the first step. To answer your questions, and this year, okay, and there\u2019s no large number of building in our revenue stream, yes, okay, and so we don\u2019t expect that, but that\u2019s just approved the technologies now. Rick Schafer : Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Bernie. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Someone beat me to the module question this time. So I\u2019ll focus in a little bit different direction in the past. I know a few quarters ago, you talked about a team that you hired to work in the converter area, which is something you\u2019re not really that known for, but I think this is also another being ASP and a big growth opportunity for Monolithic. Can you talk about your traction in converters so far and what you expect to come in the coming quarters? Michael Hsing : Yes. We can \u2013 are glad to ask the questions, okay, a couple of days ago, I saw an image and we received from our customers, and we use our customers, use our imaging for the X-ray machines and much better than their prior versions. And so when is \u2013 we sample other biotech companies and they are \u2013 our product is designed in and we will see the revenues probably a small revenue this year in the next years. This is a slow ramping products that get very high barriers. And the bottom line is we have the technologies, and we have the know-how to design a very high performance data converted. These are \u2013 is comparable if it\u2019s not better. And we will broaden the product portfolios and as we expand our teams and these take lot of efforts and a lot of investment. And so far, we built up a pretty good sizable teams. And now you will have \u2013 see more general product coming up in the next couple of quarters. William Stein : Thank you, Michael, appreciate that. Maybe one other, if I can. Something we haven\u2019t heard the company speak a whole lot about lately, and that\u2019s the e-commerce effort. Any update on how your traction is progressing there? Michael Hsing : E-commerce. Well, maybe it\u2019s not as fast as I want to be. And I said my expectation too high and I think it\u2019s better here is that we launched MPS now I mean, actually, I\u2019ll take back. I think it\u2019s not as \u2013 it\u2019s true, not I expect more, okay, but there\u2019s a lot of resistance. I mean \u2013 but our modules lot of module ramp-up. It\u2019s from e-commerce. And we \u2013 after last year, yes, after maybe 13 or 14 or 15 months ago, we launched MPS in a remote technical support. And that helped a lot. And especially our module side, again, help our customers can schedule a meeting online. And we can solve their \u2013 when they\u2019re logging we solve their technical issues. That helped a lot. And I think the most part of the ramp-up is from the MPS now from a website. But overall, all things and it will take time, okay? And you are talking about engineer change their behaviors, okay, how do you design the product and how you\u2019re purchasing the product. And I think as next 10, 12 years, even now in the next five to 10 years for the millenniums and to design a power supply and they want to do Google search rather than do the fundamental design like in the past 20 years ago, like the last 20 years. And so these are the products designed for that, okay, for easy plugging play use and easy to use and can buy from the Internet. William Stein : Okay, thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Chris Caso of Credit Suisse. Chris, your line is now open. Chris Caso : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. The question is about where lead times are right now and the degree of product shortages. With your inventory up now, has that helped to bring down lead times and alleviate some of the shortages? And if so, has that taken away perhaps some of the incentive for customers to place orders for a product they didn\u2019t \u2013 they don\u2019t need. What \u2013 it\u2019s obviously one of the things we worry about as we go through the cycle, interested in your view on that. Michael Hsing : I\u2019d agree that lead times have been coming down. They were up as long combined as much as 26 weeks or six months. And they\u2019re coming down more slowly than you think. So I don\u2019t know. Obviously, our customers have changed their ordering behavior. And if that could be attributed to the change in lead times or the fact that they have adequate inventory or that they\u2019re uncertain about with the next six months, I can\u2019t really say which is a driver in their decision. Chris Caso : Got it. Okay. As a follow-up, Michael, you mentioned in some earlier remarks, plans to be a little more aggressive on consumer business as you go through the year. So wondering if you could expand on those comments? Is that something just opportunistic this year, something that you see in the market is that just a function of the diversity of your business model where some other business is slow. So you can go find business elsewhere, if you could give us some more color on that, please. Michael Hsing : I think you made a very good comment. It is opportunistic, okay? Remember, we \u2013 how many years ago, we \u2013 years ago, let say and we have more than 50% of our MPS revenues is all from consumer. And these are five fast design cycles in fast revenues and cycles product and on opportunities. And we have the right product, right support and right price and you can move the needle quickly. And obviously, in contrary to the other industrial automotive cloud computing and these are much longer design cycles and they\u2019re kind of slowing down one segment to the other or relative in \u2013 it\u2019s not as \u2013 clearly, it\u2019s not as in the last couple of years. And the consumer is our opportunity again, and we know how to do it, okay? And we have the product and we have the price structures and not as high as all the other segments, and we will do that. Chris Caso : If I could just follow on that, does that imply when business improves elsewhere, we\u2019ve got a better macro and such some of the product cycles elsewhere with maybe higher margin opportunities develop that you sort of back away from some of that and come back to some of the other segments that have driven growth more recently. Michael Hsing : No, it\u2019s not. Okay, consumers is a \u2013 diversity is always our strategies. And last couple of years, we didn\u2019t grow because of capacity constraints, okay? And we sacrifice on the consumer side. Chris Caso : Got it. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Thanks, Chris. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you. I just wanted to come back to the data converter business. So you\u2019re obviously getting into the kitchen of 400-pound gorillas here and I think historically, it\u2019s been very difficult to crack into this market. You talked about the high barriers to entry. And other than the product being higher precision, I get that, but is there anything else about your business model that will allow MPS to be successful in this market? Michael Hsing : I think it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t know what is the business model. I think it\u2019s \u2013 I know this size takes time. And the market is large, a few competitors. All these, you said these are 800 pounds of gorilla, okay. We are well little highs going around \u2013 and we had to run fast. And it\u2019s just to take opportunities and okay, what presents the product and our customers. And they do have an eye on the different suppliers especially come from the last couple of years. And it\u2019s \u2013 we have a good hope, but we know it take a while. Tore Svanberg : That\u2019s fair. And just lastly, could you give us an update on the time line for the $3 billion and the $4 billion capacity that you\u2019re working on? Michael Hsing : Yes. As we said in next couple of years \u2013 next two years, and we\u2019re still on it. And we work with our suppliers and the gaming I just mentioned the consumer business, okay? And one of the reason is we do have obligations and to fill up these facts. And we\u2019ll be aggressive and getting all these \u2013 getting these orders, fill the capacities. And that\u2019s our gaming in the past. We repeatedly and do this \u2013 have done these kind of things in several cycles already. And this cycle, I don\u2019t see a difference from the last downturns. And \u2013 but \u2013 so for the capacity expansion, we\u2019re still intact in the game. We\u2019re not \u2013 we may slow down a little, so I mean, but we really have obligations with our fabs, okay? Tore Svanberg : Great. Thank you, again. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Great. Thanks for letting me take a quick or ask a quick follow up. Bernie, I just wanted to ask your sort of thoughts on gross margin. You guided to 58% at the mid-point. It looks like the Street consensus was probably 50 to 100 basis points higher than that through the year. So as you look at 2023, do you think March is sort of the bottom and margins can trend higher into the second half of the year? Or is this push in the ability to be opportunistic in the consumer segment likely to keep margins flattish in this 58% level through 2023. Bernie Blegen : Yes, I\u2019d probably look at it as being flattish for the remainder of 2023. And when you look at what\u2019s taken the margin down and while you\u2019re right, we\u2019re down 50 basis points. It\u2019s not a significant deflation from the rate that we\u2019ve been at trending at over the last two years. And it\u2019s really because we have the additional manufacturing capacity, lower revenue. And as we look at the next two quarters at least, the sales mix is not as desirable. Quinn Bolton : Understood. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Okay, just a quick follow-up on my side on the margin side as well. And this time on the OpEx side, you guys did a good job on the OpEx. I know you\u2019re putting litigation expense up into regular OpEx, which thank you for doing that. But just the trend in OpEx throughout the year last year grew maybe half the rate of what revenues did? How do we think about this year? Bernie Blegen : I think as Michael is expressed here between diversifying our supply chain and continuing to invest in R&D capabilities that we have some very real opportunities for additional investment that would show up in growing our operating expenses. Having said that, though, there is a fair amount of uncertainty as far as what the revenue outlook is, and we want to be good financial managers as we go through these market conditions. So I would expect that it\u2019s likely that operating expenses won\u2019t grow much more than 50%, 60% of revenue growth in the current year. Michael Hsing : Having said that, in the past, in the past two years, now we reached $2 billion companies and they all one point okay, whatever\u2026 Bernie Blegen : 1.8. Michael Hsing : Yes, 1.8, okay. I mean, our infrastructure hasn\u2019t really grown that much. In the last couple of years, and it\u2019s difficult to hire people and now we have a lot more breathing room, okay, this is the time to build up a company. Ross Seymore : Great. And I guess for a quick follow-up, I just wanted to revisit one of the questions that was asked, I think it was the very first question or close to the beginning on the storage and computing strength. I know you said notebook was better than you thought and the memory/storage was weaker, and those two kind of go the opposite direction in the first quarter then. But those markets in aggregate have been weak across the board for quite some time. So I\u2019m still a little surprised at the strength in the fourth quarter and the stability in the first. What would you attribute that to? Obviously, you\u2019re getting the orders, but are you guys taking share? Is it the Tier 1 penetration? Is it content? Just any more color on that because it\u2019s such a disconnect to the end market in general? Michael Hsing : I think I believe we gained some shares. Bernie Blegen : Absolutely. Michael Hsing : Yes. We gained some market shares. Ross Seymore : Great. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yes, we\u2019re a little bit aggressive on in summer low end market. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Ross Seymore : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Great.

Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 24, 2023, which is accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q1 2023 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Jen. MPS' first quarter revenue of $451.1 million came in about as expected, 19.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022 or 1.9% lower than revenue reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our results for the quarter were mixed with weaker quarter-to-quarter demand in our enterprise data and industrial markets, overshadowing improvements in consumer and automotive. Let's take a quick look at our first quarter 2023 revenue by market. First quarter 2023 consumer revenue of $63.4 million increased 19.5% from the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 revenue was down 20.8% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 14.8% of our first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 21.2 -- a 21.2% contribution in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 automotive revenue of $105.3 million increased $8.0 million or 8.2% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This sequential revenue increase was primarily due to continued acceptance of our highly integrated solutions for advanced driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and lighting applications. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 93.1% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 23.3% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.4% in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 Communications revenue of $67.9 million rose $3.6 million or 5.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflected a modest revenue improvement in 5G infrastructure. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 22.2% year-over-year. Communications revenue represented 15.1% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.7% in the first quarter of 2022. In our storage and computing market, first quarter 2023 revenue of $119.8 million was essentially flat with revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, as declining storage revenue was offset by higher notebook sales. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 24.1% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 26.6% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 25.6% in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 Industrial revenue of $47.5 million decreased $8.6 million or 15.3% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to lower security and power source revenue. First quarter 2023 Industrial revenue was down 2.2% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 10.5% of our first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 12.9% in the first quarter of 2022. In Enterprise Data, first quarter 2023 revenue of $47.2 million decreased $21.3 million or 31.1% from the fourth quarter of 2022 due to broad-based weakness in data center spending. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 10.9% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 10.5% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 11.2% in the first quarter of 2022.  I'd like to share some general business observations. During our 2 most recent earnings calls, we highlighted that customers were becoming more concerned with near-term business conditions and that ordering patterns might oscillate. This behavior continued through the first quarter of 2023. However, we do see order acceleration for products related to artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and power modules, and our customer engagement and design win momentum remains strong across all of our markets. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to invest in our operations to support long-term growth. In response to customer concerns, we are expanding and geographically diversifying both our global production, operations and our R&D activities.  In summary, we have strong customer engagement, design win momentum and are continuing to invest for the long term, even though timing of the revenue ramp from our customers remains uncertain. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 57.4% and 80 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 and 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was $124.3 million compared with $136.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  For the first quarter of 2023, non-GAAP gross margin was 57.7%, 80 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 and 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2022. This downward pressure on gross margin is expected to continue near term as we work through higher value inventory built up during the supply-demand imbalance following the pandemic. Our non-GAAP operating income was $164.1 million compared to $174.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $134.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $130.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.0 million up from $94.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the first quarter of 2023, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.1 million charge to cost of goods sold, was $37.0 million compared to $35.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Switching to the bottom line. First quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $109.8 million or $2.26 per fully diluted share compared with $119.1 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $146 million or $3.00 per fully diluted share compared with $154 million or $3.17 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2023 were $48.7 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $919.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to $739.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $218.8 million compared with operating cash flow of $52.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 capital spending totaled $8.9 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2023 at $184.3 million or 37 days of sales outstanding, up 1 day from 36 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.  Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2023 were $430.8 million, down from $447.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Days of inventory decreased to 204 days at the end of Q1 2023 compared with 212 days at the end of fourth quarter of 2022.  Comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 203 days at the end of the first quarter of 2023, from 212 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $430 million to $450 million. We also expect the following : GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.9% to 56.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.2% to 56.8%. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $132.5 million and $136.5 million. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $94.9 million to $96.9 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense. Total stock-based compensation expense of $38.8 million to $40.8 million, including approximately $1.2 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. Interest and other income is expected to range from $3.8 million to $4.2 million before foreign exchange gains or losses.  Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 48.6 million to 49.0 million shares. In conclusion, while we remain cautious about near-term business conditions, MPS will continue to focus on business development and investing in infrastructure as necessary to support our long-term growth. I'll now open the webinar up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore Svanberg : I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more, Bernie, on your comment about the business conditions. Because it sounds like the design win momentum is still very strong. The activity is very strong, but you also sort of added there was uncertainty in certain ramps. So maybe you could elaborate a little bit on that, especially when thinking about the second half which seems to be a period where the industry could potentially recover. Michael Hsing : Let me answer my -- Tore, let me ask first, okay. And -- so you look at all these industries, okay, we -- it's about servers computing, including industrial servers and AI product, that's about 10% of the MPS revenue. And we had a hyper -- we experienced this area really the -- all the entire companies experienced hyper growth, okay, in the last 2 or 3 years. And now the automotive to, again, we're about 23% of our business. Total together and where it's about a 30-some percent. In AI other than, okay -- across the board, other than AI and automotive and so far, still we experienced still very heavy demand.  Other than that, again, all these design win activities that happened in the last 4, 5 years, and they started to ramp last couple of years. And a lot of -- because the reason we have all the inventory, we have expanded capacities and we grow much faster than the average. And now to answer your question directly, the -- our customers, all these products during a ramp, they have a pause. And they don't know what's coming and the new product and they push out. And so we just cutting in the period, which is not bad to me. Because in the last 2 or 3 years, we -- we have been in this unsustainable growth and hyper growth. It's like a 30%, 40% year-over-year, and that will break the company.  And I'm glad to announce we're, okay, coming to -- back to the normal I mean, and we will ride this the global market uncertainties and we just adapt as in the past. Okay, Bernie, maybe you can add some more detail, okay. Bernie Blegen : And I think Michael has really laid out a very compelling case as far as the growth that we've experienced over the last 3 years, and also identifying that the automotive market remains solidly intact, but particularly in Enterprise Data with the exception of AI that we are seeing lag in ordering patterns there and general weakness in our other markets. So I think the thing to reinforce here is that the business model here remains intact. We've built MPS around sustainable growth over the long haul.  And right now, we're looking at a quarter where the end customer demand is not picking up as well as we might have anticipated a quarter or 2 quarters ago. But again, the business model is intact. Tore Svanberg : That's great perspective. And as my follow-up, you talked about gross margin coming down very moderately because of higher value inventory. Could you talk about how long you expect that to play out and even some ranges? I mean I assume maybe you'll get to, I don't know, 55%, 56% gross margin. But yes, any color you can give on the -- how long that lower gross margin would last? Bernie Blegen : Sure. And the good news here is that cycle times and pricing both in the fab, the assembly houses are coming down. And so we'll be able to participate in the lower cost after we burn down the inventory, which is currently at about 203, 204 days. So I would expect that we'll see a downward pressure on margins through Q2 and Q3, and then perhaps a moderation leveling in around Q4. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Go ahead, Michael. Michael Hsing : Yes. I might as well add, clearly, we see -- we go into a downturn situation and gave me and -- we don't know, I guess, some segment will grow in MPS because of very diverse companies and some area would be still good. And in general, the consumers and they get products and even some notebook may come back in the second year. And the point is I'll try to make is regarding to gross margins, and as you know in the past, when the industry starts to slow down, and again, MPS will be more aggressive in price. And to gain more consumer segment of the market because it can do 6 months later, when you turn the knob, we actively pursue those products 6 months later, those are fast design cycles, and you will turn the knob in the revenues in about 6 months' time.  So we care less about the short-term gross margins, but the long-term gross margins is still the same. So we emphasize and as you know, in the last 10 years or so, and we'll still pursue those models. And in the consumer segment, we may -- we made just a short -- focus on in the short term to grow the -- to maintain the growth. Operator : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Nathaniel Bolton : I guess I wanted to follow up on Tore's question. Really, Michael and Bernie, as you look into the second half of the year, that's normally a seasonally stronger period for the company. Obviously, it feels like there are lots of puts and takes, lots of uncertainty, customers delaying product ramps. But can you give us any sense how you're thinking about the second half of the year? Will you see sort of a normal seasonal uptick in September? Or are you thinking September could be flattish with kind of the 1Q, 2Q run rate? Any additional color would be helpful just to try to think about the second half. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think that right now, normal seasonality still applies, but in our case, it's a little more muted because so much of our growth in the business is attached to those new product introductions being made by our customers. So if we look in Enterprise Data in which our major customers or the products that we're supporting have had product delays. And when you look at other aspects of our business, for example, Communications, that's still what I'd refer to as lumpy. It's not necessarily trending in a seasonal pattern.  So I think that your comment is very balanced and all I'm tilting is to the new product introductions being delayed probably being a larger factor than just seasonality. Michael Hsing : Yes. I think we can't say really like a normal seasonality anymore. I mean we -- we experienced in the past. And you have some segments that grow really well. I mean some segments hit kind of a bottom that came last Q3, last year, Q4, especially like a notebook side. I mean now you see okay, it's a wakening up. I mean, MPS has won orders in design as those reference designs and we have the power -- the power solutions -- and we will see, second half, mostly all the other reservoir business, other than AI, automotive, we don't -- we have no clear views. And so that's the short term. Nathaniel Bolton : Understood. I wanted to follow up on the Enterprise Data segment. Obviously, a weaker result and sounds like some of the product or customer delays are sort of focused in that segment. Do you still think as the new server cycle ramps that you can get your share of the Vcore power management market towards 20 percentage? Is that still the right opportunity to be thinking about longer term, even if some of those customer programs have pushed out by somewhat? Michael Hsing : Absolutely. I confidently say that. I mean, because we see all these projects has not really fully ramped yet. In all the data centers, clearly, you guys know better, I mean now slowed down dramatically. I don't know whether they overexpanded last couple of years and now slowed, take a pause, okay? We don't have clear views. And what we know from last quarter to Q1 -- or Q4, Q1 to now, and they kind of slowed down. Bernie Blegen : And if I can add to that, again, using -- I know that you're focused right now on the short term as far as the second half of the year. But in the GPU space for artificial intelligence, we have a very senior market share position. And as we look ahead to even the next generation, we're in a very good position to take advantage of the next generation of GPUs. So we're really still in early stages as far as being able to leverage up our position and expand our share. Michael Hsing : Yes, yes. That's I didn't add that part. The GPU part came in the AI side, we have a current design win and as well as the next design, and the futures we will release end of the year or next year. And those were MPS product will ramp to this. Earlier, I referred to is that all these data centers, CPU powers or data center power overall, and we still have maybe just -- if it's not a single digit, just barely double-digit market shares. And a lot of -- and from a transition from a VR13 to 14, and it's not completed yet. We won a lot of design wins in VR14 and it will turn into revenues. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matthew Ramsay : Guys, I wanted to ask, I guess, a two part question on gross margin, and this is sort of -- you guys have been in -- gone from sort of 54, 55, 56 on that steady cadence of 10 to 20 basis points a quarter, and that was amazingly steady. And then during the period of supply-demand imbalance, we jumped up to 58 or so, and now we've come back in and you guys discussed that in the short term. But as you look out over the next 2, 3 years and you think about the strategy to be aggressive and grow, and contrast that to some of the opportunities that you have for new design wins and higher content, maybe you could level set us on the long-term gross margin. Has anything changed there? And where is the new normal?  And I guess the second part of that thought, guys, is, have you seen any specific price pressure in any markets as some of your competitors maybe get more supply? Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. Let me answer your last part first, okay. Any high volume, our customers have multiple suppliers, we -- they always have a price pressure, other than the last 2 or 3 years. Other than that, they couldn't ship, only the MPS came. Most of the companies have struggled in shipments and MPS, we have less. And so nowadays I mean all the higher volumes as we expected, and in the last couple of years, and I can also remember, we didn't talk that much. We introduced new technology, which is a much lower cost. And there will be a fight.  And so to answer that part of the question. But earlier, I said it, I care less about our gross margin lately, but we're still operating within the models. We're not dramatically go down. Clearly, it will go down. And but -- in a long-term model, to answer your question, 2 or 3 years out, the business -- MPS business is still pretty much intact. And we are focused on those high values. We transition from IC solutions to sell solutions. That still remains our focus. Our long-term business we will go that way and which generate and offers more values, and we have higher gross margins. Bernie Blegen : And I think just to polish off the comment there is that as far as our model, we've been operating over the last several years between 55% and approaching 60% as far as a non-GAAP gross margin. And as we introduce these higher-value products, they tend to have higher margins. And what that allows us to do is then manage the mix of business such that we stay within our model. So while we sort of anticipated in the near term downward pressure with a flattening here in the next 3 to 4 quarters, we'll continue to look to be opportunistic and managing gross margin to accelerate revenue growth. Matthew Ramsay : Got it. As my follow-up, and I apologize for this being a near-term question, but with all the different end market volatility. Bernie, if you could help us on your guidance by segment, just the revenue trends that you guys see into the June quarter, that would be great. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think that we said earlier in the call... Michael Hsing : It's fair to ask a short-term question because this is a very uncertain period. Bernie Blegen : So I think to sort of make a simple point on it is that automotive continues to be doing very well. And there, it's both the market itself as well as the share gains that we're enjoying. I said earlier that Communications is lumpy and the other areas, including Storage and Compute, Enterprise Data and Consumer and Industrial are sort of flattish for the near term. Michael Hsing : Well, also the storage -- in the AI segment in the -- in data center, if we -- the computing segment is maybe is flattish, okay? I mean I think the majority of our revenues has come from -- still come from servers. And you see it in the ramping in the last 18 months or so. In the AI and the total -- AI in the total revenues is still a smaller percentage. And the other thing I'm pointing out, there's a memory sections. I mean they're changing a new format, and they start to ramp now. This is the result that we're kind of flattish, okay? I mean it depends on how fast you ramp up to DDR5.  MPS has -- have engaged with all the major memory companies that we have a design. We have a -- we have design wins. And if they ramp up faster than we will -- we'll increase that portion of revenues. And it's depending on what the DDR5 will ramp up Matt. Operator : Our next question is going to be from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Richard Schafer : I appreciate all the color so far. Maybe if I could ask 1 on 48-volt before we go back on the AI for the question. I know you heard you say Michael or Bernie said it, I think you had said senior market share position there. I'm curious with your primary competitor in 48-volt apparently still struggling. I mean are we at a point now, if we look at 2023, where you guys think you'll likely stay sort of sole source sort of on H100 this year. And I'm just curious as part of that question. I heard you mention Content there. So is there any color you can give us around what Content does as we transition to sort of more powerful accelerators over time? I mean is it similar to what you guys have talked about with the move from VR13 to 14 on VCorPower, where you're talking about going from sort of $50 a or something like $70. And then finally, Michael, for you, I'm just really curious, are you -- who else are you seeing out there working on 48-volt power? This seems to be a pretty solid and growing market. Michael Hsing : Okay. Let me answer my part first, and I'll get in... Bernie Blegen : That's more fun part. Michael Hsing : On the landscape is okay, I truly okay, says we don't -- we see some competition in the game. I think our products remain the best so far. And so that's why we have -- and we do see some other competition, maybe as a generation of later that came in. As that market segment grows, and the competition will come. I mean the market is too big for MPS. And we welcome other people. And we welcome the cooperations. As a matter of fact, that's what we're doing and not, okay? And -- as MPS is not big enough for that market. And -- but we will be glad to be leaders. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And again, reinforcing Michael's point there is that it actually when we enjoy a leadership position, and we expect to continue to, competition is very important as far as driving technology improvements. As far as your other question as far as dollar content, when we look at the CPU market, generally, we denominate it with a dual processor, -- and so based on that, we're able to offer an expectation of what the average selling price will be per server.  With the model is still sorting itself out where you can have any number of configurations up to and including 8 GPU boards. So it's very -- it's a little harder to denominate what our dollar content is. And again, we're still in the early stages of watching this model ramp. So I think that we'll have enough experience in about 2 to 3 quarters to have a more accurate read on the dollar content, but it is much higher than what we're experiencing with CPUs. Richard Schafer : And for my follow-up, I'd love to ask you about 5G band. I know you guys have said in the past you're selling to the big 3 RAN equipment OEMs. I'm just curious how you would describe the ramp there in terms of content, in terms of share? And what I am trying to do is get a sense of how big 5G is now versus how big it could be for you guys. And to something you mentioned earlier, Bernie, I'm just really curious here, could the ramp in 5G sort of smooth some of that lumpiness you described in your comm segment? Bernie Blegen : Yes. If I was to draw a comparison of our experience with Enterprise Data where we started out with low dollar content and then graduated up the value chain including power management. We're probably about 3 to 4 years behind in the Communications market, where we're still focusing on low dollar content for like point of load knee fuse. Now where this is about to get very exciting is we are getting adoptions for later designs that include our power management for the processors.  So at this stage, we're sort of moving with the market. Again, as an early entrant. But yes, long term, I do think you're going to see a similar growth profile as what we expect to have with enterprise data. Michael Hsing : Yes, and immediately now, I keep saying MPS is a small company, but we're not nobody anymore. And we engage with all these customers -- these 5G makers and it's only a handful of a companies as speaking now. So we're in the process of signing on the contract now. And so all of these -- okay, and it's just a matter of time. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Can you hear me? Michael Hsing : We have a high inventory, yes. Ross Seymore : How about the channel inventory. We've heard a bunch of companies talk about the channel coming down, and that's a headwind to revenue growth. I know you guys proactively manage that. So you put it on your own balance sheet, but what's the channel looking like? Michael Hsing : It's also on the high side. Bernie Blegen : Yes. About 3 quarters ago, we saw an increase in channel inventories, and they've remained at about that same level. So there isn't any real new news as far as the sell-through characteristics. Ross Seymore : Is that something that's weighing against your revenue right now? Or are you comfortable running at that relatively higher level? Michael Hsing : No, we want to go lower and we want to lower and particularly in the first quarters and a lot of customer threatens and get much higher volumes, okay? That's why we shipped and now they have a break. And so as a result, inventory didn't decrease that much in the channel. Ross Seymore : So it went down on your books more so than in the channel? Bernie Blegen : Yes. The way to look at another aspect to this is that the inventory in the channel, it depends on what our end customers' lead times are. And as we even commented on in the prepared comments, we're seeing a very unusual demand pattern in that we have 3 areas where we're seeing an acceleration as far as the ordering pattern. But they're doing it with a very -- an expectation of having a very short lead time.  So as Michael said earlier, that the channel is built up in the anticipation that the customers were going to realize the sales gains with the new products, but as those have been pushed out, that's left us in this position. So we're going to continue to manage the channel as we always have. But right now, as I said, it's at an elevated level. Ross Seymore : Got it. And then 1 on the gross margin for you, Bernie. When you talked about the headwinds for it, we see this across the board. So I don't think it's anything particularly different for Monolithic. But the 1 thing you didn't mention was mix. I get that you're carrying higher cost inventory, and it takes a while to flush through. But as you go opportunistically, into the consumer market, is that rising as a percentage of sales, something that is also weighing against gross margins? And if so, when do you think that will kind of normalize as a percentage of sales, if not decrease? Michael Hsing : Yes, you can see as a normal because the consumer market hasn't happened yet. We reduced -- we downed to the big percentage now, okay? And mostly it's a high-value inventory. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William Stein : Regarding something you just spoke about a moment ago, you spoke about elevated inventory and push outs of projects. I think obsolescence risk is relatively small for Monolithic, but maybe you can reassure us on that matter. Bernie Blegen : Absolutely. Actually, a very helpful question. If you look at our history, we've never had a significant inventory write-off. And a lot of the reasons around that is that our products have long life in the market and long shelf life. So we're actually -- if you look back at 2019, we built up inventories, and we're able to capitalize when the market bounced back in '20 and particularly when the pandemic, infusion of capital occurred.  So we don't see inventory on our balance sheet as a negative. And in fact, when the markets do get more stabilized, particularly in Enterprise Data and in Storage and Computing, I think we're well positioned to take advantage of that uplift. William Stein : Great. And then like to sort of ask a double question about supply and your supply base. Other analog companies have talked about how their foundries are absolutely not cutting cost and they never see it happening, but you've highlighted this trend in your business. Is it because you're on more advanced nodes and so that's just how sort of pricing in that market works? And then maybe you could also comment on the manufacturing plan, both in terms of long-term capacity and geographic diversity. Michael Hsing : Yes. We -- you know that, okay, we advance our technology every 2 or 3 years. And we're relentlessly cutting the cost and utilize the better technologies, get better geometries. The fab now in the last 3 years, the fab costs is not lower, higher, as a matter of fact. But we utilized the geometries and also the new technology that we implement, we will be able to lower the cost.  And so the other -- the other question that you're making is a diversified manufacturing. So, we in -- we anticipated that, again, we announced that we have a new partnership outside of China. That's in Singapore. And we will continue to do so. But really outside, there's no U.S. manufacturing for our application, for our product. I mean, it's all resides in Asia, Korea, like Taiwan and Southeast Asia. And in all our module business, we can do it from our side outside of China. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this Q1 2023 earnings webinar. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which would likely be in July. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Genevieve Cunningham : Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 24, 2023, and our Form 10-Q filed on May 5, 2023, which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that outline the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our Q2 2023 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Gen. MPS reported second quarter revenue of $441.1 million, 2.2% lower than the first quarter of 2023 and 4.3% lower than the second quarter of 2022. Compared with Q1 2023, sales and communications were lower, while industrial, storage and computing, consumer and enterprise data improved sequentially. Turning now to our second quarter 2023 revenue by market. Storage and computing revenue of $124.5 million increased 3.9% from the first quarter of 2023. The sequential revenue improvement primarily reflected higher commercial notebook sales. Second quarter 2023 storage and computing revenue was up 1.8% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 28.2% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 26.5% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 industrial revenue of $49.7 million increased 4.8% from the first quarter of 2023, reflecting increased sales of products for power source and industrial meter applications. Second quarter 2023 industrial revenue was down 11.0% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 11.3% of our total second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 12.1% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter consumer revenue of $65.2 million increased 2.9% from the first quarter of 2023. The sequential quarterly revenue improvement reflected higher gaming, TV and mobile device sales. Second quarter 2023 consumer revenue was down 33.0% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 14.8% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 21.1% in the second quarter of 2022. In our enterprise data market, second quarter 2023 revenue of $48.0 million increased 1.7% from the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to initial shipments of new generation AI applications, which offset softer demand for CPU applications. Second quarter 2023 enterprise data revenue was down 26.4% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 10.9% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 14.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter automotive revenue of $104.4 million decreased 0.9% from the first quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2023 automotive revenue was up 71.1% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 23.6% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 13.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 communications revenue of $49.3 million was down 27.4% from the first quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower infrastructure sales. Second quarter 2023 communications revenue was down 16.9% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 11.2% of our total second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 12.9% in the second quarter of 2022. I'd like to make some general comments about our business. In our previous earning calls, we have noted customer ordering patterns could oscillate. This has turned out to be the case. We continue to see some orders getting delayed or amended by [pull-in] (ph) requests. This lack of short-term visibility has made forecasting beyond Q3 2023 more difficult. However, our business fundamentals remain unchanged. In the last few years, our revenue and customer base have expanded tremendously, particularly amongst Tier 1 accounts. We believe we've solidified our market share gains by delivering quality products and services. Additionally, we have a strong design win pipeline, which positions us well for future growth. Here are a few highlights -- here are a few of our recent highlights. We have been designated a preferred supplier with multiple Tier 1 customers in automotive and telecom markets. We have started sampling silicon carbide power solutions for data centers and green energy conversion. We are also continuing development for EV power management applications. We are continuing to broaden our customer base for AI applications and developing solutions for next-generation platforms. We have new design wins in battery management solutions and USB-PD for automotive, industrial and consumer applications. These will be major revenue drivers as we look ahead to 2024 and 2025. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 56.1%, 120 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 and 260 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was $112.3 million, compared to $124.3 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2023 was 56.5%, down 120 basis points from the gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to unfavorable variances and higher direct expenses. Our Q2 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $153.1 million, compared to $164.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $135.4 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared with $134.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.0 million, matching what was reported in the first quarter of 2023. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2023, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.1 million charged to cost of goods sold, was $38.0 million, compared with $37.0 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $99.5 million or $2.04 per fully diluted share, compared with $109.8 million or $2.26 per share in the first quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $137.5 million or $2.82 per fully diluted share, compared with $146.0 million or $3.00 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2023 were 48.8 million. Now, let's look at balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $941.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023, compared to $919.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $90.2 million, compared with Q1 2023 operating cash flow of $218.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2023 at $169.2 million, representing 35 days of sales outstanding, which was two days lower than the 37 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2023 were $427.4 million, down from the $430.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Days of inventory of 201 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023 were three days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 184 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023 from 203 days at the end of the first quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $464 million to $484 million; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.7% to 56.3%; total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $33.5 million to $35.5 million, including approximately $1.0 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP operating expenses between $129.4 million and $133.4 million; non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $96.9 million to $98.9 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense; interest and other income in the range of $3.0 million to $3.4 million before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares in the range of 48.6 million to 49.0 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to execute our long-term strategy. I will now open the webinar for questions. A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. Analyst, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please click on the Participants icon on the menu bar and then click the Raise Hand button. Our first question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Thanks for letting me ask a question. Just wanted to ask Bernie first, when you had your general business condition update about orders remaining volatile, et cetera, I wonder if you could just give us a little more color. Are things kind of improving, staying the same? And is there any changes in things like competitive intensity, pricing, geographic differences? Any color, a little bit more detail than what you gave on your original preamble? Bernie Blegen : Sure, I'd be glad to help out with that. So, I think that we started that part of the conversation by acknowledging that in each of the last -- the prior three quarters that we believe that ordering patterns would oscillate. And that's pretty consistent when you're coming off of a period where there'd been an extra normal level of ordering that created a demand supply imbalance that afterwards, you're sort of draining your backlog as you are watching your customers try to align around what they're guessing is end customer demand. So, as a result of that, we have not had the same level of visibility out past 90 to 120 days that we would have during the more normal ordering pattern. And so, as a result of that, we don't have the same level of predictability. On the second half of your question, the one thing that remains consistent, whether it's under normal conditions or whether it's today, is we've always been in a very competitive marketplace. And, obviously, price downs are the norm and that we have competitors like ourselves that are trying to go after as much incremental business during this transitory period as is possible. Michael Hsing : Let me add, too. We do see a slight improvement in first quarters, and essentially, it's similar. And we do see the consumer business improvement and -- from both -- from U.S. [side] (ph) to Asia side, and other ones, pretty much stay the same. Ross Seymore : Great. Thanks for that. I guess as my follow-up, Bernie, you guys have had relatively volatile end markets, not specific to you, but just in a general sense. So, any sort of color in your guide for the third quarter between the various end markets? And the one I think most people are most interested in albeit still a relatively smaller part of your business is your enterprise data segment. Any sort of color between the AI side, you talked about last for the second quarter, and the CPU side, which has been a little bit weaker? Michael Hsing : Yes, you already answered your -- all your questions there. We don't see -- we are -- all the products relate to -- with the AI, like, we cannot ship enough now. And the other ones -- other part of enterprise data, it's like data centers, CPU powers, and these are still delayed. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. And one other thing to add, and this is specific to MPS, not necessarily a broader comment at the general market, but automotive came in a little bit lower than would have been expected. And as we look at the ramp in the second half, we're observing that at least for two of our customers, unit volumes appear to be lower, and we had two product launches which have been delayed into Q4 and to Q1. Ross Seymore : Thanks, guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, Michael and Bernie. I just wanted to ask on the GPU side of the business. There's been recent chatter in the market that one of your large customers maybe bringing in Renesas as a second source as well as potentially Vicor. Just wondering if you might share any thoughts you have as you look forward with that customer about the impact of multi-sourcing with that customer? And maybe a related question, how are you feeling about your position looking into the next generation 3-nanometer processor at that customer? And then, I've got a follow-up. Thanks. Michael Hsing : Okay. I think, so far, we're in the lead position. And I can't -- we are engaged deeply in the future design, and develop a new product for the second generations for the other -- next generations. And so, other than that, we can't speculate any things, okay? Bernie Blegen : I think in most scenarios and this particular customer's representative is they want to take a leadership position through innovation, and they found us an equal partner for that. But it's in everybody's best interest that it'd be a competitive, not a single source. And so, yes, we'd always anticipated that there would be redesigns that allow competition into the market. Michael Hsing : Either as a -- we had to provide the best solution, and at the same time, we understand that our customers require other solutions. This is a very large market. There's no means an MPS can supply everything. And, also, MPS is always -- we emphasize diversified growth. And if there's a performance need, I believe the MPS is the best solution now for the near future. Quinn Bolton : Thank you, Michael. Bernie, you'd mentioned sort of visibility out beyond 90 to 120 days is pretty choppy at this point just given the industry dynamics. I guess I look out to the fourth quarter, and it looks like the Street has modeled the fourth quarter approximately flat, which I think is an above seasonal pattern for MPS historically. And I'm just wondering can you comment whether you think an above seasonal fourth quarter looks right to you, perhaps given the ramp in the GPU business and some of the timing shifts you just mentioned in automotive? Or do you think it would be best for investors to think that the December quarter is going to see a -- sort of a seasonal decline in the December quarter? Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. I think that normal seasonality for MPS would be somewhere between a sequential decline of between 4 percentage points and 5 percentage points. And I can point to the increase in the notebook sales during Q3, which precedes Christmas, so that's a normal seasonal factor that's expected to come down. And we're not seeing the uplift that had been anticipated from automotive. So, I would be more comfortable with a seasonal down in Q4. Michael Hsing : Well, it's a -- you mentioned as a seasonality -- well, we're talking about seasonality, and I try to figure out what is seasonality now. And last year, we -- last couple of years, we have a very strong Q4, at least the year before that. And the customers see all those shortages, and now the demand is -- clearly is much less. And so, you have a -- we experienced, like, a year-over-year, so like a -- in the last couple years, like, over 40%. And this year, and it clearly is not as much, okay? I mean, much less. And I can't really call it seasonality anymore. So, just as I said, it's not very clear. But as Bernie said, usually in a seasonality, we're lowered. Quinn Bolton : Understood. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Bernie. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Thanks. Yeah, guys, I just had a couple questions if I could. The first one is a -- if I could kind of maybe revisit auto for a second. I mean, you mentioned power isolation module in your prepared remarks. And I don't know if you could give us a little bit more color there. Like, kind of an update on how many customers are evaluating the product now? Talk a little bit about if you could, like, design win timing, revenue timing, kind of expectation there? And is auto going to be the first to ramp and then data center and then more of the green stuff? Or how does it all kind of shake out, I guess, is what I'm asking. Michael Hsing : Yeah, that [we saw] (ph) delay a little bit, but we will reintroduce to resampling and announce, and it was a delay due to the technical issues. And so, as speaking right now, we have resampled it. And mostly, it's in automotive and also data centers. And same as we mentioned earlier, the silicon carbides and -- these are product that we'll start to sample. Rick Schafer : Okay. Thanks, Michael. And then, second question is you guys have almost $2 billion power management business now. And I think modules are on track to be 10% of that or so this year. And I think that's up from basically nothing just a couple of years ago. So, if this business sort of has, I believe, and Bernie, I'm sure correct me, in lighter better margins, I think, the core average, I think it's a 5x ASP multiplier. I'm just trying to get a sense of -- Michael, how big do you envision this business becoming as a percent of mix going forward? And are there any particular end markets that are going to be favored, at least initially, by the move into modules? Thanks. Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. I believe that's our future. And when customers want to have a plug-in-play solutions and they want a less technically involved with power management, and that's -- module solution is the way to go. People doesn't want to buy ICs, design all of -- all these up -- the component. And, initially, that's where we're ramping a lot of them in the auto business, in the industrials, that can be an industrial site, and as well as a telecom, and -- or even semi equipment. And a lot of -- I can give -- go on and on, like, a lot of things to be mentioned. But most of all these products is not price sensitive, and they're not volume consumer-related product. And so, this is still at the very beginning. We have all these customer base, and we have all the new product coming out, and we'll see the similar growth rate in next few years. Rick Schafer : Got it. Thanks, Michael. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Jeremy Kwan of Stifel. Jeremy, your line is now open. Jeremy Kwan : Thank you. Yes, this is Jeremy on for Tore. I guess maybe a first question on the comms business. It was down meaningfully as you guys expected, and we're probably one of the early ones to call out last quarter. I guess what's your sense of where things are now? Should we expect this business to kind of sort of bounce along at these levels in the second half before maybe picking up next year? And what are your customers telling you in terms of their expectations? Michael Hsing : Yeah, as you see, we didn't participate at 4Gs. And 5Gs and other infrastructure business, all new to us. And so, you know that 5G hasn't really ramped up quickly yet. But our products in -- were designed in last few years, we're just waiting for our customers to give us orders. And so far, it's not clear. Okay. Next question? Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Hey. There we go. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I'm hoping you can talk to us about channel inventory. When we look at your P&L, you had nearly 50% revenue growth last year. I think there's a lot of -- there's a pretty strong sense among investors that there might be some inventory still in the channel to be worked through. We'd love to hear any update or any measurement you have of that? Bernie Blegen : Sure. So, as far as what we observed in Q2 is that there was a meaningful decrease in channel inventories both in terms of dollars and days. And the sort of phenomena that we've seen has been a time delay between when the end customer places an order and when they want to do a pullback because of uncertainty with what end customer demand has been. So, I can point to a couple of our end markets where that was very clear. But we believe right now that we're in a position to continue to bring -- to normalize channel inventories over the next two quarters. William Stein : So, not normalized yet, so -- is what it sounds like. So, in the September for guidance, I assume there's some expectation that sell-in will be lower than sell-through. Is that fair? Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Again, going back to the comments about the visibility and predictability out past 90 or 120 days, that's not just the demand that -- the new net orders that we're receiving, but also the strength of the sell-through is also a little harder to predict. William Stein : Great. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cohen. Matt, your line is now open. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much. Michael, Bernie, can you guys hear me okay? Michael Hsing : Yes. Matt Ramsay : Awesome. So, I guess for my first question, Michael, we've -- you and I've had some conversations about the company strategically wanting to sort of rebuild the consumer business as a percentage of revenue over time and get it back to a higher level than it's been now. I guess I'd like to revisit some of those conversations and just see if you had any comments about how you feel about supply, the demand environment, and the competitive environment in order to try to push to sort of reemphasize your company and certain parts strategically of that consumer segment. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yeah. So, that's a good question. So, now we see some improvement, but this is at the beginning. And, as we see our supply, the cost went down dramatically, and as Bernie said, our inventory values even -- I mean, it will reflect inventory value now. And so, in the past, MPS is named in the price killers. It's a very simple game. We don't mind, and we don't buy in that consumer segments and we have a fight. And all the high gross margins is on the other segments. And it's all because they share our technology strengths. We provide a much better, a much smaller size. And in a consumer segment, in the last couple of years, we neglected that, and -- because we don't have enough revenues -- or enough capacities. And so, it's not that difficult to go back to the same games that we played since IPOed. Matt Ramsay : Thanks, Michael. I think as my follow-up question, I wanted to really focus on the enterprise data segment just because that's where a large percentage of my investor questions come from. And I think there's two dynamics going on here, right, the strength of the AI business with your lead customer there, and some softness in the CPU market that's well documented. And so, the question is really what would you guys, I think, have built on books inventory to support ramps of all the customers in that space? So, I guess the question is, how quickly and what would the lead times be to respond to an uptick in demand? And do you have any visibility into the timing of a potential reacceleration of that segment? And how long is that visibility? Thanks. Michael Hsing : Our visibility is okay, probably is well documented. If you're listening to all these major AIs, [probably you will see] (ph) MPS. And you will see that MPS in the next few quarters of a potential. And -- but I can talk to you about technical issues. I think that the MPS is so far the solutions is far better than our competitor. So, we -- in a -- for the next generation of our AI processor, we're not working on now, we're working a year ago, even 18 months ago. And -- so the relationship is a strong and, also, for the technical reason, even more challenging. And the space is critical, and you had to radiate all the heat out. And for the next generation, power even higher. And so, we provide all these vertical solutions, and we pioneer with it. And all the other solution had to fit into the form in a form factors. And the integrated solution is the only way to go. Bernie Blegen : And I think if I could just add to that, it's also the breadth of the customer opportunities that we're engaged with. And over the course of the next four quarters, we're going to see multiple new customer applications launch initially with MPS. So, yes, we have a very powerful initial position with one customer, but we expect to branch that out very quickly. Michael Hsing : It was multiple customers. Bernie Blegen : Multiple customers. Matt Ramsay : Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt. Hans, your line is now open. Our next question is from Jeremy Kwan of Stifel. Jeremy, your line is now open. Jeremy Kwan : Yes. Hi. Thank you for allowing me a follow-up here. I guess, I wanted to ask about capacity. You guys have always been very ahead of curve on long-term capacity and through up and down cycles. I was wondering how you're thinking about it in this environment and whether or not that may give you guys a competitive advantage in some of these applications that you're really targeting? And, also, if you have a CapEx number for this quarter? Thank you. Michael Hsing : Yeah. As we stated it earlier, many of our customers requested move out of China. And now we kind of achieved more than 50%. We can have more than 50% of our capability out of China. And so, the overall capacities, we don't have it. Problem now is, we have more inventories, and we want to sell more from our inventory. And -- does that answer your questions? Bernie Blegen : Yeah. And I think that when you look at capacity today, it's really when this environment turns around and becomes more predictable, how are we positioned to service our customers a year and two years from now. And I think the investments that we're making, both in terms of expanding capacity and diversifying it geographically, both on the front-end and the back-end will pay very good dividends as far as customer satisfaction. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open. Chris Caso : Yes. Thank you. Good evening. First question is regarding order visibility. And I ask because for the past several quarters, there really hasn't been any requirement for turns business going forward. Is that something that's changing going forward, given some of the changes in the end markets? And what does that mean with regard to revenue visibility as we look out at over the next few quarters? Bernie Blegen : Sure. I think that Michael responded to this pretty nicely in that we saw some improvement in Q2 from Q1 as far as our net bookings, but it's still not to the degree that we historically enjoyed in either 2018 or 2020, just to pick two more recent years. In the past, we would have up to 90%, 95% of our next quarter's revenue in hand at the end of the preceding quarter. And so, you're only relying on a fraction of a percent in order to -- of turns business in order to accomplish the numbers for that particular quarter. So, we're seeing steady improvement, but we're still not at the level yet where we have that predictability. Chris Caso : Got it. Thank you. As a follow-up, I just had a follow-up question about supply, and I understand that that supply is getting a bit easier out there. Historically, I think your ability to procure supply from places different from your competitor has been a source of competitive advantage for Monolithic Power. How do you see the landscape going forward? I know you bringing on some different foundry partners as you try to diversify outside of China. What do you think that means for both your access to wafers over the long term as well as the pricing? Do you think that competitive advantage remains? Michael Hsing : Well, you're mentioning of pricing, of course, all these material costs is a much lower than -- or go back to normal, I should say, to -- as pre-pandemic. And so, in terms of a capacities, look, I didn't mention earlier, we want to expand out of China, that's from our customers' request. And the other one is we want to expand it because just for our next couple of years' growth. And mostly, we we're still in a -- follow our long-term plan, and we invest, of course, now which will slow down a little bit in the next few quarters, and -- but over the long term, so we should spin -- we should continue the course. Chris Caso : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : If there are any follow-up questions, please click the Raise Hand button. As there are no further questions, I would like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Thanks again, Gen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar, and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you, and have a nice day.",

In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our latest SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q, which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that outline the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our Q3 2023 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Gen. MPS reported third quarter revenue of $474.9 million, 7.6% higher than the second quarter of 2023 and 4.1% lower than third quarter of 2022. Compared with Q2 2023, sales in enterprise data and storage and computing improved sequentially, while automotive, industrial and communications revenue was lower. Turning now to our third quarter 2023 revenue by market. In our enterprise data market, third quarter 2023 revenue of $98.9 million increased 106.2% from the second quarter of 2023 with sequential growth in both GPU and CPU program sales. Third quarter 2023 enterprise data revenue was up 31.4% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 20.8% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 15.2% in the third quarter of 2022. Storage and computing revenue of $129.5 million increased 3.9% from the second quarter of 2023. The sequential revenue improvement primarily reflected higher sales in commercial notebooks. Third quarter 2023 storage and computing revenue was up 14.7% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 27.3% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 22.8% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter consumer revenue of $62.4 million decreased 4.3% from the second quarter of 2023 as higher gaming and monitor sales were offset by declines in TV and home appliance revenue. Third quarter 2023 consumer revenue was down 30.1% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 13.1% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 18.0% in third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 communications revenue of $46.8 million was down 5.1% from the second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower infrastructure sales. Third quarter 2023 communications revenue was down 35.3% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 9.9% of our total third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.6% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter automotive revenue of $95.2 million decreased 8.8% from the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower ADAS and digital cockpit sales. Third quarter 2023 revenue was up 9.3% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 20.0% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 17.5% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 industrial revenue of $42.1 million decreased 15.3% from the second quarter of 2023 due to lower sales in security and industrial meter applications. Third quarter 2023 revenue was down 28.2% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 8.9% of our total third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 11.9% in the third quarter of 2022. I'd like to make some general comments about our business. In our previous earnings calls, we have noted customer ordering patterns were oscillating within the overall market. This environment persisted through Q3. We continue to see some orders getting delayed or amended by pull-in requests. This lack of short-term visibility continues to make forecasting beyond the next quarter difficult. However, as we said in our last call, our business fundamentals remain unchanged. Our design win pipeline and customer base expanded tremendously, particularly amongst Tier 1 accounts. Additionally, we continue to innovate and have a strong design win pipeline position us well for future growth. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, 60 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2023 and 320 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was approximately $135.6 million compared to $112.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2023 was 55.7%, down 80 basis points from the gross margin reported for the second quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to an unfavorable product mix. Our non-GAAP operating income was $167.8 million compared to $153.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2023. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $128 million in third quarter of 2023 compared with $135.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2023 operating expenses were approximately $96.6 million, essentially flat with what we saw in each of the first two quarters of 2023. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2023, stock compensation expense, including approximately $1 million charged cost of goods sold, was $33.6 million compared with $38 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023. Switching to bottom line. Third quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $121.2 million or $2.48 per fully diluted share compared with $99.5 million or $2.04 per share in the second quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $150.3 million or $3.08 per fully diluted share compared with $137.5 million, or $2.82 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2023 were $48.8 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $1.04 billion at the end of third quarter 2023 compared with $941.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $175.9 million compared with Q2 2023 operating cash flow of $90.2 million. Accounts receivable ended the quarter of 2023 at $185.8 million, representing 36 days of sales outstanding, which was one-day higher than the 35 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2023 were $397.3 million, down from $427.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Days of inventory of 171 days came in at the end of the third quarter of 2023 were 30 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Comparing current inventory levels with following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 180 days at the end of the third quarter of 2023 from 184 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $442 million to $462 million. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 55.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56%. Total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $32.2 million to $34.2 million, including approximately $1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating expenses between $127.1 million to $131.1 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $95.9 million to $97.9 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense but includes litigation expense. Interest and other income in the range from $4.1 million to $4.5 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares in the range of 48.7 million to 49.1 million shares. We are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a share buyback program for up to $640 million over the next 3 years with the goal of offsetting future dilution. In conclusion, while we expect visibility to remain limited in the short term, which was the same as last quarter, we continue to execute on the long-term strategy. I will now open the webinar up for questions. A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Management Instructions] Our first question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hi. Michael and Bernie, congratulations on the results and the outlook in a tough market. I guess, Bernie, Michael, the enterprise data business is very strong quarter-on-quarter. Wondering if you could just give us some thoughts as you look into next year, how you see the GPU business. And specifically, do you see sort of expansion of that customer list driving strength in GPUs? And then a question on CPU. You said CPU was up in the third quarter. Wondering if you're finally starting to see some strength in the Sapphire Rapids and Genoa side of that business? And then I have a follow-up question. Thank you. Michael Hsing : At this time, Quinn, as Bernie said earlier, these markets are very much oscillating and that came in the net, you see it. We done from this quarter. So from last year, year-to-year, we're still down. But AI, as these are power modules and as we're ramping up as a result of -- can maintain growth over in these years and still a slight growth from the last years. That's mainly due to AI. And also in the prior quarters in the autos that we see as a very lumpy business, as lumpy for ADAS ramping up. But all of these, we believe that will happen in ramping up in the next year, not only from ADAS. And also, as you mentioned about on the general CPU and in the server side. And I might as well as mention all the other ones. We still have a lot of greenfield products that haven't really ramped up yet. And many, many projects gets delayed in this year pushing to next year. And we don't want to give a very clear forecast that we still don't know yet. But sometime in the next years, we believe that they will start ramping up and all these greenfield products. So that's kind of my summary for the near-term business. Quinn Bolton : Thank you, Michael. I guess a follow-up question. Bernie, I think in the script, you mentioned some pushouts, some pull-ins or expedites. I think the pull-ins or expedites maybe newer given just the overall challenging industry. Were the pull-ins specific to certain customers or end markets or are you starting to see pull-in requests across multiple end markets? Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Quinn. I think what we're experiencing here is a unique business cycle and that right now, our end customers are unwilling to commit beyond a fairly lower window of expecting lead times within under 10 weeks for delivery. So that makes, as we said earlier in the comments, the predictability really hard to call right now. But I think, as Michael just said, that when we look at our design win pipeline, it's strong. And we're confident that we're in a good position to capture share and growth as the market recovers. But right now, we're still in a level of unpredictability. Michael Hsing : He's talking about which segments. Bernie Blegen : Oh, I'm sorry. Which segments? Michael Hsing : Yes, which segments. We look at it kind of a rough surveys. Like it's actually across the entire product segment, including consumers. Some of the products, they need and pull-it in very quick. As Bernie said, the lead time is very, very short. And we don't have those products, it's pretty much across the board. And other than AI, we really planned ahead, and we really plan ahead from the beginning of the year. And we can anticipate all the ramp-up even for the next few quarters. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you, Michael, Bernie. Congratulations on that $1 billion cash balance. First question is on the Q4 outlook. I know you typically don't guide by segment, but can you just talk about directionally where you expect each segment to trend in Q4? Michael Hsing : Yes. Q4 is still down quite a bit from Q3 and pretty much everything except maybe not auto. I mean all the public sideways are maybe is slightly up and also that AI power still continuously ramp up. Bernie Blegen : Yes. I think that when you look at the broader market, we're experiencing a lot of the weakness in demand that many of our peer companies are. And what makes us differentiated is the AI boost we're experiencing. Michael Hsing : And pretty much AI and auto and everything else is pretty much muted, yes. Tore Svanberg : Very good. And as my follow-up and maybe related to the previous question on enterprise data and AI, just wondering if you have any visibility on the sustainable growth here. There's obviously one big partner that's ramping right now, but it looks like there's some other processor companies that are going to be catching up next year. So if you could give us any color on, especially enterprise data segment for 2024, that would be really helpful. Michael Hsing : I can tell you, overall, how the MPS strategies. Like the MPS strategy always get the best -- which provides the best performance. When the volume gets higher and requirement is lower, we don't chase those low-end segment. I see MPS is still in the forefront in terms of best efficiencies and the lowest generate heat in smallest areas. We are still the leading -- would be next year and the year after, all these products are eyeing in development with our customers and with the leading-edge -- leading providers in AI GPUs specifically. And that's a huge market, and we don't want to take all of them. And to your other part of the question is the general market. In general market, in other segments, we view CPUs. And you'll remember in the VR13, we didn't have a lot of design wins. But we put up a lot of inventories in the VR13.5, it became a serendipity. And again, we have a few project design win and other supply -- but we ship a lot. So that's where you see the server data center growth. That's because of that. And for next years, we were told to get ready to have those projects ramping up in a rapid supply, let's call it. And so when these markets are already ramping up, MPS are there. Bernie Blegen : I think, Tore, you hit on a couple of very good points that as far as the AI GPU opportunity, we're very well positioned both for the near term, in 2024, but more importantly, longer term. And as Michael just emphasized, there is a differentiated market there and we want to stay at the high end of that market. So we've always been aware that there would be competitors entering this space and that's how we're differentiating ourself. And then as far as the CPU and GPU markets what we're preparing to do is to manage the uptick in demand that we're anticipating by building that inventory during the next couple of quarters. Michael Hsing : Oh, yes. That's what I forgot, while I tried to make a point. And MPS doesn't want to be known as AI power company. We want to focus on the diversified growth. And we do have a lot of greenfield products still haven't realized yet. These are across the segment. And also in the consumer side, in the last years, okay, because last couple of years because the shortages we kind of neglect it. And that will -- in the last half years, we developed a low-cost product and we introduced the market where you'll see the growth. That's only on the -- because of very short design cycle, you will see revenue from next year. And all the other product like industrials, automotive, in tracking inverters, in chargers and also ADAS, these were ramping up. And so we want to achieve very diversified growth, not only on the AI side. Tore Svanberg : Great color. Good job with the buyback. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys, can you hear me? Michael Hsing : Yes. Hi, Ross. Ross Seymore : Hi, there guys. So I guess the question I have is, I don't know cyclicality or seasonality is carrying the day. But the last couple of quarters, you've talked about weakness. You're not unique in that. But the fourth quarter, you seem to be guiding pretty much back to a seasonal drop. If I look into the first quarter, is that something that you expect to continue, or is visibility just too limited to really comment on that quite yet. Michael Hsing : Yes. Well, the numbers kind of reflected seasonal, but the reality is it just happened that way, we can't call it seasonal. This is a fast-changing market, I mean, it's very difficult for us to forecast. That's difficult. Unfortunately, we have a lot of capacities. But these capacity were still the lead time still shorter than our production cycle and we have to get ready just that. Bernie Blegen : Ross, you bring up a really good point is that if we look at the outlook for Q4, a portion of that is how competitive we were at going after the notebook market. And so the Q4, we're experiencing a little bit of a decline as those are seasonal sales. When we look at Q1, Michael said it best, there isn't a lot of visibility. But as we look at this cycle, we believe that next year is really back half-weighted. And so I would probably indicate that we'll have a more conservative profile as we look at the first half of 2024. Michael Hsing : Yes. Also, I forgot to mention about it. And we talked about beginning of the year, we'll be aggressive on price and especially within the course of board. And then we have a new product in the consumer segment come out -- already came out. And also in a notebook area, we pretty much have a large market share in the commercial side. In the beginning of the year, we were very starting -- become very aggressive on the price. And now, fourth quarter, you see it in our notebook side start to gain more shares in the consumer side. Ross Seymore : Got it. Thanks for that. And my one follow-up, I want to just pivot over to the gross margin side of things. You mentioned, Bernie, in your script that you're at the low end of your guidance because of mix. I was a little surprised that enterprise data more than doubled sequentially, but yet you pointed to mix. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on? What mix were you referring to because I think, whether correctly or incorrectly, at least I assume that enterprise data would be an accretive gross margin category. Michael Hsing : Sure. Well, consumer notebook, margins are very low. But it's an easier money to be made. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Michael is exactly right, is that we have been aggressive on pricing across the board. And while that isn't called out specifically as a contributing factor to the lower gross margin, it is reflected in the overall mix, notwithstanding the impact of the GPU and AI business. Ross Seymore : And has that pricing dynamic, is that starting to kind of normalize from here? Or is that an incremental headwind that we should consider going forward? Bernie Blegen : I believe that as the market begins to stabilize, that will return to a more normal profile as far as pricing. Again, a very specific point to make here is that most of our customers are attracted and we secured design wins because of our innovation as opposed to pricing alone. So I believe that as the market stabilizes sometime in 2024 that we'll probably return to a more normal pricing environment as well. Michael Hsing : Yes. You said product mix, right? But also, there's other capacities, and capacity utilizations in [indiscernible] and also add a lot of capacity cost for us. So it's a mix of all of them, not only the product mix. Ross Seymore : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Hey, guys. Let me add my congratulations. If I could follow up, just one more question on enterprise data. You mentioned your greenfield product lineup for next year, I think, a couple of times on call. And one of those really stands out is the silicon carbide power isolation module you guys are working on. And I know that's for a couple of different end markets. I was hoping you could give some color around the sort of engagements you're seeing right now with the CSPs, so in data center, maybe a sense of timing of when those initial revenues would start showing up in the model. And my bigger question is really, do you view sort of power isolation module as a TAM expander for your existing enterprise data franchise? Thanks. Michael Hsing : Let me answer your first for silicon cover. Thanks for reminding me this. I almost forgot. Yes, we released the product. And first revenue, we'll see sometime in the next years, would be in the solar inverters. And the green energies had a lot of demand, we have got products we designed for those -- that market segment and will start to ramp and also in automotive. And these are not specifically for tracking inverter for these drivers. We do power management. And we will see those products designed and ramping up much later. I mean these are clearly in the dip -- there's a void in the market. No other company produces that kind of a product, and it became very unique. And so I have a very good confidence in the second half of next year, the year after. We will see a lot of new revenue coming from that segment. And what's the second questions, second part of the -- Rick Schafer : Yes. Within CSP, the full rack power that I know you guys have discussed. Is there any color you could give around how you view that? Is that sort of a TAM expander for your enterprise data segment? I'm sorry, the hyperscalers? Michael Hsing : Oh, the hyperscaler. Hyperscaler is now -- you guys know better than we do. We just only provide the power. So I can mean that, for the CPU side, GPU side, as we said earlier, VR14, we expect to have bigger shares. And if you refer to silicon carbide in that we will develop those products. Those are power supplies. And again, these are plug-and-play power supply, and these are large modules. And that will ramp up -- I don't have a time frame. Probably is towards the very end of the next year, the 2025. Rick Schafer : Okay. Thanks a lot for that color, Michael. And I guess, maybe if I could try one more slide that Ross question on gross margin. I don't know, Bernie, if you could give us any kind of rule of thumb. And I understand it's a mix issue and I hear everything you're saying about the current pricing environment. But as we look the thing sort of normalizing, say, in the second half next year, say you get back to your $2 billion or better kind of run rate, I mean, should we be thinking gross margin at that level should be back sort of tilting toward the high 50s again at that sort of a run rate? Bernie Blegen : Yes. I would not be too quick to jump to the high 50s in the near term here. I think that what we've said previously is that we expect for the next few quarters to stay within our model, targeting about 56% plus or minus 50 basis points. And then, as we look at the second half of next year, as things stabilize and we get a better mix that we should see return to have an incremental improvement. Michael Hsing : Yes. I still see some and I didn't look at the number in details. We expand a lot of capacities. And these are strategically not mistake. And we do see a lot of growth in the next couple of years. And so I believe this capacity, the utilization had taken into effect on the gross margins. I don't know how many -- what's the percentage? I don't know. Maybe Bernie can answer you later. Bernie Blegen : Yes. On the capacity, and I'll take this topic on because it's an important one as we look ahead, is we talked about a year ago as far as developing new relationships with fab partners, particularly in Taiwan and Singapore as we not only expand capacity in advance of a future upswing in demand but also to diversify by geography. And so those investments are adding to our overall cost profile more in the R&D side than in gross margin specifically today, but that capacity will become available here just as we see the second half of next year starting to -- Michael Hsing : Well, these are for future. China is on -- Bernie Blegen : Yes. Michael Hsing : But the capacity that we expanded from a year ago and it's not utilized, yes? Bernie Blegen : Yes, not yet. Michael Hsing : Okay. Or the test equipment. Rick Schafer : Thanks for all the color guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping Michael, you talked about traction in design wins that will turn into revenue over the next several quarters and years. It sounds like you've been very busy with these, as you always are. And often, that means you can see sort of what's coming a little earlier in terms of where the revenue might shift in terms of the end markets and products and that sort of thing. So when you think about the bigger design wins, either the bigger volume runners or the bigger ASP drivers, is there a shift either in end markets or in mix, let's say, for modules or motion control or things like that? Any other shifts in the revenue mix that we should expect because of these design wins that have yet to ramp? Michael Hsing : Well, thanks for reminding me the motion. I forgot about that. Okay, yes, we do have a lot of design win in the motion side, too. And we look at it. And the beauty is, I can't call it specifically, really across the board. And that means we have our biggest customers, like 4%, 5%, maybe slightly higher out of these years. And all the other customers, there are a few thousand customers and a few thousand products around, I don't know how many market segments. And they are very healthy in terms of design win activities. And so all of them will turn into revenues. And I can give you some bigger segments, and not many people talking about it. And is not, what is it, a USB-C, USB-PD. And I believe that this will be a huge revenue and growth. And MPS has a lot more content versus a USB-PD versus the USB -- Bernie Blegen : Earlier versions. Michael Hsing : Yes, earlier versions like type B, okay, now it's Type C. And some of them in auto will be cannibalized for USB type B product. And but C is a much higher content, and that's in auto. And in the consumer side, it's totally new. And USB B type is a very low -- is like a consumer side. And now they're converting to USB-C, and that will be a lot broader applications. And it's based on -- because all unified approach, and especially European countries and drive that standards and I think to migrate to everywhere. They have a clear mandate went to switch it. And I believe even Apple on, for the next version of a phone will be USB-C. And we see MPS has a lot of opportunities, a lot of growth. So other than that, battery management and that will ramp in 2014. And again in a lot of different applications from -- Bernie Blegen : 2024. Michael Hsing : 2024. And these are from power tool to garden tools and from all kind of other things. I mean those are already designed in products, okay, we're ramping in the next 12 to 24 months or less than 6 to 24 months, I guess, yes. Bernie Blegen : And in addition, just to repeat sort of the opportunities that we talked about in both green energy, clean energy and as well as in DDR5. So there's a large number of products that are expected to ramp here very quickly for us. William Stein : Great. If I can ask one follow-up. The inventory decline sequentially surprised us a bit. Perhaps this was always your plan. But if it wasn't, can you describe what happened here? Perhaps customer came in with more demand for something or maybe you decided mid-quarter to reduce production. What -- maybe just set me straight on this issue. Michael Hsing : We reduced the overall inventories that came in starting at the beginning of the year. That's probably reflects that. And yes, and it doesn't mean we will keep that low. We will boost that up more. Bernie Blegen : Yes. What we've done is, we've said that we have a range of inventory that we want to operate within between 180 to 200 days. And what you've seen is that we did reduce wafer starts about 9 months or 3 quarters ago, and that's now being reflected in our balance sheet today. But as we anticipate the demand for all of the opportunities that we see possible for 2024, we are beginning to ramp inventory. And as Michael said, we have the capacity available to take advantage of that. William Stein : Thanks, guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is open. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Michael, I wanted to dig into the automotive market a bit and understand the drivers of the business over the next several quarters. I think you guys have some very exciting new content with one of the leading EV OEMs in the States and obviously some really good content with a number of folks in Asia. So if you could try to help us break down what your expectations are for the drivers of your automotive business over the next, I don't know, 6, 9 months relative to some, I'd say, fluctuations in unit expectations from some key customers, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks. Michael Hsing : Yes. These type of products is not like a consumers. Like a 0.5 year and you can design you out. And it took us a year -- it took us years and it took us at least 12 months to work with our customers, the major suppliers, and to put in the system and make a production worthy and working. And that's a long effort. And frankly, I don't really care, okay? As long as you win those socket or you win those projects. I mean the revenue will come. And so when is the next 3 months or next 9 months? I don't really know. I mean we thought from the last year, again, we saw the last year, middle of this year, we'll start to ramp up. It didn't. But I think it's next year, sometimes that we'll see more and more ADAS and also the new type of tracking inverters. And so that's pretty much just as everybody else expected. All these products are ramping up, okay, we'll go with it. Bernie Blegen : And if I can just add to that, that a lot of the customers that are picking up on design wins are skewed more heavily to EVs that are inviting new technology platforms. And that market has slowed in unit volumes observed. But the exciting part of this story is that we see that new platform launches for those customers are in position to ramp in the first half of next year. And we're seeing a proliferation of a broadening of those technologies going into more traditional internal combustion, or IC brands. So I think that the automotive market, while it's difficult to time that our positioning is very secure. Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. That's a good point. That ADAS, they start to ramp. We were told at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year and now we were told next years. But all of these are new for us. And in the digital cockpit and also ADAS. So now they tell us early next year. And I don't know I can believe or not. I mean -- Bernie Blegen : We'll see, we'll see. Matt Ramsay : Thank you, guys. I guess my follow-up question, it's not, to me, the most strategically important part of your business, but I think it has a lot of different benefits is the consumer market in Asia. And I mean Bernie used the cookie jar analogy a number of times over the years. And the consumer market got down to a small enough percentage of your revenue. I think there was an intention to potentially really lean in and try to regrow that business both from a revenue perspective and also, it gives you a lot of flexibilities around growth and margins. And maybe the demand environment is not there today to really lean in and regrow that. But I just wanted to do a pulse check on the strategy, that's still the intention to regrow that business as a percentage of revenue and you feel like you have the product portfolio to go and do that? Michael Hsing : The strategy is correct. And as in the last quarter, I said like has dropped to unhealthy positions, way too low. And there's a lot of money to be made. And margin may be lower but it helped the EPS a lot. So the second question is whether we have enough product? We did a lot of them, and that came in last 0.5 years. And other ones will release in next couple of quarters and our next quarter also, and those will turn into revenues in the 0.5 year to 9 months' time. Bernie Blegen : We remain committed to the consumer marketplace as part of our diversification. Michael Hsing : Absolutely. Okay. Matt Ramsay : Thank you, guys. Have a good afternoon. Appreciate it. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. I just had two quick follow-ups. First of all, on the buyback, I mean, this is from a size perspective something that's quite large. And we don't have much history with the company in regards to a size like that. So how should we think about, I guess, philosophy with the buyback? You mentioned to offset dilution, but are you going to be opportunistic? Or are you like some other companies where you buy the stock regardless of the price? Just trying to understand some of the dynamics there. Bernie Blegen : Yes. So I'd like to comment on that very quickly is that when we looked at doing the buyback, we were demonstrating confidence in our free cash flow over the next 3-year window. And the goal here is to offset dilution that will naturally occur during that period of time. So we're going to apply a go-to-market strategy that is both opportunistic but also programmatic. So we don't have a timetable necessarily for how to implement it during that period, but it will reflect both existing market conditions as well as a systematic program. Michael Hsing : Well, implies a bylaw, keep it higher, yes. Tore Svanberg : Yes, that's very helpful. The other follow-up, and I know this is a minor detail, but your lighting control business was up quite a bit in the quarter. Was that mainly because of notebook, or was there something else going on there? Michael Hsing : Lighting business? Bernie Blegen : I'm sorry, Tore, you broke up a little bit. Were you talking about storage and computing? Tore Svanberg : No, no, no. So you have the lighting control business. I mean you showed this in your filings. It was up about 20% sequentially. And I was just wondering if that was because of notebook or anything else. Michael Hsing : No, these are decorate lighting. We don't have a lot of consumer business anymore. But these are small numbers, okay? I mean I don't know that specifically, but I do know we don't have a lot of consumers because these are really, really low price. These are industrial lightings and decorative lighting. Bernie Blegen : Yes. I apologize, Tore. I think that you broke up and we missed the heart of your question, which end market? Michael Hsing : Lighting, he said. Tore Svanberg : Yes. You have a lighting control versus DC to DC, right? So lighting control, it increased by $4.5 million sequentially. It was [1] [ph]. It's a $100 million annual business. I mean it's not trivial, but obviously, small in the bigger scheme of things. Michael Hsing : Yes. Bernie Blegen : Yes. Again, Michael addressed it, but it's a general market. Michael Hsing : I don't know it specifically, but that's the market where we're in. We will position ourself. We're not specifically in the consumer and in high volumes. Bernie Blegen : And also, it's in automotive as well. Michael Hsing : Yes. You're right. Genevieve Cunningham : [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Just closing here, I'd like to thank you all for joining us this webinar and I look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter, which will likely be at the end of January. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome everyone to the MPS Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, and Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO. In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our latest SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q, which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that outline the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our Q4 2023 earnings release. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC earlier today and is available on our website as well. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks Gen. For the full-year of 2023 MPS achieved record revenue of $1.82 billion. This is our 12th consecutive year of revenue growth driven by consistent execution, continued innovation and strong customer focus. As announced today, MPS is expanding into a new $1 billion market with the acquisition of our partner Axign B.V. Axign is a Netherlands-based startup with early revenue, specializing in programmable multi-core digital signal processors. Axign competitive difference is its ability to deliver signals with near-zero distortion and reduce power consumption for automotive and consumer audio systems. The combination of Axign and MPS's IP, which has been accepted by several high-end audio customers, will change people's experience in their cars, homes, concert venues, and stadiums. Let me turn to a few highlights from this past year. Our integrated power management solutions for artificial intelligence enabled our customers to unlock previously untapped opportunities for innovation and growth. We created new automotive content, powering the ramp of autonomous driving, the digital cockpit and lighting systems for both conventional and electric vehicles. We continued to diversify our global R&D footprint with the further expansion of our engineering centers of excellence in Europe and Taiwan. And finally, we continue to expand and diversify our operating footprint with the qualification of multiple new fab and packaging partners in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia. Turning to our full-year 2023 revenue by market segment. Automotive revenue grew $94.6 million year-over-year to $394.7 million in 2023. This 31.5% gain was primarily driven by increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting advanced driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and lighting applications. Automotive revenue represented 21.7% of MTS's full-year 2023 revenue, compared with 16.7% in 2022. Full year 2023 enterprise data revenue grew $71.6 million over the prior year to $323 million. This 28.5% increase was primarily due to higher sales of our power management solutions for AI applications. Enterprise Data revenue represented 17.7% of MPS\u2019 total revenue in 2023, compared with 14.8% in 2022. Storage and computing revenue for 2023 grew $38.5 million over the prior year to $491.1 million. This 8.5% increase was primarily driven by increased sales of products for notebooks. Storage and computing revenue represented 27.0% of MPS\u2019 total revenue in 2023, compared with 25.3% in 2022. Communications revenue fell by $46.5 million to $204.9 million, this 18.5% reduction was a result of lower 4G and 5G infrastructure sales. Communications revenue represented 11.3% of our 2023 revenue, compared with 14.0% in 2022. Industrial revenue fell by $46.5 million to $172.7 million in 2023. This 21.2% decrease primarily reflected lower sales in applications for industrial automation, security and power sources. Industrial revenue represented 9.4% of MPS' full-year 2023 revenue, compared with 12.2% in 2022. Consumer revenue decreased $84.8 million to $234.7 million in 2023. This 26.6% year-over-year decrease was a result of broad market weakness across all segments. Consumer revenue represented 12.9% of MPS' full-year 2023 revenue compared with 17.8% in 2022. Let me take a moment to talk about the general business conditions. Throughout 2023, we highlighted that customer ordering patterns were oscillating, reflecting general economic uncertainty. While we saw a nominal improvement in Q4 ordering patterns, we remain cautious as visibility beyond the current quarter is limited. Despite this ongoing uncertainty, we continue to execute against our long-term strategy by bringing innovative new products to market and expanding design wins across our broad base of customers. We believe these ongoing investments position us well for future growth when the macro environment stabilizes. Switching to Q4 results. MPS had fourth quarter revenue of $454.0 million, down 4.4% from the third quarter of 2023 and down 1.3% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Comparing year-over-year results, fourth quarter 2023 revenue for enterprise data grew by 88.4%. Storage and computing fell 2.9%. Automotive was down 7.8%, Consumer decreased 17.5%, Communications decreased 36.3% and Industrial fell 40.5%. Fourth quarter 2023 GAAP gross margin was 55.3%, down 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 and 290 basis points below the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, flat with the third quarter of 2023, but 280 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022. This year-over-year reduction in fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin is largely due to sales mix. Turning to operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $141.6 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $130.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.7 million, roughly flat with the third quarter of 2023 and up from the $94.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2023 stock compensation expense, including $1.2 million charge to cost of goods sold was $41.1 million, compared with $33.6 million recorded in the third quarter of 2023. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2023, GAAP net income was $96.9 million or $1.98 per fully diluted share, compared with $2.48 per share in the third quarter of 2023 and $2.45 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Q4 2023 non-GAAP net income was $140.9 million or $2.88 per fully diluted share, compared with $3.08 per share in the third quarter of 2023 and $3.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2023 were $48.9 million. As for our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.11 billion, compared to $1.04 billion at the end of the third quarter 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $153.3 million, compared with $175.9 million in Q3 2023. Fourth quarter 2023 capital spending totaled $13.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2023 at $179.9 million, compared with the $185.8 million reported at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and $182.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. There were 36 days of sales outstanding across these comparable periods. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 were $383.7 million down from the $397.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Days of inventory rose to 172 days at the end of Q4 2023 from 171 days at the end of third quarter of 2023. We have carefully managed our internal inventories throughout the year given the uncertainty in the market. Using next quarter revenue as a basis, inventory was 175 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, down from 178 days at the end of the third quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2024 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2024 revenue in the range of $437.0 million to $457.0 million. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%. Total stock-based compensation expense, including associated employer taxes of $46.2 million to $48.2 million, including approximately $1.4 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating expenses between $147.2 million and $151.2 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $101.8 million to $103.8 million. This estimate excludes stock-based compensation expense and amortization of recently purchased intangible assets, but includes litigation expense and the expense from our recent Axign acquisition. Other income before foreign exchange gains or losses expected to range from $5.3 million to $5.7 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of $48.8 million to $49.2 million of shares. We continue to execute the share buyback program that was announced in our Q3 '23 earnings call. Finally, I am pleased to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.25 per share from $1 per share for stockholders of record as of March 29, 2024. In conclusion, while we continue to be cautious about the near-term business conditions, we believe our long-term growth strategy remains intact, and we can swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Operator : A - Genevieve Cunningham : Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Can you hear me? Michael, Bernie, can you hear me? Michael Hsing : Yes. Bernie Blegen : Yes, we can. Speak up. Quinn Bolton : Hey, congratulations on the very stable outlook in a pretty choppy environment. Looks like the enterprise data segment was up $30 million quarter-on-quarter, really driving a lot of the growth in the near term. As you look into 2024, can you just talk about your expectations for enterprise data specifically your opportunity to perhaps expand the customer set with some of the other leading GPU and AI accelerator companies? And then I've got a follow-on question. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I'll take that, Quinn. As far as the initial ramp that we've been experiencing over about the last four quarters, we've really seen or benefited from the acceleration of demand for these applications and solutions. As we look ahead, we see a broadening of the number of market participants or customers that will be participating in that. But at the same time, we also believe that competition within the supply chain will continue. So for a majority of the period to-date, we've enjoyed a pretty high percentage of market share, but expect that to decrease as we introduce second and third suppliers. Michael Hsing : But overall, the overall added -- overall, the market segment is and grow very rapidly. And we're expanding our production lines and we will meet in the second-half for the demand. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Maybe just looking at sort of the road map for some of these accelerators in 2024. I think you guys have some new ramps with probably higher content, but I think you also have perhaps lower cost cards coming out where you guys may see a step down in your dollar content. Can you just kind of walk through the puts and takes? We should be thinking about your average dollar content per win? Do you still see that trending higher as power consumption goes up? Or is the increase in competition and perhaps efforts to design cost down cards starting to perhaps limit that dollar content opportunity? Michael Hsing : The dollar content is -- well, it's -- as a market accelerating again, we have more -- our competitor joining and especially this rate of ramp in -- and also, we see other players, other AI players will enter the market that we are so far, we're behind whether pretty much the sole source of power solutions. And as you see the second half or sometime next year, you will see a lot of other players to be qualified or they solve their -- one of the technical problem is, okay, or the odds. So that's what we expect. The cost side, okay, we're always lowering our cost. And at this time, we want to solve all the problems and we believe we resolve all these issues and during this fast ramp. And also the cost at this time is not really the issue. It's all about the throughput and to meet the customer demand. Bernie Blegen : And one final comment on content is that with each following generation of new products that are being introduced for AI, the power requirements are increasing. And at this point, we have a belief that the dollar content will go up per server. But at this point, it's very hard to gauge that. Michael Hsing : In the next version of it is -- the power is even higher -- is much higher as Bernie said. And we started to do these product developments back in a couple of years ago. And we're about to release it to our customers in this quarter and the next couple of quarters. Quinn Bolton : Perfect, thanks. Thank you for all that color. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Yes, thanks. I'll have my congratulations as well. A couple of questions, if I could. I guess, Michael, I'm curious if you could kind of elaborate a little bit, I'm curious what surprised you the most, the last 90-days or so. I'm thinking particularly of auto, obviously, enterprise data was stronger than expected, but auto seems like it's kind of materially gotten softer for most in the last 90-days. So I was curious if you could comment on what you're seeing there. And of course, you guys had, I think, a couple of delayed model year launches last year and the second half. And I was just getting -- trying to get a sense of when those might ramp. And if you consider that an offset maybe to a slower auto market at large. Michael Hsing : Good questions, good observation. And towards the end of the last year, it kind of -- auto slowed down. But overall, we as Bernie said earlier, we still grow some high 20%, 30% somewhere in the overall -- in the auto segment. These are mostly primary -- mostly due to the ADS the infotainment or whatever the head units, call it, the digital cockpit. And going for next year we believe we see all the activities and customers and nowadays consuming all these inventories that we shipped and in May or June period times, and now they start to have a higher volume ramp and especially in the EV side. So for this year's first part of this year. Bernie Blegen : So I think that there has been some softness that has occurred in Q3 of last -- Q3 and Q4 of last year that was observable both for IC and EVs. And as we said in our earlier comments and it applies to automotive, we don't have great visibility beyond just the next quarter. So it's hard for us to predict with the second-half of \u201824, the ramp might look like for automotive. Michael Hsing : Right, the ramp is in the early adoption in EV is very lumpy and a different automakers and ramping in different schedules, I mean -- but overall, the trend is they will pull out more EV with more our products. Rick Schafer : Thanks, Michael. And if I could follow up, I know Quinn was asking about some of the 48-volt stuff. I was curious, I mean, you guys are so dominant on this in second stage 48-volt, and I know you've got a stage 1 product now as well. So I didn't know if you could give us a sense of what your expectations are for share or revenue contribution. However, you'd like to discuss it. But I'm curious sort of what Stage 1 power will do to your content, we'll do for your -- for that enterprise data segment. And I also was curious only because you mentioned it a couple of times, new competition coming in 48-volt. And I was just curious to get your thoughts on if it gets harder or the competition going forward as guys like NVIDIA move from a two-year cadence on new processor development to an annual cadence. Michael Hsing : All right. Yes. This game is always the best performers. So far, our competition, we don't -- I don't want to speak our competition. So far, in what we have, okay, and our customers can be very receptive to our solution. So far, we pretty much have a majority of the volumes. And they keep requesting it and keep requesting we solve all these issues related to their system issues, ours and issues from our side. And -- so when -- even the volume gets even bigger it's good to have another source. Otherwise, again, you don't want the MPS, they can all of them. So again, that's not what we intend to do. And so -- and also the competition in -- it's exactly like a server side. And we are the newcomer in the server market back in -- a couple of years ago, and that's how we win the market. And we had a product long before that. And we also need -- we had to dump the down to meet the common footprints. And because the power density is not high enough. And when this AI come out on the market, the common footprint is not a requirement. So we start to win a lot of -- a lot of shares. And the same is in the servers and have a very similar trend. And that's how we win the market. And we always want to do, as we said in the past. We want to pushing the technology. We want to make sure we're the best. Rick Schafer : And Michael, any sense of Stage 2 -- or sorry, Stage 1 contribution this year for you guys? Michael Hsing : Yes, okay. We had some issues on the Stage 1s and we had some design wins and very small volumes in different systems, actually. And now we don't have -- all these issues are resolved. That will significantly gain the content. And in each AR systems. Bernie Blegen : And Stage 1, for us, at least, is represented about 20%, 25% of the dollar content of Stage 2, and we expect to see the incremental ramp from these products in Q1 and Q2. Michael Hsing : Yes. We had shipping these products for some of the 48-Volt systems. And also, we supply the -- we are as a supplier for chip and for the silicon, not for the modules. And now we step up the two modules. Rick Schafer : Great. Thank you guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much. Congrats guys. Good afternoon. I'm going to ask both of my questions here together because we got two or three calls going on tonight and I don't want to end up on two lines. I don't know that we want to go interweaving earnings calls. But my two questions are the first one, Michael, since you helped found the company, you guys have not been active in M&A traditionally. So I'd be interested to hear a little bit more about the company you're acquiring the markets that you're going to go after how that whole deal came together and what the prospects for that new technologies that you may -- and people that you may roll into the company. Just any background there. Michael Hsing : That's a great question. So otherwise, we are taking to the old AI call. Matt Ramsay : Just really quickly on my second one, so I'll go back. Bernie, if you could just help us out with the guidance for March by segment, that would be helpful to make sure we're all modeling from the same footing. Michael Hsing : All right. Let me answer your first question. And you said it's inactive in the M&A market. That's not true, okay? And we follow our -- well, it's not really a policy. So we follow what we do for the best for our shareholders. We don't acquire revenue. The reason is cheap to grow revenue for MPS. But we do look -- do apply technology. And so this is the -- in the past, actually, we acquired a field and financially immaterial with our shareholders. And at this time, and it's big enough, we made these disclosures. And to talking about this Axign, is the company that we work with in for three years already. And it's proven that their technology and with our power stage and there will be a huge benefit for -- in audio signal to audio amplification fields. And we have a proven in a very, very, very high-end customers and make these products as a very unique and never achieved in histories that no zero disposing signals and same to speakers. And the cost is very low. The way we achieved that. And also, we achieved a lot of programmable is also software adaptive. And that -- I see it when I listen to those sounds, it's really -- you bring audio first we put in the press release, putting audio quality to everybody's home to lower down -- really low down the cost. And that will revolutionize how we listened. Bernie Blegen : Matt, I'll take the second question then on the guidance as far as what we're looking at for Q1 here. The growth driver is remains the enterprise data. The positive there is that in addition to AI, we're also seeing incremental positive demand for our traditional CPU data center solutions. When you look at the other groups, you -- basically, we see a flattening in comms, but then we see declines that sort of range between the high single digits and low double digits in the sequential growth between Q4 and Q1 for the other groups. Does that answer your question, Matt. Gen, I think we can move to the next one. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you, Michael, Bernie. And congratulations on 12th consecutive year of growth, especially in this environment. That's stunning. My first question for you, Michael, is 2024. So you've already talked about AI and Bernie just sort of gave us directionally things for Q1. But you always seem to surprise us a little bit but something throughout the year. So I'm just wondering, is there anything that you could share with us that could happen either in industrial or communications. I'm not thinking about cyclical stuff. I'm thinking about more sort of new secular stuff that you're working on that could surprise us on the upside this year. Michael Hsing : Well, instead of -- well, last year, the growth is not very spectacular. It's like what is a single digit -- 1.5%. Okay. It's -- Yes, okay. But this year, I think is who knows. In last year, we didn't know until ChatGPT happened. Then the AI business took off and was out of our expectations, I mean, we didn't know. But to answer your questions to comment your question 11, what is it, 12 years, 11 years in consecutive year-by-year growth. And it's -- we follow our principles. And again, we want to -- first thing, okay, we want to make sure it\u2019s all the product, what we deliver to our customers is the best product, best performers. And we want to beat all our competition. That's number one. Number two is, we react. We react fast, we're nimble, and we fulfill our customer demand. And that's sort of pretty simple strategy that we followed and we kind of disregarded of what the market segment does. And we don't chase those market segments. This year, who knows, okay, with one of the segments and we'll grow, but I don't expect it we'll grow as big as AI, okay? But maybe a couple of small segments happening and I do see that. And we do see that in the recent quarters and the last quarter source and we see all these orders come in and they came in as we expected, those products are truly better than our competitors. Tore Svanberg : Makes sense. And as my follow-up, I think most people, when they think about MPS, obvious they think about power management and how much share you've gained there. But when I look at the Axign acquisition, I think about your penetration into the data converter space, you're doing much more stuff on the single processing side. I mean, you're clearly building out, I think, a pretty impressive portfolio in what I would call more the mixed signal part of the market. So will you be able to maybe share that with us over time? I don't know, a percentage of revenue collectively so how much these subsegments can represent for the overall business? Michael Hsing : Yes. Okay. I think in the next couple of years, and you will see some significant growth from a different area, from a single processing and for data converters and for -- of course, we talk about today and the audio process, and which we're already designing and some consumer -- high-volume consumer market segment. And later, we're going to get into automotive and automotive business. And other ones, we have a lot of small things. A lot of other things like silicon carbides and for silicon carbide projects for green energies for solar -- and for solar inverters. And -- well, these are still kind of power management, but a lot of them, we are other power, and these are for communications. And for communications in between -- in the solar side, okay, so from the inverter side. And even the automotive side back to automotive side, and there's a lot of other communication in the -- within the car, and we'll develop those type of products. And you see MPS in the next few years will migrate out to dose a second to those segments. Tore Svanberg : Excellent. Thank you and congrats again. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Hey, thanks. I'll add my congrats to the remarkably stable outlook. And along those lines, the company has had a longer-term revenue growth and margin model that you have talked about in the past. I think the way you say it is either plus growth or around 20 top line and then 10 to 20 bps per quarter on gross margin. We've been sort of really outside of that model as things have been really volatile since -- really since COVID started, I guess, but I wonder if we're potentially honing back into that model? Or should we sort of throw that away and not think about that anymore? How would you encourage us to think about revenue growth and margins longer term? Michael Hsing : Yes, those kind of models is models and models. And -- but I think the given time and we will be back in a model is the model can be. It's like a weather forecasting, right? we build models and we didn't predict this thunderstorms. And for like the last couple of years, our model is not correct. And either we have too much we too little. So given those kind of economic, whether it's the environment and that model is not quite right. But they end up -- and also, our model is not very scientific either okay, is based on our empirical historical reasons, okay? And -- but we should not deviate from what we see now again. Bernie Blegen : And just to give people a refresh of what the model is that Will is referring to is, generally speaking, we outperformed the market by 10 to 15 percentage points and in the stable market conditions where it's growing between about 5% and 8%, it's easy to assume that would be between 15% and 20% growth. On the gross margin or range that we targeted about on a non-GAAP basis, is between 55% and 60%. And then when the environment is more predictable, we look to be able to grow gross margin 10 to 15 percentage points -- or basis points on quarterly successive quarters. Michael Hsing : Yes. I might as well added, okay. We emphasize the product development and also the customers design win. And I do see a lot of wins and many different segments I said earlier and probably I forgot even half of it, okay, in my mind. And there are so many things going on. And -- so going in the future and when a normalize -- as Bernie said, is a more normalized economic conditions. And there's no reason we will not grow -- we grow 1.5%, okay? That's at least say it that way, okay. Bernie Blegen : But the market contracted 10%. Michael Hsing : Yes, yes. Okay. Yes. William Stein : We certainly are outgrowing long-term, no doubt. The other thing I'd like to ask about is inventories. I think on your own balance sheet, you're running below your long-term target now, maybe the maybe my view of the targeted sale. I'm not sure, maybe you can just update us on inventory relative to your target and also in the channel, what you think is going on there, please? Thanks so much. Bernie Blegen : Sure. I can take that one. So as a reminder, the model is days on our balance sheet between 180 to 200 days. We came in at about the low 170s this quarter, which was really a reflection of how we have been managing our inventory in this uncertain environment. Having said that, we've started a lot of wafer starts ahead of what we believe will be a potential upside certainly in the next few quarters. As far as the channel, that's been a difficult aspect of this market for everybody. And we've had our share of putting inventory in the channel, but I'm very happy to report that over the last three quarters, it's been coming down appreciably. And we're right now just a little bit above our model. Michael Hsing : We will start to build inventory. Bernie Blegen : Yes. William Stein : Great. Thanks so much guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Travis Polan of Wells Fargo. Travis, your line is now open. Travis Polan : Hi, guys. This is Travis on for Gary. Congratulations on the results. I was wondering if you could provide color on how your customer base has evolved through 2023. Historically, MPS has been diverse from this perspective. But did any customer approach 10%? And along those lines, how do you expect this mix to evolve as we move into 2024? Michael Hsing : Yes, I see these data we grow our small customer base in -- by a few thousand in last year. And that's kind of exciting. And it doesn't mean we add a lot of revenues. And in the longer term, the wealthy I mean -- the bigger the base, the better it is, the more stable MPS will be. And also, you don't know -- and what's the next hardest things, okay? And our customers will decide that. But the market will decide it. Our customer will take opportunity. If it's not this one, that one well. I mean we just explained that play the percentage. And we just have our products goes out the door. Goes to design in those -- to those customers. And in terms of which segments I have to say it's everywhere. This is okay. The -- I can't remember any numbers more than our grow orders more than five or six things. And -- but that's the beauty you won't go 1,000. I mean that takes a few years and it will turn into bigger revenues. Bernie Blegen : And Travis, it's an excellent question because I think to align with Michael's point there is that the strength of MPS as far as resilience in different market conditions, is the breadth of the customer base and not have high levels of concentration. Now obviously, with this environment where it has been generally weak except for AI we're in sort of an unusual profile, but we don't expect that to last over the next couple three years. Travis Polan : Got it. Thank you for the color. That\u2019s all from me. Michael Hsing : Yes, okay. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you. I just had two quick follow-ups. First of all, is on revenue capacity. So I know in the past, Michael, you talked about sort of getting to $2 billion in capacity. Obviously, you're there now. But then also any updates on getting to $3 and even $4 billion of revenue capacity? Michael Hsing : We are building for $4 billion revenues, again, in capacities. And we -- actually we never changed. And especially out of China, and we -- and that actually fits our plan. and we'll continue to do that. And these kind of capacity issues you look at MPS business. And we see -- we believe these business will grow -- we grow our capacity accordingly. It's really a disregarded, okay, what's the current environment we address for long-term issues. Tore Svanberg : Very good. And then the other follow-up, any updates on the e-commerce business. We haven't heard about that in a while. So I just want to make sure we check in with you and get an update there. Michael Hsing : Our module business is -- our -- pure e-commerce, I said it, okay, we didn't know what we are talking about and wasn't that excitement and exciting. But the combination of it and with our web service in the e-commerce and also some interactions help from our website. That generates 150 million units now -- last year. And I can't call it in -- what was that, like seven, eight years ago, seven, eight years ago, we're going to these e-commerce business customers logging our website, we're going to -- they can change their -- they can input their parameters and program our ports, we ship the product within a week or so. That didn't happen that much. But -- and yes, it's happening. But I still believe in the long term, that will be the business because we are loading the power management. We're loading all these product designing barriers. And -- why not? People can program the part and especially younger generations. And they have -- they rather program a product rather than use a solid line, putting us in the arms and get and go to a lab is okay to make it happen. And I think it's longer younger generations would do that. And it will be different from other generations, my generation. And that business I believe in the long-term, we're still picking up. But for now, was more than that bad. I cannot say that way. Tore Svanberg : Great. Thank you, again. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Melissa, your line is now open. Melissa Fairbanks : Hey, guys. Thanks very much. I was wondering if maybe I could squeeze one in about storage and computing business. I know it's not quite as exciting maybe as what's going on in enterprise data. Michael Hsing : That's not good. Melissa Fairbanks : I noted that you did pick up some business on the notebook side last year that was kind of opportunistic. We've got some seasonal factors coming in, in March. We've kind of heard that channel inventories, at least on the PC notebook side have normalized somewhat. But wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color on the storage portion of that business that we don't seem to talk about very much. Michael Hsing : You know, the answer already. And I said, overall, it's not good. Overall, we take on some market shares, and we start to grow a little bit. Bernie Blegen : So I think the way to look at it is that we anticipated softness in the storage market. And so as a result, we became more competitive on notebooks an accepted lower-margin business. And it was offsetting declines, particularly in SSD where we've seen a decline. We increased share with a lot of the major customers in the SSD market, but their business was in decline for much of 2023. And then the other positive in the group is that we saw the initial ramp of DDR5 during the year and also graphic cards expanded pretty nicely during the year. So this is a group that has different characteristics and net-net did pretty okay in a pretty difficult market. Michael Hsing : Well, I think the DDR5, we expect to ramp in last year, right? I mean it happened didn't happen that fast. I mean -- so the key is, again, we make sure our product is designing and when these products will ramp, it's not up to us. And we actually care less but only care is we have a product to ship. Okay. Melissa Fairbanks : All right. Thanks very much, Michael, I'm sorry to bring up a sore point. Michael Hsing : It's not a sore point. It's a reality like everybody else is. Melissa Fairbanks : Sure. Alright thanks guys. Michael Hsing : Alright, thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow-up, Bernie, I think you had mentioned that in addition to the GPU and AI, you guys are starting to see better traction on just the core CPU server market I know in the past, you've talked about your goal to try to get your share in that segment to 25%. So wondering if you might just give us an update where do you think your share is in CPU core power today? And how are you feeling about that 25% market share target over, say, the next couple of years? Thanks. Bernie Blegen : Sure. So what really generates interest with our customers is when they see the new product launches at both Intel and AMD ramping and we do the power management for both of those. And I think that as we observed in the last year or even 18 months that the most recent versions of their products have been delayed. And so we've experienced a slower ramp as far as being able to increase share or content on those platforms. But at least initially, is it was observing for Q1 as well as for the balance of '24, we see that both of those ramps starting to improve and that we'll participate with them. At this point, we don't have any reason to doubt our earlier projections as far as overall share opportunity between 20% and 30%. But right at this particular moment, it's hard to say what we have. Michael Hsing : Yes. Let me talk about this in looking and we didn't have any. And we are 13.5% and because that was about 2.5 years ago, we have a lot of design wins. We have a design win, a few but for me came in the customers -- at their customers, they couldn't get the -- couldn't ship. And we are turning to be the bigger players. We are four teams in -- back in a few years ago, that we're designing a many different projects. And we expect to be a bigger player. And so that's -- we still believe the same story. And when the CPU market picks up and our revenue will start resume to growth. And so what is the last year, and I don't even remember what was the last year, there wasn't spectacular numbers anyway. And I think as soon or later will turn around. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Great. Thank you very much, everybody. I'd like to thank you for joining us on this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again in our first quarter which will be in late April. And just to add to that, at that time, we'll be introducing a new format for this call. We will provide you content and context on how the end markets have performed in a written manner, and then we will use the conference call portion more for Q&A. So we believe that, that will be a more efficient use of your time and ours and also more complete communication. So with that, I will thank you. And again, I look forward to seeing you again in April.",

    "content": "\ufeff Genevieve Cunningham : Welcome everyone, to the MPS First Quarter 2024 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar.  Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO; and Tony Balow, VP of Finance.  Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, MPS released written commentary on the results of our operations. Both of these documents can be found on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our latest SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update this information.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Gen. We're doing something a little different in today's earnings call. As a detailed recital performance metrics is included in the company's earnings commentary, accompanying the earnings release, I'll use this time to provide just a few comments on our Q1 2024 performance and our outlook before opening the call up to Q&A.  Our financial performance improved in the first quarter of 2024 with revenue up both sequentially from Q4 '23 and year-over-year from Q1 '23, Ordering patterns consistently trended upwards through the quarter. Visibility into the second half of 2024, however, is limited and many of our customers remain cautious.  Despite this uncertainty around the second half of 2024, customer engagement across all of our end markets remains high, and our design win pipeline continues to grow stronger. Additionally, we are continuing to expand our product portfolio and diversify our supply chain globally. We believe both actions position our company for further growth as the market improves.  In summary, we saw consistent improvement through the first quarter, but we continue to be cautious about the second half of 2024 business conditions. Overall, our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact, and we can swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur.  I'll now open the webinar up for questions. Genevieve Cunningham : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Congratulations on this enviable consistency. I have two questions. My first question is on share gains. And historically, Michael, Monolithic Power tends to really accelerate share gains during downturns. And I know there's a lot of focus on Enterprise Data right now, which is 1/3 of your revenue, but -- can you maybe call out some other verticals or applications where you are seeing more share gains in the current downturn? Michael R. Hsing: Clearly, we just wait -- if we haven't out of this downturn. You see this, we compare the rest of the industries, we're like a 10% up. And -- so that's really a share gained. And so in terms of -- so the rest of vertical market as auto is clearly is the one. We won many sockets in there. And MPS is still small compared to all these established -- our competitors.  And other ones, even other ones -- even the servers and notebooks areas and these are the ones, all gain shares. And the last one is the consumer, as we said it a year ago or so, we gave it up some of the shares because of the capacity constraints. Now, we have a lot more capacity now and you will see some growth in the near future. Bernie Blegen : And if I could add one additional comment there is that we've had a number of greenfield opportunities that have been waiting to launch in an improved macro environment. So in addition to the end markets that Michael just referenced, I think that you'll also see share gains in both communications and industrial. Tore Svanberg : Great. And for my follow-up question and specifically on Enterprise Data, which is now 1/3 of our revenues. There's been some chatter lately about lower power management content in next-generation AI data centers due to liquid cooling and other techniques to lower overall power. Is this impacting MPS broadly? Or is this kind of more sort of a very specific use case in the server power management market? Michael R. Hsing: All these cooling systems, the new format or vertical powers, MPS involve all of them. And if they transition to those markets, those systems -- and MPS in the same gains, okay? We will gain -- and we will grow with it. Is there any other comment? Tony? Okay. Bernie Blegen : No, I think that the point that we've demonstrated, particularly with Enterprise Data is the ability to leverage up content as we go into higher-value technology. For example, the water cooled and vertical represent opportunities, not threats. And if you look down the line not to -- not far out, we'll also be going into rack power as well. Michael R. Hsing: That's good. Yes, good answer. Operator : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn Bolton : I'll add my congratulations on very steady performance in a challenging macro environment. I guess I wanted to follow up on Tore's question on enterprise data. Lots of your competitors making noise about perhaps gaining share at your largest enterprise data customer. I'm wondering if you could just sort of address your latest thoughts on competitive landscape in both lateral power and then perhaps looking forward to vertical power? And then I've got a follow-up. Michael R. Hsing: Yes. As you may remember, 2016, we have a power curve versus -- the power curve CPU computing capabilities and versus the power densities. And we projected it for 2018 or '19. That would be the crossover point that MPS product. And for those common footprint, driver [ mass ] couldn't fit into the peripheral powers. That's around 700 watts. If you remember that in 2016, we said that. And at the time, we projected with the CPU was wrong. It's actually turned out to be GPUs. But the power is the power, power densities. And -- but 2018 or '19 -- and that's pretty much the peripheral power that reach the limit. And now from that time -- and everybody goes to a vertical for even higher power AI computations or learning. So all over these power go to verticals.  And peripheral powers reached the limit. And I can't comment on our competitors, okay, so far, MPS, well, as always, we want to bring the best technologies. And we are not a champion of volumes, okay? We don't do that. We want to every -- whatever we do, we do the best. And not the volumes that we ship.  And -- so when the market became normalized and became a normal -- not like the last couple -- last year or so. And there will be more -- more solution come on board. A lot of our competitors start to copy our products, so be it. That's fine. So we are -- we stick our MPS model, we will have a very diversified growth. Bernie Blegen : I think it's important to keep in mind when you look at our history, as Michael just referenced there, that we have always won opportunities due to our innovation. And as we look at the next generation of GPU or TPU or ASIC products that are in this high power end market. We're an enabling technology meaning that at the front of the design cycle, we're consulted, we're integrated, in fact, with the development of the next generation of products. So we believe that strategically that, yes, there will be competitive influences on the market but we want to continue to position ourselves as the leader. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Just any comments you guys have on when you think vertical power may go to volume production? Is that something that happens later in '24? Is that not in volume until sometime in 2025? And then the follow-up, Bernie, is you look at the consensus estimates, the Street's modeled up 9% sequential growth in your December quarter. Your typical seasonality, I think, is down 1% to 3%. Wondering if you have any comments as to that sort of a-seasonal pattern out in Q4? I know you're not guiding out that far, but wondering if you could make any comments about that sort of atypical growth. Michael R. Hsing: I'll answer the first part of it. And the vertical power is happening now. There's multiple of our customers, they are launching the vertical power now and we are shipping those products. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And I'll pick up the second part of your question there is that seasonality, particularly as you are exiting a downturn is hard to predict. And what we tried to indicate with our prepared comments is that there are signs of optimism from the standpoint of improved ordering patterns. But how that translates into the second half is hard to predict. And so we have more of a profile of the guide that we've given for Q2. But that really as far as the difference between Q3 and Q4, we see them higher than Q2 perhaps. But between the two of them, flattish. Michael R. Hsing: Yes. We see AI probably still continue to grow and grow very fast rate. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Richard Schafer : My congratulations guys, and I just had a couple of questions. The first one just since we're talking about power, and I sort of have a point in one on server CPU power. Some of the new x86 platforms that are due out later this year are pushing 500 watts. I mean is there an expectation? Just like the call you made back in 2016, maybe that was a little premature. But is there expectation that x86 is eventually going to move to 48-volt still? And if so, I guess, where are we in that transition? How far off do you think that is? Michael R. Hsing: Yes. Okay. Now since you mentioned 2016, I can go back to earlier. 2014 we were not even -- we were outside the door, in 2016, we can join, we were invited as a guest. And we gave some tokens so you can play it. And so the transitions and from VR 13.5 to 14, then this type -- this time, when these new CPU power, we have a significant market share. That will keep -- and it's not reflected into revenue yet. And once those CPU release, we will gain a significant amount of shares. Richard Schafer : And any comment, Michael, on the transition to 48-volt power for X86? Michael R. Hsing: That we don't -- that's probably -- the higher powers is over 700 watts. I think those will transition to vertical powers. And -- which were ready and other ones below that, we believe, are still using a traditional rack power that came in and use 12-volt supply. Richard Schafer : Got it. And just as a follow-up, shifting gears a little bit to auto. I was just curious what your expectations are for your auto business this year? Obviously, that market is under a little bit of pressure near term. But I believe you guys have been pretty open about some of your material share gains.  For instance, with China, within China, ADAS also with some of your top auto -- you with your top auto customer. You've also got some pretty significant share gains, I believe, ramping later this year, but I was curious if you could provide any update there. Michael R. Hsing: We saw - yes, go ahead. Richard Schafer : I just was curious if you could add in there, what your expectations are from -- I know you had a couple of launches that some OEMs delayed in the second half last year, and I didn't know if you still expect it to benefit from those this year. I know that's kind of a lot in one question, but there's a lot going on in your auto business. Michael R. Hsing: Yes, certainly. We actually care less with the share gain, what the revenue expectations. Of course, we have to prepare all the inventories, okay -- and that's the only thing we care. Whatever this or whatever it is, okay. We want to do -- if we're not -- if we're not the best, we will not win those market segments. And particularly, these are new applications and new features.  So far, we can tell you -- in this year's or end of the last year's, and Chinese EV makers, they produce a lot more. And with those features that we are in, they export it in -- not to U.S., but to the other possible world, they increased somewhere 5 million to 6 million units, okay, million cars. And that's where we see the upside so far. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Congratulations on the stability. Just a question on the visibility into the second half. I understand the caution, especially given everything going on in the broader market. But you also said that your bookings are improving, the order rates, the engagements, et cetera, et cetera. So is the visibility improving? It's just not as good as it used to be? I'm just trying to reconcile the bookings side improving, but the visibility not. Bernie Blegen : Sure, Ross. If we can kind of reflect that over the course of about the last 6 quarters, ordering patterns have been well below whatever we call normal. And when we're seeing improvement, doesn't mean that we're seeing that they have necessarily stabilized or that they're as predictive as when you have like 5 or 6 consecutive quarters of strong ordering patterns. So all we're trying to do right now is remain cautiously optimistic. Tony Balow : Ross, it's Tony. The only thing I'd probably add on that, right, is really focused on the design win engagement, making sure that pipeline is healthy because it's difficult to call when the market would come back. As Bernie said, it's still pretty choppy. But if we have that strong design win pipeline as well as having the supply chain diversification we were talking about, we're set to take advantage when the markets do come back. Ross Seymore : I guess as my one follow-up, a near-term question for you. Any outliers in the growth that you're guiding to in the second quarter by end market segments versus the 7% total? Michael R. Hsing: No. Outliers means like AI stuff, Yes. As I said earlier, we still -- we still see a lot of growth, okay? I mean we are getting -- try to get all the inventory ready, okay, start to go even further, okay, and they even have a lot more upside. Bernie Blegen : Yes. If I look sequentially between Q2 and Q1, we do see the continuing demand profile for Enterprise Data. And I think we see also some contribution from Automotive, but the rest of our end markets are pretty flattish. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William Stein : Congrats on the good results, and thanks for the change in format. It's a breath of fresh air. Michael R. Hsing: And -- you appreciate it. We try to make it life and make it easy for you. William Stein : I'm hoping you can update us on the progress you pursued to try to diversify your manufacturing geographic footprint and both on the front end and back end? And then I have a follow-up, please. Tony Balow : Yes, I'll start, and then I'll let Michael and Bernie pick up. So I think we continue to make progress on diversification of our supply chain globally. And so I think that is proceeding as planned. And I think that we're set as customers would ask for that capability that we have it ready for them right now. So I think based on what we said in the past, so I would say no change in the expectation there. So Bernie or Michael, anything you want to add? Michael R. Hsing: Yes. We built all these capacities our customer demands, okay. There's a few of them that really demand a lot outside of China. So we have more capacity. So that's the comment. Okay. William Stein : Okay. Let me try a different topic. Some product types that I know have been ramping maybe over a long period of time. One is converter -- data converters, which is a category, there's -- I think there's really one very dominant supplier, but you guys have started to get into that area. And then the other is the modules that you make when these are much more complex and they have many, many chips, I think, in each one. If you can talk to us about the recent growth in those newer categories, that would be helpful color. Michael R. Hsing: Yes. Okay. Let me answer the first ones, data converter -- data converters are -- it's a technology that we're talking about, we developed in the last few years. And we want design win, we start to shipping products, and -- but however, there's only 1 or 2 products, okay? And now we're going to release a family of a product in less than a year, less than a year time. That will meet a more general market.  The other topic that's when you're talking about -- these modules. Yes, so called e-commerce modules, and we're actually doing well, okay, not exactly the e-commerce we talk about in 2018. And it's going over well over $100 million, okay. I mean -- but these are multi-chip modules is more than $100 million. Actually, all these AI products that we're shipping these all modules. And vertical powers and also the rack powers. We're shipping all these modules. So  I -- in the past, I say -- I said and I'm sick and tired of selling silicon only. I want to leverage -- our leverage and monetize, our know-how will sell these power modules sales solutions. Bernie Blegen : And I think that we've sort of hit on one of the strategic differentiators between MPS and a lot of our competitors is that we can offer the most flexible architecture of whether it is delivering a module or silicon die, so however the customer wants to build our silicon or modules into their end application, we have the flexibility to do just that. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matthew Ramsay : I guess it's my first question. guys, I wanted you to maybe talk a little bit about the content per socket progression that you see for the company in the AI business, in particular, as your -- silicon providers that are driving these platforms make generational transitions there. I think there's a little bit of confusion that the big primary guy in AI is not just launching 1 product, but they're launching 3 different ones that I expect to have slightly different content. And you obviously have other customers there in AI, not just NVIDIA but others.  So if you could talk generally, Michael, about just what you're seeing from a content perspective, generation to generation there? And maybe Bernie, what are the variables on sort of blended content increases that you might see as we move forward? Michael R. Hsing: Yes. I can't talk about the -- well I don't -- we don't know how our customers -- and these are AI GPU providers, how they use it. I mean, they sell -- they have a different model, they have a different model -- they have a different variety of products. We -- as long as we know, okay, they use some -- they use IC chipping in general for peripheral power and verticals is all more than 700-watt powers, over 1,000-watt power. So these are from modules. And how many modules per CPUs, we have rough ideas, but we don't know exactly. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And to follow up on your second point, it's a very content-rich environment for us. It also includes memory, for example, and the CPU process -- processor in addition... Michael R. Hsing: Or even optical. Bernie Blegen : An optical as well. So I think it's really too early to put limits on content availability. In fact, we're finding new areas in order to deploy. Michael R. Hsing: So far, we just want to handle the growth. All the demand from a memory side from opticals, from even the GPU, CPU powers. And this period is really the growth period. Matthew Ramsay : Got it. That's helpful. I know there's a lot of moving parts. I was going to kind of step back and ask a little bit about gross margin trajectory, it comes up a lot in my conversations. I know you're kind of in that 55% range. I guess, Bernie, what are the puts and takes here? I know there are big customers ramping in enterprise data and there are variables around that.  There's also mix between your segments and where you're sourcing supply from, there's a lot of variables here. So what would -- I mean, are we kind of at a relative floor in the 55% or slightly above range? And what would be the variables that could drive the margin back higher? Bernie Blegen : Sure. This is a pretty simple question. So as you know, the range that we target is between 55% and 60%. We demonstrated that during the post pandemic stimulus that our margin was able to go to the higher end of that limit. And right now, for the last couple of quarters as well as our guidance here, we've maintained a non-GAAP rate of 55.7%. And really, what will enable us to go up is a change in the mix of business. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo. Gary Mobley : Congrats, and thank you for persistently seeing the expectation. Most of the interesting questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to touch on pricing trends. I know you don't overlap a whole lot with the analog chip market leader. But clearly, they're being aggressive on price. So maybe if you can speak to the different product groups or business segments that might be affected by that? And as well, just generally speak about the pricing environments for your broad set of products. Michael R. Hsing: Tony, you want to? Tony Balow : I'll start and then let Bernie jump in, right, I think what you've heard from us in the past is that for us, because we lead on innovation and we're trying to work on the next-generation platforms and work on where we really have a differentiated advantage to our technology. We're probably less susceptible to pricing than some of the segments that are volume related or might be more mainstream. So I do know there's lots of reports out there about pricing right now. But I'd say right now, that's not impacting us in a way -- that's not impacting us in any way, and you can kind of see that in our outlook. And so Bernie will add some more on that. Bernie Blegen : Yes. And fundamentally, part of the issue that's driving prices both additional capacity in China as well as additional capacity that's coming on with a large North American company. And on the cost side, we've always been very, very competitive regardless of the end market opportunity and... Michael R. Hsing: The cost regardless of what the margin is, we always have to -- we always drive the cost down. I shouldn't give you more than you asked, and it's a little bit from the futures. And so far, have nobody asked the question yet. We saw in the near-term market in the next couple of years, the AI truly trickle down to all applications. not only in the cars, and all -- in the sensors, all these -- in building for the phones and all kind of things trickle down to a different level. And that we see now all kind of activities is going on now.  And we -- there's a lot of design initial phase performing the product ideas. And these are requested from our customers. And we don't see that in the end of the last year, even in the beginning of this year, recently, we see a lot more. So that will drive -- those products definitely will drive the gross margin up. Gary Mobley : Thank you for that comprehensive answer. Last quarter, your distribution inventory, I think you characterized it -- I think you characterized the distribution inventory as being a little bit above the target level, what is it now? Have you been able to work that down to more of a normalized level? Bernie Blegen : Sure. So there's sort of two ways to look at our channel inventory right now. If you keep it narrow to really the AI supply chain, we're trying to keep that elevated so that, that inventory is basically available on demand. But then with regard to all of the other end markets, we've seen it coming down nicely. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore Svanberg : I just had two quick follow-ups. I'm intrigued by the consumer segment, Michael, I know that's surprising when everyone is talking about AI. But I think this is the lowest percentage has ever been. But you did talk about getting some share there in the downturn. So any particular applications that we should keep an eye on as you start to grow back in the consumer area? Michael R. Hsing: Yes. Okay. That's good question, I mean, yes, that's -- I said earlier that fell into an unhealthy percentage. We want to have a diversified growth, we neglected our consumers. But on the other hand, is during this period, a lot of our competitors care less about cost. We have less effect, but we did lower the price in the notebook market segment. And that's probably you see it now, we grow the notebook revenues faster than notebook market growth. And these are low-margin products.  But when looking at -- looking forward, audio product. A lot of it related to a consumer product. Maybe, Tony, you can mention -- you can talk about this is okay. Tony Balow : I'll go and Michael can certainly talk a lot more, but I'd point you back to what we announced last quarter on Axign acquisition. And we really looked at their technology and saw an opportunity to participate in the high-end audio market and MPS's scale and Axign's technology really offered an opportunity to go after customers, and we're seeing some traction in that area. So consumers got a wide base of potential applications, and I think we'll continue to pick our shots where we can sort of really add value with our innovation. Michael R. Hsing: Yes. I can tell you, we will start to ship in Q3 but -- Axign and MPS together as a bundle. Tore Svanberg : Yes. That's exciting. And my last question is on communications. It was actually up sequentially this quarter. Everything that we're hearing, of course, is that, that market is still very weak. In your prepared remarks, you said that, that growth was driven by networks. So can you elaborate a little bit what's going on there? Are you actually starting to see that market turning? Or is this just pure share gains? Bernie Blegen : It remains a flattish market. I think that in quarter-by-quarter, we're going to see infrastructure go up or down. But the full year outlook is that it will probably be flat with '23. Michael R. Hsing: I'm betting on the communication market, it will trickle down from the speed, and demand of higher speed will trickle down all these segments. And we have a lot of design wins in 5Gs or in other high speed or Wi-Fi, and we're ready for that. Tore Svanberg : So Michael, what you mean is AI will trickle down. And as that happens, the comm sector will revive? Michael R. Hsing: That's right. Yes, it has to. That's no brainer. Genevieve Cunningham : Our last question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Melissa Dailey Fairbanks : Michael, I love a no-brainer. I mean -- I love that. Michael R. Hsing: Yes, I don't need my brain to talk about it. Melissa Dailey Fairbanks : I'm adjusting my model accordingly. So I know you guys addressed auto earlier, and I know everyone is focused on enterprise data. But I would like to understand better, we're coming up on the model year builds for like model year 2025. I would like to know where you feel comfortable guiding the auto revenue from here? Bernie Blegen : Yes. So let me take that one. A lot of the exposure we have with new content is with the EV companies. And so Michael touched on the opportunity, particularly as it relates to Chinese OEMs where we have a good installed base, particularly as it relates to ADAS or autonomous driving.  And those tend not to be as seasonally driven as the internal combustion. So while we're seeing some sequential improvement quarter-by-quarter during the year, we don't necessarily -- we're not looking for that hockey stick that used to occur with automotive sales in Q3. Genevieve Cunningham : I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : So I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during the second quarter conference call, which will likely be in late July. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Genevieve Cunningham : Welcome everyone to the MPS Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO; and Tony Balow, VP of Finance. Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, MPS released a written commentary on the results of our operations. Both of these documents can be found on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risk and uncertainty. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release, and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update this information. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Gen. Good afternoon, and a big welcome to all of you. Let me open by saying MPS reported yet another record quarter with Q2, 2024 revenue of $507.4 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our strong revenue growth was attributed to three factors, increased demand for AI power solutions, improving order trends in several of our end markets. And lastly, initial revenue ramps associated with design wins secured in past years. Separately, we continue to expand and diversify our global supply chain, to ensure supply stability and capture future growth. As we have emphasized for many years, our results reflect continued success of our proven long-term growth strategy, and our transformation from being only a chip supplier, to a full solutions provider. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Gen, could you please ask the first caller? A - Genevieve Cunningham : Our first question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much, everybody. Good afternoon. Michael, Bernie, congratulations on, I'll just say, it's nice to have a calm part in the storm relative to what's been - all of us have been dealing with over the last two weeks, so congrats. I wanted to ask a couple of questions that I imagine the enterprise data segment is going to be a huge focus on this call. So maybe I'll just start with the first question. Bernie, if you could maybe give us some directional color by end market in your guidance for September, I'd appreciate it. And secondly, Michael, if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in some of the non-enterprise data segments, like things like consumer, comms, auto. The model's been driven by this big growth in enterprise data, but from what I can tell, your company's had a lot of design win success in some of these other areas where the macro has really been challenging. And I'm wondering if you're starting to see any green shoots there yet, for recovery in some of those other segments? Thanks, guys. Bernie Blegen : Sure, I'll keep my comments fairly short as far as the Q3 outlook by end market. Essentially, the bookings trend that we carried into Q3 has improved quite a bit over the last few quarters, and has been fairly broad as far as the end market participation. If you look specifically at enterprise data, you'll see that we took a fairly large step up in each of the last two quarters. And then in the third quarter outlook, we see continued growth in communications, storage and computing with incremental improvements and also in our other groups. Michael Hsing : Yes, your second question, as Bernie said it, we do see some of our - other business would not relate to AI. And now it is difficult to separate AI, non-AI. Other business we designed in which we - let's say that, okay we ship these products to the half a year ago. A year before we see the market start to wakening up. But that's whatever it is, whatever it is, okay. And we do see a lot of new design, new requirement, which is much higher power, for especially for communications. And well, as a matter of fact, as across the board. And these designs are much higher power than the previous versions. And these are all relate to the new design, relate to AI - and AI requirements. And these design wings, we'll probably triggered downs in a game of two [ph] or three years, and change of revenues. Matt Ramsay : Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate it. I asked two questions. So I'll get back in the queue. Thanks. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Dustin Fowler of Oppenheimer. Dustin, your line is now open. Dustin Fowler : Hi guys, I just have couple of quick questions. So for power isolation, I believe you ramp later this year in auto followed by data center next year. I think both markets could be Greenfield opportunities in the hundreds of millions each. Could you just give us a sense of the ramp in both markets, the competitive landscape and maybe any market sizing if you can? Bernie Blegen : Dustin, I apologize. This is Bernie. I didn't hear which two markets. Dustin Fowler : Oh, sorry. That was auto and data center for power isolation? Michael Hsing : Okay. Yes. We do start to ship in the gate [ph] and the product for the higher powers and for data centers. And this is only the beginning. And would you say that that's very true? Auto is being known and we, when ADAS and became more, more and more the cars converged into the ADAS, okay. And which we believe in being a two or three years, all the cars will have that features. And we, so far we provide all the, we have design wing in all these car makers, especially in the EVs. Dustin Fowler : Okay. And I guess as we think about kind of auto this year, I think street has auto model flat. I guess how realistic is that given 70% content gains you have with your largest auto customer before power isolation plus the wins with Chinese OEMs? I guess maybe for Bernie, are you modeling auto flat this year? And how should we kind of think about share gains? Michael Hsing : Well, we cannot pick the, you want to pick the models and gave me, and you want to pick them, I can't give you a model. My accuracy is a plus minus 12 months. And going forward, we are very confident. Bernie Blegen : Yes, I think the near term outlook for automotive remains a little bit fuzzy. And for example, in Q2, we were expecting a nice uplift, which did not occur. And so Michael's correct is that positioning within the next two, three quarters, is hard to predict for auto more broadly and EV specifically, but our long-term positioning is only getting better with additional design wins. Dustin Fowler : All right, thanks guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Great, thanks for taking my question. Michael, I'm hoping you can linger on that comment you made about solution selling. I think might've been the term used. I think in the past, we've been conditioned to hear about modules versus semis. Can you linger as to what your, maybe spend a minute explaining what sorts of products and what end markets, and what growth you see coming from that activity? Michael Hsing : I like that question. Yes, okay. As we said, we started that journey long time ago, okay. And at the beginning, maybe I didn't know, we didn't know what the hell we were talking about. And okay, but that's the directions. And that's including a part of e-commerce. And we sell plug and play solutions. So the effort is that the journey will be, we are, we known to be a semiconductor company. And yes, we do. We do all that we provide. And when we sell a silicon, we're selling, actually we're selling a solutions. We know all the technical details in terms of how we implement the solutions. So my effort is we want to monetize all our knowledges. MPS in the end, doesn't make any things. And we all making the money from our knowledge. While we capitalize all the entire our capabilities. And so the journey we started, now we're selling the solutions. It's probably 20%, 25% of a total MPS total revenue. Every piece of a silicon used to be selling somewhere between $1 and $0.50 to $1. Some of them are a lot of them even lower for the mass market. And which we kind of vary little now, especially in consumer business. And now, we're turning to a solution company is still a semiconductor based solutions. We sell those solutions. Now particularly as you call it, as a modules. And like I don't know what the appropriate word for that. And so today is 25%, 20% to 25% of a total revenues. MPS module business excluding AI. We're running a couple hundred, close to $200 million. And we're growing every year by more than company's percentage growth. And if you look at this, this way, every chip we sell, all the solution is more than a chip price. And you generally $4, $5, $6, $10 of a content that we can sell. So that's the result of today. And we will commit on the journeys. And again, we're transforming a company to a silicon only, to silicon based solution providers. Bernie Blegen : And Will, if I could just add two comments quickly. The first is, and this is specific to your question, that it's across all of our markets. It primarily focuses on those that have longer design cycles, where we can add expertise in design solution. And the second point is again, while we are driving a lot, a higher percentage of our business to the modules, or to the more complete solutions. We have the ability, like no other company to be able to deliver the type of solution our customer wants, whether it's a die, a chip or some package in between. Michael Hsing : Yes, and many -- maybe traditional semiconductor companies and they are hard to distinguish, whether they're solution providers or selling modules, selling solutions or selling semiconductor only. And that's especially the case and apply for AI powers. And there's a very few company using a silicon based, the module solution to power up this AI solution or data centers. William Stein : If I can add a follow-up please. Can you talk about what you're doing in vertical power delivery? I know there's a lot of companies that are claiming to have it, or be ramping it. And I know you guys are one of those companies that are I think more clearly delivering, but maybe you can talk about what your efforts are yielding in that area? Thank you. Michael Hsing : We are - in the leading positions. Okay, I said it - and there's maybe one, I will say the one or two company. Maybe one company have the capability have - and similar to MPS, the market is huge and it's growing. And MPS is, what the leading position, is because not by one day, like one-or-one an AI happened, we developed that years ago for that. And there's not many semiconductor companies that are based at the semiconductor company have that kind of a capability. William Stein : Thanks guys, good job on the quarter. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hi guys, let me offer my congratulations. Maybe just first Bernie, a quick follow-up on Matt Ramsay's question on the drivers of sequential growth in the third quarter. I think you mentioned comms and storage and computing, but I didn't hear you specifically say enterprise data. I just wanted to confirm enterprise data is still one of the big growth drivers in the third quarter. And then I'll get to the two questions? Bernie Blegen : On the enterprise data, the way I tried to tee that up, first off, yes, it is expected to grow, but we have grown significantly each of the four prior quarters to this. So the rate of growth is slowing down. And the biggest for this quarter only. And I offer that because there's a lot of opportunities that have yet to begin to ramp with a number of the different companies that we're currently working on designs with. But I was calling out in particular that both storage and computing and communications will be good drivers in Q3. Michael Hsing : Quinn, you know VR 13.5 and we start to have a significant revenues. And that was the beginning, you know that. And VR 14, which hasn't really ramped up yet. And we have a lot of design, we increase it. VR 13.5 is like a MPS -- MPS is a test case. And so when during the shortage, okay, a lot of revenues, a lot of volumes shifted to MPS. And our competitors couldn't deliver, we delivered and we delivered. And now the benefit it is - for VR 14, where will be a significant players in the market segment? Bernie Blegen : And particularly in the second half of this year, it looks like that segment is starting to take off. Quinn Bolton : Great, that was going to be served. I guess my first question was just, could you talk within the enterprise data about some of the opportunities, whether it's on the CPU power side or just broadening out of your AI portfolio? And then I'll have another question on vertical power if I could squeeze in that second question? Michael Hsing : Go ahead. Quinn Bolton : So the question on vertical power, I mean, just some different competitors, may mean different things when they're talking about vertical power. And I just wanted to kind of get your guys' view on the market. When you guys talk about vertical power, is that true vertical power where the voltage regulator is sitting underneath the processor substrate and supplying current vertically into the processor? Or do you guys consider sort of stacked packages, where you've got one or more voltage regulators, or phases in a module with the power inductors and capacitors, and other things that might be stacked vertically, but still delivering current laterally into the processor? What's your definition of vertical? Because I think there's some confusion in the market of what may be vertical and what might look vertical, but actually still supply current laterally? Michael Hsing : Yes, you're right. There's one is some customers so Quinn and using the top surface lateral power supply, which is like a very similar to server, the server CPU power supply. And other ones turning into the backside, still lateral powers. And more advanced one is directly under the CPU. And so to answer the question, is MPS supply currently we're running all three solutions? Chip, all modules, we have everything there. Bernie Blegen : And Quinn, if I could also add to this that, the necessity for the different deliveries of power, is as you get into increasingly higher current and in addition to either lateral or vertical power, we also have liquid cooled that, we believe that we have a position on. Michael Hsing : Yes, to Quinn, to answer your question is that the most efficient and difficult to do, is you're making a module directly under the CPU. And that's the highest efficiency power delivery. There's a lot of a problem, and a lot of technical issues associated with that type of approach. So many companies take a conservative approach, okay? And some companies just do only like servers and top surface lateral power delivery. And for those very high powers, well over 1000 watt, all these powers, the power modules directly under the CPUs. And these are the highest efficiency. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Bernie. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open. Bernie Blegen : Chris, can you hear us? Chris Caso : Sorry, I was on mute. You can hear me now? Michael Hsing : Yes. Chris Caso : All right, sorry, thank you. The first question is on seasonality, and how that may be changing for you. In the past, the December quarter typically was a seasonally down quarter, but your business mix has changed quite a bit, since those days and the revenue is now coming from segments that are not as seasonally, not a seasonal December quarter. With that, how should we look at December seasonality going forward, or is the old model no longer appropriate, as we look forward? And if there's anything you want to comment on with respect to December? Michael Hsing : Yes, we're seeking advice from you. What's our seasonality? With a new business, with all these inventory oscillation from our customers, and we don't know so came in - you have a huge shortage, then it comes up the huge over supplies, and okay now, the main, I assume, and our customers consumes all these excessive inventory. Now the market is waking up. And is there another shortage? I don't know. And it's difficult to forecast. And - the lead time is still very short. Chris Caso : Okay. So we'll do our best for everything good thing? Michael Hsing : Yes, yes. You can tell us. Chris Caso : All right. That's fair enough. As my follow-up question, I wanted to follow-up with vertical power as well. And what we know, particularly within the enterprise segment AI, we've got some higher wattage processors coming. Can you talk about what you expect for content on that, and what in particular you expect for vertical power next year? Because I know there's some debate, certainly doesn't seem to be debate over whether you're ready for vertical power, whether the ecosystem is ready for vertical power. And does that make a difference with regard to your content, as you go into the next generation of processors, because the wattage is certainly going higher? Michael Hsing : Yes, I can tell you this. Our customers will not be appreciated in talking about how many - dollar per their unit, or GPU unit, okay? And so, then they don't want us to talk about it. And second, I don't know, I don't want to know about it. Chris Caso : Okay. Understand, but I mean, in just in terms of the opportunity, maybe you could speak in more general terms about the opportunity that's available to you? Michael Hsing : Oh, sure, yes. And now you look at our revenues, right? Okay, for a couple of companies, okay, and from last year, was like a what, it's a 1% or 2%, or maybe last year's, okay, couple of percentage our total revenue. Well, today, so like we're running like a what, 20%? And 20%, so that's a full $500 million, okay? And we were told this is at the beginning. And there's a lot of other companies, like where our opportunities and our design wing hasn't really ramped up in company like Google's and AWS and Meta. And those coming later. So I see the huge opportunities and I do see, okay, this is not MPS only, but the market's way too big. We don't want to turn into an AI company only. Chris Caso : Yes, I think the only thing I'd probably had on top of that besides for the direct AI opportunity, I think you've heard us talk about the AI trickle-down effect, whether that can be memory, it can be optical, it can be pulled through of networking. I think there's a lot of opportunity for MPS, beyond even the direct AI business? Michael Hsing : That's a good comment, yes. Chris Caso : Right, appreciate those comments. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you, Michael, Bernie. And congrats again on another stellar quarter. I wanted to follow-up on enterprise data, but I'm going to move away from the processor power management, and ask you more about opportunities elsewhere in the data center, especially power supply. I know historically you haven't talked a whole lot about GAN, silicon carbide, but I'm pretty sure you have some activities there. So can you elaborate a little bit on what you're doing on the power supply side of data centers? Michael Hsing : Yes, I like that one. Okay, I like that one. But I can't tell you the revenue yet, but it's a small, okay? And we, in the since 2016, and again, we start to develop our own silicon carbide. We're not selling expense. It will be a part of our solutions. I said very, very early, so we're not intending to sell a fit [ph] as a power device only. So now, we designed those three kilowatt, six kilowatt, 12 kilowatt power supply. And you guess what? It's a data center. It's a data evaluating, so we have a very little revenues, but the biggest is the MPS only, owned. All our test plot, we're using a huge amount of power supply, and MPS is our own customers. All these testing equipment that we have to design, we have to invent it, how to test these modules particularly, and also as well as burning. And MPS supply these power modules to our vendors, and our vendors are in problem went into these systems and it became our test equipment. And so, that's the revenues we start to generating. And but for 4G and for data centers, and these are still in the, well, we engage them a year ago or so, couple years ago. And so, the revenues small, but we're looking for the big revenues from that segment, because MPS provides the highest efficiency and the smaller size. Tore Svanberg : Yes, that's great perspective. As my follow-up, I recall, because we've gone through a few cycles together, I recall usually you use downturns to gain a lot of share. I know everyone's excited about data centers today, but what are some of the areas, where you're starting to see more meaningful share gains from a designer perspective, now that we're sort of navigating here at the bottom of the cycle? Bernie Blegen : Sure, so I think that we've been very clear about the positioning that we have an automotive, and how that's continuing to grow across multitude of different platforms with a multitude of different Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs. I think the most recent area for improvement where somebody's Greenfield opportunities, are becoming more visible in market, would be in particular with communications. We're seeing that in the wireless and 5G, and I think that we've seen some early indications of continuing investment in that segment. So I'd say that's probably the area that will be most visible, but obviously I don't want to forget industrial, which even though right now, is a relatively modest part of our business. And it's not shown a lot of momentum towards growth, probably is the next area, where we have a lot of Greenfield opportunities that will materialize in the next four quarters. Michael Hsing : Yes, go ahead. Tore Svanberg : Yes, I was just going to ask, and the RV market, is that going to be under auto or industrial? Michael Hsing : RV? Tore Svanberg : The RV market, the Kemppi car market, I know you've talked about that? Michael Hsing : Oh yes. No, no. Yes, okay. That's one of my favorite ones. Okay, yes, okay. And I think it's going to be in industrial market. Because share - all these products share the same signatures as we do for data centers for our own test plot and for test equipment, okay? We'll be very much shared the same characteristics and also for robotics. And especially for those moving, not stationary robot. And these robots move around, and they all need that type of a power supply and the charging and the battery management. And these all share very much the same characteristics as RVs, okay RVs happen. Tore Svanberg : Yes, those could be industrial or consumer or even the humanoid stuff too. So I don't think I want to just put those...? Michael Hsing : I think it's a - we're probably in the industrial side. Yes, okay, yes. Tore Svanberg : Sounds good. Thank you and congrats again. Michael Hsing : Okay. Thanks, Tore. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hi guys, just wanted to add a quick follow-up question. There have been a few semiconductor companies this earnings season that have sort of mentioned having licenses to - Huawei being revoked in the quarter. And it's raised some questions from investors. I just wondering if you guys could address do you have a license to ship to Huawei? If you did, has it been revoked? Is that, is there any real exposure at MPS to that customer? It's obviously not impacting your near-term outlook, but I figured I just asked, because we've gotten a number of questions on potential Huawei exposure, across the semi coverage? Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Quinn, I can make this pretty simple. We don't have any licensing or contractual arrangements with Huawei that are at all. So they can't be canceled. Any business we have with them has always just done on a PO basis, and we have no indication of a change in their relationship. Quinn Bolton : So Bernie, I guess there was more that export license question. Do you need an export license to ship to them? I think that's what's sort of price? Michael Hsing : Yes, our product is not, not like in the 20, below 24 nanometer or whatever, that we are not, as far as I know. Bernie Blegen : Yes, you're right. Michael Hsing : And as far as I know, we're not subjected to the export limit, have any limitations. And, but we will talk to our, to answer your question precisely, I will consult our legal counsels. Quinn Bolton : Yes, okay. Okay. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter conference call, which will likely be in late October. Thank you, have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Genevieve Cunningham : Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO; and Tony Balow, Vice President of Finance. Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, MPS released a written commentary on the results of our operations. Both of these documents can be found on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone, that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainty. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today and we assume no obligation to update this information. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Bernie Blegen : Thanks, Gen. Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q3 '24 earnings call. MPS achieved record quarterly revenue of $620.1 million, 22% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2024 and 30% higher than revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Our performance during the quarter reflected the strength of our diversified market strategy as we experienced improved ordering trends across most end markets and additionally benefited from initial revenue ramps associated with design wins secured in prior years. Let me call out a few highlights. Q3 2024 automotive revenue was up 28% sequentially with improvements in infotainment, lighting, ADAS, and body controls. Communication revenue was up 65% from the prior quarter, reflecting new product ramps for Wi-Fi, optical, networking, and router solutions. Storage and Compute revenue was up 25% sequentially on the strength of demand for DDR5 and SSD memory and notebooks. MPS continues to focus on innovation, solving our customers' most challenging problems, and maintaining the highest level of quality. In addition, we continue to expand and diversify our global supply chain, which will allow us to capture future growth, maintain supply chain stability, and swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. Our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact as we continue our transformation from being a chip-only semiconductor supplier to a full-service silicon-based solutions provider. I'll now open the webinar up for questions. Operator : Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Thanks and congrats to you guys. I guess I've got a two-part question if I could. The first is on enterprise data. It looked like it was down about 15% sequentially. I don't know if you could give some color on that. Is that one-time in nature? Or does that reflect a more sustained shift in that segment as we look into 4Q and then into '25? And then my second part of my question, I mean, it looked like auto, I knew you listed a few of them Bernie, automotive, industrial comps, consumer all look like they were up pretty materially sequentially. So is that -- how would you characterize those segments, which have sort of been lagging the last few quarters? Do you feel like those have made the turn? Bernie Blegen : Sure, Rick. This is Bernie. Let me start with the enterprise data. Sequentially, we were down about 1.5% from Q2. And that a couple of things that we've talked about. One is that, we don't control our customers' ordering patterns. So as it relates to the current quarter, we did see a different ordering trend than we'd observed in each of the past six quarters. And then as far as looking ahead, we've been very open about the fact that as far as supply chain security for our customers, that's going to require a second or third competitor to introduce -- be introduced on the share. And so there's a lot of issues here that we've been talking about and that we're managing. But one very important point is that MPS's strength is in the diversity and we don't try to call out a particular end market's results. We try to deliver the company in total. And that's sort of a short-term view, but Michael may have a couple of comments on longer-term view. Michael Hsing : Yeah. You probably everybody knows that if you look at the transcript from the last year, we talk about it. The market is big and the market is growing. Well the AI requirements is growing. And so the customers initially will take the -- always take the best solutions and to fulfill their needs. And the best solutions and also the speed of the development service, as you, as Bernie said earlier. And that's why we occupied as a pretty large shares, okay? And I mean, last year, we said that, okay, this market is too big and MPS will be always have a best solutions in these applications. And we will talk -- we also talk about in a -- the market is bigger, there will be a second or third and fourth supply to join this segment. And okay and this is the -- and when would have happen? And we don't know, okay. It happened in the last couple of quarters and they gave me in the next years. What we see that, again, the market is growing very fast. We have other ones like SOC side of market segment and like it hasn't really ramped up yet or started ramping. And the other ones like -- other hyperscale like company -- cloud computing companies and their own SOCs and their own TPUs, they call it the tensor processes system. And that those one is our -- still small. We're ramping in the next few quarters, okay? And as Bernie said that, MPS in the past, we always emphasized diversity and we will not be known to be a AI power supply company. Bernie Blegen : And then, Rick, I think you had a question as far as automotive and whether or not the step up that we observed from Q2 to Q3 was more of a broader trend line or if it was a one-time event. And this we believe is a step up where a lot of design wins have been waiting in the pipeline for the right opportunity. And so we do believe that specific to us, not a discussion about the broader market, but specific to us that the number of product ramps are expected to come into the next -- come into the stream in the next two or three quarters. Michael Hsing : Well, again, okay, as we -- as we said many, many years ago, there's a lot of new design wins. And when the ramp will take off, we don't know. It will be plus minus a year or so. Do we care? We don't, okay? And then now all these greenfield products start to rejuvenate and that's what you see in the revenue to date. Tony Balow : And maybe one more comment just for Rick is that, traditionally, we've been talking about strength in ADAS, but what you heard Bernie talk about was, we saw that strength in automotive across kind of all the segments, including infotainment, body controls, really a sign of those sockets that we had won previously now start generating revenue. So it's more broad-based within automotive than maybe we talked about previously. Rick Schafer : Thanks for all that color, you guys. And maybe, right on that point on auto specifically. I realize that this is a broad-based pickup and it's some place basically design win driven as all things are with you guys. But I'm curious, specific, I mean, NVIDIA did believe it did really well the last year or two with drive, Warren, and I know you guys do power there. So I didn't know if you could talk specifically about China auto and what content trends look like for you guys there and maybe give a sense of how big China auto is now as sort of a portion of your overall auto segment. Thanks a lot. Michael Hsing : Well, China is again, EV business is booming. And now the tapered off a little bit and looks like it will -- booming again. And we're going in the right direction again, okay. And there's a lot of requirements. And the infotainment and the new type of infotainment and also the ADAS, okay. It's widely adopted in China. And so that's what we see a bigger portion of it is ramping from China. And also we see it in the -- and other than ADAS, okay, we see a lot of other products and grow -- will grow in -- from Germany -- in Germany and in the US. Rick Schafer : Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you, and congratulations on the record revenue. I wanted to follow up on enterprise data. Obviously, you had two very strong quarters, first half of the year, it took a breather this quarter. But how should we think about that business into the December quarter? And Michael, I know you talked about many new product ramps in 2025, but just sort of specifically for Q4, how should we expect that business to perform? Michael Hsing : As far as I know, Q4, we don't lose any shares and probably it's going in the -- it was the same as the forecast. Okay, we don't, okay, we don't -- we can't really tell. And this forecast was given us to us in a few quarters ago. And we just fulfill that, fulfill the demand. So we'll have a -- that's what we built for me -- in the last couple of quarters. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. And I think as we look to the outlook and the guidance that we provided, really enterprise data was somewhere in the plus low-single-digits. So again, our customers ordering patterns are really what drives the performance there. Tore Svanberg : No, that's very fair. And the one big surprise to me this quarter was communications. I think it was your strongest growth segment this quarter. You highlighted Wi-Fi optical networking. Could you maybe just give us a little bit more color what's going on there? I mean, it does sound like you have some new segments there that you are penetrating, especially on the optical side. Michael Hsing : Well, the opticals, okay, is a data converter, data communications, within the data centers, okay, within the reps, okay. And that's a portion of it. But that's not all of them, okay. Other one is the new Wi-Fi format and okay start to ramping up. That's the MPS will have a lot of reference designs and that's what we see. It's across the continent. All these projects turning to a revenue now. Tony Balow : So I think the outlook for, again MPS specifically remains very solid. Generally, after you have a big initial stocking in the quarter with a new revenue ramp, it tends to tail off for a quarter, but we see sustainable growth in communications through the first half of '25. Tore Svanberg : Great. Thank you for the color. I'll go back in line. Operator : Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open. Joshua Buchalter : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I think in response to Rick's question, you mentioned two factors that sort of drove the flattening out of enterprise data being order patterns and second sourcing. I guess could you -- or could you maybe rank order which one of those had the bigger impact near-term? And in particular, as we think about your customers diversifying their suppliers, are you seeing this more on AI accelerator platforms that are already in the market or is this tied to the newer platforms that are currently ramping? Thank you. Bernie Blegen : So I think Michael offered that in Q4, we're not expecting Q3 and Q4 to see share position change. So that was really just trying to acknowledge that is a function of being the market leader in the AI. And then over time, as we see a layering of all these new AI opportunities, Michael referred to the TPUs, which will probably begin to ship late. Michael Hsing : I don't know if the TPU is what I remember is the TPU maybe is -- maybe Google's name, a trademark name. To me it's a tensor processor. Tony Balow : Tensor processor. Michael Hsing : Yeah it's all -- that's what we mean. And it's all really -- some of you in the call referred this as SOCs. And we have many design, we engage with many of our customers in many years ago. And those products is actually we see start to ramp in the last quarter. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Okay. Joshua Buchalter : Thank you for the color. And I realize you've got content in multiple different sockets on many of these accelerator cards. And so my question is going to try to oversimplify it. But how should we think about, as we think about some of these new AI accelerator platforms, your content opportunity may be in relationship to power draw of the actual processors or any other helpful Rules of Thumbs you can give us as we try to fine-tune our models in the next year. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Well, you said, if you believe so like I hope and -- if you believe as we believe, our products, our solution is the best and the most power efficient and the market is bigger. And that portion of our revenue will grow. The rest of the stuff, I don't get -- I don't -- we don't care. Just let it happen. Let the numbers speaks up. Joshua Buchalter : Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open. Chris Caso : Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess, the first question, as we look at your guidance for the December quarter, not a lot changing on a sequential basis. I think you mentioned that the enterprise data will be up low-single-digits sequentially in December. Anything else that you would call out as kind of growing or shrinking different from the average in December? And then following that, given that enterprise data has grown as a percentage of revenue, does that affect seasonality as you look into the March quarter? Is there anything we should be thinking about with respect to the different customer mix as we go into March? Bernie Blegen : Sure. If you're looking at Q4 by end market, it's interesting you have some seasonality, but currently, we don't believe that any of the end markets are going to change by more than plus or minus mid-single-digits. So it's a very, very narrow range that we're talking about there. And when we look out into the momentum carried into '25, obviously, we don't guide beyond Q4, but it has been seasonally down quarter for a lot of companies, but I don't have a view on what that's going to look like currently. Chris Caso : Okay. Thank you. Michael Hsing : We don't, especially, we don't really care. So as long as we have a design, we design and we are in the project with our customers. And when those ramps start to happen, our customer -- they don't have a clear view. And let those products -- let take its own calls, let the numbers speak itself. Chris Caso : Okay. As a follow-up, as you look into next year, the other part of your enterprise data business on traditional server, that's an area that you guys have been favorable on for a while, but I guess, you've been waiting for the market to improve. We heard some a little better news from at least one of the CPU vendors this week. Can you give some view of kind of the share content, what you're seeing in that part of the enterprise data business as you go into 2025? Michael Hsing : Yes. It's a good question. Yes, we do see it, and the volumes started picking up. And as we said many quarters -- many years ago and this was -- this rapid sapphire of something. And the VR 14, we will pick up the shares in the 13.5, by serendipity of a shortage and we prove with significant suppliers in that. And VR 14 and what will be a significant, well, one of the big supply in -- in this rapid sapphire growth. Tony Balow : And maybe just beyond just the enterprise data segment itself, as you see those ramp, right, they'll pull through other solutions like DDR5 memory and continue to be a tailwind in some of the other segments as well. Chris Caso : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, I know you often are involved in some interesting sort of sometimes idiosyncratic growth drivers for the company. I know for some time, you were famously tinkering in the automotive end market and sort of searching for more effective solutions than what was available in the market. And I understand your focus has been perhaps more in the home automation market more recently. And I wonder if you can talk to us about, some things that might be on the come in the next couple of years from the company in that end market. Michael Hsing : Yes. As you know, it's an MPS have a few thousands of our products. So we're in lighting, we're in -- we are in a thermostat and we are in shades controls and we're in all these fan models and security, the window actuators, and the window and door opening actuators. And we're also making MCU now. And those MCU can be a brain of everything while we're just putting the one box and we're putting one box with the software. So and we sell as a kit. Everything is -- everything including it. It's the key is the ease of use. I think this will change the market segment for building automations. William Stein : That's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up, you mentioned, your MCUs now. There's another category that you entered relatively recently. You're not really known for it as much, but data converters. I know I think you hired a team in that area and you had some very good results for initial product, maybe in the medical end market. Can you talk about traction in that category, please? Michael Hsing : We are growing in that segment. The revenue is still small. As you know, these are -- these are design cycles is very long. And also the product life cycles 10, 20 years. I mean they will last forever. And those segments win-win some in some industrial side as well as the medical side. And we have -- as we have more product rolling out as a matter of fact in the next couple of quarters some family of standard product. We will gain more market shares in this segment. William Stein : Great. Thank you. Michael Hsing : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a questions. I want to go back to the non-enterprise data side, I think by my math, it was up about 35%, 36% sequentially. I know, you guys have a ton of design wins and you're kind of just waiting for them to ramp, but the magnitude of that ramp, the diversity of it, and just the commentary that bookings are improving seems to be at odds with the very muted recovery that so many of the peers are seeing. So could you just explain, do you think cyclical conditions are getting better or is this a very Monolithic power-specific dynamic? Any sort of color on that. Bernie Blegen : I think, Ross, we're experiencing a little bit of both. Is somebody? Michael Hsing : House, can you mute it? Yeah. Okay. You can mute it. Yeah. Okay. Bernie Blegen : So, Ross, you're asking the difference between growth specific to us and what we're seeing in the market. And in the current quarter or let me go back, the previous quarter, we actually saw improvements in our ordering patterns. But they're not a consistent trend. But what we saw in the current quarter was a lot of new revenue opportunities that we received from design wins secured in previous years that were coming to market now, particularly in the communications, particularly in automotive. And then also we saw an improvement in the overall profile of the memory market. Michael Hsing : Well, as a matter of fact, we see all across the board. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Michael Hsing : Other than AI. Other than AI power and all across the board. Ross Seymore : And how are you -- I guess as my follow-up, whether it's in the AI side or otherwise, a lot of supply has been added to the market over the last couple of years to address shortages, et cetera. And so a fear people have is that pricing pressure is going to ensue, whether it's more competition in AI power that you mentioned earlier or just a more aggregate holistic increase in pricing pressure. Are you guys seeing any evidence of that? Michael Hsing : Well, our competitors also some of the Chinese suppliers and they always want to lower the price to get in the market to get in the socket. That's not the game what we played. And so a lot of the -- our customers they don't change those socket. They don't change the -- our products can swap in -- and quickly. And those kind of things is in a -- and also to the way we emphasize diversity. So not in one segment. It has a lot of shipments and a lot of volumes going into the one particular applications. And for example like AI and we will provide the value. Our value is the highest performance. And all the other products let our customers choose and so the history is telling us, our history short, and as we -- as long as we operate in the same principles and the revenue will keep growing and growing the same way. And we see the next couple of years, especially next year, we see -- all these products will grow. And now this is -- which is to see the first sign of it, and all these design win turning into the revenue now. Ross Seymore : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first to start off, I think it was for the first time ever in your June 10-Q, you guys disclosed a 10% plus customer. And I'm wondering, I know you haven't filed the Q yet, but if that's going to be an ongoing disclosure, would you be able to provide us if you had any 10% customers in the June, sorry, September quarter? And if so, what percent of revenue was that customer? Bernie Blegen : So, Quinn, what you're referencing is basically revenue exposure by direct customer and indirect. And when the customer hits a certain threshold according to the SEC guidelines, we need to put a reference to that. Michael Hsing : But we're never putting a name out there. Bernie Blegen : No, no. We do not. Michael Hsing : Yes, this time, we have -- still have a one customer is bigger than 10%. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Michael Hsing : Bernie, you can check that numbers. Is that right? Only two customers and above 10%. Quinn Bolton : Okay. And we'll get percentages in the Q. Bernie Blegen : It's one or two. Michael Hsing : Yeah, I think, it's one or two. You can check that. I believe it's one. Bernie you can check that. No, it's only one. Two will be very big. I don't -- I don't believe the numbers. Bernie Blegen : We don't. We don't. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Quinn Bolton : Okay. The second question is, I know, you don't want to guide to 2025 yet. Michael Hsing : Hold on a second. Tony, could you -- Bernie Blegen : Check that? Michael Hsing : Yeah, could you check that, is that one or two? I think the second one is less than 4%. Tony Balow : Yes, I'll check it. Give me 10 seconds, so I'll get back to you. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Yeah. So we are, okay, this had to be on our record. And then let's make it clear. Go ahead. Quinn Bolton : Yes. Maybe while we're waiting for Tony, my second question was, I know you're not going to sort of give a specific guidance out to 2025, but The Street is looking for continued pretty strong growth in the enterprise data segment. I know you've talked about lots of crosscurrents in terms of expecting some additional competition to enter that market, some pricing pressure at existing customers, but you also have the ASIC designs that start to ramp next year. The Street is kind of looking for that business to hit almost $1.1 billion in revenue. And just wondering is that given your crystal ball, is that sort of a reasonable expectation? Do you think that we should be tempering expectations for that segment, given some of the cross-currents you've mentioned or do you want to just kind of keep it one quarter at a time? Michael Hsing : Yes, I can tell very confident, confidently we will be, okay, let's say that. And when this market -- when this AI market turn into like a regular server market, MPS will be a significant player in that. And now this is not -- became a, what do you call it, reach to an equilibrium yet. Bernie Blegen : Not a run rate. Michael Hsing : No, yeah, this is still ramping up. And when this segment is ramping -- when you start to ramping, it's kind of lumpy. You don't see this thing, okay, you don't see -- you can't keep going forever like the first two -- since last year and the first -- in the first couple of this quarters like our first couple of quarter in this year. And next -- and so to answer your question for next year, clearly, so we have a lot more customers as I said earlier, that will start to ramping those designs will turn into -- those design will turn into revenues. Tony Balow : Michael, just to circle back relative to distie, we'll call out two, for direct, we'll call out one. Bernie Blegen : Okay. That's a direct customer, not a distie. Tony Balow : So we'll call one direct. We'll call out multiple distie is higher than 10%. Michael Hsing : Yeah, well, distie will never come, and because all the reporting we -- that's in the reporting, all the design creation, all the exposures for the end customer is only one. The next one is, I believe, is a less than -- is about definitely is below 5%. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Bernie. Michael Hsing : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. I had a similar question to Quinn, but thinking more about vertical power. So enterprise data this year more than $700 million. I assume the contribution from vertical power is still quite low. And if that's the case, as the market does transition to vertical power, could we see this market base basically even accelerate over the next few years? Michael Hsing : Absolutely. Not in next few years, next few quarters. Yes. We -- as we said, look, we are playing the power module market segments in -- since 2017. And all these technology, all these manufacturing capabilities and that will really benefit for these vertical power. And as speaking, now we are shipping those products in good volumes. Tore Svanberg : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me get a little follow-up snuck in here. Inventory, I know Michael, you and I have laughed about that in many times like this in the past. Michael Hsing : That's my favorite topic. Ross Seymore : There you go. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Ross Seymore : In this instance, internal inventory came down by a lot days-wise. What did external channel do? How are you looking at that? Was some of that 35% sequential growth that I referred to in my initial question a little bit ago, inventory fill, or has the channel stayed lean? Bernie Blegen : No, the channel stayed lean. In fact, our total days went down in the quarter. Michael Hsing : Well, we want to -- this is not good. We want to build up. And as always, we build the inventory in the -- it's not synced with the market demand. And you see our -- Ross, okay, you're the expert of MPS inventory. If you checked like our inventory levels, it's the opposite of the market demand. And now the market demand for MPS now is very high. So the inventory is low and we don't think that we're going to reign to a shortage issue, but it's at the inventory level is at the uncomfortable level. Ross Seymore : Got you. And I guess just to clarify, Bernie, when you said total inventory actually went down, you mean just total channel inventory days fell. Bernie Blegen : Total channel inventory, yes. Michael Hsing : Channel inventory is also low. yeah. Ross Seymore : Got it. Okay. That's it. Thanks guys. Operator : This now concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again in our fourth quarter conference call, which is likely to be in early February. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of Monolithic Power Systems, Inc., Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO, and Tony Balow, Vice President of Finance. Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. released a written commentary on the results of our operations. Both documents can be found on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. That involves risk and uncertainty. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q4 2024 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update this information. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Thanks, Jen. Bernie Blegen : Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q4 2024 earnings call. In 2024, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. posted its thirteenth consecutive year of growth with full-year revenue of $2.2 billion, up 21% from 2023. For Q4 2024, we had record quarterly revenue of $621.7 million, above Q3 2024 and 37% higher than the fourth quarter of 2023. This performance reflected the strength of our diversified market strategy, consistent execution, continued innovation, and strong customer focus. Let me call out a few highlights from 2024. We introduced the silicon carbide inverter for high-powered clean energy applications. Initial revenue is expected to ramp in late 2025. Other silicon carbide-based applications are expected to be introduced in multiple geographies during both 2025 and 2026. We developed a family of high-quality, cost-effective automotive audio products utilizing DSP technology from our 2024 XSign acquisition powered by Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. solutions. For enterprise notebooks, we launched a battery management solution and are sampling a new mini phase power stage. These products enable faster charge time and significantly improve notebook battery life. Building on our first analog-to-digital converter design win in 2024, we are developing new high-accuracy 24-bit converters, which are expected to ramp in the second half of 2025. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. continues to focus on innovation, solving our customers' most challenging problems, and maintaining the highest level of quality. We continue to invest in new technology, expand into new markets, and diversify our end market applications and global supply chain. This will allow us to capture future growth opportunities, maintain supply chain stability, and swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. Finally, I'm pleased to announce our quarterly dividend will increase 25% to $1.56 per share. And during Q4 2024, we completed share repurchases under a 2023 $640 million authorization. This week, our board of directors authorized a new $500 million three-year share repurchase program. For the three years ending December 2024, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. has returned 86% of its free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid. Our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact as we continue our transformation from being a chip-only semiconductor supplier to a full-service silicon-based solutions provider. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Thank you, Bernie. Genevieve Cunningham : Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. As a reminder, participants can click on the menu bar and then click the raise hand button. Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you, and congratulations on the solid results. Michael Hsing : Either Michael or Bernie, could you talk a little bit about the dynamics here in the March quarter, especially by segment? You know, obviously, we know some end markets are still soft, yet others are actually quite healthy. So any more color on how you see the various segments in the March quarter would be really helpful. Bernie Blegen : Sure. As far as our Q1 outlook, I think we need to take the perspective that relative to the size of the market, we're a fairly small player. But we have a lot of greenfield design wins which have been previously delayed that are now starting to ramp as we enter 2025. So when we look at two of the areas that are going to drive most of the growth in the quarter, automotive is continuing to grow, and communications, where we launched some new products in Q3, are bouncing back from Q4 and will continue strong. Memory's demand profile is also very good, and notebooks look to be having a Q1 uplift. We don't know for sure, but we've had many design wins and believe that those are coming into the market. On industrial consumer, we have a lot of new product ramps that are likely to start to contribute at the end of 2025. And on the enterprise data, it will be down. Tore Svanberg : Very good. And as my follow-up on enterprise data, how should we think about that business throughout calendar 2025? Again, obviously, a lot of different dynamics, you know, different players. You know, the growth trajectory for that business throughout calendar 2025. Any color you can share with us there? Bernie Blegen : Yeah. We don't talk about it in the near terms in the specific customers as we always do. So, again, I mean, the near term is that we can control our customers' buying pattern, their allocations, and the like, but overall, this is a multi-billion-dollar market segment. We are getting ready for these next few years in the growth, and it's clearly a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. But for us, in near terms, this year could be even or maybe slightly up. Okay. We is our best guess. We don't know. Michael Hsing : Yeah. Just to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. So we have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers. So as Michael just said, we believe it's likely to be a flattish year, but we believe that from a quality and supply availability perspective, we're in very good shape. Tore Svanberg : That's fair. Congrats again on the results. Bernie Blegen : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. Rick Schafer : Yeah. Thanks, guys. I'll add my congratulations. And if I could maybe tack on to the back of Tore's question, I was wondering if you could update us maybe just to give us a sense of the number of accelerated projects that you expect to ramp this year and into 2026. Just to kind of get a sense. I heard you loud and clear, Michael, that this is a billion-dollar-plus TAM. I'm just trying to get a sense of how... Michael Hsing : It's a multiple billion. Oh, multiple billion. Yeah. Don't be shy about that. We're not shy on it. No. Okay. We don't want to lose that. Okay? Tony Balow : Rick, this is Tony. I'll jump in. I think what we want to say is we're engaged across all the hyperscalers, but what you heard Michael say was that the exact timing of the ramp is very difficult for us to call. So I don't think we want to put a specific number of customers or exact ramp times out there other than saying that we're engaged broadly across them. As Bernie said, we believe that's going to scale through the second half. Michael Hsing : I can give you examples. And we foresee that these projects are going to ramp. In 2022, 2023, you look at the automotive side. We said that we have a lot of design wins. And we said, oh, these are going to ramp up, or we put a lot have a lot of inventories. And, 2023 is kind of flattish years. Our customer delayed their launch, so 2023 affected us. But I keep saying it. We don't really care. So, like, and as long as we have a product and it's designing, and designing their new product, especially to look and we're turning to a revenue plus minus twelve months, eighteen months. Bernie Blegen : And if I could just add to Michael's comments there. When you look at automotive, it was delayed not just in 2023, but also in the first half of 2024 against what we had built inventory and against our expectations. But now, as you can see, it's very solidly on track with two consecutive quarters of growth. And likewise, you could apply that same formula to what we're seeing in the communications with the release of the fiber optics in the data center. So we have the technology, but where it intersects and ramps in the market, a lot of that's a little bit out of our control. Michael Hsing : Well, you mean the directly AI powers. Okay. We have so many projects working with multiple hyperscale companies, and so we cannot tell which one is, well, ramping first. Okay? I know what the magnitude of ramping. Just we are getting the supply chain ready, get our quality testing facility ready to receive these revenues. Okay. Turning to these revenues. And so the timing we care less. Rick Schafer : Thanks for all that color, Michael. You know, funny you're talking about auto because that's my second question if I could. You know, the EV conversion to 48-volt power and to 800-volt batteries is sort of set to ramp this year, I believe, and I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks, Bernie, you know, that you're going to be shipping power isolation content. Second half, I think I heard you say, and I believe EV is about three-quarters of your auto business. So I just wondered if you could talk us through sort of what your potential content given all those changes, right, all these additional drivers, you know, what your content looks like last year or potential content per vehicle versus what it looks like, you know, in 2025 with all these new jump balls. Michael Hsing : Some very good questions. And we mentioned about 48-volt system many, many years ago. Okay? And particularly for auto, now, it became a hot topic. And we have all these products ready. We're designing those new vehicles. And these have a base on 48-volt systems. We can capture a lot. And, when once their product once their vehicles are ramping up, put on the market, and initially, we'll be another dominant player. Bernie Blegen : And I think that this is the rollout in automotive starts with EV, which is quicker to adapt new technologies onto their platform, but we expect it to continue for multiyear. Michael Hsing : Yep. Again, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. provides a 48-volt integrated solution. And all of these high-power modules are all based on the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. silicon solutions. And those will significantly change all these discrete ways of doing it, accruing together, the 48-volt solutions. So that definitely sets Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. apart from the rest of our competitors. Bernie Blegen : And, Rick, beyond just pure 48-volt, remember what you saw beginning Q3 was, you know, designs outside of ADAS start to hit the market. We saw more broad-based growth in the auto segment. We'd expect that to continue as additional sockets come to market. So I think that's the other dynamic that's happening as well. Rick Schafer : Great. Thanks, you guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Seymore : Can you hear me now? Bernie Blegen : Yep. Yep. Hi, Ross. Ross Seymore : Perfect. Hi there. Just want to revisit the enterprise data side of things and, you know, not to overplay that. But the market share gains and dynamics in server CPU side of things, has that changed at all? Because I, you know, I think everybody knows what's going on with key customers and the diversification, you know, market share shifts and those sorts of things. But do you guys have other things that are happening as we speak as well? So I really wanted to focus on the dynamics outside of those, not just with the ASIC providers and other GPU providers, but also with the CPU market share and servers. So any update on that would be helpful. Michael Hsing : Ross, so let me say something else first. Our inventory is low and the channel inventory is low. We're ramping up. Bernie Blegen : I didn't know if I had to follow-up on that. It's a very good question. And let me just give you a little bit of what we're seeing. It's a fast-changing landscape. And what I mean by that, it's difficult to offer commentary on enterprise data in its different components. The lines between CPU and GPU are becoming blurry, and in support of both lines of business, we have a lot of standard products. So while we've historically had better visibility in the separation and track them a little more easily, it's hard for us to make more than just a generalized comment about what direction either market segment's going in. Michael Hsing : Yeah. I mean, I've added that. Okay. We are getting significant shares on the server side. And once you see the server market start to ramping up, well, the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. revenue will ramp with it. Ross Seymore : Great. I guess as my non-inventory follow-up, the communication side, you guys did well in that in the second half of the year. It's a little bit choppy still, but can you just give us an idea of the profile of that business? Much is kind of the old comms versus the new comms, and give us a little bit more color on what the growth driver is that gives you the confidence for the year and, you know, I assume it's on the optical side of things, but just a little more details on that would be helpful. Michael Hsing : We're all laughing, Sanjay. And would you say the beginning of the question so Okay. It was comms. Right? Ross? Yeah. And the communications. Ross Seymore : Side, it just you know, you guys have been talking about that growing for many, many years, and it finally did last year. But I know there's some, you know, legacy pieces and some new pieces, so I just wanted to try to get some color on the difference between them. Tony Balow : Yeah. Ross, I think you kind of hit it when you were asking the question. Right? If you could comp us going forward, the area of strength that we've really been calling out is an optical. And we'd expect that to continue as part of the overall data center opportunity that you heard Michael talk about. So I think that's probably the biggest inflection point that you've seen in the past couple of quarters versus legacy business. Ross Seymore : Got it. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Gary Mobley of Loop Capital. Gary, your line is now open. Gary Mobley : Hey, guys. Let me extend my congratulations as well. I wanted to start with a housekeeping question. Are there any greater than ten percent customers in fiscal year 2024? And if you can't name the customer, can you at least give us a sense of how big that customer was in the year? Bernie Blegen : Certainly. For the three quarters Q1, Q2, Q3 in our 10-Q, we said that we had two direct customers which are distributors that were greater than ten percent and one indirect customer that was greater than ten percent, and that carries through for the full year as well. Gary Mobley : Okay. But you can't give us a number that will publish in the 10-K in terms of the percentage of revenue from that direct customer? Bernie Blegen : Not at this time. Gary Mobley : I tried. Bernie Blegen : Alright. Gary Mobley : Wanted to ask about revenue diversification outside of your traditional power management market. And if I count correctly, there's maybe four shots on goal, and you highlighted some of those in your press release. And that would be, you know, data converters, silicon carbide, DSP audio, and battery management systems. So my question is, you know, how big in revenue terms could that be, and if this fiscal year 2026 time frame? Or said differently, how much of a growth catalyst can be on top of what you're producing in traditional power management? Michael Hsing : Traditional power management, they're talking about these are low voltage things that if it's what you mean. And, okay, the silicon carbide is, of course, to me, is also in the power management. And, again, but these are much higher powers, not high very high power management. We don't want to put on the numbers, but these are, again, it's a billion, a couple billion dollar opportunity for all of them. For Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. I don't want to put a timeline on it. Okay. Tony Balow : I was I know it says, you know, we picked a couple for the script, but we only, you know, could put a few in for time. But I think our strategy continues to be plant a lot of seeds in a lot of different areas that can turn into revenue as the market decides what to prioritize. Michael Hsing : Oh, that's a good point. And they I only yeah. We on March 20th, we have an analyst day. And that game. And this time, you come over, you will see a lot of showcase on the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. new technologies. And these all will contribute in the next few years of growth. Okay. And if you want to hang on what what is the numbers, okay, I would say that, okay, if you look at the past before Monolithic Power Systems, Inc., what the model it is. We will I don't see anything any reason we should change. Okay? Sure. Faster or slower. Gary Mobley : Thanks, guys. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. I'll offer my congratulations as well. I guess, Bernie, Michael, obviously, a very strong start to the year in the March quarter. Your comments about enterprise data certainly sound like that business might be more second half weighted. And so I guess I'm just trying to think, you know, what what sort of revenue pattern would you expect, you know, through 2025? Is the first half, you know, slower, the second half materially stronger? Do you think that you have some puts and takes? And so it's a, you know, kind of more linear ramp through the year. Just any any sort of thoughts on the shape of revenue through 2025 would be would be helpful. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. So the comment that we made as far as the outlook for the year really looks at, you know, the design wins we've secured and an expectation of what is going to be ramping. Keep in mind, though, that particularly in the AI side of enterprise data, that that is tended to be very volatile and that we have relatively short lead times as far as when we get hard information or POs for actual delivery. So I think that within the context of, you know, what we believe is most likely to happen, we're very secure by saying a flattish year that's weighted to the back half, but how that curve actually plays out over the quarters is to be determined. Michael Hsing : Yep. Let me add it. Okay. Bernie said model to me is that these industries and, okay, these applications if you will, and again and very at the it is at the initial ramp. And so you're only involved with a we have a few customers. Now so, like, we talked about it before, so we have multiple customers. Okay. And they start to ramp. It's very good for Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. Very we will we've focused on the diversifications. And even within a single segment. Quinn Bolton : Well, kinda, I guess that was gonna be my my sort of second question just thinking about the enterprise data segment. Can you just give us a sense what you're seeing in terms of one, you know, like for like, pricing pressure and then two, I think some of the newer designs really move away from a silicon-only solution to much more of a module solution, and I assume that those carry much higher dollar content for you. And so do you see, you know, as you mix the customer, you ramp some of the new hyperscaler designs, do you think the blended ASP trends in that business even if you see some like for like pricing, could that go higher through the year as these new platforms ramp? Michael Hsing : Well, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. is going to stick with our models. In that game and margin models. We provide performance. If it doesn't fit the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. business model, we don't take those businesses. And so far, we're the leading suppliers in silicon as well as power modules. And so this is the reason we in a very short time, in the last twelve, twenty-four months, we have engaged with all these hyperscales. We have all these projects designed in it. And also we have many future products in development. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Thank you, Michael. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open. Chris Caso : Yes. Thanks. I guess just to start, I just want to make sure I understood correctly that some of the comments. So when you look at the enterprise data flattish for the year weighted to the back half, and I'm assuming that's the entirety of the enterprise data segment, not just that associated with AI. And, you know, maybe you could talk about how you know, you talked about some of the hyperscalers, some of the custom ramps happen in the second half of the year. Is that what's driving that strength in the back half of the year? What's kind of driving that back half weighting? Bernie Blegen : Chris, that's an accurate observation. It's as we look at the ramps for those SOCs and some of the tensor processor products that are expected to come out. We've been prototyping those, but the revenue ramps are really weighted to the second half. And in addition, some of our existing customers in the AI business in particular have multiple new products that they're ramping, and those will have different demand profiles as well. And then that's just within the enterprise data. I think another important ingredient is what we've referred to as the triple down effect as we see the other applications that are allied enterprise data or AI specifically in memory, optical, and networking, and all three of those are areas for growth as well during 2025. Chris Caso : Right. And I guess, you know, as you look at the full year, you know, obviously, you know, from what you guys are seeing and, you know, the better than seasonal Q1, you know, it's safe to say you're starting out a little better than, you know, some of the others in the space. You know, what's your thought as you go through the year? I mean, is there any lumpiness with regard to, you know, some of the opportunities that are ramping early in the year that we should consider as we go through the year? Or, you know, is, you know, excluding the enterprise data's business, do you see revenue, you know, kind of on a fairly stable, upslope trajectory as you go through the year? Michael Hsing : Yeah. I couldn't tell you some. It's very difficult to say sooner than you go by year by year, we don't go by year by year. Okay. I mean, but all the way, we have to report it year by year. And give you examples. Our large customers start to push out some product pulling a lot of other ones. So we can't we can't really tell. So, like, I mean, and other customers, other hyperscales start to ramp. Okay. It's telling us we're going to keep a rim. Whether the ramp has an effect and remove our revenue needles, in Q4 of this year or Q1 of next year, we can't tell. Tony Balow : Yeah. Maybe the only thing I'd add on Michael is it just goes back to the focus on what you can control. Right? And, you know, the organization looking at providing the best products, you know, with the best quality, and that's what we can do right now. And as the market then, you know, plays through, that will turn into revenue. So don't think we're trying to get into a quarter by quarter debate here, Chris. I think that's how we've more landed kind of in a first half, second half dynamic at this point. Chris Caso : Alright. Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter of Cohen. Joshua, your line is now open. Joshua Buchalter : Yes. Thank you for taking my question. A couple of times, you've talked about the hyperscale program sort of driving growth more so in the back half of the year. I guess if we compare these sockets to, you know, what you've already done in AI and the accelerator side, there's a lot of companies in the analog space that are saying that they have power engagements with ASIC vendors as well. Would you expect the majority of these merchant ASIC programs to be dual-sourced, and I know you're not going to necessarily quantify share, but I'd just be curious to hear how you're seeing the competitive environment in these sockets. Bernie Blegen : Sure. Let me take the first opportunity there. If you look at our most recent track record in the new and I'd say new, relatively new, AI business. The reason we were able to secure a lead position initially is because of our ability to innovate and our time to market along with, you know, our overall performance characteristics. So to the extent that that is valued, in these product launches, those are the qualities that give us an opportunity to have a first-mover advantage. But as we've said a couple of times on this call, when we look at our customers, we don't necessarily control what their decision process is or why. And so, again, we lead with our strengths and believe that we're well-positioned, and then we'll see how the numbers turn out towards the end of the year here. Michael Hsing : Yeah. You mentioned the second half. You pinged it down as on the second half of the ramp. What we mean is in the very near future. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Michael Hsing : It could be Q1, but Q1 of next year could be Q3 of this year. Or even overlapping in Q2. And a lot of things, as I said earlier. Okay? And our large customers, some of the push out, other ones are pulling to the game. And pulling very urgently. Okay? I mean, so we cannot tell. Bernie Blegen : I guess to put a punctuation statement, we remain cautiously optimistic, but our momentum is certainly in the right direction. Michael Hsing : Oh, that's the professional way to say it. Joshua Buchalter : We always get the more professional answers from Bernie. Okay. No. Thank you. Bernie Blegen : Thank you both for the color there. As my follow-up, I guess, you know, you're kind enough to give sort of a rough outlook for enterprise data growth for 2025. Any more clues you can give us on how you're expecting, either at the company level 2025 growth to shake out in any sort of, you know, which segments you would expect to be the biggest contributors to growth? Michael Hsing : Biggest ones, we're thinking is a multiple of them. Yeah. Bernie Blegen : And we... Michael Hsing : Sometimes it would pick a number, but it's not it was wrong. Okay? And but other ones are coming up. Bernie Blegen : And we focus on the diversified growth that that's that is the key strategy we've been playing the same principles for the last twenty-five years. Michael Hsing : And if this thing doesn't work, then other things will work. Okay. That's always our strengths. And as long as we bring up the best performance, highest performance in the market. We will if this segment slows down for whatever the reasons, other segments will pick up. Joshua Buchalter : Thank you both, and congrats on the results. Michael Hsing : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. Will, your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. We start with what everyone's been asking about is enterprise data. I think you highlighted, Bernie, that it's going to be down sequentially. Can you give us a little help on the modeling? Because, you know, down could be down, like, three percent or, like, thirty percent. Maybe just dimensionalize it a little bit to give us some context, please. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. I think that it'd be really hard. Again, what Michael just said is that the strength of our model is the diversification. And I would probably point to the outlook that we've given in total for Q1 as being a risk profile that we believe we can deliver comfortably against. Based on what we can see in our backlog and the ongoing ordering patterns. But again, trying to actually stratify with a level of precision on the end market at this point might be difficult. Michael Hsing : Yeah. You may be looking for precision, and okay. And the realities in the business, we go for long terms. And we go for long term. It doesn't mean near term will have uplift in our revenues. Okay? William Stein : Yeah. Clearly, my ability to model the near term is problematic. A follow-up if I can. Maybe let me switch gears a little bit. Michael, I think in the past, you talked about having some capability in microcontrollers. Historically, you know, I know that it's not, like a focus or it's not a meaningful part of your revenue as well as I understand. Should we expect that to change? There's so many new products you talk about silicon carbide power and converters now and DSPs even. Should we expect microcontrollers or any other digital sort of logic technology to become a bigger part of your revenue over time? Michael Hsing : Very good questions. And we don't list out a microcontroller as a standalone standard product that we sell. As a matter of fact, we sell many microcontrollers now. Okay? And as I recall, in my mind, can come up twelve, thirteen microcontroller projects is ongoing. Some of those stuff is shipping. But what we sell microcontroller is this on the system level. And as Bernie earlier said, in the last field conference, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. is evolving to a silicon-based solution company. Microcontrollers play a key role. And all these powers, all these other lighting, all these other audios, and including power supply, including AIs, they all have microcontrollers in it. And we don't list separate the items and the standard microcontroller part. A lot of and clearly oh, also a lot of microcontroller integrated. And that's the reason we don't list it apart. This is separate. Okay? William Stein : Thank you. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from William Kirwan of Morningstar. William, your line is now open. William Kirwan : Hey, everyone. Thanks for letting us get a question. Questions so far, so I'll try not to beat any dead horses. But maybe it sounds like at least in the March quarter automotive communication seemed to be driving some of the growth. So I'm wondering if you could just give a broader view into the demand for those markets for 2025 and your opportunities for share gains in those two. Bernie Blegen : Sure. Well, it's good to hear you in the Q&A, by the way. When you look at the end markets, most of the ones that we have are long design cycles. And automotive probably lends itself to being the most predictive because we secure design win two to three years for an EV in advance when it gets launched. Or as many as four to five years for a traditional internal combustion engine. Now having said that, the timing of those ramps, when it gets the design win comes to market still remains a question mark. But within the context of, you know, six to nine months, we can be reasonably predictive. So in automotive, we see continuation of what's been driving our last two quarters of growth as far as EVs in China. And those will be supplemented in the second half of the year more likely by a European OEM that is going to be bringing up an autonomous driving ADAS solution. As well as additional content opportunities in North American EV companies. And then when you look at the communication side, I think that is we're very early stages of being able to ramp the revenue opportunities, particularly in fiber optics. We started out with two primary customers, but we expect that customer base to diversify over the year. Michael Hsing : As always the pattern. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Michael Hsing : That's excellent. And then, you know, maybe one just on some of the new products that were introduced at the start of the call. Really just which one of these maybe excite you the most and what are the new markets that you might be able to enter with these that are the most attractive, do you think, from a growth perspective? Michael Hsing : The most exciting product, we haven't announced it yet. Come over to an Analyst Day. Okay. March 20th. I'm locked 20th. I said, okay. And these are equal babies. Okay? They all grow. Tony Balow : Should be very same same right now. Yeah. Again, we picked four, but there's many more behind that. So it's hard to pick just one. Bernie Blegen : Actually, we wanted to have a teaser to make sure we had the best turnout for the investor day. William Kirwan : Okay. Excellent. Well, we'll wait for more detail in March. Thanks, guys. Michael Hsing : Alright. Okay. Genevieve Cunningham : Our next question is from Hans Mosesman of Rosenblatt. Hans, your line is now open. Hans Mosesman : Thanks. Congrats, guys. I'll be quick. What is the split for your enterprise data between AI and non-AI, if that's possible? And I have a follow-up. Bernie Blegen : Yeah. Again, I think we already answered that question by saying that those lines are getting blurry, so we really don't have a meaningful way to make that divide. Michael Hsing : And our customers are not were not appreciated where we disclose those numbers. Bernie Blegen : And our customers have made it very clear. Hans Mosesman : Is non-AI considered memory and optic historically? Just out of curiosity. Michael Hsing : Different market segments. Optics and communication, memories, and storage. Hans Mosesman : Fine. Okay. At the risk of upsetting your customers, if you answer what is the share between your historical AI customer for this year versus accelerator customers. What's the split? Is it ten, ninety, or fifty fifty year? Bernie Blegen : And for this year, and at the end of the year, and we probably will have a more or in the near term where we have a more clear picture, but then now we don't. And frankly, it's not clear where as Bernie said, we're not in a position to answer that game. And also by either by product, they share the same product, and also some customers and doesn't want us to release these informations. Hans Mosesman : Okay. Thank you very much. Genevieve Cunningham : Our last question is from Joe Kotraki from Wells Fargo. Joe, your line is now open. Joe Kotraki : Thanks for taking the questions. Just curious on the notebook strength that you guys are talking about into the first quarter. Wondering this, you know, what's driving that? Is that strength from are starting to see pull for AIPCs or is it channel refill? Just trying to understand some of those dynamics. Bernie Blegen : That's a great question. In fact, we believe that a lot of the design wins that we've had in notebooks more recently are tied into, you know, new AI product demand. But as I said, it's a little bit of an atypical ramp for Q1. So we really don't have a definitive answer on the why behind it. Joe Kotraki : Got it. And then just, you know, trying to think about the new projects that are running in the second half for enterprise data. Any help that you can provide and just try to think about, like, the architectures of those solutions that you're shipping to your customers, are you still largely seeing those as being lateral power opportunities or those starting to move to more vertical solutions? Bernie Blegen : Yeah. I think you heard us talk a couple of times that we're not going to talk specific at any customer or their particular architectural solution. I think for us, what you see us again focus is providing a portfolio of products with the best quality, the best performance, and then the customers can choose what works for them. Michael Hsing : And going back to Michael's earlier comment as far as basically the value proposition of the principles we operate under, what we're most interested in doing and continuing to do is winning sockets. Joe Kotraki : Yeah. Our customers have picked particularly does it not want us to reveal the lateral power or vertical power? Bernie Blegen : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. Genevieve Cunningham : I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. Bernie Blegen : I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call. As a quick reminder, we will be hosting our investor day on March 20th, 2025. Michael and other Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. executives will showcase our vision for innovation and outline key elements of the company's long-term growth strategy. The event will be held at our San Jose offices and will include live presentations, a Q&A session, and demos of our latest solutions for a number of applications and a lot of other markets. If you haven't done so already, please email your RSVP to mpsinvestor.relations@monolithicpower.com. You can also access a live stream of the event on our investor relations website. Separately, I look forward to talking to you again during our first quarter 2025 conference call, which will likely be held in May. Thank you, and have a nice day.",
