All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, [Frety]. And welcome everyone to Capital One\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet.

With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve? Steve Crawford : Thanks, Jeff. Let me begin with slide 3 tonight. Capital One earned $1.15 billion or $1.96 per share in the first quarter. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.12 billion or $1.91 per share and had a return on average tangible common equity of 16.8%. As you know, our capital plan was approved in the quarter and our Board has authorized $2.5 billion in share repurchases over the next four quarters. Included in continuing operations results this quarter were a lower provision for loan losses driven by lower charge-offs and a $208 million allowance release and $27 million in discrete tax items, primarily related to changes in New York State tax law. Our historical financial statements have been revised, as we adopted a new accounting standard for investments in low income housing tax credits in the quarter, resulting in the cost of investing in qualified affordable housing projects no longer being recognized above the line in operating expense or rather below the line as a component of tax expense. In addition, the new accounting standard results in higher costs in the earlier years of the investment [flows] due to faster amortization, resulting in a modest reduction in historical earnings and a one-time $112 million reduction to retained earnings. We have provided an appendix slide that outlines the impact of the consolidated company and the segment results due to the adoption of the accounting rule. Excluding the impact above, operating expenses decline quarter over quarter, largely due to the absence of non-recurring restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter. Additionally, linked-quarter revenues were lower, driven largely by day count and lower seasonal volumes in cards. Turning to slide 4, let me briefly touch on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 11 basis points in the first quarter to 6.62%, more than entirely driven from the first quarter having fewer days worth of recognized income. Average interest-earning assets were down modestly quarter-over-quarter driven by lower average investment securities and cash offset by higher average loan balances. Average loans were higher on a linked-quarter basis due to continued growth in our auto, finance and commercial businesses offset by declines in card balances primarily due to seasonality. Our guidance for card runoff in 2014 remains $1 billion. We are updating our expectations for mortgage runoff in 2014 to $5 billion from $4 billion previously. Turning to slide five, I will briefly cover capital trends. As expected, Basel III standardized became our primary regulatory capital regime in the first quarter. Regulatory capital ratios for periods prior to the first quarter are reported under Basel I. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized fully phased-in basis was 11.7% in the first quarter compared to the same number of 10.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013. With the benefit of phasing our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 13%, up 80 basis points from the same 12.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. While there is still work in progress, industry wide on the final implications for capital under the Basel III advanced approaches , we continue to estimate we are above our target of 8%. Based on the quantitative and qualitative outcomes in the recent CCAR process, we look forward to returning capital to our shareholders through the approved $2.5 billion in share repurchases over the next four quarters. The bar surpassing CCAR is high and will likely continue to rise. We have and will continue to invest in our processes to exceed these standards. We have demonstrated our commitment to return capital and understand that remains an important part of return equation for our investors. Let me close briefly with an update of our expectations for 2014. The early adoption of the new accounting standard for low income housing tax credits and the change we made to prospectively recognize auto reposition expense and operating expenses instead of as a component of vehicle, impact on our outlook for PP&E and its components. We\u2019ve previously expected pre-provision earnings for 2014 of approximately $9.8 billion excluding extraordinary items. Adjusting for the shift in geography of these two items with the impact of the new accounting standard being a primary driver, we now expect 2014 pre-provision earnings to be about $10 billion within a reasonable margin there. Looking beyond the impact of these geography moves, we expect some modest or principally offsetting changes with higher revenues offsetting higher expenses. With that, let me turn the call over to Rich. Richard Fairbank : Thanks Steve. I\u2019ll begin on slide 7, with an overview of the domestic card business. Ending loans were down about 7% from the fourth quarter driven by expected seasonal pay downs and continuing planned run-off. Ending loans declined about 3% year-over-year. Excluding the planned run-off, the year-over-year decline in ending loans was about 1%. Purchase volume on general [purpose] credit cards, which excludes private-label cards, which don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 11% year-over-year. Looking below the surface, the year-over-year trends in loans and purchase volumes continue to reflect our strategic choices, which focus on generating attractive, sustainable and resilient returns. We're avoiding high-balance revolvers and allowing the least resilient parts of the acquired HSBC portfolio to run-off. In contrast, we're seeing underlying year-over-year loan growth in many segments, including transactors and revolvers other than high-balance revolvers. New account originations continue to grow at a strong pace and we continue to see opportunities to increase lines for existing customers, which should improve the trajectory of both loan growth and purchase volume growth overtime. As we said last quarter, we expect these improvements to result in overall year-over-year loan growth in the domestic card business sometime in the second half of 2014. Revenue margin for the quarter was just under 17%, down seasonally from the fourth quarter. Revenue dollars were down about 10% year-over-year driven primarily by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio. Non-interest expenses improved by $119 million from the sequential quarter, driven by operating efficiency and seasonally lower marketing. On a linked-quarter basis, the charge-off rate increased by about 12 basis points to 4.01%. Delinquency rate decreased about 41 basis points to 3.02%. The improvement in delinquencies was better than normal seasonal expectations. First quarter charge-offs in delinquencies include the temporary increase we discussed last quarter. Recall that in July 2013, we changed a number of customer practices on the HSBC branded card portfolio to align them with regulatory guidelines and Capital One practices. These changes temporarily increased fourth quarter delinquency rate. The delinquency impacted largely run its course which contributed to the improvement in delinquency rate in the first quarter. We originally estimated that the changes to align HSBC customer practices would temporarily increase the monthly domestic card charge-off rate by about 35 basis points from December through March. The actual impact was closer to 25 basis points and we expect it to diminish to about 10 basis points in April and be mostly out of the charge-off rate by the end of the second quarter. Looking beyond these temporary impacts, we expect that our focus on resilience and our strong credit risk underwriting will continue to drive strong credit results with normal seasonal patterns. Our card business remains well positioned. We\u2019re poised to return to year-over-year loan growth in the second half of 2014 despite continuing run-off and our choice to avoid high balance revolvers. We\u2019re delivering strong, sustainable and resilient returns, and we\u2019re generating capital on a strong trajectory, which strengthens our balance sheet and enables capital distribution. Moving to slide 8. The Consumer banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans declined about $35 million from the fourth quarter and about $2.9 billion year-over-year. Continued growth in auto loans was more than offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased from the fourth quarter and remain on a strong growth trajectory. Subprime originations were relatively stable, while prime originations grew as we captured additional prime share from our existing dealers. Ending deposit balances grew by about $3.9 billion in the quarter. Year-over-year deposit balances declined about $1.1 billion, mostly in our legacy Capital One direct banking businesses. Consumer banking revenue was modestly lower compared to the fourth quarter driven by declining consumer banking loan balances, persistently low interest rates and margin compression in auto finance. Non-interest expense decreased $88 million in the quarter as a result of lower marketing expense in our deposit businesses, the absence of several small non-recurring operating expenses we recognized in the fourth quarter in continuating operating efficiencies. These improvements were partially offset by a change in the geography of where we recognize auto repossession expenses which are now included in operating expense rather than in net charge-offs. Provision for credit losses improved in the quarter. Auto charge-off rate and delinquencies improved in the first quarter in line with expected seasonal patterns and aided by the shift in presentation of repossession expenses that I just described. Home loans credit trends remain favorable and continue to perform well inside of the assumptions we made when we acquired the mortgage portfolio. The overall consumer banking charge-off rate remains strong at about 1%. While we continue to expect that auto finance revenues, margins and returns will decline as we move from exceptional levels to more cycle average performance, we remain committed to the auto finance business. We build deep and sustainable dealer relationships, we have developed proven underwriting and customer service capabilities and we expect that the auto finance business will continue to deliver resilient and well above hurdle returns. Additionally, we expect that the [inaccessible] impact of the prolonged low rate environment will continue to pressure the economics of our retail deposit business even if rates rise in 2014. As you can see on slide 9, our commercial banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. The current and historical results on slide 9 and in our financial tables have been restated to reflect the change in accounting for low income housing tax credits that Steve described earlier. As shown in the appendix slide, the net effects on the commercial banking segment are reductions in revenue, operating expense and income tax as well as the modest decrease in net income from operations. Loan balances increased about 3% in the quarter and 18% year-over-year, driven by growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I lending and CRE. Loan yields declined in the quarter and compared to the prior year, driven by lower market pricing for increased competition and our choice to originate loans with even better credit quality. Revenues declined 12% from the fourth quarter. Lower loan yields as well as lower tax equivalent yields in our equipment leasing business drove the quarterly decrease in revenue. In contrast, revenues increased about 5% from the prior year. The year-over-year increase was the result of growth in loan and deposit balances across the franchise, partially offset by declining loan yields. Non-interest expense was up 15% from the prior year as a result of the Beech Street acquisition and continued growth in loan balances. In the quarter, non-interest expense was down about 9% with lower amortization expense and seasonal trends. Commercial credit remains very strong with the charge-off rate at 4 basis points. While the current very low charge-off levels are not necessarily sustainable, we continue to see low levels of non-performing and criticized loan balances, so we expect the strong credit performance of our commercial banking business to continue. While increasing competition particularly in generic middle market lending may continue to impact the pricing and volume of new loan originations, we expect our focused and specialized approach to deliver strong results in the commercial bank. I will conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. In the first quarter of 2014, we posted another quarter of solid results for the company and across our businesses. We received no objection to our CCAR capital plan and announced the $2.5 billion share repurchase program that we expect to complete by the end of the first quarter of 2015. Capital One is earning very attractive risk adjusted returns and we expect that will continue in 2014. But we\u2019re always focused on the important levers that will sustain and further improve our profitability. We are committed to tightly managing cost across our businesses. We don\u2019t view this as a one-off initiative, it\u2019s a major multi-year agenda and it remains the top priority in all of our businesses and in every budget cycle. Our credit results are strong driven by a long standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our continuing focus on resilience. Growth remains a high priority for us, but only in the context of the preemptive focus on generating attractive, sustainable and resilient return. We expect planned run off will drive declining home loan balances. On the other hand, we expect growth in areas we\u2019re emphasizing including commercial banking and out finance will continue, and we expect year-over-year growth in domestic card loans to resume in the second half of 2014. And with respect to capital, our CCAR submission and our 2014 capital plans are strong evidence of our commitment to return capital to shareholders. The bar for passing CCAR is high and will likely continue to rise. We have invested and we\u2019ll continue to invest in our processes to exceed these rising standards. Our capital and liquidity positions remained strong. Our businesses continue to deliver attractive and sustainable returns and generate capital on a strong trajectory. Industry loan growth remains low and in our case, planned run-off frees up capital as well. We're comfortable also with our strategic footprint. These conditions create excess capital that can be distributed to shareholders. We recognized that capital distribution is important to our investors and capital management remains an important part of how we expect to deliver superior and sustainable value to our investors in 2014 and beyond. Now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts, who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question, plus a single follow-up question. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. [Vicky], please start the Q&A session. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And we'll go first to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs : Yes, just two quick questions. I guess first on loan growth, you're still talking about returning positive in the back half of the year. Can you just help us understand some of the drivers behind that? Is it from new account acquisitions driven from the recent marketing spend, is there an expectation that the existing customer base will begin revolving against slower run-off. Can you just tease out what some of the main drivers are? And then for Steve, just thinking on a longer-term on capital return, you talked several times that the bar does continue to rise. But given the strong capital position all else equal, do you think the current year's capital return is sustainable or given the fact that you don't move to be in advance for several years, we can actually see further increases to capital returns in the near-term? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Yes Ryan, we continue to be on track to have loan growth in our card business return in the second half of 2014. What\u2019s really driving that is continued success in new account origination; I think we feel very good about the results we see there. On the existing customer base things are going very well and we\u2019ve gotten traction, a lot of traction in the line increase area where I am sure you know that we had sort of a brown out with respect to line increases as we were adapting to a regulatory guideline. So, that\u2019s pretty much back on track. So we feel good with respect to being able to play offense if you will. With respect to the defense side, every year the run-off becomes less and we continue on our journey of running off also our high balance revolver. And so net-net, the line is finally crossed in the second half of this year and I think we feel good about the trajectory from there. Steve Crawford :  So Ryan, as Rich mentioned, we\u2019re not at a point where we\u2019re prepared to provide specific guidance going forward and I am sure you can imagine there is a bunch of reasons for that. But in our couple of observations, some of which you\u2019ve heard it from Rich and I already. One, the qualitative bar continues to go up for all banks and I think the good reasons for us to emphasize flexibility in our future capital plans probably means that share repurchases will be a continuing emphases. And I think in terms of thinking about payout levels going forward, I kind of go back to the way Rich ended, which is we have a really strong capital position and continue to deliver high returns. Industry-wide loan growth is relatively low and in our case it\u2019s magnified by run-off. We continue to be comfortable with our strategic footprint. So, and most importantly, I think hopefully demonstrated over the last couple of years; we understand how important capital return is to delivering enduring value to our shareholders. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW: Thank you. I guess I\u2019ll ask my couple of questions upfront. Steve, I was just wondering if you could just go over that breakdown of the revision in the PP&E again. Just how much is coming from the specific tax changes versus other stuff of that $200 million increase in PP&E? And then secondly, question for Rich. We\u2019ve had a couple of large players in auto go public recently, one that\u2019s pretty focused on prime and I think I heard you say that you guys took share in prime from dealers. I was just wondering if you could talk about how you expect the trajectory to be going forward in auto lending in terms of growth. Thank you. Steve Crawford : So let me go first. In terms of the PP revisions, again these are primarily changes in geography. So, we would have approximately $240 million of incremental operating expense. If we have the current standards prevail into this year with respect to how we were accounting for [Litech], we would similarly have $40 million that would stay in (inaudible) instead of moving up to operating expense. These are again approximate numbers that gets you to the around $200 million, which is why the guidance went up from $9.8 billion to $10 billion, again that excludes extraordinary items and we\u2019re not defining that\u2019s the last decimal point. Richard Fairbank : Yes Sanjay, in the auto business we continue to feel very good about the auto business. We\u2019ve wanted to make sure that our investors understood that the confluence of kind of once in a lifetime event that led to extraordinary return opportunities and exceptional growth opportunities that\u2019s redressing towards the main, but that\u2019s not to take away from that fact that we continue to feel good about the opportunities to be very successful and earn well above hurdle rate returns in this business. The growth -- basically I think the way to think about the growth trajectory is subprime is pretty flat these days and we continue to grow in the prime space and that\u2019s really just further penetration of the dealers that we have very good relationships with. So it\u2019s kind of a natural to do this growth. And so despite that growing competition and of course we see two players that are now out there with IPOs and they are going to be intensely trying to generate growth, I think we feel pretty good about our position here. Of course the prime growth, as we get a mix change with more prime growth and more flattish on the subprime side that puts additional kind of pressure on the overall average margin and in addition to just what\u2019s happening competitively. The other thing just to say on the auto growth side is the -- we continue to keep a close watch on the underwriting practices that are going on in the business. And I think it\u2019s pretty much the same story I have been saying the last few quarters. There is a little slippage on some of the metrics, but overall still more slippage back towards the main as opposed to things that would cause us to really pull back. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : We'll go next to Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Bill check your line. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Hello, can you hear me? Jeff Norris : We can hear you Bill. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Okay, great. Thank you. You guys had a healthy year-over-year purchase volume growth as did some other issuers that have reported but you as that they also saw a non-interest income decreases in your card segments? And I was wondering if you could talk to what's driving that? It seems that there is a benefit from the interchange revenues that would be kind of on the plus side, but maybe if you could talk about what else is going on that would be helpful? Richard Fairbank : Bill on the, so first of all just purchase volume continues strong for Capital One and we think we're continuing to gain share of role in that space. With respect to non-interest income, there are couple of things going on, first of all our interchange growth in the quarter was basically flat despite the significant growth in purchase volume and more importantly the significant growth in general purpose credit card purchase volume. And I just want to point out, there is a lot of volatility in that particular metric in anyone quarter. But there is also a medium term kind of sustaining phenomenon here where we are very committed to our rewards business and we are upgrading rewards products for some of our existing rewards customers and consistent I think with the industry overall extending rewards product to some existing customers who don\u2019t have rewards. And so near-term you will see some interchange cannibalization as we do this, this is very intentional and it\u2019s all part of building a deeper customer franchise and all part of frankly are deep believe in the power of building relationships through strong rewards business. The other thing is the late fees were light in the quarter reflecting the delinquency real strong delinquency performance and that\u2019s probably something that a number of other competitors would have seen as well. But a little light on the interchange side and late fees that\u2019s a flip side of a very good credit effect are the contributors to a little weakness on the non-interest income. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Thank you so much Richard, I was hoping I could ask one follow up to Stephen. I had a question on your target 8% common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III I was hoping that maybe you could discuss the extent to which the severely adverse scenario under CCAR could become your binding constraint I was just looking to get your thoughts on whether those two ratios could produce difference answers that could impact what you manage the business to? And that\u2019s it, thank you. Steve Crawford :  Well that\u2019s a great question frankly it\u2019s a long way off in the future for us and we\u2019ve just had the first couple of banks exit parallel and those banks to my understanding even in the 2015 fee cost they\u2019re not going to be tested assuming the advanced approaches apply. So I don\u2019t think anybody can give you a really good feel as to the intersection between CCAR and advanced approaches. What I would tell you in terms of how we think about our capital that is you start with an assessment of the proper capital levels for our inherent risk. As you know we\u2019ve talked about the company\u2019s use of stress test for many years in assessing how much capital we use. And we\u2019re also informed by relevant experience, we had hopefully the most robust test we\u2019ll have for a while in the great recession. So a lot of that is the grounding for the capital that we need but moving away from the internal view, there are still moving pieces it\u2019s not just how advanced approaches gets into CCAR I don\u2019t think CCAR is stable at this point. And we haven\u2019t even entered parallel run. So while there is significant uncertainty we believe the 8% target is right and wouldn\u2019t communicate that to Europe, we thought it was fairly inconsistent with the regulatory framework. That\u2019s not a guarantee that 8% is the correct point estimate. But any other number at this point would be speculative and remember our 8% number does include a 100 basis point cushion above regulatory amendments. Jeff Norris :  Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brad Ball with Evercore. Brad Ball - Evercore: Thanks. Could you talk about the card revenue margin, the compression this quarter was entirely seasonality or were there others factors and how do you feel about the revenue margin in the context of the growth that you are talking about in the second half, are you thinking around 17% would be still sustainable and then just lastly on credit, the delinquency improvement, I suppose this quarter is what drove the reserve release is there still more room for additional reserve releases going forward, what\u2019s your thought on credit broadly? Thank you. Richard Fairbank :  Okay. Brad on the revenue margin, yes in terms of the first quarter, the revenue margin for the quarter was 16.9% and that\u2019s down from 17.3% in the fourth quarter and that decrease, you are right was primarily driven by normal seasonality of the revenue margin. And sort of putting the revenue margin in the context, 2011 the revenue margin was around 17%, 2012 we added the HSBC portfolio and adjusting for a purchase accounting effects the margin was also around 17%. In 2013 after adjusting for Best Buy help for sale impacts and the deal related items, the revenue margin was also in the low 17% range. The benefits from the removal of Best Buy\u2019s low margin business were roughly offset by what we call franchise enhancement so basically moves that we are making to consistent with our very strong customer advocacy things we\u2019re doing in the company. And going forward there are going to be many puts and takes on the revenue margin. There will always be some franchise enhancement actions that we continue to take overtime, but I think overall we believe Brad, the margin will remain healthy, we\u2019re not going to give a specific forecast about the revenue margin, but I think we believe it will continue to be strong. And on credit, yes, the delinquency is what drove the release. It\u2019s just, you probably heard and we keep saying quarter after quarter, it\u2019s hard to imagine things getting much better than this. And let\u2019s really enjoy it while we\u2019re in this part of the cycle. I think we are struck by the strength of the credit performance, we continue to see the relatively low delinquency levels and the low roll rate. So, I don\u2019t think as we look at it that we\u2019re here to declare that credit is going to get even better, but I think I would say this that the continued strong performance of all the credit metrics reinforces our strength, our belief in the strength and continuation of a good credit performance that can help generate very nice returns in the business. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets. Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets : Hi, can you hear me? Sorry about that. So I just had a couple of questions, and I apologize I got to the call a little later. But one question I have is in terms of your liquidity coverage ratio requirements. Where do you stand on that? How far along you think you are? And how should we think about the impact to net interest margin as you try to make progress on the LCR? Steve Crawford : Is that it? Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets : That was the first question, sorry. Steve Crawford : Okay. So let me start with LCR. Basically we don\u2019t think there is going to be a material financial impact. It\u2019s a little bit hard to be, too definitive on the ultimate impact because we don\u2019t even have final rules at this point. But I think almost -- unless the rules change materially, we wouldn\u2019t see a real financial impact from this. There is however the greater operational and governance burden that\u2019s primarily a function of having to calculate this ratio on a daily basis and kind of when the industry needs to be able to do that certainly plays into the operational challenges. But we will be able to satisfy what currently it seems like the bar you have to get over which is the 80% LCR ratio requirement as of January \u201815. Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just my follow on question is on a different note. I think you announced that you are going to seize working with some sort of providers like payday lenders and cheque cashers and the like. It would be helpful just to get your sense or your perspective on that. Why seize working with all of these providers, why not just start working with some of the ones who are less compliant or is the issue of trying to figure about who is or isn\u2019t compliant with the regulatory requirements? I\u2019d just like to get your thought process as far as that goes. Richard Fairbank :  Yes. Sameer, we consistently review our business plans across the company and our customers individually and as groups to ensure that they are aligned with our strategic goals and our objectives on all dimensions including regulatory compliance and everything. And we took a number of factors into consideration and determined that the check cashing business being bankers to check cashers no longer fits with our strategic priorities. The financial impact of this exit is really not material. This business was the small part of the overall enterprise. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : Good afternoon. I guess one question on the guidance and then I had follow-up on auto. Steve, you mentioned beyond the geography moves, so setting aside all that. There were some modest upgrades to the revenue expectations offset by expenses. I wonder if you could just -- what drove the upgrades to your revenue expectations, any sense of magnitude and are the offsetting expenses more on the marketing side or on the operating expense side? Steve Crawford : Yes. That is down to as you kind of probably anticipate the answer to this question down to a level of guidance in detail that we\u2019re not going to go to like last year. We provided guidance and as we move through the year we really stand it on to provision net revenue. This is a really dynamic business with a lot of moving pieces. And as was true last year, we may get to the guidance that we laid out at the beginning of the year in different ways. We\u2019ve centered on pre-provision net revenue for a bunch of reasons, but it\u2019s obviously the foundation for our ability to invest the future growth and to return capital to you. Adjusted for changes in geography, we\u2019re not changing our guidance, which obviously excludes extraordinary items. And as Rich mentioned, we\u2019re leaving out the credit story, which remains pretty strong as well. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : I appreciate that. And then on auto, and I guess with the benefit of hindsight, I mean your originations pulled back a lot in 4Q \u201812 through 2Q \u201813, they\u2019ve kind of reaccelerated in the second half of \u201813 and the various credit data that\u2019s out there for you and competitors, if you guess to the extent there was a problem that was in the first half \u201813 [vintages], in the second half \u201813 vintages are improving or performing better. I wonder if you agree with that. And if -- what was it about the first half \u201813, because it is not obvious when you look at credit cycles or terms across the industry why kind of across the industry first half \u201813 than to just see little weaker in second half \u201813 and first half \u201814 seem to now be doing better? Richard Fairbank : So I\u2019m not sure what you are referring to, I don\u2019t have our origination data right in front of me, but I\u2019m not sure what you are referring to about a pull back in 2012. My recollection to the following that the auto business spiked early in the great recession. A lot of people exited, we pulled back to our really core dealer relationships and then looked for the inflection points. You may remember that we\u2019ve often articulated that some of the best lending opportunities are actually in the [roads] of downturns when you pass kind of inflection point relating to customer behavior and competitor supply and demand and sort of underwriting standards. And so really into as I recall it was in 2009 and in the 2010 that we really accelerated originations in the auto business and we have continued very strong right through this point all through this period believing this is kind of the best part of the cycle and checking very carefully each vintage. As it\u2019s turned out, despite our inflection point monitoring and our belief that this was the best part of the cycle and the supply and demand were in a good place, the vintages have actually outperformed in a good way our own expectations. And so certainly in hindsight, we feel very good about our acceleration. And I\u2019m not aware of anything that would characterize the early -- the vintages in the first half or second half of a particular year. Along the way with these vintages there has been some expansion of -- some loosening of our very tight credit standards back to just tight, if you will. And so a couple of the vintages have had expected higher risk, but overall this has been a continuous period of accelerating originations and very strong credit performance. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : We'll go next to Daniel Furtado with Jefferies. Martin Kemnec - Jefferies: Hi, can you hear me? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Martin Kemnec - Jefferies: Great. Hey, this is Martin Kemnec in for Dan Furtado today. Thanks for taking my question. First, can you kind of help us think about sort of the impact that higher rates have on the transactor strategy and how you guys can maybe potentially look to offset some of the higher cost to carry there? I mean does that strategy become uneconomical with short rates pushing up at some point down the road? And just kind of maybe walk us through what type of leverage you can pull either on the funding side or the reward side? And then secondly Steve maybe for you, pretty impressive when we look at the recovery levels in the card book, at least what we can see from kind of the master trust seems to be pushing higher in the early part of this year. Is that kind of an organic effect as the economy improves, we\u2019re seeing a little bit better consumer spending numbers, things picking up, or is that sort of an inorganic effect from potentially selling those accounts and then booking the gain there, maybe just an update on the dynamics you\u2019re seeing on recoveries and expectations for that going forward? Richard Fairbank :  Okay. Martin, let me take first of all your question about our transactor business and its exposure to higher interest rates. We fund the expected lifetime balances for our transacting customers. And we expense rewards as they are earned. So as such, as rates rise, we feel very good about preserving the profitability and the benefits for our existing customers. Additionally, we subject our investment decisions as you can imagine to worsening conditions in the marketplace including higher interest rates. So, our products have a built-in resilience even at a higher interest rate level. Of course, should rates rise enough, I think you get kind of to the point that, and all players would be pretty equally affected. I think the industry would probably react and the going forward product structures would logically potentially adapt at that point. But in terms of the exposure to us, we kind of lock in as the best we can sort of all the existing things and we build in a buffer. And then I think if there were an adaptation, it would be an industry adaptation and we would react at that time. With respect to recovery levels in the card business, I\u2019ll make just a general comment about the recovery levels. In general, recovery dollars tend to come down somewhat at this stage of the cycle. It\u2019s kind of the math of the shrinking inventory of fresh charge-offs against which to recover. So in general, recovery rates have -- recovery dollars have been coming down just because recoveries are highest on fresh inventories, in the fresh inventories the good news is we haven\u2019t been supplying our recoveries team with as much supply as they\u2019ve been used to, so that\u2019s a good thing. It is also the case with respect to asset sales -- I mean debt sales. We are probably the lowest, they\u2019re among the very lowest in the industry in terms of extent of debt sales. But those are sort of opportunistic decisions made based on pricing in the marketplace and that can affect any particular quarter for some of the metrics as well. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good evening gentlemen. My first question is bigger picture. Rich, you\u2019ve been a long-term observer in capital and it\u2019s been a long-term participate in the revolving credit market in the U.S. in particular. And I guess looking at the market today in consumers, do you sense that there is a difference or a change in their willingness to borrow? Obviously we\u2019ve seen very slow revolver growth, generally speaking, there is obviously some higher levels of debt still existing from the housing crisis. I wonder how you are thinking about the longer term growth prospects for revolving credit. And I have a follow-up. Richard Fairbank : Yes. Ken, I think we all in this business have just been struck by for really a number of years now, credit kind of comes in a little better than expected and growth is kind of hard to come by. And I think those are the flip side of the same phenomenon and it\u2019s really what you\u2019re identifying. The consumer is just being very conservative. In some ways Ken, the very thing that sort of frustrates the economy from growing, which is consumers are not spending enough, what are they doing with their money? Well, a lot of times they are paying down debt and just being extra careful. From a banking point of view, we should all be careful what we wish for here because the flip side of this growth weakness on the borrowing side is a tremendous kind of strength on the credit side and that has been powering a lot of great performance for some of the banks over this period of time. I do think though it\u2019s part of the macro trend and delevering that frankly consumers and corporations have been doing for a number of years. So, it\u2019s hard to prognosticate, but we generally operate with an outlook that revolving debt will probably be, the growth of revolving debt will be pretty slow. You\u2019ve seen student lending of course growth has been pretty electrifying over this period of time and we\u2019re not in that business, we\u2019ve had a few cautions about that, but certainly that has been up. And we have been struck too by the strength of auto, borrowing over this period of time, solid borrowing and very good credit performance. But I think overall, what you\u2019re seeing is the consumer that has I think learned a lot through the great recession and is cautious. And I think that our metrics are probably likely to reflect that for better and for worse. Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you had -- obviously the revenue margin has benefited from very low funding costs over the last few years and it\u2019s nice to not hear you speaking about 15% revenue margins anytime soon. But I guess, I\u2019m interested in how you\u2019re thinking about defending those margins as rates rise, obviously funding costs have been quite low. And I guess this discussion around whether those core deposits are going to be sticky at these levels is really what I\u2019m getting at, if you can give us any thoughts around that that would be helpful? Steve Crawford : The business overall was or for card specifically, because I think for the business overall, you can look at our exposure to rising rates and we actually feel pretty good about our asset sensitive position. And that\u2019s going to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders, because we think obviously assets are going to re-price a little bit faster. So, if it\u2019s more of a card specific question, we can deal with that. But I think overall when you look at our position, we compare I think pretty favorably with the peer group. Jeff Norris :  Next question please? Operator :  We\u2019ll go next to Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets. Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets :  Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just the first question, I think someone mentioned the pace of run-off in the mortgage book to accelerate from $4 billion to $5 billion this year and just wondering given what we\u2019ve seen in the [MBA] did installing refinancing activity, is there anything specific to the portfolio, it seems you\u2019re buckling the trend a little bit in terms of slowing prepayments? And then the second question was regarding commercial bank yields. It did job pretty sharply this quarter. Just wondering if they will continue to compress or this is kind of a new level going forward. Steve Crawford :  No, there is nothing specific on price revision and increased mortgage run-off, it maybe a little bit I think you have to go back and look at when we provided the guidance and what rates were at that point versus what rates are now. I think you\u2019d probably find there is a better connection there between the run-offs. Richard Fairbank :  Scott, on commercial yields if we take the year-over-year perspective, loan yields decreased by 44 basis points due to the few factors. I think at the top of our list would be the increased competitive pressure in the market especially in the vanilla markets that have very, very large number of banks competing in it like the C&I sort of generic businesses. We also have shifted toward, more towards floating rate loans that has had an impact. We\u2019ve always had very high quality originations, but we\u2019ve even shifted toward loans with even higher credit quality and with a bit of trade-off with yields there. And ultimately in terms of how we make money. Our spreads have been somewhat, have not decreased by the same magnitude the loan yield has. It\u2019s partly offset by lower funding cost, but overall certainly the competitive environment is contributing to that. Quarter-over-quarter I don\u2019t think I am going to go into details that we have the total tax equivalent yield that kind of affect that makes a lot of noise. But competitively in the C&I business spreads definitely continue to compress and there has been some weakening in the non-investment grade credit structures as well. So we\u2019re pretty cautious in those spaces. In commercial real-estate the spreads we see pressure on pricing and limited pockets of weaker lending terms but that\u2019s largely in construction. I think banks are being a lot more disciplined in real-estate and also you have a big difference between the C&I business and CRE business, in CRE the CMBS channel has been largely sidelined while of course the CLO market is back to levels that are pretty close to 2007 level, so that\u2019s putting extra pressure on the C&I business. So -- and again our strategy is mostly focused on specialty lending which is affected by all of these trends but tends to be -- the margins are holding up better because of the more balanced supply and demand. Jeff Norris :  Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill:  Hi good afternoon thanks for taking my call, just had one question on the comment about higher rewards that are netted against interchanges. Is this reflecting the growth of the quick silver card and the cash rewards or is this amore of a mix with venture or just broader changes in customer behavior in use of rewards? Richard Fairbank :  It\u2019s really, it\u2019s several effects, so first of all, we have our flagship venture and quick silver products that have pretty rich rewards for the consumers and as a percentage of our whole book those are growing. Then you have our extension of the richer rewards to existing rewards customers and then you also have extending rewards further to some customers who have not been a reward customer. So all of those contribute to this gap between purchase volume growth and interchange growth and in the -- there is sort of a transitionary period where some of these penetration effects are more noticeable and I flag that only because we\u2019re in sort of one of those kind of periods. But it\u2019s the flip side of our real belief in the power of this business model and in many ways the success of our rewards business. Operator :  We will take our last question for the evening from Matt Burnell. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Good evening gentlemen. Just I guess a question on the income statement. It looks like professional services costs were down pretty visibly quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. I wonder if that has to do with CCAR preparation or is there is some other factor driving that and how we should think about that number going forward? Steve Crawford : Yes, I wouldn't over read anything or seasonal impacts in that the CCAR of anything would be a small portion of it and it\u2019s obviously incorporated into our overall guidance for the year. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And just not to get too deep into the weed but commercial real estate growth continues to be high teens 20% year-over-year. And I guess I'm just curious, Rich I understand your commentary about remaining very cautious or diligent in terms of your underwriting. But there are some markets in the Southeast and particularly DC that have been flagged as being relatively aggressive. And I guess, I'm just curious if you're seeing the same trends in those markets and how aggressive the competition has gotten in those the markets with commercial real estate? Richard Fairbank : So, again I would say, my overall observation from the market, the blended kind of observation from the markets we\u2019re in is that commercial real estate is quite a bit tamer than the C&I business. And I think it's really just frankly the flip side of the fact that C&I performed so well in the last downturn and is available to so many banks that you have sort of a lot of folks rushing in there. And then you have the CLO impact, the growing CLO impact as well. So, that's the area I'd flag as the biggest concern we have. On the commercial real estate side, again I think in most places people are licking their wounds and there is generally we see behavior that is more careful but that varies by markets, we don\u2019t do commercial real estate in the southeast so I really don\u2019t have an observation on that, we are relatively small players in DC. But I guess -- and more than half of our, the majority of our commercial real estate in fact is in New York City that has a lot of strong market dynamics going on right now and generally the behavior is not too irrational. But beyond sort of those qualitative descriptions I mean we spend a lot of time looking at key metrics and what\u2019s happening to those key metrics. And when we look at LTV debt service coverage ratio and debt yield in commercial real estate we see things that are well within the guard rails we would look at and frankly are still I think we are still pretty comfortable with how we see those metrics moving in the marketplace, at least with respect to the loans we are originating. Operator :  At this time I turn the call back over to Jeff Norris for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Norris :  Thanks very much and thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call today. We thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember the Investor Relations team would be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great evening. Operator :  That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Justin. And welcome everyone to Capital One\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One\u2019s website capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2014 results. With me today is Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Steve will walk you through this presentation.

And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve? Steve Crawford :  Thanks Jeff. I will begin tonight with slide three Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2.04 a share in the second quarter and had a return on average tangible common equity of 17.5%. We reduced our net share count by 11.1 million shares in the quarter reflecting our share buyback actions. Included in continuing operations results for this quarter were higher linked-quarter revenues, flat linked-quarter non-interest expenses, a lower provision for loan losses driven by lower charge-offs and a $100 million allowance release, a $37 million addition to our reserves regarding UK cross sell, which was split almost evenly between non-interest expense and non-interest income. In the UK refunds to customers who bought payment protection insurance is an industry wide issue and continues to be in the headlines. Our reserve build reflects the fact that while the number of customer claims we receive is continuing to fall, it hasn't fallen as quickly as forecasted. The reserve build does not reflect any change in how we calculate customer refunds. It is possible that we may further add to reserves if we determine that we need to change the calculation of customer refunds. And finally, we had an $18 million benefit related to mortgage rep and warranty which includes the provision of $11 million before taxes in discontinued operations and a benefit of $29 million before taxes in continuing operations. Turning to slide four, I'll touch briefly on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 7 basis points in the second quarter to 6.55%, primarily driven by lower yields and average balances in our domestic card business partially offset by the second quarter having one more day worth of recognized income. Average interest earning assets were up modestly quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by higher average loan balances in our auto finance and commercial banking segments. We are updating our expectation for mortgage runoff in 2014 to about $6 billion based on our current view of rates. Moving to slide five, I\u2019ll briefly cover capital trend. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized fully phased-in basis was 11.6% in the second quarter of 2014 compared to a Basel III standardized fully phased-in equivalent ratio of 11.7% in the first quarter of this year. With the benefit of phase-in, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.7%, down 30 basis points from the Basel III standardized equivalent of 13% in the first quarter of this year. And while we have yet our parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches, we continue to estimate we are above our target of 8%. Last, we reduced our net share count by 11.1 million shares in the quarter, reflecting our share buyback actions. We completed approximately 1 billion of our share buyback program in the second quarter and we expect to buy an additional 1.5 billion over the next three quarters. We have demonstrated our commitment to return capital and understand it remains an important part of the return equation for our shareholders. I\u2019ll close tonight with the brief update of our 2014 expectations. We continue to expect pre-provision earnings to be about $10 billion, within a reasonable margin of air. And we continue to expect some modest but principally offsetting changes with higher revenues offsetting higher expenses relative to our expectations earlier this year. While we had a release of allowance in the quarter, going forward as we return to growth and considering the charge-offs remain below historical averages, we\u2019re less likely to see going forward. With that, let me turn the call over to Rich. Richard Fairbank : Thanks Steve. I'll begin on slide seven, which shows another strong quarter posted by our domestic card business highlighted by a return to year-over-year growth. The year-over-year trends in loans and purchase volume continue to reflect our strategic choices which focus on generating attractive sustainable and resilient returns. Ending loans were up about 4% from the first quarter and about 1% year-over-year. We had expected year-over-year growth to resume sometime in the second half of 2014. The early return to year-over-year loan growth resulted from increasing traction in the segments we\u2019re emphasizing including reward customers and revolvers other than high balance revolvers as well as the success of credit line increase programs. The collective impact of these factors was greater than the continuing impact of our choice to avoid high balance revolver. Purchase volume on general purpose credit card, which excludes private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue grew about 16% year-over-year. Revenue margin for the quarter increased 13 basis points to about 17.1%. The increase resulted from expected seasonality and higher non-interest income partially offset by a decline in loan yield. Revenue dollars were down about 10% year-over-year driven primarily by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio. Non-interest expenses improve by $32 million from the prior quarter driven by operating efficiencies partially offset by a modest increase in marketing. We expect an increase in marketing in the second half of 2014 driven by both the expected seasonal ramp and because of the success and continuing opportunities we see in growing customer relationships, purchase volumes and loan. On a linked quarter basis charge-offs and delinquencies were in line and continued strong underlying credit performance and better than seasonal expectations. The charge-off rate improved 49 basis points to 3.52% driven by seasonality as well as the diminishing impact of aligning HSBC branded card customer practices with Capital One practices the 30 plus delinquency rate improved 19 basis points to 2.83%. Our card business remains well positioned we returned to year-over-year loan growth a bit earlier than expected despite continuing run off and our choice to avoid high balance revolvers. We are delivering strong sustainable and resilient returns and we continue to generate capital and solidify our customer franchise. Moving to slide eight. The consumer banking business delivered another quarter of solid results ending loans grew about $335 million from the first quarter and declined about $1.2 billion from the second quarter of last year. One a year-over-year basis continued growth in auto loans was more than offset by mortgage run-off. Auto originations increased from the first quarter and remained on strong growth trajectory. Subprime originations were relatively stable while prime originations grew as we continue to capture additional prime share from our existing dealers. Ending deposit balances declined by about $2.4 billion in the quarter consistent with normal seasonal patterns. Year-over-year deposit balances declined about $640 million. We had an abundance of deposits since the ING Direct acquisition and we've been allowing the least attractive deposits, the runoff. Consumer Banking revenue increased about $18 million or 1% compared to the first quarter. Year-over-year revenues decline by about $66 million or 4% driven by the impact of persistently low interest rate on the deposit business declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue impacts. Non-interest expense increased $28 million or 3% from the prior year. The increase resulted from growth in auto loans as well as a change in the geography of where we recognize auto repossession expenses, which are now included in operating expense rather than in net charge-offs. Provision for credit losses increased modestly in the quarter at about $76 million from the prior year. The year-over-year change resulted from a swing in the allowance from release in the second quarter of 2013 to a modest build this quarter related to auto loan growth. Auto charge-off rate improved in the second quarter, driven by expected seasonal patterns in the higher proportion of prime loans in the portfolio. Home loans credit trends remain favorable and continue to perform well inside of the assumptions we made when we acquired the mortgage portfolios. The overall consumer banking charge-off rate remains below 1%. Our consumer banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing challenges. In auto second quarter growth and performance were very strong, but we expect that auto margins and returns will continue to decline as we move from exceptional levels to more cycle average performance. We expect that auto returns will be continue to be resilient and well above hurdle. And in our retail deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment will continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2014. As you can see on slide nine, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Loan balances increased about 5% in the quarter and 18% year-over-year, driven by growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I lending and CRE. As competition continues to increase it\u2019s likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will moderate over time. Loan yields were stable in the quarter but declined 34 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by lower market pricing from increased competition and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. Revenues increased 7% from the first quarter and about 10% from the prior year. The year-over-year increase was the result of growth in loan and deposit balances across the franchise, partially offset by declining loan yields. The stronger increase in non-interest income was driven by the Beech Street acquisition and growth of fee generating businesses. Non-interest expense was up 17% from the prior year as a result of growth in loan balances and continuing infrastructure investments to drive future growth. In the quarter, non-interest expense was up about 5%. We continue to closely manage commercial credit risk and commercial credit results remain very strong. Charge-offs, non-performing loans and criticized loans remain at exceptionally low levels that are not sustainable through the cycle. Commercial Banking competition continues to increase but we expect our focused and specialized approach to deliver strong results in the commercial bank. I\u2019ll conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. In the second quarter of 2014, we posted another quarter of solid results for the company and across our businesses and we continued to return capital to our shareholders as we execute our announced $2.5billion share repurchase program. We're delivering these results in an operating environment that has both encouraging trends and continuing challenges. Credit remains relatively benign and our domestic card business is growing. On the other hand, the interest rate environment remains challenging and competition is picking up, particularly in auto and commercial. Capital One is earning very attractive risk adjusted returns and we continue to focus on multiple levers to sustain our profitability. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in card, auto and commercial banking as growth remains a high priority. We'll maintain our long standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. And we will continue to manage expenses tightly in the context of investing to drive future growth, be a leader in digital banking and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. We're on track to deliver 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10 billion. We expect the 2015 pre-provision earnings will rise with growth in average loans driving increased revenues partially offset by a higher non-interest expense as we continue to invest to sustain growth and return. While the efficiency ratio will vary from quarter-to-quarter, we expect the full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53% and 54% excluding non-recurring items. Capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver superior and sustainable value to our investors. We continue to generate strong earnings and work actively to return capital to shareholders. Now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris :  Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to see the other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow up questions after the Q&A session, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Justin, please start the Q&A. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs :  Hi, good evening guys. On the 2015 efficiency, the 53% to 54%, can you just give us some help understanding what type of backdrop you are assuming; are there expectation for rising interest rates; or any sort of acceleration in growth either in your loan portfolio or in the economy from the current levels? Steve Crawford :  Yes Ryan, I think we gave guidance on 2015 on efficiency ratio and only gave guidance on that because we largely want to avoid forecasting other items. I do think it was important for us to express kind of what we think the potential is to drop additional revenues to the bottom-line as we move into 2015 but also to give you a real sense of what we think some of the investments are that we are making to ensure that we can sustain the returns we have which we think are very good and also grow going forward. So I mean you can see what\u2019s happening in general on loan growth around the industry. And I think we leave it up to you to try and figure out where you think that\u2019s going to go over the next 18 months. Jeff Norris : You have a follow up Ryan? Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs : Thanks Jeff. You've obviously had some of the strongest growth that you've seen in quite some time and I take your point that we're likely not to see much in terms of the reserve releases going forward. But how should we just think about provisioning for growth? Should we think about charge-offs matching provisions from here or do you feel the reserve is at a good place and it could likely stay at the current levels? Steve Crawford : Yes. Well, I think most people have been in the card industry have consistently assume that we\u2019re at the end of the period of improvement and they have been consistently wrong for a long period of time. We just thought like it was important to say with where charge-offs are, which is pretty historic levels that we would bet against additional reserve releases going forward. I think a lot of people have continued to make that assumption over the last couple of years and they have been wrong. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : Sure. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Thank you. I guess Rich you mentioned that loan yields were a headwind to other positives for the card revenue margin. I was wondering if you can just help us think about loan yield on the new loans that are coming on relative to those that might be running off and maybe those that you were originating pre-recession or card act. Just wanted to try to get a sense of kind of how that's progressing? Richard Fairbank : Well, I think Ryan. First of all I just do want to say just a contextual thing and your question may or may not have been simulated by that. Average loan yield is sort of it had some funny dynamics over the past several quarters and year-over-year it starts officially heightened because of the Best Buy held for sale in 2013, by the Best Buy held for sale accounting and so on. But if you kind of just get beyond some of the noise in the current movement and perhaps it\u2019s really better for me to speak in terms of revenue margin. I think there is a striking stability in revenue margin that really goes back a number of years when you think back to revenue margin in 2011 was around 17% then in 2012 we added HSBC and adjusted for purchase accounting, purchase accounting margin was also around 17% and then in 2013 if you really normalized for the Best Buy impacts and deal related items revenue margin was kind of in the low 17% range. And we had some offsetting things that were going on there from the removal of Best Buy\u2019s low margin business roughly offset by a bunch of moves we made on things like payment protection, stopping the origination of that and some other kind of franchise enhancements. And we\u2019ve also said that I think on a calibration across all the businesses that we operate and I think the most stable business in terms of the yields and the margins in the business overall is the card business. And so unlike say on the other end if the continuum on the auto business where we say the new originations are definitely at lot lower yield and margin and then what the back book has. I think the best way to think about it Ryan is that this, I mean Sanjay the front book has pretty strikingly similar kind of revenue dynamics to the black book. And I think that\u2019s really in many ways a reflection of the stability of our own business model and a reflection of kind of the relative stability of pricing in the card market. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: I think about sub-prime as a function of the total. I mean has that mix moved up in sub-prime, I mean is other opportunities in sub-prime that might not have been there a while ago? Richard Fairbank : Some ways to more things change, the more they stay the same not to -- pretty similar to the revenue margin story that sub-prime mix in our portfolio stayed pretty similar. The FICO under 660 is been about a third of our outstandings in terms of like currently measured FICOs and that metric has been stable for an extended period of time. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache - Nomura: Thank you. Good evening guys. Last quarter we saw relatively slower interchange revenue growth relative to your purchase volume growth, but this quarter we saw very strong than interchange revenue growth of 22% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Can you give some color around that the dynamic that play here and talk about the sustainability of those trends? Richard Fairbank : Yes. In the same way I cautioned when it was very poultry last quarter than it surges this quarter really kind of give you the same caution. In any individual quarter, the net interchange metric is -- I wouldn\u2019t put too much reliance on trend reading based on that. The net interchange metric first of all includes a bunch of things. It\u2019s got partnership contractual payments in it, it\u2019s got international card in it and we periodically adjust our rewards liabilities based on what we are seeing in terms of customer trends, redemption rates and things like that. So and over the last few quarters as you say, net interchange growth has generally lagged general purpose credit card interchange growth significantly. But overall what we have said is that we expect the trend to have interchange growth lag general purpose credit card growth. We\u2019d expect this, a lag with some volatility quarter-to-quarter to continue. And let me explain just a little bit what\u2019s behind that. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful and we are also though in addition to aggressively marketing new rewards originations, we are also working to build our long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and extending rewards products to some existing customers who don\u2019t have rewards. And all of that means some near-term cannibalization but overall I think it really helps deepen the customer franchise. But those are facts I think will last for an extended period of time. So again, we feel very bullish about the ability to grow general purpose purchase volume, interchange should lag that with some quarterly volatility, but overall the economics of our rewards products, we feel very good about them. And what we're doing there is, over time we're building, growing that interchange revenue, additionally what comes with the territory of this business is the spenders build balances over time and they build finance charge revenues gradually over time and then you get the charge-offs for low attrition and kind of the long-term franchise dynamics is a whole thing. So, I appreciate the call, because I think it's important to understand why the interchange does have a lag there relative to the purchase volume, but to our part it's something we're investing in and feel very good about. Bill Carcache - Nomura: Thank you for that detailed explanation that dynamic, that's really helpful. If I could as a follow-up, do you believe that we\u2019re at a point in the recovery where perhaps the near prime revolver is finally starting to feel the benefits of what today many would argue has been a rather lop sided recovery favoring the affluent? Richard Fairbank : I think that, I'm always a little cautious about using the recovery word. I mean this thing is if we're talking about recovery with a small r, I think in general certainly I think the recovery has been more manifest at the top of the market. But I think, yes, I would support the notion that I think we see across our business, some modest signs of some strengthening across the broader spectrum of the mass market. But I think these are all in the context of fairly modest effects at this point. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the PPNR guidance and the OpEx guidance and just understand does this suggest that there is going to be some degree of incremental operating leverage heading out into next year or are revenues and expenses moving up more or less in lock step? Richard Fairbank : I think -- go ahead Steve. Steve Crawford : Yes. So, I guess it depends upon what your frame of reference is. I think our GAAP efficiency ratio in 2013 was a little over 55%; the first two quarters of this year we\u2019ve been operating around 54.5%; and next year we\u2019re talking about somewhere between 53% and 54%. So, if you\u2019re defining operating leverage solely with respect to efficiency ratio, that number is going down over time. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay, thanks for the clarity. And just a follow-up on the customer refunds issue. I think Steve you said that it\u2019s playing out a little bit differently than you\u2019d anticipated. I was just curious as to why you think that is? Steve Crawford : It\u2019s just the submissions in terms of that they\u2019ve been coming down; they just haven\u2019t been coming down at the rate that we expected. There is a little bit different of a trend line which is why we increased the number by 37 million. And a big part of that could be that there has been a fair amount of media about PPI recently; that could be one of the things that kind of drove the increase. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : And the next question comes from Brad Ball with Evercore. Brad Ball - Evercore: Rich, in talking about the growth that we saw this quarter, you mentioned three drivers : You said reward; non-high balance revolvers; and credit line increases. Can you give a sense as to which of those is driving the most receivable growth and are those the same drivers that you expect to drive U.S. card balance growth in the second half or will you be perhaps expanding the market to grow in the second half? Richard Fairbank : Yes, I mean all three are important factors, I think that the investments in originating new account, all the efforts on originating new accounts be they on the top of the market side or in revolver other than high balance revolver. That has been a very study kind of growing thing. That is increasingly picking up traction and we feel good about that. The credit line increase thing has been a little bit more volatile as you recall really going back to the beginning of 2012, there is a bit of a brown out related to that as we retooled our capabilities in the context of some regulatory guidance that came down about the need for having income before we did a credit line increase. And the pattern of that is the problem solving to get solutions for that. We kind of got to a good place in the latter part of last year and then so we started initiating credit line increases on a growing basis around that time. And so part of the sort of surge that you see this quarter reflects that affect. It is not entirely -- it\u2019s not a one quarter little blip, there is actually continuity and continued momentum in that one as well. So but that one is a little bit more of a surge than the other two effects that are just very steady kind of growing effects. Brad Ball - Evercore: Great. And then separately on auto finance you mentioned that prime grew this quarter from capturing share, I think you had said in prior quarters that you were seeing some increased pricing pressure on prime. What\u2019s the dynamic there and what\u2019s your outlook for auto finance growth in the second half? Richard Fairbank :  Yes. So, it\u2019s a little -- you are a careful student of what we say because we have said as we have talked about the marketplace that the most competitive part of the credit spectrum is prime and that\u2019s really in fact in terms of margins at a near cycle low in many ways although the underwriting is generally healthy but the pricing is really tight. In the subprime space things are compressing but are still at a healthier play. So then kind of the question is so why are we flat in subprime and growing prime, it is what we are doing is deepening our dealer relationships. In our dealers where we have a very strong position and in subprime, we have a lot of opportunity to grow in prime. And it's really -- there are two things going on, one is I think we feel good on a standalone basis about the economics of the prime business, although it's certainly on the lower end of returns and by the way of losses of the various things that we do. But, I think the biggest benefit is the deepening of the dealer relationships and the benefits that come across the credit spectrum in terms of the quantity and quality of the deal flow that we get. So, we feel, even as one time we've got a cautious eye on the pricing side on prime we feel good about this expansion that we just wanted to flag that most of the growth is coming, most of the incremental growth is coming on the prime side. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : And the next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup: Rich I know you've made some comments about card loan growth, but I just wanted to follow up. Is your sense that we'd be more likely to sort of keep out here in terms of industry card loan growth or do you think that we're potentially in an earlier part of the stage here? And then secondarily, do you think any differential in terms of the health of the consumer on the lower or high end. Richard Fairbank : Yes. So it's always hard, it's probably definitionally hard for anybody in the middle of these businesses to tease out the effects of industry growth versus one the growth that we ourselves are generating through our good innovation and marketing and so on. I mean you can see we\u2019ve had some pretty striking sort of step forward here in the sense that going from I can\u2019t remember something like a minus 3% year-over-year to a low single -- now a positive growth number in card, despite all the stuff that we\u2019re running off. And as I look at it just from our kind of more narrow perspective I just see across all the things that we\u2019re investing in we went out spent a lot of time testing and we\u2019re rolling out on things that we\u2019re testing and we\u2019ve had a growing amount of innovation and we\u2019re rolling that stuff out and it feels, it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re just riding an industry tied up. I think this really feels very much like what we expected from the test that we did and the roll outs are performing very well and consistent with that and they\u2019re sort of expanding in that sense. I am really pretty cautious to declare any kind of industry effect I\u2019ve seen for such a long period of time that the virtually zero and for a long time kind of negative growth in terms of revolving debt and of course I do want to say too as we continue to just stay so at the [sounding] performance on the credit side. We should all remember that this effect that has kind of exceeded the expectation virtually anybody out there I think is certainly one of the important factors there is the flip side of the consumer cautiousness that\u2019s holding back to growth. So, I don\u2019t think as an industry we\u2019ll get a package of a bunch more growth and just still like record low credit. What I do feel is very good about our own growth programs that we\u2019ve steadily invested in and I think we've got good traction there and we hope to continue. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : Moving on the next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli - William Blair : Thank you, good afternoon. The private-label card business, I would just like some updated thoughts on that and what you're thinking about as far Rich about opportunities. Are you seeing more opportunities obviously Nordstrom, you\u2019re going to have a big file coming onto the market, you have a big competitor that's coming public, the GE capital spin-off, Synchrony I guess, just some updated thoughts on your opportunities if you're seeing more or less and excitement about that business? Richard Fairbank : Well, gosh we certainly like the business. It\u2019s three to four, probably four years ago, we didn\u2019t have partnerships. So in some sense we\u2019ve come a long way since then with over 20 partners and $15 billion of outstandings. Of course the biggest single effect of that was the purchase of the HSBC business, but also before that we had pretty actively entered the market and going after top of the line players [Kohl\u2019s] being the flagship kind of partner there. So our view of this business is, it is a real natural for Capital One, because we're already a big player in the card business. And I think this business is also crying out for innovation, whatever digital innovation any of us are thinking about in banking, if you want an industry that is incredibly they need of digital innovation, it is the retailing business and I think that that an opportunity to leverage business and I think that that an opportunity to leverage our own digital innovation and that space is very exciting to us. And what we are trying to do in that space is not -- is even though scale matters a lot and it definitely matters a lot and all you have to do is look at the loss of scale that came from our walking away from Best Buy to see some of those marginal economics; scale really matters. And so that\u2019s why we are very focused on growing. But I think each of the different players sort of has their different strategy. We are certainly trying to go more toward the higher end of the market in terms of the real quality retailers who are focused on building a franchise, deepening their customer relationships through the card as kind of the flagship and central nervous system of that transformation and that\u2019s really our sweet spot and I think where we can create a unique positioning. You may have noticed that in an unusual move Kohl\u2019s with whom we already had a contract for many years still proactively went out and thought to extent that by another five years because they were so and again you have to look at their own words on this, but very happy with the relationship we are building and said that in order to really invest to build the long term franchise with us, they wanted an even longer commitment because they felt we were soul mates about leveraging the cards really build the franchise. So that we see great promise in that business. In the near-term we have the challenge of that scale really matters and we are kind subscale. Yes, there are a lot of -- well there are several things that are sort of floating around in the market right now. And we will have to see how that thing turns out. But I really want to say that we still -- I still go back to the core principles that while growth really matters, what matters more than that is that we have quality partners who are motivated to do this for the right reason and a contract that really works. And where we find that, I think we want to be in a pole position to get those deals and I think over time, I like our chances. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : And the next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Great, thanks. Rich, I saw and I heard you say something about the deposit margins coming down, even if interest rates rise. Could you kind of go over that, because I wasn't sure I got that? Steve Crawford : Yes, I'm not sure that that was in the comment. What I think he said which is not inconsistent with what I think the rest of our peers are saying is that even if we have a near term rise in interest rates, that doesn't mean that you'll be showing better spreads in the consumer banking business. Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Got you. And would you say that the terms of the Kohl\u2019s contract are comparable to what they have been, because in the past, I mean your disclosures showed that you kind of remitted 90% of the revenues over to them. It's not clear what -- I mean maybe you could talk a little bit about what that partnership actually does for Capital One? Richard Fairbank : Moshe, I don't know, if we want to get into the details of the Kohl's contract, I think that, I think both we and Kohl's have felt that economically this is a good program for both sides, in fact I think in acid test our partnership, is it really works economically for both side. And some of the elements of this are kind of structured a little differently from some of the other programs that are out there, but not in a way to have adverse economics for us it\u2019s just -- if you compare that structure to some others it\u2019s a different way that the revenues flow and the payments work. But underlying, it\u2019s a good program that with attractive economic opportunity for us and the renewal was while there were some changes in the terms, it was directionally along the similar lines. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : And the next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi, good evening. Question on the purchase volume; you had a nice increase there obviously year-on-year up 11% and up significantly from last quarter. Just you talked through earlier about the drivers to the increase in the loan balances, I am just wondering if you could kind of parse out the different drivers to the purchase volume increase by the different products, the clients types that you have? Richard Fairbank : Yes. So, the purchase volume Betsy is and here I really speak about the general purpose card, obviously there is purchase volume growth going on, on the private label side, but we\u2019ve kind of more called your attention to the general purpose side since of course that\u2019s where interchange and the branded, the branded card business is for us. So, we talked about year-over-year growth of 16% which is even up on what we\u2019ve seen recently. The two effects that are going on is continued growth in the spender side of the business, both in consumer and in small business as a result of a lot of the marketing and customer experience work that we've been doing. And then also Betsy another factor that has boosted this is credit line increases and because of course what's happening is as people are selling their new credit lines, they're doing it through purchases as well. So that certainly added to this significant growth number. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : I know the credit line increases typically with (inaudible) strategy you've got increases primarily targeted towards the lower end of the customer and near-prime customers as opposed to prime customers. Is that the way the credit line increase has been going recently I mean giving effect [you to brown] I'm just wondering if credit line increases are across the board in terms of the quality sort of customer or are they still move likely to be skewed towards near-prime than the super prime? Richard Fairbank : I mean our credit line -- so I am going to go back to what led us to have a bit of a brown out in line increases and that was this regulatory requirement that one needed a validation of income before one did a line increase. So our line programs work across our entire portfolio, there was more impact on the lower end because we tend to start with lower lines and then the mechanism and then there are more line increases to get to a destination than say where you to get a venture card you would be starting with a pretty high line. So the differential impact was more on the lower side of the market of our portfolio, but really the effect and our roll out now of full capabilities and line increases is targeted across our whole portfolio. Jeff Norris :  Next question please. Operator :  Next will be Matt Howard with UBS. Matt Howard - UBS: Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the expense guidance again, just going back to last year the original guidance was (inaudible) under $600 million decline or improving efficiency. I guess what\u2019s just changed as it just more opportunities you are seeing to take share or is there some other competitive dynamic that would suggest otherwise? Steve Crawford :  Are you talking about -- I thought I heard you say expense efficiency? Matt Howard - UBS: The operating expense, the previous guidance were forward to fall last\u2026 Steve Crawford :  So if it\u2019s operating, we really haven\u2019t changed our guidance for \u201814 what we did tonight was add a bogie for 2015. With respect to our original guidance for \u201814 all we have said is that we expect higher revenues and higher expense relative to our original estimate. Matt Howard - UBS: Okay. And just in terms of the pre-provision guidance I thought you said sort of higher $10 billion but higher revenue offset by higher expenses. We just didn\u2019t know why the guidance were to fall year-over-year why would that have changed? Steve Crawford :  The guidance for the efficiency ratio to fall? Matt Howard - UBS: For the overall operating expense number. Steve Crawford :  I am not sure I am following. Matt Howard - UBS: I will follow up [offline]. Thanks. Jeff Norris :  Next question please. Operator :  And that will come Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities :  Good afternoon thanks for taking my question. Just one question, Rich you mentioned in terms of the commercial loans a little bit of slowing in the loan growth there and I saw specifically in commercial real estate in the multifamily portfolio that was growing and annualized rate little bit about half of the rate of what you've done year-over-year. Is that from you are being tighter on underwriting or is that just a drop in demand across your markets? Richard Fairbank : It's probably not technically either, we haven't tightened our underwriting nor have we loosened it. And I don't think demand is going down; if anything, I think demand is going up a little bit. I think -- but maybe I'm parsing words here, I think what's happening in some of these markets is that the markets are heating up in terms of competitive activity and some of the pricing in these spaces. So, what we have done and then multifamily is a good example of that. We are very working hard to grow, but not by lowering our underwriting standards. We work really hard within the context of our standards to get all the business that we can. And one of the things that we've said in parts of the commercial business probably even more so on the C&I side, there are increasing evidence of some underwriting in pricing, softening in the marketplace on the C&I side, certainly the I think the impact on the institutional investor side of covenant light loans, things like this. This is slowly kind of spreading into different parts of the commercial marketplace and that is the biggest reason that we\u2019re saying over time this very significant growth rate that we have, we expect it to moderate just because we\u2019re holding pretty firm on the standards that we will accept for these loans. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay Rich. And then I just want to follow-up on the comment you made at a conference recently about selectively placing branches across your platform. Obviously, you have a number of markets where you already have reasonable branch density. I guess I am just curious at this point given your comments about thinking about branches, if you are more interested now than you might have been in the recent past about making very targeted acquisitions of branches in and/or around where your branches currently sit. Richard Fairbank : I think we are in a --- we\u2019re big believers frankly in being on the forefront of the digital revolution in banking and it is clearly sweeping the banking industry. And we\u2019re not just ideally kind of interested in it. You may have noticed that we bought ING Direct that had a very big investment in digital banking. What we have often said though is my perspective from one who\u2019s started out over 20 years ago to build the company that I thought would be a kind of direct only company, over time I\u2019ve really come to appreciate the benefits of physical distribution and face-to-face contact. What we\u2019re trying to do is work backwards from where that market is going as opposed to just try to go recreate what others have done in classic banking. And therefore I think putting in some light physical distribution in key metro areas is part of our future, but I think we're going to go about this trying to go with the market is going and not through the classic kind of go acquire across the country kind of thing. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : And our last question will come from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : Good evening. I guess on back to the efficiency guide for 2015, I mean if I think back over the past few years, we've been on this kind of transitional period where there was the top bank initiative and scaling up to be one of the top five banks; and I mean I\u2019m sure so that goes along with that; there has been the merger charges; increase in tangible amortization which now running down. And so I guess as I think now, 53% to 54% in 2015 recognizing that no environment is ever really normal or the end game, but would you view 53 to 54 as a roughly normalized level of efficiency for the company or would you still view it as a transitional year to some ultimately lower level? Steve Crawford : Yes. Look, I think if we were going to talk about something through the cycle, we probably wouldn't pick efficiency ratio, because you can pay dividends and return capital out of what your efficiency ratio is. So I think it's reasonable and we think about what the right through the cycle level of profitability is. There may be a point where that discussion we have. But if we do that, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be around efficiency guidance. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : Fair enough. I guess as a follow-up and just a small thing. The jump in occupancy expense this quarter; is that a new run rate or was that just something that happened that was idiosyncratic to this quarter? Steve Crawford :  No, that\u2019s probably closer to a new run rate. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : Thank you. Steve Crawford :  Nothing idiosyncratic there. Jeff Norris :  Well, thank you very much to everyone for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, if you have further questions, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any questions you may have. Thanks again. Have a good evening. Operator :  Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for your participation today.",

And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve? Stephen S. Crawford:  Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.1 billion or $1.86 per share in the third quarter. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.94 per share and had a return on average tangible common equity of 15.7%. Included in continuing operations results this quarter were higher linked-quarter revenue, flat linked-quarter non-interest expenses, higher provision for loan losses driven by $214 million allowance build, partially offset by lower charge-offs. There were a few non-recurring legal reserve changes in the quarter, I would like to highlight. First, a $27 million contra revenue impact; second, we had charges in non-interest expense, which were offset by a $28 million benefit in our domestic card business. And last, we had a $70 million charge from rep and warranty expense and discontinued operations. Turning to Slide 4, net interest margin increased 14 basis points in the third quarter to 6.69%, primarily driven by a higher average balances in our domestic card business and the third quarter having one more day worth of recognized income. Average interest earning assets were up quarter-over-quarter driven by higher average loan balances in our domestic card, auto finance, and commercial banking businesses. Turning to Slide 5, let me cover capital trends. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized fully phased-in basis was 11.8% in the third quarter, compared to 11.6% in the second quarter of this year. With the benefit of phase-in our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.7%. And while we have yet to enter parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches, we continue to estimate we are above our target of 8%. We reduced our net share count by 3 million shares in the quarter, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We completed approximately 500 million of our share buyback program in the third quarter, and we expect to buy an additional 1 billion over the next two quarters. Let me close the night with a brief update of our 2014 expectations. We continue to expect pre-provision earnings to be about $10 billion, excluding non-recurring items. Traditionally, our marketing expenses were seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. That seasonal increase in marketing as well as our operating expense investments in growth, which Rich will review in more detail will drive an increase in non-interest expense in the fourth quarter of this year, which will carry into 2015. We highlighted for you last quarter that allowance releases were less likely going forward. In the third quarter, we build allowances as we grew our card loans and expectations for future card growth will likely drive allowance build in the coming quarters. With that let me turning the call over to Rich. Richard D. Fairbank: Thanks, Steve. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 7 with our domestic card business, which delivered another quarter of strong results. Ending loans were up about 5% year-over-year and about 3% from the linked-quarter, stronger than typical seasonal growth in the third quarter. Continuing momentum and new account originations and credit line increase programs drove loan growth in the quarter. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private label cards that don\u2019t produce interchange revenue grew 17.5% year-over-year. Revenue margin for the quarter increased 34 basis points to about 17.4%, consistent with normal seasonality. Revenue dollars grew about 6% from the linked-quarter, driven by growth in average loans and the seasonal increase in revenue margin. Year-over-year, revenue dollars were down about 4% as the revenue impact of our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio was partially offset by strong underlying growth in average loans. Non-interest expenses increased $17 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher marketing expense. We expect both operating expenses and marketing to increase in the fourth quarter; driven by loan growth, the expected seasonal ramp in marketing and continuing opportunities, we see to drove customer relationships, purchase volume, and loans. Domestic charge-off rate improved 69 basis points on a sequential quarter basis to 2.83%. We believe the sharp improvement in the quarter is temporary. The third quarter is usually the seasonal low point for card losses, but we think seasonality drove only about half of the improvement that we saw in the quarter. Most of the remaining improvement was the result of better than seasonal delinquency rates we experienced in the first half of the year flowing through the charge-offs in the quarter. We\u2019ve already seen this short-term delinquency benefit reverse itself. We think the 2.83% charge-off rate is an unsustainable low point, and that losses are headed up from here. In the short-term, we expect normal seasonal increases in the charge-off rate in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2015. Beyond seasonality, the temporary delinquency benefit I just described has run its course which will add to the upward trend in the charge-off rate in the fourth quarter. Longer term, loan growth will start to impact the charge-off rate in 2015. As new loan balances season, they will start putting upward pressure on losses. While the impact on the charge-off rate will be modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. Pulling together both the short-term and long-term factors including seasonal variability, we expect the quarterly domestic charge-off rates throughout 2015 to be in the mid-to-high 3% range. In addition to rising charge-offs, we expect allowance additions resulting from loan growth. We aren\u2019t counting on further economic improvement helping our credit loss nor are we projecting renewed economic weakness. Of course, changes in a still tenuous economic recovery could substantially impact our current loss expectations. Our current business remains well positioned. Loans, purchase volumes, and revenues are growing, and we are delivering strong and resilient returns. Moving to Slide 8. The consumer banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans were flat compared to the linked-quarter and declined modestly from the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage run-off. Auto originations increased 14% year-over-year. Most of the growth came from prime originations as we continue to capture additional prime share from our existing dealers. On a linked-quarter basis, auto originations were essentially flat. Ending deposit balances declined by about $1.5 billion or 1% in the quarter. Year-over-year deposit balances declined about $800 million. We\u2019ve had an abundance of deposits since the ING Direct acquisition, and we\u2019ve been allowing the least attractive deposits from Capital One\u2019s legacy direct bank to run-off. Consumer banking revenue was flat compared to the second quarter. Year-over-year revenue declined by $61 million or 4% driven by the impact of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances, and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue impacts. Non-interest expense increased $29 million or 3% from the prior year. The increase resulted from growth in auto loans as well as a change in the geography of where we recognized auto repossession expenses, which are now included in operating expense rather than in net charge-offs. Provision for credit losses increased $55 million from the linked-quarter driven by expected seasonal trends in auto charge-off. Home loans credit trends remain favorable and continue to perform well inside the assumptions we made when we acquired the mortgage portfolios. Our consumer banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the phase of continuing challenges. While we expect that auto returns will continue to be resilient and well above hurdle, we expect that they will continue to decline as we move from exceptional levels to more cycle average performance. And in our retail deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment will continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2015. As you can see on Slide 9, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Loan balances increased about 3% in the quarter and 17% year-over-year. Most of this growth is in specialized industry verticals in C&I lending and CRE. Loan yields declined 11 basis points in the quarter and 48 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by increased competition and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. Revenues increased 3% from the second quarter and about 10% from the prior year. The year-over-year increase was the result of growth in loan and deposit balances across the franchise, offset by declining loan yields. The stronger increase in non-interest income was driven by the Beech Street acquisition and growth of fee generating business. Non-interest expenses were up 18% from the prior year as a result of growth including the Beech Street acquisition and continuing infrastructure investments to drive future growth. In the quarter, non-interest expense was flat. We continue to closely manage credit risk. Charge-offs, non-performing loans and criticized loans all improved in the quarter and remain at exceptionally low levels. While commercial credit results remain very strong, the current levels are not sustainable through the cycle. Commercial Banking competition continues to increase pressuring margins and returns. As competition continues to increase, it\u2019s likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will be slower in 2015 and closer to overall industry growth rate. But we expect our focus in specialized approach will continue to deliver strong returns in the commercial bank. I\u2019ll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. We posted another quarter of solid results for the company and across our businesses and we continue to return capital to our shareholders as we execute our announced $2.5 billion share repurchase program. As Steve mentioned, we are on track to deliver 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10 billion. We expect growth in full year revenues in 2015 driven by strong growth in average loans. While the efficiency ratio will vary from quarter-to-quarter, we expect the full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53% and 54% excluding non-recurring items. Our expectations for both the remainder of 2014 and 2015 include the impacts of investments to drive future growth to be a leader in digital banking and to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. Continuing opportunities to grow our domestic card business are expected to drive higher marketing expense in the fourth quarter and in 2015. Marketing efficiency, cost to acquire new accounts and the NPV of our marketing investments are strong. We are also making significant investments in digital and technology, banking inherently is a digital product and digital will transform banking over time. The momentum around digital is building across financial services. Consumers increasingly expect elegant and robust digital experiences from all companies, including banks. Software is a predominant way consumers interact with their banks even today and that engagement will only go up. Activity in the payment space from financial services companies and non-banks is accelerating. The ability to efficiently store and use vast amounts of data will unlock new opportunities. Capital One is well positioned to succeed in a digital world and we are investing in the foundational infrastructure and capabilities to be a digital leader. We are continuing to expand Capital One 360 as a national digital banking platform. We are bringing in significant native digital talent, engineers, product developers, designers and data scientists. We are very active in mobile and in payment. For example we are one of only a handful of banks, included in Apples launch of Apple pay in September and shortly thereafter launched our Capital One digital wallet. We are focused on delivering an exceptional user experience to our customers and recently acquired a leading design firm in San Francisco called Adaptive Path. While the financial cost was modest, Adaptive Path has been a pioneer in the UX field and they will make a big impact on our customer experience. Also, Capital One has a deep heritage as an information based company and Big Data is tailor made for us. We are investing in our Big Data infrastructure to enable rapid psycho analysis in the generation of even more powerful insights and new services. As we are reminded of almost daily in the media, there are significant threats to information security across all industries, including financial services. At Capital One, protecting customer information is paramount and requires that we are ever vigilant in our defenses. We\u2019ve made significant investments in this area over the years and we will continue to invest aggressively. Ultimately, the winners in banking will have the capability of world-class software company. Most of the leverage and most of our investment is in building the foundational underpinnings and talent model of a great digital company. To succeed in a digital world, the company can\u2019t just boast digital capabilities onto the side of an analog business. At Capital One, we\u2019re embedding technology, data and software development deeply into our business model and how we work. For example we\u2019re focused on building reusable plug and play middleware using restful APIs, modern software development and design, integrating our platforms and making them scalable in real time and building a powerful and flexible data infrastructure. These foundational investments while not only the most visible are glamorous aspect of our digital journey create sustainable competitive advantages and position us to continue to thrive as banking goes even more digital. We\u2019re also investing to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. We are enhancing our capabilities, infrastructure and talent to meet heightened expectations for risk management and regulatory reporting. We are continuously improving processes for capital and liquidity management including CCAR and the new LCR requirements, and we\u2019re investing to deliver on the broad set of emerging regulatory requirements. The expectations for large financial institutions continue to rise and we\u2019ll continue to invest to keep pace with these requirements. Pulling up Capital One is delivering attractive risk adjusted returns today and we expect that will continue. We have the financial strength to invest in our future without comprising current financial results. We remain focused on the leverage that create and sustain high performance. We\u2019ll continue to pursue growth opportunities in card, auto and commercial banking. We\u2019ll maintain our long standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilient, and we will actively work to return capital to shareholders, as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors. Now, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start our Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any further follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Lauren, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe Bruyette & Woods: Good evening. First question just on your expectations for charge-offs, I appreciate the color, is it fair to assume the ramp in the reserves was kind of related to that as well as the growth and maybe you could just remind us of the methodology you use to determine reserve adequacy? And I guess second question, I\u2019ll ask upfront just the growth in the balances, it\u2019s pretty encouraging, what are you seeing that\u2019s different from maybe a year ago that\u2019s driving that growth in balances in card? Thank you. Stephen S. Crawford:  I\u2019ll take the first. I think Rich will take the second. You are spot on in your observation about what drives the allowances, it\u2019s really two factors, loan growth which we\u2019ve been talking about returning in the second half for a while and then also the higher delinquencies which translates into higher NACO likely in the future. And basically, we have an extremely low quarter of NACO this quarter. As Rich talked about, we expect that to normalize and that replacement effect also has an impact on allowances. So going forward, you should absolutely be focused on loan growth and then to the extent that you believe delinquencies in acres are headed up, and that\u2019s going to have an impact on allowance and obviously if you thought the opposite, the opposite would be true, but it\u2019s really both factors. Richard D. Fairbank: And Sanjay, what we\u2019re seeing is continuation of what I\u2019ve been talking about for \u2013 in a sense, talking about what we\u2019re working on for a number of years, and talking about the traction the last several quarters, the traction that we\u2019re getting, it is really in both originations and in line increases. In originations, we in the areas that we have really chosen to focus on including the top of the market with the heavy spender segment and in revolvers other than high balance revolvers. We have seen really growing traction in those areas, and that\u2019s a good thing to see. The other big effect is line increases. Line increase is something that is always a central part of how we manage our business. As you know, we were kind of experienced sort of a line increased brown-out, starting really in some sense back in the throes of the great recession. We\u2019re very conservative and then of course we had the Card Act and the rules associated with proof of income before we could do line increases. So in some sense, what you see now is moving from a browned-out line increase situation through now where we\u2019re back into equilibrium in doing that and also catching up with some deferred line increases along the way. So there is a lot of strength in both areas, and I think we\u2019re encouraged not only by the traction, but by the prospects for continuing traction. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi, a couple of follow ups. One is just on the ALLR ratio itself. I guess your point that expecting NCOs to come back up, are you using a forward look of I would say 12 months, 18 months, and I also just wanted to understand if \u2013 how you are assessing what ratio to get that ALLR up to today? Richard D. Fairbank: Yes, it\u2019s actually different, Betsy, based on product, but the big driver is card and card, and the most important timeframe is the next 12 months, so it\u2019s really the view of what\u2019s going to happen to loss rate over the next 12 months, it\u2019s going to be the principal driver. In addition to that, you\u2019ve also got to factor in what the growth will be. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Good evening. Steve, when you think about the 53% to 54% efficiency ratio for 2015, can you give us a sense of what type of PP&R would be associated with that. I know you noted, Rich noted that you expect growth in revenues for the coming year, but Rich also gave a long list of things that you needed to invest in, so I guess if we do continue to see balance sheet growth at the pace that we are seeing, can you just help us understand what might be a good base level for us to anchor to, thanks. Stephen S. Crawford: Yes. So I think Rich did a couple of things, he reconfirmed at 53% to 54%. He also said we expect loan growth to really drive the revenue outlook. So, I think we\u2019ll leave it up to you to really figure out what you think a reasonable rate of loan growth is, and that\u2019s probably as far as we are prepared to go in 2015 in terms of forecasting PP&R. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : And then if I could ask one follow-up question, Rich, you talked a lot about digital investments, Steve spoke about opportunities to make a business more efficient in the past. I know you guys are talking about a 53% to 54% next year, which is essentially flat on a core basis. But as we look out over the next few years, do you think there is enough leverage in the investments that you are making now that we should see continued efficiency improvement over time? Richard D. Fairbank: Ryan, I think that digital, there are many benefits to digital investment. I would \u2013 the economics ultimately of going digital are pretty dramatic. The marginal cost of a digital interaction is virtually zero, and we are far from that in the analog activities that we do. A couple of things I want to say about that, first of all, I don\u2019t even think the biggest benefit or the most compelling case for digital is just to lower costs even though I do believe that that is the end game. This is one of those few things in life where it\u2019s pretty much everything gets better, but we are talking about being able to be faster, more efficient, a better customer experience, better controlled in an intense regulatory environment, much more able to innovate a better associate experience, so there is a lot of things that come on this journey. From an economic point of view, we have tracked digital investment, and also the clear savings that come from that, most importantly from driving customers to digital. Just because you build it, they don\u2019t necessarily come. So we have a lot of efforts on that and we are making a lot of progress. That said, the tally right now for the measurable parts is we\u2019re spending more than the manifest savings are, and I think actually that differential will continue because there is a lot to invest in, but it\u2019s very clear to me that we can see savings and we can see a lot of other benefits happening. But the thing I want to leave with you is this is not a program, this is not a project, this is not a one year kind of thing. I mean we\u2019re essentially talking about \u2013 we happen to be living through probably one of the biggest revolutions in the history of the world up there with possibly fire at [will] (ph). So that said, I think there\u2019s a lot of transformation to go on in banking. And so, I think that the impacted digital investment will put upward pressure on efficiency ratios as opposed to downward in the near and medium-term. Longer run its direction is clearly downward, but I just wanted to leave you with that. Jeff Norris :  Next question please? Operator : We\u2019ll go to Ken Bruce of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good evening. I guess I would like to delve into what you\u2019re seeing within the portfolio or just generally that\u2019s leaving you to believe that that delinquencies are heading higher teens, just looking at some of trust data that you see a little bit of a seasonal effect, but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something specific that you\u2019re kind of focused on or what\u2019s kind of leaving you to believe that we\u2019re going to pass the best in delinquencies? Richard D. Fairbank:  Well, so, let me separate out sort of the comments I often make about where we are in the cycle versus things related to Capital One and the strategies that we have. I don\u2019t have a changed point of view about where we are in the cycle. We\u2019re in an extraordinary time. It\u2019s hard to imagine. As an industry loss is getting much better than this. I\u2019ve been wrong before that over the last few years. It\u2019s really quite extraordinary where we have come to. But this is not. When we\u2019re talking about delinquencies and charge-offs going up, this is not calling a turn in a sense of \u2013 finally the credit card industry has gotten beyond its lowest point. At some point that\u2019s going to happen. What we have going on here is much more \u2013 is partly just mechanics that we want to share with you and then most importantly, it\u2019s the growth story. The mechanics are that we had an unusually low third quarter. And so, coming back often unusually low third quarter is part of the math that we want to make sure that everybody understands. And within that of course you have the seasonal effects, but also we\u2019ve seen \u2013 in our history we watch very, very carefully for changes in flow rates that we see across the business. There was a particularly positive good surge in flow rates in the first half of this year that just looking at the mechanics of that, that has sort of reversed itself not into something bad but more of a just kind of reversing of that particular surge. That\u2019s one effect that kind of going on here. But as we look forward, so first of all we\u2019re reversing out of the unusual momentarily low of this quarter. And then you pretty much from there you\u2019re looking at seasonality and we\u2019re heading into the seasonal ramping part of the year. And then you have the growth, the dynamics of growth taking over from there. So this isn\u2019t really about the charge, the credit card industry, it\u2019s really about Capital One and the effect of the very positive story that we see developing in terms of our growth, but we want to make sure people understand that what comes with that territory is increasing losses, particularly compared with our environment of not much growth and even shrinking over the last few years, and we want to make sure investors just understand the charge-off math associated with that. Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And everybody is focused on credit card growth, it seems that the success that you\u2019ve all had is being kind of looked at by others jealously and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve seen any change in the competitive landscape based on others behavior? Richard D. Fairbank: So I think the competitive landscape in card continues to be intense, but strikingly stable. And again I would compare that you\u2019ve often heard me talk about, I think both the commercial business and the auto business are getting kind of into a degrading state of competition and as they regret towards the main and so on. I think that so, but the card business, the pricing is relatively stable, you\u2019ve had mail volumes increase by about 16% over the last year and so we got to keep an eye on that. And by the way that mail volumes increasing in the context of where the world is increasingly going to digital so that the total amount of marketing is even greater than kind of what you see in mail volumes. So certainly there\u2019s more \u2013 there\u2019s competitive intensity there, but I think the real thing that\u2019s going on is there\u2019s \u2013 the surviving and successful players in the card business have looked back in their rear view mirror as they\u2019re tripped through the great recession. And they have figured out where they\u2019re good and where they\u2019re not so good, and they have staked out in most cases strikingly different strategies. And I think each of those strategies makes a lot of sense for the particular issuer and it\u2019s playing to the strength of the particular issuer, but I think it helps to contribute to a rationale competitive environment in which in its own way we can kind of all succeed. And one thing kind of helping us a little bit after all of these years of the card industry and total growth growing nowhere you have seen in the last few months just looking at revolving credit date I think inching up from near zero to in March 1.5%, April 2.6%, May 2.5%, June 2.9%, July 3.4%, August 3.3%. So it\u2019s a little bit of rising of the tide as well. So these alleged jealous competitors, I think, are feeling very good about how they\u2019re doing in, it\u2019s a pretty stable industry. Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Thank you. Good evening. There is a kind of focus on auto and \u2013 so I had a couple of questions that I\u2019ll ask upfront. Rich, can you give some perspectives around how the auto business at Capital One has transformed from its early years to where it is today and the extent to which during that time there has been a remixing the way from what was then maybe a bit more of a focus on sub-prime customers to perhaps a bit more of a focus on prime today? And just kind of bring us to where your mix of prime versus sub-prime is currently? And maybe you talk about the relative attractiveness of each of those segments in the current market? And then finally maybe just doesn\u2019t necessarily have to follow that the risk of loss is greater in sub-prime given collateral quality and to the extent to which used car prices still remain pretty strong? I know there is a lot there, but I would appreciate any color on that. Thank you. Richard D. Fairbank: And you say as the risk of loss greater in sub-prime, greater than \u2013 what greater than it was before greater than prime, what did you\u2026 Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Yes, I mean, I guess you\u2019d maybe just talk about like risk adjusted margins and how they have changed in both prime and sub-prime and how collateral plays into that? Richard D. Fairbank: Okay, thank you, Bill. So, Capital One, in 1998 we entered the auto finance business with the belief that this highly fragmented industry was going to go national and we wanted to bring information based strategies and the national kind of strategy to that business and we bought a sub-prime credit card company, Summit Acceptance Corporation. So our initial foundation came out of the sub-prime side and over the decade and a half that we\u2019ve been doing it since we have migrated to a pretty much full credit spectrum perspective. This is not only to leverage scale economies, but what\u2019s very clear is that the real leverage is in deep dealer relationships and there is economic benefit in that and I think in terms of the quality, the kind of loans that come out of that, it\u2019s a win-win to build deep dealer relationships. And also it is our nature. If you look across the businesses that we do, that we tend to try to play across the credit spectrum and tend not to specialize just in one particular place. So this has been a long journey over this period of time, but you can see the continuing move toward not only near-prime, but so much growth in prime. And I think \u2013 and most of this is a matter of solidifying and deepening the exiting dealer relationships that we already have. So I think it\u2019s a win-win as we do that. Now when you think about the economics of the business, sub-prime has high margins and higher losses and it\u2019s all about how well one can play the credit risk management game. And I think this is not for the faint of heart. This is companies that deeply invest in that and we have 15 years experience in auto and couple of decades experience in the card business and underwriting in that particular segment and we feel very good about the risk adjusted through cycle returns that we experience there. And I think our rearview mirror experience in the Great Recession is confirmatory as well Near-prime by the way is just in between everything that I\u2019m going to say about prime and sub-prime. On the prime side, this is very thin margins and very low credit losses and that is a business that where scale matters and every expense dollar is really important and so on. But I think we\u2019ve managed to build one of the top positions in that business. And while the returns are much lower we are comfortable with those returns. They\u2019re much lower than sub-prime. We\u2019re comfortable with the returns and we\u2019re very comfortable with the integrated economics we\u2019re getting in this business. Just one comment about the cycle for a second. The extraordinary returns a few years ago in the auto business as competition headed for the hills, have now pretty much regressed very close to the mean. Some prime remains a little bit above in terms of returns at this point and the prime business is really right there at the intense point in the cycle from a margin point of view. But overall things here we feel good. Stephen S. Crawford:  Also look for additional information on the mix of our auto portfolio in our upcoming 10-Q. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : We\u2019ll go to Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Donald James Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Yes. Rich, I have some question around Apple Pay. It seems like the banks may be paying some type of fee to Apple. Obviously, you can\u2019t talk about the specifics. I was curious if you can offset that outside of fraudulent. Secondarily, I know the networks are creating a vault and charging the banks. And there\u2019s been some talks that the banks might create a vault. I was wondering if you consider that as well. Richard D. Fairbank:  Okay. Don, we don\u2019t get into the economics of our contract with Apple. But the decisions that we make come with the belief that this is an important thing for us to do. And I think it offers a good, opportunity and upside for us. The vault that that bill is referring to let me just comment for a second, one of the key elements in security, that\u2019s a very important breakthrough is that, card numbers are not going to be embedded inside the secured element on a phone. Instead, one-time single-use or a few times use tokens will be in a sense, sent to the phone. So that the risk of extended fraud is massively reduced. Visa and MasterCard are creating a vault and there is other activity that\u2019s going on of some alternative approaches, as well just in the nature of an evolving industry. I think people aren\u2019t leaving single solutions as the only way to go. But whether it is coming from Visa and MasterCard or from a banking industry vaults are really actually from individual issuers vault. There\u2019s work going on in all three of those dimensions, but the big story there is, this tokenization is a game changer in terms of security. Donald James Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Thank you. Jeff Norris :  Next question please? Operator : We\u2019ll go to Bob Napoli with William Blair. Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Company:  Thank you. Good afternoon. Just on the credit card business, Rich, I mean your growth just over the last few months has just really accelerated and it is there \u2013 are we getting to high single-digit growth or double-digit growth in the credit card business or is it just \u2013 this is just kind of a one-time catch up in bringing the credit lines \u2013 kind of catching up with the increases in credit lines that you had delayed for several years? Pretty stark increase in loan growth from 0% to 5% in the last three or four months. Richard D. Fairbank: Yes, it\u2019s funny given the heritage of the company that we would think numbers like this are\u2026 Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Company: Right, go ahead. Richard D. Fairbank: Are so big, but all jokes aside of course we did live through the period where not only where we \u2013 so you had \u2013 we\u2019re going from an environment where we had a very cautious consumer and we ourselves had a certain challenges that we had to deal with that I talked about earlier. And then we also had sort of the running off of some of the HSBC highest risk things and then our multi-year is still going on avoidance and running off of high balance revolver. So that\u2019s a lot of things that sort of conspired to generate some anemic and frankly negative numbers in terms of our growth. And what\u2019s going on here Bob is not really a kind of one-time effect, on the line increases there is a bit of a \u2013 there is some element of kind of catch up with that, but I would more leave you with \u2013 this is really the product of the steady work we done from a number of years both in the line increase innovation side and on originating in the segments, we know so well. It\u2019s actually continued traction there. You know as well enough to know that we\u2019re not going to make a forecast of growth, but you can also tell that that we feel pretty good about the traction we have right now and we do look forward to seeing continued growth. Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Company: Then last question is just on the commercial business, you\u2019ve had very good growth there, but loan yields \u2013 well credit is phenomenal, your yield has dropped almost 50 basis points and deposit costs are relatively flat year-over-year, and you talked about very intense competition. But how does \u2013 where do the loan yields flattened out here, does the growth really slow down because it\u2019s too competitive. Can you really generate the returns you\u2019re looking for with the trends that I\u2019m looking at? Richard D. Fairbank: Well, look at \u2013 I think that the nature \u2013 let me comment for a second about the nature of how I think credit cycles work. When you\u2019re in the sort of good part of the credit cycle, which has been like the last few years where borrowers are more careful and lenders are more careful and maybe a little more scarce, as you go on in the cycle, I think there is a very kind of classic pattern that occurs that as competition increases, lenders, particularly those who have strong memories of a recent recession like we all do here, what happens is the competition becomes almost singularly focused on price. And I think that prices fall until you get kind of down to that point where there\u2019s not a lot of room there. And then you kind of move to phase two in the industries \u2013 in the cycle evolution where people start compromising various underwriting terms. I think most of the \u2013 I describe commercial that this battle has been played out on the pricing side, but also there is certainly other things going on the C&I side. The impact of the CLO market and the covenant light loans has put a lot of pressure on sort of the lower end of the marketplace, but it\u2019s not impacting banks that much at this point, but we have a wary eye on that. I mean, just the percentage of loans in the institutional market that are covenant light is substantially higher than before the great recession. So we certainly have to keep an eye on this. And in other areas, individual areas you start to see some loosening of some underwriting standards in the industry, but I think all in all if the things aren\u2019t too in a bad place yet. The key thing we\u2019re doing is focusing on segments where we are comfortable with the segments and for us that\u2019s mostly the specialty lending segments that are not as subject to 8,000 banks who are looking for assets, trying to go out and see if they can generate business. This is kind of like the card business where highly sophisticated limited number of players, who know what they are doing are competing in these spaces. So the net effect of all of that is I\u2019m going to leave you with. I mean, we still feel that there is good business to be had in commercial, but you should be thanking as this regresses to the main our growth is going to do the same. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator :  We will take Chris Donat with Sandra O\u2019Neil. Christopher R. Donat \u2013 Sandler O :  Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask about the marketing spend in the third quarter, which typically at least in the last few years has been down from the second quarter, but it\u2019s uptick this year. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s reflective of opportunities you\u2019re seeing that are then translating into new account growth, or is it more tied to other campaigns, or something like Quicksilver. Just little explanation about where we are in the third quarter also with your comments of expecting an increase in the fourth quarter. Neill Partners, L.P.:  Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask about the marketing spend in the third quarter, which typically at least in the last few years has been down from the second quarter, but it\u2019s uptick this year. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s reflective of opportunities you\u2019re seeing that are then translating into new account growth, or is it more tied to other campaigns, or something like Quicksilver. Just little explanation about where we are in the third quarter also with your comments of expecting an increase in the fourth quarter. Richard D. Fairbank: Yes, so it\u2019s a very natural thing for everybody, when they think marketing to think of TV ads, because that\u2019s what you all see unless you\u2019re blessed by having your mail box full of some of our solicitations, and so on. I want to say that just as a reminder, the amount of money we spend on television advertising is a modest portion of the entire expenditures that we do in marketing. So my short answer is that a lot \u2013 there you\u2019ve seen the seasonality of marketing spend and a bunch of that comes from campaign seasonality. So things like our sponsorship of a lot of things in the NFL, I mean in college football and things like that, there\u2019s a whole seasonality there. Campaigns you see like Quick Silver and various things, there\u2019s a lot of hard wiring in advance of some of that stuff. But the increases that you see beyond the normal seasonality really are a reflection of real time seizing of the opportunity that\u2019s going on at Capital One, as we see growth opportunities. So there\u2019s kind of a fixed component in the near term and there\u2019s a variable component. And we\u2019ve always said that in the end that variable component is pretty sizable, as well. And you\u2019re just seeing the manifestation of kind of seizing the moment and taking advantage of that Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : We\u2019ll take Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Richard Barry Shane \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC : Thanks guys for taking my question. I actually want to circle back a little bit on the question upon Bob Napoli raised. When we look at margins, particularly in the card segment, when we strip out, sort of the impact of the HSBC portfolio and the run-off there, it actually looks like your margins have been pretty stable. Rich I know you\u2019ve given a lot of metrics, related to 2015 outlook, in terms of credit and expenses. And I don\u2019t want to push too hard in terms of getting you to give us one more. But give us a sense, I mean, do you think that we are \u2013 and again you guys have talked for a long time about margin erosion and then backed away from it. Do you think that we\u2019re at that inflection point now? Richard D. Fairbank: You\u2019re talking, Rick, about the card business? Richard Barry Shane \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC : I am talking about the card business. Richard D. Fairbank: Yes. Richard Barry Shane \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC : Yes. Richard D. Fairbank: I don\u2019t see evidence that we are. I mean look, I\u2019m the last guy you\u2019ll ever see saying, read my lips, no price reductions from here kind of thing. But now I see people intensely competing in the segments where they see their strengths. All of them are sophisticated, they all have fresh memories from the great recession. And I \u2013 look, yes, we have been one that has been predicting margin decline for a number of years. And so first of all, you probably shouldn\u2019t be asking me giving my credibility that has been lost over that subject, but I see again a very competitive but stable rational environment. And probably in the longer run, there will be pressure on that, but I don\u2019t. It sure has a different feel for me again than the other segments we play in, where things are only going in one direction. Richard Barry Shane \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC : Got it. Yes I mean, I think, if it is that \u2013 several years ago, you talked about margin compression following Card Act and eventually sort of threw your hands up and said, hey, we\u2019re not just seeing it, it feels that way still. Richard D. Fairbank: Yes, I mean, again, a lot of my predictions about the margin compression back in the post Card Act days, really was sort of thinking through the mechanics of all the aspects of the Card Act and how that would play out and some of that stuff. It didn\u2019t play out exactly as we had predicted. The other thing that\u2019s going on, I really want to draw another thing too into this conversation in both the commercial and the auto space, if I were to calibrate that compared with the card business. In the commercial and auto space, you literally had people heading for the hills for a whole period of time as the great recession was raging. A lot of auto players literally liked bailed out of the business. You had a lot of particularly European players bail out of the business so much capital markets money, and so on leaving the commercial space. And so supply itself has really changed over this period of time and it\u2019s led to margins to really go up and then to really go down. In contrast, in the card business, all the players who pretty much entered the great recession are still the same list of players on the other side of it. We were all a little wiser now, but we\u2019re all very committed to the card business and pretty much doing all the things that continue to make it successful. So the card business never had the spike in margins that occurred in the other businesses nor does it have the kind \u2013 the regression to the mean therefore that occurred in the other businesses. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : : Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research : Hi, good evening. Can you hear me? Richard D. Fairbank: Yes, Brain, go ahead. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research :  Okay. I guess I don\u2019t know want to \u2013 I know you said you don\u2019t want to give revenue guidance. I guess the question I have is you\u2019re being fairly explicit about expenses going up and we are at a $12 billion annualized run rate, so it feels like the current consensus is 12.3%, it feels like up is something more than that and you\u2019re still talking about a 53% to 54% efficiency ratio. Just to make those two die out, would revenue growth have to be in the high single-digits just to make the math work? Richard D. Fairbank: No, Brain, if we\u2019d wanted to get that specific by line item we really would. There is a lot of moving pieces in the environment. We\u2019re trying to do a lot of the same things \u2013 a lot of things at the same time, keep our customers, our regulators, and our shareholders delighted and particularly in this interest rate environment that\u2019s a handful. So we feel comfortable with our guidance of 53% to 54%. We\u2019ve tried to give you senses as to what\u2019s going to drive the top-line growth next year, which is really loan growth. We just talked a little bit about how we feel about loan growth. I think given where we are that\u2019s probably as far as we\u2019re prepared to go. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research : Fair enough. Maybe a follow-up on a separate tack is marketplace lending or peer-to-peer whichever term you prefer I mean how do you think about it both as a competitive threat and as an opportunity for Capital One? Richard D. Fairbank: We have a great interest in all of the innovations that are coming out of the digital space. I think one thing that is a classic thing that banks do and I always worried that we resemble that description is to focus on things the way that we do it and miss the fact that they\u2019re really break-through things going on. I think they are \u2013 so the peer-to-peer lending, which is pretty much non-exiting activity on the banking side is clearly picking up quite a bit of steam in the startups and in the digital space. I think there is a \u2013 it is our view that all of the opportunities in the digital space and we pretty obsessively study those including a bunch of lending ones. The peer-to-peer lending opportunity is not one that\u2019s at the top of our list in terms of the opportunities. I mean we\u2019re going to be very close students of what\u2019s going on, but I think there are number of other really clever things that are happening with startups that we\u2019re a lot of more interested in. I think there is a \u2013 when you think about peer-to-peer lending and all the risk issues associated with that, all the regulatory environment we live in and kind of the things that we have learned and \u2013 that I personally, for example, have learned in over two decades of building a consumer lending company. There are a lot of challenges and a lot of risks in there. So what we\u2019re going to do is probably be a very eager observer and we\u2019ll go from there. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : Our final question this evening comes from that Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Thanks for taking my question. A bigger picture question then a fairly focused one. Rich, given \u2013 all the commentary you gave us in terms of your focus on improving the digital offerings and at a time when a lot of the traditional commercial banks are spending a lot of time and effort on doing the same thing. Can you give us a sense as to your \u2013 the trend in your level of comfort and your ability to keep deposits and maintain deposit pricing relative to maybe where \u2013 how you were thinking about that a couple of years ago? Richard D. Fairbank:  Are you talking about the asset liability, sensitivity or\u2026 Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : I guess I\u2019m really talking about deposit data, one of the questions we get most often from investors is Capital One spends a lot of time talking about their digital offerings and I think that in some cases gets investors worried about the potential for outflow of deposits faster at Capital One than at a \u201ctraditional bank\u201d even though those traditional banks are now following down the path of Capital One trying to focus on digital acquisition of deposits. Richard D. Fairbank: Yes. So first of all, you know, so much \u2013 when I gave my little spit flying little passionate speech about digital a few minutes ago. One thing I want to say is the way digital is transforming banking goes far beyond what I think the thing people mostly think about, which is, today there are branches and tomorrow there is a branch in people\u2019s pocket. And look that is very important component of that whole thing. And by having bought ING Direct, by having before that already build to digital bank of our own, and having a big commitment to digital innovation and having a heritage of 20 some years being a direct marketing company, I\u2019m very interested in the opportunities there. But the bulk of our digital investment itself and capabilities is really for things that kind of extend beyond some of the narrowest view about just moving to a bank in your pocket kind of thing. Let me comment on deposit stickiness. And I really appreciate that you asked the question. If the conventional wisdom out there is gosh well the only way that these, some of these online banks have got, they\u2019ve used price as a way to generate their business. Again having 10 years experienced ourselves in building an online direct bank and then having bought ING, we have a window that shows how very different that the actual world that we live in is, versus some of those perceptions. And a lot of it, and it really pivots around what is it that is drawing customers into a bank like ING Direct, for example, and now Capital One 360. Many years ago at its very beginning ING offered one of the highest rates paid. And over the years it had a very explicit goal that we are going to move into building of franchise and building a brand, and the benefit of that is that we\u2019re going to get people to come for us for something other than just being number one in the league tables with respect to rate. And over time the ING franchise has, now Capital One 360 has moved way off the frontier of where the hot money goes. And in fact, we now have well more than a decade of experience of just seeing how long live these customers are, and also how below this franchise is, the customer loyalty is really extraordinary. And so while I would say that relative to the branch on the corner we in our own planning are assuming a deposit data that is higher than those most sticky of deposits. I think that people are going to be pleasantly surprised by the resilience of these deposits. You make the other point, which is really important to, which is that there is a blurring of the lines here over time as more and more banking becomes digital. And I think, especially with Capital One strategy ourselves to kind of create the fusion of the truly kind of ING oriented digital bank and the physical distribution Capital One that we are and I think that as our own lines blur also you\u2019re going to see the industry lines blur and I think that over time it is a franchise with surprising striking resilience. Stephen S. Crawford:  And, Rich, just to add, extending that beyond just how online versus in-branch deposits respond, I think the way your whole liability mix responds to changes in environment is a much bigger question. It\u2019s a function of your wholesale, retail mix, what\u2019s ensured, what\u2019s not ensured, the size and duration of your deposit relationships. And as we look at that we don\u2019t feel disadvantaged relative to peers. And I think if you look at our asset sensitivity, you\u2019d find that lines up pretty closely with the average peer bank. Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  Thanks, Steve. And then a quick question for you perhaps. You mentioned the LCR requirement. How far long are you on that? And was the decline in the yield on investment securities this quarter versus the second quarter driven by some of the actions you\u2019ve taken over the three months? Stephen S. Crawford: We have been rotating. There will probably be a little bit more, but that\u2019s not a big impact on margin. We\u2019re going to be fine in terms of meeting the transitional requirements. LCR isn\u2019t a huge issue for us except there is a little bit of a margin compression and obviously there is some OpEx getting our systems in a place where we\u2019ll be able to calculate all the stuff on a daily basis. It\u2019s a good example of the regulatory cost that Rich was mentioning. Jeff Norris :  Well, thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. Thank you for your continued interest in Capital One. And remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great night. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve? Stephen Crawford : Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll begin tonight with Slide 3. 2014 full year results reflect solid underlying performance across all of our businesses. Consistent with our expectations provided at the beginning of the year, 2014 pre-provision earnings were $10.1 billon. Net income grew 7% and earnings per share grew 10%. For the year, return on average tangible common equity was 15.8%. Our balance sheet remains strong with an ending common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%. And we reduced our common shares outstanding by 3%, reflecting our share buyback program that began in April. For the fourth quarter Capital One earned $999 million, or $1.73 per share. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.68 per share. Pre-provision earnings of $2.5 billion were down $125 million from the third quarter as higher linked-quarter revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses, largely driven by seasonal and growth related cost and investments in our technology and regulatory agendas that we have highlighted for you over the past several quarters. Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis as higher charge-offs were more than offset a smaller allowance build over the previous quarter. As you can see on Slide 4, reported NIM increased 12 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.81%. Average interest earning assets were up quarter-over-quarter, driven by growth across our segments. Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 12.4%, which reflects current phase-in. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, we were at a 11.4% in the fourth quarter. We reduced our net share count by 5 million shares in the quarter primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We expect to complete our previously announced $2.5 billion buyback program in the first quarter of 2015. We formerly entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches as of January 1, 2015 and we continue to estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was above our target of 8%. Regarding the LCR, as of year-end, we estimate that we are comfortably above the fully phased-in requirements for our consolidated company. With that, let me turn it over to Rich. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Steve. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business, which delivered another quarter of strong growth in results. Ending loans were up about 6% year-over-year. Growth from the linked-quarter was also about 6%, stronger than typical seasonal growth. Continuing momentum in new account originations and credit line increase programs drove loan growth in the quarter. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private label credit cards that don\u2019t produce interchange revenue grew about 18% year-over-year. Revenue margin for the quarter decreased modestly to about 17.3%, consistent with normal seasonality. Revenue dollars grew 5% year-over-year in line with average loan growth. As expected non-interest expenses increased significantly from the third quarter. Strong growth opportunities drove higher marketing and operating expense increased to support loan and account growth, as well as our continuing investments to be a digital leader and meet rising industry regulatory requirements. Credit trends in the fourth quarter were inline with our expectations. Last quarter, we explained that the third quarter charge-off rate was unusually low. It was the seasonal low point for charge-off rate and also included the temporary benefit from better than expected delinquency rates in early 2014. In the fourth quarter charge-off rate increased 56 basis points to 3.39% about half of the increase resulted from expected seasonality and about half from normalization of the temporary delinquency favorability. The fourth quarter delinquency rate increased inline with normal seasonal pattern. Our expectations for the charge-off rate have not changed. We continue to expect the quarterly domestic card charge-off rate throughout 2015 to be in the mid-to-high 3% range. We expect normal seasonal patterns throughout the year, including an increase in the charge-off rate in the first quarter. In addition to seasonality, we continue to expect that loan growth will impact the charge-off rates. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate will be modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. In addition to rising charge-offs, we expect loan growth to drive allowance additions. For the full year 2014, the biggest story in our domestic card results was the return to growth. Ending loans grew 6% and general purpose credit card purchase volume grew 16%. Revenues declined 5% driven by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio excluding the revenue impact of the portfolio sale full year 2014 revenues reflect inline with average loans. Non-interest expense declined 6% with lower operating expense partially offset by higher marketing. Lower operating expense resulted from tight cost management across the business. Lower acquisition related expenses taking out cost associated with the Best Buy portfolio and the absence of a non-recurring legal reserve that impacted 2013 expenses. Provision for credit losses improved modestly with lower charge-off rate offset by additions to the allowance. The rekindling of growth along with our continuing focus on delivering strong and resilient returns, enabled the domestic card business to post strong net income, while improving the quality of our franchise in 2014. Our card business remains well positioned. Moving to Slide 8. The Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans were up about 1% from both the linked-quarter and the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage run-off. Auto originations increased about 25% year-over-year driven by strong auto sales and deepening relationships with our existing dealers. Ending deposit balances were essentially flat compared to both the linked-quarter and the prior year. We\u2019ve had an abundance of deposits since the ING Direct acquisition, and we\u2019ve been allowing the least attractive deposits from Capital One\u2019s legacy direct bank to run-off. On a linked-quarter basis, Consumer Banking revenue was up 2%. Non-interest expense increased $89 million, or 9%, from the linked-quarter, driven mostly by auto loan growth infrastructure in digital investments and higher marketing. And provision for credit losses increased $24 million from the linked-quarter driven by expected seasonal trends in auto charge-offs. For the full year 2014, revenues were down 3% driven by the impact of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances, and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue impacts. Full year non-interest expense was up 3% driven by auto loan growth and the change in the income statement geography of where we recognized auto repossession expenses. Full year provision for credit losses increased $47 million, or 7%, consistent with the gradual normalization of auto charge-offs and allowance builds for auto loan growth.  Full year 2014 trends show that our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the phase of continuing industry headwinds while our auto business remains well positioned. We remain cautious and continue to closely monitor pricing, underwriting practices, used vehicle prices and other competitor and market factors. Returns on new origination vintages are lower than returns in the overall auto loan portfolio but remain resilient and above hurdle. And in our retail deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment will continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2015. As you can see on Slide 9, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter, although the pace of growth is slowing. Loan balances increased about 2% in the quarter and 13% year-over-year. Most of this growth is in specialized industry verticals in C&I lending and CRE. Loan yield declined six basis points in the quarter and 59 basis points compared to the prior year, driven mostly by increased competition, lower tax equivalent yield and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. The declining trend in loan yield stabilized somewhat in the quarter. Revenues increased 5% from the third quarter and about 2% from the prior year. Year-over-year, higher loan volumes have been largely offset by declining yield. Non-interest expenses were up 4% from the prior year and 9% from the third quarter as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments. Provision for credit losses increased $23 million from the linked quarter to $32 million. Charge-offs, non-performing loans and criticized loans remained strong in the fourth quarter. The current levels of commercial credit results are exceptionally low and we continue to closely manage credit risk. For the full year, ending loans grew 13% and average loans grew 17%. Revenues grew 6% as volume growth was partially offset by declining yield. Non-interest expense grew a 13% moderately lower than the growth in average loans. Provision for credit losses increased $117 million from a negative $24 million to positive $93 million, driven entirely by the swing from allowance releases in 2013 to allowance builds in 2014. Our Commercial Banking business is well positioned to navigate current market conditions. While following oil prices, they are likely a positive for our consumer businesses. We\u2019re closely monitoring and managing the potential impact of low oil prices on our $3.7 billion energy portfolio. And competition remains intense in the Commercial Banking business, pressuring margins and returns. It\u2019s likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will be slower in 2015, but we expect our Commercial Banking business will continue to deliver solid results. Pulling up, Commercial Banking is thriving at Capital One. The business has steadily and profitably grown to over $50 billion. We\u2019ve built deep industry specialties and established great relationships with our commercial customers. I\u2019ll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. 2014 was a strong year for Capital One. As Steve mentioned, we delivered 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10.1 billion. We posted strong earnings. We strengthened our balance sheet. We returned to growth in our card business and continued to prudently grow our auto and commercial business. We improved the quality of our franchise and we returned significant capital to our shareholders. We\u2019re poised to build on the momentum in 2015. Our expectations for 2015 include the impacts of the investments we\u2019ve been discussing for several quarters. In our domestic card business, we see attractive marketing opportunities to drive future growth. Marketing efficiency, cost to acquire new accounts and the net present value of our marketing investments are strong. We\u2019ll continue to invest to drive and support growth in loans, deposits, and account relationships across our businesses. We\u2019re making significant investments in our foundational infrastructure and capabilities to be a digital leader. Banking inherently is a digital product and digital will transform banking over time. Capital One is well positioned to succeed in the digital world with our heritages and innovative information based company. We\u2019re committed to deeply embedding digital in how we work, not merely faulting digital on to the side of our company. We\u2019re also spending to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. We\u2019re enhancing our capabilities, infrastructure, and talent to deliver on the broad set of expanding regulatory requirements and meet increasing expectations for risk management and regulatory reporting. And we\u2019re continuously improving processes for capital and liquidity management, including CCAR and the new LCR. Capital One is delivering attractive risk adjusted returns today and we expect that that will continue. We have the financial strength to invest in our future without compromising current financial results. Pulling all this together, in 2015, we expect growth in full year revenues driven by a growth in average loans. We expected full year marketing and operating expenses will both be higher in 2015 than they were in 2014. Let me turn to our efficiency ratio, specifically our expectations for the full year 2015 efficiency ratio. In July, we are articulating an expected range of 53% to 54% excluding non-recurring items. We\u2019ve reaffirmed that range in October. Since then we\u2019ve experienced a sizable adverse change in interest rates. As a consequence, we now expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53.5% and 54.5% excluding non-recurring items. This change in range has driven entirely by the movement in rates. We don\u2019t take this change in expectations lightly, but we don\u2019t believe we should make long-term business decisions based on spot prices for interest rates. We continue to manage costs, very tightly across our businesses, while make our planned expenditures to drive growth, be a digital leader and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. These expenditures are essential to our ability to deliver strong shareholder returns on a sustainable basis. We also expect that efficiency ratio will vary perhaps significantly from quarter-to-quarter based on factors such as day count, the timing of growth and associated revenues, and the timing of investments throughout the year. Pulling up our strategic priority for 2015 have not changed and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We will continue to pursue growth opportunities in card, auto, retail banking and commercial banking. We will maintain our longstanding discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilient. We will manage cost tightly, while we invest to grow, be a digital leader, and we continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements, and we will actively work to return capital to shareholders as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors. And now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thanks, Rich. We\u2019ll now start our Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts, who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session on the call, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call to answer them. Becky, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Rich, could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment both in the kind of branded business and in the retail card business, maybe - so one of your competitors announced a portfolio acquisition today. Are there any - I mean any things you could kind of discuss in that area? Richard Fairbank : Yes, Moshe, the competitive environment in the card business, I would describe as - intense, but consistent and fairly rationale. Industry balances remain flat - I mean have been flat for quite a while. Now, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of growth. Of course, there have been some increases in marketing levels with respect to direct mail. You can certainly feel in the reward segment in particular, especially in cash back products, a lot of competition and manifest itself in their version of teaser rates, which is early spend bonus offers. Long-term pricing in general has been stable in the segments that we compete in. And overall, well again, I think it is intense. I would describe this industry as pretty rationale and more, more stable than the other markets that we compete in most notably auto and commercial. You know that was a description of the branded card business. The partnership business, which as you know, Moshe, is sort of a deal flow business. The - as one who\u2019s certainly been around the branded card business for more than a couple of decades, the most striking difference between these two businesses is the option nature of the partnerships. And that is the biggest factor that leads this business to have in my opinion on an apples to apple kind of basis, lower inherent returns, and the wildcard of the marketplace and the nature of sort of option prices that that exist in any point in time. That the - there are a number of partnerships that are sort of \u201cup for grabs\u201d in the marketplace. I would stress that one of the characteristics of this business is the significant majority of all partnerships actually sort of stay with the incumbent, but they certainly, go nonetheless most go through the RFP process. So there is fair amount of activity in this base and I'm struck by how competitive that is and certainly we\u2019ve been to some auctions where people are stepping up and paying prices in excess of what we\u2019re comfortable with, but certainly I would describe that as a pretty intensely competitive. And one that we\u2019re going to stay very disciplined. That\u2019s great. Moshe Orenbuch : Just as a quick follow-up of that Costco Canada launched a couple of weeks ago for you guys, anything you can tell us about it? Richard Fairbank : Well, we were very happy to win the Costco partnership in Canada and this of course is as you know a premier retailer with an amazing customer base VAC partnership. I think it\u2019s off to a very good start, but that is very early days and the - but it\u2019s a manifestation of the strategy that we have in the partnership business, which is to try to focus more on the sort of the premier players in the marketplace and that is where of course there is more intense competition to win these partnerships, but one that I think the players are more focused on really using these partnership card relationships as a way to really drive value for customers and that line is up exactly with the value that we think we can add. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : Good afternoon, just I notice there was an absence in PP&R guidance although you did suggest that revenues would be higher in 2015 marketing and operating expenses would be higher in 2015. Would you be able to provide us some PP&R guidance or does it sound that like the revenue increase would offset the increasing expenses and therefore you would end up with about $10 billion again in pre-provision net revenue, but with higher loan loss provisions. Stephen Crawford : Yes, Matt thanks for the question. We didn\u2019t give you PP for specific reason. But what we did do is give you lot of the building blocks. First of all we\u2019ve said that basically revenues are going to be driven by growth in average loans. We\u2019ve obviously provided you an update on the efficiency ratio. And in addition, what we didn\u2019t do last year, but have done this year is give you a sense for where charge-offs are going in our biggest business was in card. So we really are trying to provide kind of the major building blocks. The primary unknown for us is the ultimate growth that we\u2019re going to experience in card, and that really contributes to almost every part of the income statement in an important way and it\u2019s why we\u2019re reticent to be as specific on a particular number as we were in prior years. Matt Burnell : Fair enough. And then in terms of the U.S. bill business, you had - what appears to be stronger purchase volume in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis than many of the other domestic competitors. Although the interchange was a little bit, I guess, below our expectations. Is there some dynamic there that you can provide a little additional color on in terms of the growth in the spending, but somewhat lower growth in the interchange? Stephen Crawford : Yes, Matt. First of all, I wanted to say that the net interchange metric can have quarter-to-quarter variability because it includes partnership contractual payments in international card. And we also periodically adjust our reward liabilities based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that. But even beyond that variability and sort of - if you look past quarterly noise, the phenomenon you\u2019re talking about is real and that net interchange growth has generally lagged general purpose credit card interchange growth for Capital One, and we would expect this trend to continue. Our rewards programs have been and they continue to be very successful with of course flagship products like QuikSilver card, the Venture card, the Spark card for small business. We\u2019re also building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards to customers and in many ways consistent with the industry extending rewards products to some existing customers, who don\u2019t have rewards. And there is some near-term cannibalization when we do this, but it\u2019s all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise. But the net effective all of this including leading with great flagship products, all of this contributes to that delta that we think will continue although to be a lot of volatility in that between purchase volume growth and interchange growth. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Don Fandetti with Citi Group. Don Fandetti : Yes, thanks. Rich, I wanted to follow-up on the comments about the loan growth and the potential variability. It seems like you have sort of a general sense of where things would be headed in terms of the market, you know market share is - is the variability may be private label. Can you just talk a little about where you could go from here you are feeling like the 6% number, you could have upside? Richard Fairbank : I think I learned a quite long ago that that when you have growth opportunities, trying to predict the growth rate at least from capital - the way we do business at Capital One is just something that\u2019s not probably in anyone\u2019s interest because just to reflect on how we make our decisions. As you know we\u2019re a fanatical information based company and across all the segments and sub-segments we\u2019re in. We are reading the data that is coming back and readjusting constantly our choices and so on. What you have seen from our commentary for a number of quarters now and this commentary even actually preceded when you started to see our growth numbers is that we believe we\u2019re well positioned to for - to grow in ways that are right down the power alley of Capital One and the product of having invested for years to have this competitive position and this opportunity. That said I\u2019ve been around the block enough to know that the market can change and most importantly competitive dynamics can change. So, what we do is try to share with you a general sense of and hopefully you can feel that reflected in the comments, the general sense of - about the opportunity. And I say yet again now and it\u2019s been several quarters that I\u2019ve been saying it is, I think we see a nice growth opportunity in front of Capital One. I don\u2019t think we want to quantify this, but what we\u2019re going to do is cease the opportunity as we have it. And then when does have opportunity if they change then we change accordingly, but this is why comments like we\u2019re - marketing will be up and we think there are growth opportunities for next year that would be consistent. And in many ways my message and the feel is pretty similar to the message I\u2019ve been saying for a number of quarters now. Don Fandetti : Thank you Richard Fairbank : Next question please? Operator : We'll go next to Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets. Sameer Gokhale : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I was just curious in terms of the efficiency ratio, guidance. Again, if you could just clarify, have you assumed any sort of interest rate increase in the second half of 2015, I know other banks, some other banks have. So I was just curious about that. And then I had another follow on. Thank you. Stephen Crawford : Yes. So, our interest rate forecast that we use is based on forward, so there are some modest increases in the second half that that we would have. Sameer Gokhale : Okay, thank you. And then I was trying to think of the interplay between, say your consumer - and when I say consumer, I'm just thinking to catch you all in everything ex-commercial loans, but the efficiency ratio dynamics between your commercial lending activities of Commercial Banking versus Consumer Banking. I know many other regional banks have actually had significant pressure in terms of managing their efficiency ratio, primarily because of revenue pressures. And so I was curious from your standpoint, have you implemented any structural changes to try to bring the efficiency ratio down in the commercial bank? And how do you think of the interplay of commercial versus consumer? Are they moving in the right - in the same direction? Or one is offsetting the other? That would be helpful. Thank you. Stephen Crawford : So Rich, I am sure you may want to add to this. I think the biggest thing that the industry has talked about with respect to the efficiency ratio is the rate environment. And how that impacts pretty much all of the businesses and I think you saw a lot of commentaries from a number of players that it would be difficult to improve their efficiency ratio if unless we had more of a normalization in the rate environment. And that plays out in the commercial and the consumer business probably more than it does in the card business. Richard Fairbank : And then the other thing is that that effect efficiency ratio of course is what\u2019s happening on the cost side, the investment side. And if you think about the drivers of our commentary about efficiency ratio and cost at the margin, one is growth opportunities. We have been stepping up increasingly, sort of, in the card business to invest because we see particular opportunities there. On the commercial side if anything our growth opportunity is decelerating because of the choices that we\u2019re making in response to market conditions, but those are factors that we\u2019ll play out over time. The regulatory costs are pretty much all across the enterprise and that\u2019s going in only one direction and I\u2019d be pretty surprised if over the next few years there\u2019s any forces that would move those cost pressures in the opposite direction. And finally, the investments in digital. And while digital is a big opportunity across consumer and commercial, certainly on a relative basis, I think, the revolution is going to be greater on the consumer side and it\u2019s literally going to transform all aspects of how banking is done, it\u2019s going to transform not only if people often think through the lens of the customer experience, but really the whole way - the way retail distribution works, the way operations, marketing, servicing and even something that\u2019s very, very core to how Capital One works, which is information-based strategies itself. So this is a big deal on the commercial side, its pretty much a revolutionary deal on the consumer side. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ken Bruce : Thank you, good evening. I guess I would - trying to maybe reconcile between some of the comments that you\u2019re making around auto and still what is a very strong origination business for Capital One. Can you just give us some understanding as to how you believe you\u2019re navigating what is increasingly a very intensely competitive part of the marketplace? Richard Fairbank : So Ken, our - we\u2019ve been saying the same things for quite a while about the auto business and the sort of started with our comments for some for many of the years right after the great recession started raging, which is, we went into this kind of - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exaggeration to call it sort of once in a lifetime kind of confluence of events that led the auto industry, both from the growth and from a kind of returns and credit point of view to be absolutely exceptional. And most of what we have seen happening since then is sort of a regression more toward normal if you will. And so, what\u2019s happened, I think, for Capital One and certainly for other players is with each passing quarter, the intensity of the commentary that people in the business make is increased. But if we pull way up that we don\u2019t see things that are - would cause us to have great alarm about the business, but what we see is just on the pricing side increased pressure. Although, that stabilized when I look at prime and subprime that stabilized more recently, but frankly in the prime space at a below kind of cycle, little bit below cycle norms, so things are very a tight there. The subprime space it\u2019s been steadily declining a little bit stable of late. On the underwriting side, the most noteworthy place that there has been any risk expansion has been in terms of and there\u2019s been significant growth of the over 72 month loans. But still things likes LTVs, which is probably the single most important variable, have remained certainly on the prime side stable and healthy on the sub-prime side moderately increasing, but well below sort of pre-recession levels. So more the way I would characterize this auto business, is that we just have to stay very, very vigilant and what I find is we - our choice is sort of one dealer and one deal at a time end up with the growth moderating in sub-prime for example sub-prime has been flat at Capital One, I think for in originations for about I\u2019m guessing since 2011, I think it\u2019s been pretty flat, so that essentially all of the growth in origination has been on - near prime and especially the prime side. So I think that\u2019s a manifestation of our reaction to the marketplace and continuing to pursue opportunity where it is prudent and where we can build deeper dealer relationships. But I would say the important thing I want to link with you is while even new originations you can see have pound-for-pound kind of a bit higher credit risks than some of the exceptional stuff of the past. The business that we are originating, we still feel is well above hurdle and we like the opportunity. Ken Bruce : Okay and just a follow-up, in terms of your guidance on credit card charge offs it seems that really what you\u2019re seeing is that just the seasoning of that some of the recent growth is going to have an upward bias on the loss rates that you\u2019re not really witnessing deterioration in terms of the underlying portfolio. Richard Fairbank : Absolutely, absolutely. Well, let me just talk a little about the credit situation in the card business. First of all, it feels to us as pretty much exactly the same as when we talked about this a quarter ago. But just to put this in perspective, card credit has been exceptionally strong over the past few years. And our portfolio has benefited from the improving economy and a generally more disciplined consumer. And our back book which is made up mostly of customers who weathered the great recession. That continues to show exceptionally low risk and is very resilient. We see great opportunities for resilient in new business, but from the starting point of our highly seasoned back book most new business will have higher losses. So the credit performance of our new originations and our credit line increases has been strong and in fact it\u2019s meeting in well - it\u2019s is meeting and some cases even exceeding our expectations in a good way. And since we returned the growth I\u2019ve been emphasizing that these new loan balances season, they will start putting upward pressure on cards overall charge-off rate and this impact is going to be modest at first, but we expect it to grow through 2015 and beyond. And we\u2019ve been growing in the segments, we\u2019ve always been focused on, we continue to avoid the segments that we think lack resilients, even if they have quite nice returns in today\u2019s environment. And that is really the essence of our credit story and we wanted to make sure that people exactly understand what is the dynamic that is leading charge-offs to increase. But back to the original question that you asked, this is not driven by a worsening of credit performance of the existing book or anything like this, it\u2019s really the by-product of our ceasing of growth opportunity and sort of the vintage math of that. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. I guess, the question on the revenue margin assumptions for 2015, I guess implicit in your revenues are going to grow with average loans is flattish revenue margin is that a fair statement? Stephen Crawford : Talking about card? Sanjay Sakhrani : A consolidated. Stephen Crawford : Yes, plus or minus I think that\u2019s right. We\u2019ve got card obviously is a big contributor of the run-off of home loans is a positive on the other side. We\u2019ve talked for a while about compression in auto and commercial and the biggest kind of unknown is what happens for the rate environment overall. So you put those on the mix master our best guess right now is relatively stable. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And then a second question following-up, Rich, you mentioned kind of the impact of lower fuel prices on consumer, I mean how do you factor that into your guidance for next year as charge-up. I mean, does that marginally benefit that ratio? And then just - I\u2019m sorry, one quick data point question, Steve, if you could help out of tax rate for 2015? Thank you. Richard Fairbank : So, let me do this the easier one first, our tax rate will be, if you look at the tax rate for the year, our best guess is, it will be plus or minus to the tax rate that we experienced for the year in 2014. Richard Fairbank : Sanjay, I can only just to speak intuitively about the gasoline price impact obviously as we kind of hard to measure at this point. One reason it\u2019s hard to see is of course the sharpest drops in gas prices have been just over the past three months. And any credit benefit from falling gas prices is going to be really hard to disentangle from other economic effects. But it\u2019s just clear that falling gas prices translates into equivalent of a wage increased from most households. I do want to caution though that the flip side is the same low gas prices may be economic stress and geographics that are heavily depended on the economic, I assume on the energy sectors so we\u2019ll have to keep that in mind. But just intuitively I think you have a pretty good net positive for consumers overall. We are not putting any of that into our own projections but it\u2019s clearly something we are going to start to see if we can measure it. But most likely I think it\u2019s going to be embedded in an overall economic performance. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Rich Shane with JPMorgan. Rich Shane : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is a little bit assertoric, but I\u2019m curious if there was any change in policy related to funds transfer pricing at the consumer bank either in terms of rate that you will apply or balances? Richard Fairbank : Short answer is no. My guess is the reason for the question as you are looking at the other part of our income statement and the change year-over-year and the biggest driver there was treasury, I mean there are other things in there as well, we\u2019ve corporate items that run through that tend to be lumpy but the biggest year-over-year change was treasury. And there were several reasons for the improvement in treasury in 2014 including change in rates, hedging actions we took in 2014 to manage the risk, rate risk in our balance sheet and improved securities yield because of slower run-off. And to our couple of one time items in there too we had roughly $70 million of expenses for redeeming our preferred issuance in 2013 that we didn\u2019t in 2014. The one thing we did do a little bit along the lines of what you\u2019re talking about is with LCR coming on. We continue to refine the way that we charge our businesses for the liquidity that they use. So we were passing out more liquidity cost of the business, really consistent with things like LCR. Rich Shane : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Stephen Crawford : Yes. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Gugenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much and good evening. I\u2019m - Rich in the past, you\u2019ve highlighted some of the areas in which you are also seeking cost savings. I think vendor relationships is one that\u2019s been mentioned and I think there were few others. So I was wondering if you could just update us on the progress on those initiatives and whether all of that benefit gets reinvested or whether some of it gets manifested into earnings? Richard Fairbank : Eric, there are a number of areas that we - well, first of all, across the board we\u2019ve been working incredibly hard on expenses for a long time. And this is of course in the context of headwinds that that are pushing things so hard in the other direction. And you can see over the - starting it well the second half of 2012 and through 2013 and 2014. The trajectory of operating expense and of course some of that comes from deal related expenses that sort of automatically happened. We\u2019ve also worked hard to make sure that we get the synergies we talked about and the deals and drive out the integration costs and things like that. Also though other big areas of focus have been the area of procurement and we always sort of worked hard at that, but by building a big centralized and almost the whole science of that in making it have the feel almost like a line of business has been something that\u2019s even exceeded our own expectations. And we pretty rigorously measure not just, what talking to ourselves about how things are better, but really a before and after of kind of thing. And that that has led to some tangible - I mean, pretty sizable, tangible benefits. Another area that of course should generate increasing benefit is in digitization. So a lot of the impacts of digital are really sort of hard to measure and it really relates to the way we work, but things like going paperless, driving people away from some of the more expensive channels into the digital channels and some of the transformation in terms of marketing to be more online and so on. These have facts that that we measure and they - the numbers are starting to grow. The on digital - just take digital itself that is a net trade that has costs a lot higher than benefits at the moment, in terms of what you can purely measure because we\u2019re investing heavily in digital and all of our in - there is almost nothing that we\u2019re investing in digital where the primary objective is to save money. This digital transformation is such a comprehensive revolution. It really allows for things to be faster and way better for the customer, a better associate experience, much better controlled from a compliance point of view, more scalable and yes, lower cost. So right now, one of the important net negative trades is what's happening on just the pure cost side with respect to digital. By the way, the overall economic benefits of digital, I would argue that an important reason that we\u2019re on the growth trajectory, we\u2019re on in the card business is in fact because of our digital success not only in terms of the customer experience, but really in things like how we do marketing and things like that. So this will - I believe the long-term pay off of the digital investment is going to be very significant. In the near-term from the cost line, this is going to be a negative trade. And, of course, the investment in the regulatory thing is a very substantial and of course we know which direction those things are moving. And the other thing, on the cost side, of course, is the investment in growth itself. And there the biggest number is of course marketing, but there\u2019re also operating cost that that go along with that as well. And as you know Eric that\u2019s our highest priority for our own expenditures, is to make sure that we\u2019re investing in our own growth and those investments will continue. So net-net one minus all of that needs to be just, there\u2019s kind of a fanatical multi-year quest to bring out every single penny that we can and all of that is and that\u2019s out in this number that I am sure some people look at and say well, with all the growth and all the digital somehow shouldn\u2019t that be lower. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hi, good evening, guys. Just first on the card reserve, this is second to your core, I think, provisions did come in a bit higher than some of us were sort of expecting and just given your outlook from mid-to-high three [ph] U.S. card charge-offs, how should we think about the reserve on top of charges? Steve is there a target of 13 months forward how do we think about the right level that you guys manage the reserve to. Stephen Crawford : So I\u2019d go back to what Rich was talking about on credit, because that\u2019s really the driver of our reserve and it\u2019s not as simple, nor would ever be as simple, we take 13 months of anything. It\u2019s actually looking at loss content in our portfolio. And there are two things that are really going on, one is the growth that we\u2019ve talked about and unless you assume growth as zero losses adding growth will drive up need for allowance. The second piece of it is a little bit of the mix movement that Rich talked about from an incredibly low and resilient back book to a very much expected but higher loss front book. And as that becomes more of the equation that is going to drive up the loss content, which ultimately is reflected in allowance. It\u2019s not a matter of not wanting to be helpful to actually give you a sense as to where allowance would end up. We have to accurately forecast 24 moths of losses and 12 months of balances and that\u2019s better than frankly anybody has been able to do and we think we are pretty good at looking how credit evolved. So we\u2019re not trying to do difficult that just out beyond particularly your delinquency low rates. I think it\u2019s very hard to predict credit from a quarter-to-quarter basis. So in general, one can think a little bit about how the balances are growing as being the first factor and a trend rate in losses being a second factor, but even that\u2019s not enough, because our balance growth quarter-to-quarter has a seasonal component, right. So the fourth quarter uptick that you see isn\u2019t necessarily going to last throughout the entire year. So we\u2019re actually trying to figure out, which of those components are going to be more lasting. So there\u2019s a whole bunch of things going in there, but I think you can see since we expect growth going up, since we\u2019ve talked about losses going up, there\u2019s going to be more need for allowance going forward. Ryan Nash : Got it, and Steve, Rich talked a lot about the digitization. Can you size for us, how big these costs are and over what timeframe and we\u2019ve seen a lot of other banks try to self-fund a lot of these investments and to what extent do you think you can self-fund these? And I guess just related to the near-term, can you at least commit to PP&R growth in 2015? Stephen Crawford : Well, look I think we said we expect to grow revenue and we expect our efficiency ratio basically to be flat to a little bit down on a GAAP basis. So I withdraw conclusion from that that we expect PP&R to grow. We\u2019ll leave it more up to you as to buy how much. We\u2019re not going to go through and kind of evaluate how much of the spend is digital. I think we\u2019re trying to do a whole bunch of things here, deliver very good returns in the near-term, but also make sure we can do that for the next 20 years. And as we try and set our priorities, it\u2019s kind of cognizant of both factors. And so far we think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job in managing that and plan on continuing to going forward. Richard Fairbank : Let me just add to that that I want to go back to a comment I made before and some other banks may feel differently about this, but I think it may also manifest what we\u2019re trying to achieve here. I think in the long run, there is going to be very significant cost benefit from all these digital investment. But the biggest benefits and the reason we\u2019re doing it is in almost all cases not for that reason. And what I most excited about is actually the opportunities to generate growth and to generate better real time decision making to make better credit decisions. And in the end build a deeper franchise through very significant improvements in the customer experience and things that really create more loyalty and more stickiness with customers. And so over the years, it will be very, very hard for us to measure that because digital and digital - I mean, digital investments are turning - are more and more turning us into a digital company as opposed to a company that just tries to digitize what they do or the phrase I said earlier to bold digital on the side of a bank. So it\u2019s more and more becoming - over, over a longer period of time, who we are in terms of how we operate and how we make decisions and how information is used in the company. And if you notice my passion about this is because I have not seen and probably this speaks for mankind as well over, over our long history. But certainly, I haven\u2019t seen anything remotely like this in terms of the ability to transform how a business works. The only parallel is the thing that led me to go out and build Capital One in the first place, was looking at how information and technology we\u2019re going to transform starting with the card business and ultimately banking. This is going to be a very, very big change and I think its biggest impacts will not be the impacts that they have on cost. But what is also clear is that for anything as transformational as this, one has to on a sustainable basis invest to build the foundational capabilities upon which the sort of digital innovation that the world can see will occur. And this is going to be a longer journey, but I think it\u2019s ultimately as significant to transformation as what the information based opportunity we saw 27 years ago turned out to be. Ryan Nash : And just one last thing, one another hesitation with separating out these expenses is the overlap between our expenses, so things that one considers to be digital that also have enormous regulatory impact or enormous growth impact is pretty considerable. So the three things we\u2019ve talked about that are growing, causing a growth and an investment kind of overlap in a lot of ways. Richard Fairbank : The pretty much number one way to make sure that that we\u2019re successful with respect to the breadth taking number of compliance requirements is in fact automation. Just trying hard and making sure we\u2019re well organized, just doesn't cut it with the magnitude of what\u2019s going on. So it\u2019s just another aspect of the breadth and depth to which investment in digital can really put a company in a very good position. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Chris Donat : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the issue of the provision as we look forward given that there has been a lot of changes in consumer behavior and timeliness of payment. I\u2019m just wondering if the assumption that that new originations for card loans will have their peak charge-off in say 18 month to 30 month. Is that based on what we\u2019re seeing sort of post crisis, or is that really based on what you have experienced over the history of the credit card business? I\u2019m just wondering if anything is there that might be different this time around. Stephen Crawford : Okay, well. First of all there\u2019s few different phenomena that are going on. When we talk about our charge-off, especially in the second half of next year and into 2016 going up as a result of growth that is the comp positive fact of all the different vintages have actions that are being taken. And I want to separate out a couple of different effects. One is originations and one is credit line increases. These themselves have quite different dynamics, they also have quite different flow in terms of many other metrics including the timing of profitability, and cost in the near term, and so on. But anyway with respect to credit, I would characterize credit line increases tend to write when they happen, they have a benefit with respect to losses and then overtime the charge-offs on a more delayed basis build overtime. Originations tend to, they have a momentary kind of benefit from the speed boat effect that they have, but then they tend to peak earlier and then actually improve over the longer-term. And again our credit guidance is just a sort of comp positive all the different things that are going on. We have sizable credit line increased activity, we have very significant origination activity that\u2019s been going on over the past year and we hope will continue. And the most important thing, we have wanted to do is just make sure that as we started signaling sometime ago, the charge-off math of this very good development for Capital One is pretty predictable and we want to just make sure we got in front of that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Chris Donat : Okay. So no real change in either from the originations or the credit line increases in consumer behavior kind of pre-crisis versus post-crisis, right?. Stephen Crawford : Not, not well, so not in terms of the shapes of these curves. The consumer behavior pre-crisis was tended to lead to what turned out to be higher losses and a lot of things back then that was not nearly as cautious the consumer is now. So just about anything we do these days versus an equivalent action in 2006 or 2007 Certainly we would expect peak in a better place, but this is - and but the main thing as we were also saying is that paradoxically even as we are guiding to higher credit losses and frankly guiding to more growth in credit losses and it appears that our competitors are, this is in the context of a very stable and good credit environment. It\u2019s in the context of originations that are coming in very much as expected and consistent with what we\u2019ve seen recently and one that is really therefore entirely. Just the result of charge-off math associated with the acceleration of growth and then frankly going strikingly from a shrinking situation into one of some pretty good growth. Chris Donat : Got it. Thanks very much. Richard Fairbank : Thanks you. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our final question this evening comes from Brian Foran [Autonomous Research]. Brian Foran : Hi, I guess the only thing I left was on the rep and warranty reserves. I guess any color on the 1.1 billion going to 700 million, was there settlement and should we expect originally reasonably possible losses and that kind of stuff to come down in tandem? Stephen Crawford : Well the reasonable possible losses left away to the 10-K, but yes I mean it was settlement activity that we\u2019re the primary driver of the reduction in the reserve. Brian Foran : Great, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Thanks Brian. Stephen Crawford : Okay, well, with that I\u2019ll just say thanks to everyone for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One and remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a good night. Richard Fairbank : Thank you. Operator : That does conclude our conference. We thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Thanks very much, Jennifer, and welcome, everyone to Capital One's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our first quarter 2015 results. With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Steve will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, and then click on Quarterly Earnings Release. Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. For more information on these factors, please see the section entitled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports which are accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Crawford. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Jeff. For the first quarter Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2 per share and had an average return on tangible common equity of 15%. On a continuing operations basis we earned $1.97 per share. Net income was up $154 million driven by higher pre-provision earnings and lower provision expense versus the prior quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased by $69 million versus the prior quarter as lower revenue was more than offset by lower marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses decreased on a linked quarter basis driven by a smaller allowance billed and lower charge-offs versus the previous quarter. Turning to slide four, I'll briefly touch on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 24 basis points in the first quarter to 6.57%. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by two fewer days to recognize income and temporarily higher cash balances. We don't expect any incremental margin pressure to meet the LCR since we're already above the fully phased in LCR requirements as of March 31, 2015. Turning to slide five, let me cover capital trends. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 12.5% as of March 31. On a fully phased in basis we estimate this ratio would be approximately 12.1%. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5.4 million shares or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions that began last April. Over the past year we have reduced shares outstanding by 24.9 million or 4%. We entered parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1 and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target. We were pleased with our 2015 CCAR results and believe they continue to demonstrate our strong commitment to return capital to shareholders. Our approved submission include a plan to increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.40 per share. In addition, our plan authorizes the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016. Our long-stated preference for the focus of capital return continues to be in the form of share repurchases. And while investors can expect an ongoing ability to generate strong returns and a commitment to return excess capital subject to regulatory approval, investors should not infer a long-term commitment from our recent payout ratios. With that, let me turn it over to Rich. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Steve. And I'll begin on slide seven with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth accelerated in the quarter. Ending loans were up about 9% year-over-year and average loans grew about 7%. We continue to post strong growth and see goods opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 19% year-over-year. This growth was driven by the success of our rewards programs, increased new account originations across our card business, and credit line increases. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, revenues were up 7%, in line with average loan growth as revenue margin was stable. On a linked quarter basis, revenue margin decreased seasonally to 16.9%. Year-over-year non-interest expenses increased 2% driven by higher marketing, consistent with our return to loan growth. As expected, non-interest expenses decreased about 6% from the linked quarter with seasonal declines in marketing. Credit in the first quarter was stronger than expected. We experienced better than forecasted delinquency flow rates. The charge-off rate increased 16 basis points to 3.55%. The delinquency rate improved 35 basis points to 2.92%. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through to charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rates in the lower end of our previously communicated mid-to-high 3% range, perhaps even getting into the low 3% range at the third quarter seasonal low point. The improvement in our outlook for Domestic Card credit drove a modest allowance release in the quarter. We also expect favorable credit to drive lower than expected past due fees, putting modest pressure on revenue. Longer term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth math. As new loan balances season they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate is modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. We still expect growth math to drive quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid-to-high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016. In addition, while this quarter shows that we may not have allowance builds every quarter, we expect growth to drive allowance additions going forward. Our Card business remains well positioned to deliver growth with attractive and resilient returns. Slide eight summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were up about 1% from the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage run-off. Auto originations increased about 10% year-over-year driven by strong auto sales and deepening relationships with our existing dealers. Consumer Banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continues to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances, and margin compression in auto. Provision for credit losses grew $66 million to $207 million, driven by a change in allowance. In the first quarter of last year we had a modest allowance release. In the first quarter of this year, growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit drove an allowance build. Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing industry headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2015. In our auto business, we've been experiencing normalization of both credit and returns from once in a lifetime levels coming out of the great recession. Credit performance is gradually worsening in the industry and we see slightly higher losses on newer originations. We've been cautious on industry underwriting and competitor practices for some time. As a result, our subprime originations have been essentially flat for nearly two years. In the first quarter, we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. And used vehicle values remain at historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results, but we assume lower prices in our underwriting, so we remain comfortable with the resilience of the business. Despite our heightened caution, we will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers. Moving to slide nine, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased about 10% year-over-year with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals, in C&I and CRE. As we've been signaling, our year-over-year growth is slowing compared to prior years in response to market conditions. Loan balances declined modestly from the linked quarter as we've seen some slippage in industry underwriting standards in pockets of the market. Revenues increased 13% from the prior year driven by growth in average loans as well as increased fee income from agency multi-family originations. These factors were partially offset by loan yields which declined 25 basis points compared to the prior year driven by increased competition. Non-interest expenses were up 7% from the prior year as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments. Provision for credit losses increased $28 million in the quarter to $60 million. The provision in the quarter was primarily driven by an allowance billed for our $3.6 billion of loans to the oil and gas industry driven by the impact of lower oil prices. We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. 96% of our loans are secured and 73% are shared national credits. Our largest exposure is in exploration and production in which we benefit from holding loans at the top of the capital structure and is counted in collateral values. Many of our borrowers are least partially hedged against falling oil and gas prices. Our second largest exposure is in oilfield services in which our customers face greater downstream challenges as E&P companies cut back in response to low asset prices. We're working through these issues on a customer-by-customer basis. We are also a lender in the Taxi Medallion Finance industry, with a small portfolio of less than $1 billion in loans. Medallion values have softened because of increased competition from new entrants like Uber. We continue to closely watch this sector. Overall, commercial charge-offs, non-performing loans, and criticized loans remain strong. While we continue to closely manage credit risk, we don't expect these levels to be sustainable through the cycle. Our Commercial Banking business remains well positioned to navigate a challenging environment in which intense competition continues to put pressure on growth, margin and returns. I'll conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. Capital One posted strong results in the first quarter. We're delivering attractive risk adjusted returns today, and we expect that will continue. For the full year of 2015, we expect growth in revenues driven by growth in average loans. As you can see in our Domestic Card business, we are experiencing very strong growth. And in this window, we are likely to increase marketing to take advantage of the opportunities we see to help sustain the current trajectory. While growth opportunities would drive long-term value creation, the higher marketing and the higher operating expense of additional volumes will put pressure on efficiency ratio. As a result, we are likely to be in the higher end or possibly modestly above the 53.5% to 54.5% efficiency ratio range excluding non-recurring items. We're managing costs very tightly across our businesses to stay within the range, but we will also strive to make the right business choices to drive long-term value as growth opportunities unfold through the year. Pulling up, our strategic priorities for 2015 have not changed, and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. We'll manage costs tightly while we invest to grow, be a digital leader, and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. And we'll actively work to return capital to shareholders, as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors. And now, Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Jennifer, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Hi. Just wanted to follow-up on the update to the efficiency. I think you guys came in at roughly in the middle this quarter. And I was just wondering, Rich, can you give us a little bit more clarity on how we should think about the incremental costs that you need to spend on marketing and how it flows through to loan growth? How long of a lag should we see on growth? And then I'll have a follow-up. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ryan, our initial guidance on efficiency ratio, we did I guess three quarters ago. We updated it for the dramatic changes in interest rates. And over this period of time, there have been \u2013 we have constantly responded to the growth opportunities we see in the marketplace. We've continued to invest to capitalize on those opportunities, and we've continued to refine our forecast, if you will, of what are the actual growth numbers that we think will come in the near term. And kind of the byproduct of all those moving pieces has been \u2013 leads to my commentary on the efficiency ratio. I mean, the bottom line is \u2013 to grow we need to spend money. We believe this is a very, very important window of opportunity, and we're taking action to capitalize on that and along the way working very hard to manage sort of one minus, the cost of that, and keeping our investors posted along the way. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then just following up on your outlook on credit. You talked about a mid-3%s charge-off with the exit run rate closer to the mid-to-high 3%s. How should we think about the impact on the provision if loan growth is sustained at these levels? Should we expect the provision to track charge-offs and then build for \u2013 and then have a subsequent build for loan growth? And then just related to that, Rich, you commented that it continues to increase as we move into 2016. At what point do we actually start to see the charge-offs leveling off? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : So let me take the provision. There's obviously two parts of provision. There's a charge-off component and then there's what happens in your allowance. So you have one piece of that already in the charge-off guidance, but that charge-off guidance in and of itself is also a contributor to what's likely to happen to allowances. So let me back up for a second because I know this is a continuing question and just try and give a little bit more help. At the highest level, we build our card allowance, and actually it's not too different anywhere, but let's talk about our card allowance off of three different things : what the loan balance is at the end of the period; what our charge-off forecast would be over the next 12 months; and then there are qualitative factors which really cover the risk that are not captured by models. So if you're really trying to model the allowance in future quarters, you're going to need to make assumptions on all of those, the growth rate and the assumption for loans. And remember if you're not doing a year-over-year growth rate, you've got to think about the seasonality because they can run off in different ways. Next you also would need to however \u2013 whenever you want to forecast that for the balances, look at what charge-offs are over the next four quarters after that. And then with regards to our qualitative factors, they've been about 10% to 15% in benign periods but they can vary pretty significantly if you're entering or exiting a credit cycle. So I'm trying to give you a little bit of a picture of why small movements and assumptions can create swings in a quarter which end up being meaningful. And the most impactful of the three assumptions is really the net charge-off rate and just looking at this on a static basis with our current loan balances of $74 billion, a 15 basis point change in loss rate in a quarter, all other things being equal would drive $100 million change in allowance. As Rich talked about, in the first quarter we experienced better than expected delinquencies and flow rates. So the starting point for our next 12 months loss forecast has shifted down and as a result we had allowance releases. Had that not happened, growth would have actually probably driven allowance builds. So going forward it's a combination of growth and our expectations for loss that suggest that we're going to need allowance builds. But it's really hard to go a lot further than that given all the factors that I've been through. Hopefully that helps Ryan, in the way you think about constructing what could happen to allowance. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ryan, and then in terms of the trajectory of losses, it's interesting, you may remember last year we flagged at this time kind of a similar phenomenon that we saw this year that better than expected flow rates and then just seeing those flow rates kind of mechanically, we put a \u2013 given the six-month window that we have, that we can watch delinquencies flow into charge-offs, you can see that we've adjusted our projections for that six-month window. You may remember last year that this phenomenon that we saw around this time last year in the latter part of the year we said we saw most of it dissipate. So we are not assuming that this changes the outlook for the end of the year or beyond, and if that changes, obviously we would \u2013 if this phenomenon sustains itself, obviously we would adjust that. So we are here today with the same kind of outlook that we had last time we were talking to you and it is just very clear that the growth math and you can see the pretty dramatic growth numbers that we have, the growth math just pretty much has to carry the day. And that's why we're looking to the fourth quarter as still the mid-to-high 3% range, and then we are saying and then 2016 would be up from there. And we're saying up from there just again by the vintage math of growth. And all of this is in the context of a kind of unique time in the industry and for Capital One where most of our customers that we have right now on our book, they weathered the great recession and are very low-risk and I think exceptionally resilient. So it's pretty much anything we book moves the numbers up from here. We feel great about the credit quality of what we're booking but the growth math is just very inexorable in that sense. Now you asked the question : when will this level off? We are reluctant to be predicting something that's going to have a lot of factors driving that when we get there. But I think our point is that 2016 will be a year of rising charge-offs off of the trajectory with which we leave 2015 just because, again, the accumulated math of the vintages of the new business that we're booking. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to Bill Carcache from Nomura. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Rich, I was hoping that you could update us with your current thinking on the strategic importance of the international credit card business and perhaps talk about its growth outlook. And maybe tie in reports this quarter that Capital One was cutting its credit card rewards in the U.K. and how that may influence how you're thinking about it. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Bill, first of all, I want to say that most of you may be aware that in both the UK and in Canada, there have been regulatory-based moves to lower interchange. Neither of our businesses there, particularly our UK business are highly dependent on purchase volume for the economics of the business. So I don't think this will have a big impact on our particular overall economics even though it's an important move in the marketplace. Already a number of issuers have come out in response to the lower interchange rates in the UK and have notified their customers that future rewards will be at a lower rate. I think that's pretty natural in a tight margin business, and the rewards business is a very tight margin business with the interchange and the high payment of reward benefits. That's pretty natural market phenomenon and we already see that going in the UK. Interestingly, there's been some pushback and noise on the consumer side because consumers really do like their rewards and I think we should all take note that even in a country where the rewards rates are lower, there is some pushback there, and I think it's a reminder that in the U.S. consumers who are enjoying higher rates of rewards are pretty vocal for us, for the preservation of these benefits. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. That's very helpful. I appreciate that commentary. If I may ask a bit of a high level question on what we're seeing in the partnership business. The view I believe I've heard you express in the past is that you like the partnership business, but that your optimism is somewhat tempered by the fact that contracts come up for renewal every five years or so and the potential exists for outsized profits to get competed away in that process. I know I'm paraphrasing, but that's the sense I've gotten from your commentary. But there are others in this space who are expressing a bit more of an optimistic view on partnership businesses and kind of taking \u2013 talking about how the thing that they're most focused on is how their merchant partners are looking for them to help them drive incremental sales growth and they talk about how their pipelines are very strong. And so I guess the question then is what do you think is driving these differences in views that some folks in the partnership business are a little bit more optimistic in their outlook and that's it? Thank you very much. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, thank you, Bill. First of all, I think in many ways it's all relative and relative to what. So as one who built this company initially on a direct to consumer model one customer at a time, you have seen the long history and current performance of that business, and it a little bit spoils me relative to pretty much everything else in the banking business. And I kind of start from there for my calibration. And frankly, the big difference between \u2013 as you said, between the regular direct to consumer credit card business and the partnership business is the holding of auctions that happens on average every five years. And that tends to, all other things being equal, be quite a mitigator in terms of some of the upside potential. So many of my comments have been just that calibration. The partnership business is a very interesting and intriguing one to me and for a lot of the reasons that you cited, others are talking about. As you know, the retailing business, for example, is in massive strategic turmoil. And the impact of digital and the need for retailers to reinvent themselves is an extraordinary in many ways kind of existential kind of imperative. And I think that companies like Capital One that are doing very significant investments in digital and in mobile and in not just the customer experience associated with that, but all the underlying infrastructure that is behind what it takes to actually innovate in digital, companies like ours I think are in a very good position to partner with retailers and help them strategically and actually in terms of real product innovation and execution in that transformation. So we are also investing in that opportunity and we have partners with whom we're working right now on some pretty cool digital innovations. And so look, that's one reason I like the space a lot. It's also such a natural sibling to our regular branded business. But what we're doing is we're \u2013 how do we deal with sort of this overhang of the auctions? We just make sure that we never say we have to win no matter what. We go out there. We're selective relative to making sure these are great companies we're working with, companies that are in the partnership business with us for the right reason, where it's really motivated to build a franchise and not just for the making of near-term money that sometimes comes at the sacrifice of customer practices. And finally selectively where the ultimately the price of the deal is something where both parties can win. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. I guess I got a question on credit quality again. So the seasoning math was supposed to impact 2015 and I guess now it's not. So what's really driving that better performance? Is it fuel prices or something else? And I have one follow-up after that. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sanjay, I think in the very near term there is \u2013 as we grow, there is some what we call a speedboat effect that growth in the near term sort of has a depressive effect a little bit before it inexorably raises the charge-offs some months down the road, but that's really a small effect. I mean mostly what \u2013 essentially what we're talking about here is something that we've seen on not infrequently over, for me, the 20-year history of being in this business, is that from time to time we notice that all our flow rates, our delinquency flow rates move in a similar direction all at one time. And usually when this happens, there's not necessarily an explanation for it. Often we're able to go back later and tie it back to economic data that comes out later and so on. Now this is not a huge effect. I don't want to get carried away. I've seen much bigger effects in other times. But because we have actually gone out to give sort of quarterly guidance, all we're saying is coming in better than the quarterly guidance in the relatively near term relative to when we did it just relates to better than expected flow rates without having a perfect explanation there's probably some general economic effect that is going on. But then our most important point is that we don't necessarily see any evidence that this should change our longer term view about the trajectory and magnitude of the charge-off we're talking about. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Understood. And then the follow-up question is just I want to make sure the expense take-up on the guidance, that's just more opportunistic spending, right? And to the extent that you're being opportunistic, can you just about where those opportunities are? Thanks. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The opportunities, we are \u2013 gosh, the more things change, the more they stay the same. For a long period of time, Capital One, well, pretty much always in our history, we have always been one to invest in growth opportunities. The investments begins by investing in innovation, in testing, in brand building, and in creating and looking for opportunities. We're real students of the windows of opportunity. And then when we see them, we tend to seize them because we've also learned markets continue to move. So that's the phenomenon that's going on here. Where we are seeing the growth opportunity is pretty much in our branded book across the board where we are investing. And we are pretty much investing in all places other \u2013 as we've talked about \u2013 other than high balance revolver. So pretty much one minus that is where the opportunities are happening there. And they're a byproduct, again, of a lot of work over the years, behind the scenes and investing in things to be in this position. But there's something that still requires us to invest quite a bit in marketing and the associated cost of growth as the opportunities continue. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Rick Shane from JPMorgan. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks guys. You talked a fair amount about the provision on the credit card side. I'd like to talk a little bit more about the provision on the commercial side, which you'd sort of talked about some of the qualitative factors that drove the increase in provision, but I'd like to relate it back to Steve's comment about how you think about reserve levels. Obviously, this quarter we saw a pickup in provision, pretty substantial without any deterioration in credit. Obviously, that's forward-looking related to what you see going on in the oil patch. I'm curious if there're specific credits within the portfolio that you've already identified as particularly at risk, or is this just a generic reserve related to the qualitative factors Steve talked about? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Well, the comments that I was making were really directly off of card. But let me address commercial. As Rich said, that was really driven principally by energy. And if you think about that, it's a little bit of both. It's a little bit of specific credit observations. It's a little bit of trying to get ahead of what we see in the marketplace using our historical experience, developing a scenario and making sure that that's reflected in our provision and allowance as well. Those are the things that are really driving the number in the quarter. One of the things I would say is we're early in the cycle, but we're obviously trying to use the experience we have in energy to forecast what could happen. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And I'll bootstrap a follow-up question a little bit. Are you seeing anything on the consumer side in the oil patch that has you concerned at this point as well? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. When we look at geographical segmentations of where there is the greatest oil-related activity in those more local markets, we do see a tick-up in some of the consumer credit metrics that you would expect. Nothing dramatic at this point, but it is visible in the markets that are most highly concentrated with respect to oilfield activity. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to Don Fandetti with Citi. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Rich, you've been pretty cautious on subprime auto for a while now. It seems like your comments today are perhaps a little more cautious. And what do you think is driving the more aggressive lending, let's say, this quarter? Because it's interesting. Credit looks like it's actually gotten a little better in subprime. And is it the smaller players? Can you talk a bit about that? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Don, there are a lot of different practices people use in the industry and underwriting practices and we all use them on a sloped basis. So it's not like, well, there's a practice; we don't use that one or when do we require this kind of collateral or this kind of information for a particular loan? It is the intersection of the particular practices as it relates to a particular customer and the credit risk of that customer that has moved for some players. And it is not a universal thing. Some players have been more aggressive than others. And we just been around long enough to know the key thing is we very much have a culture around here : people don't live with growth targets at Capital One. We forecast growth when we think it's going to come, but people all know that job one is to raise your hand and flag when you see opportunities, and the most important thing is that we go after resilient business. We are flagging some of \u2013 yes, we've ticked up a little bit our commentary on this, although we have been talking for quite a while about it. We talked -- in many ways taken two different perspectives. Partly what we've said over time is just understand coming off a once in a lifetime, unique situation of incredibly tight credit and incredibly a conservative borrowers, some of the kind of loosening that's going out there would be in the category of normal reversion to the mean. Some of the stuff that we're flagging here would, I think, be on the other side of that. But on the other hand, this a not something where we're saying, oh my gosh, this is \u2013 you're going to see us just pull out of this thing. We still believe there is selectively very good opportunity for Capital One to go get the assets that we want and continue to build and even expand the number of dealer relationships that we have. But we wanted to just put the Street on increasingly on notice in the sense for this \u2013 that we're very carefully watching the practices, and we're going to make the choices that we make for resilience, and we hope that there're really in many ways two offsetting forces with respect to growth. We're clearly losing deals one customer at a time sometimes that we might have won in the past because others have moved farther in their underwriting. On the other hand, some of the innovations we have and the really sustained success in building deeper dealer relationships, moving up through their prime relationships and expanding dealer relationships is a force in the opposite direction that still generates growth. So the net effect of those two things will drive our results. You can see that, in general, subprime is where we have \u2013 you don't see that much growth going on anymore and most of it really has been in prime lately. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. And then what is the percentage mix over your recent card loan growth between existing and new accounts? And do you \u2013 in terms of the seasoning, I guess you see more of the seasoning impact on new accounts. Is that a fair assumption? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, the only seasoning that one would have on existing accounts \u2013 well, first of all, existing accounts always, the outstandings ebb and flow with people's spending and borrowing and just general kind of ambient activity. The only big mover on the existing file would be line increases and having been in sort of a brownout period for a couple of years with respect to line increases, as we said, getting back into line increases led to, if you will, sort of a surge of catching up for a second. We're on the slightly higher side of equilibrium probably at the moment, I would say, there. The seasoning of those is a different seasoning dynamic with respect to new business. The line increases tend to \u2013 all the economics of line increases have upfront \u2013 it's sort of upfront very good things, doesn't cost much to get them. There's no kind of spike of diabolical behaviors or anything. So what you tend to have is \u2013 and for a while people use their line to pay any obligations and so on. So what you have there is more of a steady, delayed sort of rise in charge-offs over time with that vintage. That is an important but minority part of the overall growth right now. It's an important minority, shall we say. The majority of the growth is coming from the origination side of the business or from recent originations and the very immediate credit line moves we might make relative to those. But I put that all in the category of originations. The vintage dynamics for that are very different. First of all, all the economics are upfront. You take all your pain. You've got your high cost to originate, the big allowance builds. There's even sort of a \u2013 the peak of charge-offs comes pretty early and then moderates over time so that sort of all the good news aspect of that thing happens over time. The majority of our growth is coming on the origination side, but there's a sizeable minority that is on the line increase side. And that's approaching an equilibrium now. It's on the high side of equilibrium. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thanks. Rich, you talked a little bit about the rewards in the UK coming down a little bit on tight interchange in the market. Could you talk a little bit about your outlook for the U.S. where rewards have generally gotten more aggressive and the like in the prospect of perhaps at some point seeing a higher interest rate environment and whether that will have any impact on the industry? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sorry, Moshe. Repeat your question... Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Basically, you've had aggressive rewards competition. It's been increasing both on a co-branded and also just even on cash back and mileage type programs. The question is, does that turn around? Does it turn around if interest rates start to move up when profitability on a customer who's basically using the card like a charge card would go down? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, Moshe, you're talking about a sector that, as long as I've been around it, has been pretty intensely competitive. Now it tends to be lopsided relative to a lot of competition from a small number of players and sort of modest involvement from everybody in the business. This rewards space is \u2013 certainly is still very competitive. And the recent manifestation of extra competition there has been, early spend bonuses have continued to rise. That's probably the most noteworthy thing. I think others in general have come out with products that are a little better than what they have for the existing books. So there's a little movement on product value and continued competition on early spend bonuses. So we have our eye on that. And of course the other place for the competition of course is just in the amount of marketing. And people are stepping up the amount of marketing as well. So overall, I would say there has been modest, pretty, pretty modest, now in the overall scheme of things, sort of increase in the intensity of competition there. Now you talk about \u2013 so in the context of all of that, as rates go up at some point, I think a sizeable increase in interest rates will probably have a fair amount of impact on that. I wouldn't expect modest interest rate changes to impact that too much. But I know, Steve, you've spent a lot of time thinking about this. What were you going to say...? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, just with respect to interest rates, three observations. First, when we book new accounts, we fund the balance, what we assume the balance is going to be, going forward. So there's not rate risk as you would say on the existing book. The rewards that we have are obviously that we're accumulating are expensed. And as Rich said, the underwriting that we do on the accounts does assume some stress level in the rate environment, so it's not booked based on current spot rates. So there's a lot of thought into the interest rate risk associated with the business. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And just as a follow-up, any update on what you're seeing in your relationship with Costco in Canada? And if not now, when do you think we'd hear about that? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. We're excited about our new agreement with Costco. This was launched in September of last year. And of course we're the exclusive credit card issuer for the retail brand in Canada. This didn't, by the way, just didn't come with a portfolio acquisition. So this is really one that we're sort of, from scratch, working to build the customers. And as the first \u2013 in the first six months since the partnership launched, we're seeing pretty strong demand as Canadian consumers appear to be certainly very willing to take up what is a quite attractive MasterCard product. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Steve, if you wouldn't mind, can you just clarify what you meant in your comment about the payout ratio going forward just so I understand it in the context of what Rich concluded with in terms of the payout outlook? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Look, we'd ask you to look more at our actions and our commitment to return capital over the last two years. I don't think you'll ever see us, certainly not in the near term, but my guess is probably ever committing to a payout ratio. The business is just \u2013 we'd like to retain the flexibility. And obviously, if opportunities arise or the economy changes, there can be a whole bunch of things that change. In the near term, you saw that this year our test improved a fair amount in terms of how the Fed looked at us, which was good news. And we hope things continue to move in that direction. But we can't be assured that that's the case. The other big uncertainty we've talked about and continue to have going forward is how CCAR and advanced approaches will come together. So there's just a whole bunch of reasons why we don't want people to lock into what we have done over the last two years and just assume that's the minimum going forward. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. So you're really just underscoring the need to maintain capital flexibility in light of competitive conditions and a continuously evolving regulatory environment. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Absolutely. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. All right. Thanks very much. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Bob Napoli from William Blair. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just a question on growth and a follow-up on regulation. Just the \u2013 Richard, what do you expect, what are your thoughts on the growth rate of your credit card business? You've had very strong growth, accelerating growth, as you said, helped by credit line increases as well as your branded product. Are we done with the credit line increases? Are we going to continue to see an acceleration in that business? And \u2013 I mean your spend growth in the U.S. is pretty amazing compared to the industry. And I guess that's credit line-driven as well. So outlook for growth. And are we \u2013 which products, and are you near the end of the credit line increases? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, Bob, let me talk about the outstanding growth, to start with. That is being driven somewhat by line increases and also by the success of origination programs on, sort of across the various parts of \u2013 across all the parts of the business that we're investing in. So, on the line increases, I guess, my description was, we're on the higher side of equilibrium, but they're sort of approaching an equilibrium level. But we're probably on the bit \u2013 on the higher side of equilibrium there. On the spend side, that is \u2013 that's driven by \u2013 I mean you were kind of right where you're going in a sense. The spend is, yes, partly the success we have in the rewards programs we have, it's also people filling up their lines in a sense, either coming from line increases or a lot of new originations where people are starting to ramp up their spending there. So there's a number of things that have come together to make really quite extraordinary spend growth. And all of that I think is reflective of \u2013 if I kind of pull way up and just talk about our growth here for a second, the growth that you see here \u2013 and Bob, you've known Capital One for a long, long time. Our strong growth is really driven by the investments we've made in the last few years and the current market dynamics that represent a window of opportunity. And we're continuing to invest to try to sustain this trajectory. And I've just been around long enough to know that life's about windows of opportunity. And the way Capital One works is, when we see windows, we really do kind of go for it. We also, interestingly, if there's a reverse window, if you will, when we think market dynamics get in a kind of negative sense, we, a lot of times, exceed the market in the other direction, sometimes in pulling back. But this is one of those things where a number of things have come together and the byproduct of a lot of investment and opportunities, some digital innovation that's going on, and we'll capitalize on it as long as it lasts. We're reluctant to give a growth outlook because almost by definition, when you're growing at some of the kind of rates you've seen here, it's just hard to predict where things go from here. But we certainly are continuing to invest. And that's reflective in some of our comments about on the cost side. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. And just on regulation, are you seeing \u2013 are we getting near the end of the increase in regulatory costs? Do you have any sense that things are settling down? I mean you hired 5,000 people over the last year and there's a lot of investment, I don't know what \u2013 I mean how much has regulation pressured your business from an operating expense and operating perspective? And do you feel like maybe you could see the light at the end of the tunnel or not? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I don't think you could probably find a bank executive in the entire United States that would predict that the increase in regulatory costs has come to an end. So, Bob, I think there are some companies who have gotten themselves in a very complicated situation and are trying to rectify some sort of big, very public problems and things like that. I think for us, the philosophy that we take and look, the regulatory bar dramatically increases every year. And I mean every year including even the \u2013 the other day, I was giving a presentation to our associates and just listing within the last 12 years, a big, long kind of list of things that have sort of raised the bar in the past year. The approach that we're taking is to say let's try to seize this opportunity, seize the regulatory moment, not just to fill out a checklist and get our \u2013 all of our to-do requirements done, but to work backwards from what it takes to build a really dynamic, well-controlled company in the modern kind of era, if you will, and work backwards from that and make sure that what we're putting in is consistent with a dynamic company that can innovate and do a lot of things and also embrace the spirit behind so many of the regulatory requirements that the world is really expecting and demanding a very high level of execution. And we're going to try to step up to that bar. Along the way, the costs frankly keep going up, Bob. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi. Good evening. Just had a question on some of the new partnerships that you've been announcing. I think you've done some work with innovative companies, like some of the firms out there on the West Coast and wanted to get a sense of how much your technology investment spend has helped you to be a leader and helped you to announce these kind of partnerships early on? I'm talking about what you recently announced with Uber. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So well, Betsy, first of all, with respect to external digital parties, there's a lot of manifestations of Capital One's commitment to digital. We've done a number of partnerships. We've done a number of acquisitions like Adaptive Path, Level Money, and things like that. We've done a number, a very large number of recruiting successes, including some pretty high-profile folks that we've brought in. One thing is absolutely clear and it's \u2013 and we believed this from the beginning, that every bank is going to need to transform itself. The digital revolution is changing banking on just about every dimension that you can imagine basically. It's changing what it takes to win in payments, in distribution, in marketing, in brand, foundational infrastructure, experience design, if you will, the way information is used. And in the end, that really means the role of talent is central to that kind of transformation. And so in the talent marketplace, in the partnership marketplace, I think these folks, you can't just go out there with a checkbook and say here we are. We're here to bring you into the fold. I think these folks look to see and they come in and kick the tires to say, is this a company that's bolting digital onto the side of a traditional bank? Or is this a company that is really, like in our case, trying to build a really leading information-based technology company, in a sense? And the key manifestations of that are inside the company. Are the leaders committed? Are they digitally fluent? Have they digitally reimagined their business? Are they bringing technology talent not just into some like place in IT in a sense, but is it really being brought right into the heart of the business and become sort of who you are? So when you heard me talk a lot about digital, it's just that this reminds me a lot of 20 years ago sort of building an information-based company. I'm incredibly excited and sobered by what it takes to actually really build an information-based technology company, and I really like our chances. And along the way, as we go on that journey, the more success we have there will correlate also with a lot of people from the outside saying, you know what? That is the kind of company that I think speaks our language and is one of us. And you'll see more of the kind of partnerships and successes that you alluded to. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : That's great. And just a follow-up on that is on \u2013 the impact on real-time payments. I know there's obviously a lot of work streams going on at the Fed regarding trying to move the payment system to be real-time settlement. I'm sure you've thought a lot about that and are working on that as well. I'm just wondering what kind of opportunities does that potentially give to you as real-time payments come to fruition. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, gosh, there's a lot of dimensions to that particular thing. It is ironic that the banking system is from stem to stern built on a batch basis. So you pretty much look at anything, and from the old direct mail stuff that Capital One and so many of us have done over the years, the whole way clearing works. And so \u2013 and really, while there are many, many aspects to the batch nature of this thing, right at the center is this irony that in a world that increasingly is going toward pure electronic payments, there's a massive kind of, oh yeah, lag in the end to make those things fully happen. Most banks \u2013 pretty much all of us banks have built middleware layered to, in a sense, simulate real-time, even in the context of a reality that's very much batch-based. I'm not sure that real-time payments will actually transform banking as much as a lot of people think it will. But the reality of when the world moves, if we pull up from real-time payments and clearing technically to the larger point of the world moving to such immediate interactivity and such a mobile world, the really dramatic transformation that's going to happen to banking is it's going to become real-time, far beyond kind of real-time payments. And I think that \u2013 I think banks are so, in a way, ill-suited to drive to that destination, yet the world will drive us banks there. I think that you kind of put your finger on something from a broader point of view that I think is at the heart of the whole reinvention of banking that is coming. It's just that for banks to get there, the banking system and for banks individually, there's a lot that that entails. And we're going to need to think more like technology companies and maybe a little less like banks. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today will come from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks. Just following up on that, what do you think it would cost in time and money to transform the company into a real-time entity? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Capital One? David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yes. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean in some ways, I mean it's a lifelong, forever journey. This is not like we're going to say by next year, we're going to be real-time. I'm just saying, so from a journey for me that started 20 years ago and looking at the banking industry and saying in many ways this is really the information business, not necessarily just the traditional banking business. I'm saying the world has \u2013 it's very clear at the accelerating rate that the world is moving, the ability to \u2013 the dimensions of how information is leveraged, the real-time nature of information and the software revolution that has changed everything, the connected revolution here. Working backwards from that will be a lifelong journey, but I think that the companies that, for all of us, it will be gradual. But as we continue to leverage those opportunities, I think the difference between companies that are really taking advantage of that versus companies that are following the more traditional model, there will \u2013 in the end, this is going to translate, I think, into growth opportunities and economic differences and a number of things that are pretty significant. But this is something in a sense that is going to be a lifelong effort for banks like ours. David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: But you think it will take a long time. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : In some sense, it'll probably take forever because the world's going to keep moving that fast. The main thing is that we already see the benefits of some of the things we've been investing in and some, one of the important drivers of some of the growth opportunities we have right now is coming from the digital innovation that we have spent a number of years doing. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance : Well, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us on the conference call this evening and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great evening. Operator : That does conclude today's conference.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Thanks very much, Nancy, and welcome, everybody to Capital One's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. If you'd like to access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2015 results. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Steve will walk you through the presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release. Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and for more information on these factors, please see the section titled forward-looking information in the earnings release presentation and the risk factor section in our annual and quarterly reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC. With that I'll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Jeff. For the second quarter Capital One earned $830 million, or $1.50 per share, and had a return on average tangible common equity of 11%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.48 per share. Net income was down $285 million driven by lower linked quarter pre-provision earnings and higher provision expense. Pre-provision earnings decreased by $233 million versus the prior quarter as higher revenue was more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis as lower charge-offs were offset by a larger allowance build. We had non-recurring costs of $225 million in the quarter. We have included an appendix slide in our earnings presentation available on our website illustrating the impacts from these items to key line items and ratios in the quarter. Non-recurring charges include : restructuring expense of $147 million related to the realignment of our workforce that we recently announced internally. We expect a modest amount of incremental non-recurring charges later this year from site closures related to this activity. We also added $78 million to our U.K. PPI reserve of which $37 million was captured as a contra revenue item and $41 million was captured in non-interest expense. The increase in our U.K. PPI reserve is driven by complaint volumes declining more slowly than we had previously estimated. The refund of PPI fees and interest is an industry-wide issue and there continues to be uncertainty as to how these exposures will play out. Estimating future complaint levels is difficult and there is the potential that more complaints will be filed in the future than we are currently estimating. As always, our 10-Q will provide further details on the factors we consider in estimating our reserve. Excluding the impact from the restructuring charges and the build in U.K. PPI reserve, earnings per share in the quarter were $1.78 and our efficiency ratio was 54.6%. Turning to another legal matter. In the quarter we recorded a $36 million benefit from reducing our reserve for representation and warranty claims. This reduction was driven by a recent High Court ruling in New York regarding the application of statute of limitations. We also expect that the ruling will result in a decrease to our reasonably profitable rep and warranty exposure by approximately $500 million from the level reported in March of 2015, but that calculation will not be finalized until the 10-Q is filed next month. As outlined on slide four, reported NIM decreased 1 basis point in the second quarter to 6.56% as lower investment securities and loan yields were partially offset by lower cash balances and additional day to recognize revenue in the second quarter. We continue to be above the fully phased in LCR requirements as of June 30, 2015. On slide five you can see our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 12.1%. On a fully phased in basis we estimate this ratio would be approximately 11.8%. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5.5 million shares, or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We entered parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1 and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target. Let me now turn the call over to Rich. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on slide seven with our Domestic Card business. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter. Ending loans were up 11% year-over-year and average loans grew 9%. We continue to see attractive opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew 20% year-over-year. The success of our rewards programs increased new account originations, and credit line increases continued to drive purchase volume growth. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis revenue margin decreased 12 basis points driven by the change in our finance charge and fee reserve, which swung from a modest credit-driven release in the first quarter to a modest growth related build in the second quarter. The Domestic Card revenue margin remains healthy at 16.8%. As you know, we stopped selling payment protection to new customers in the U.S. in 2012, but we allowed existing customers to keep the product. Since then, our revenue margin has absorbed a small drag as the back book of payment protection has been gradually running off as a result of account attrition, charge-offs and cancellations. Payment protection is expected to contribute about 25 basis points to the full-year 2015 revenue margin and has been declining by an average of about 10 basis points a year. As we continue to simplify our operations to focus on our core offerings, we believe it is the right time to fully exit the back book, which we expect to largely complete in the first quarter of 2016. We expect the contribution to revenue margin to essentially go to zero by the second quarter of 2016. Year-over-year non-interest expense increased 7% driven by higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. Credit in the second quarter was driven by expected seasonal improvements. The charge-off rate improved 13 basis points to 3.42%. The delinquency rate improved eight basis points to 2.84%. Recall that last quarter we experienced better than forecasted delinquency flow rates. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through to charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rate to be around 3% at the third quarter seasonal low point. Longer-term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth math. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. We still expect growth math to drive quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid-to-high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward. Slide eight summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 1% year-over-year and 5% from the linked quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was up 2% year-over-year driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continued to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. Non-interest expense increased 6% year-over-year driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans. Provision for credit losses grew $42 million year-over-year to $185 million. Growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit resulted in higher year-over-year charge-off expense. In our auto business used vehicle values have softened, although they remain near historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results. We've discussed increased competition in pricing and underwriting for some time. In the second quarter we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some of our competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. As a result, subprime originations declined modestly compared to the prior year. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our longstanding focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers. Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will pressure returns in our deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2015. Planned home loans runoff continues and auto loan growth is slowing and margins are compressing from once-in-a-lifetime levels. We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio in the second half of 2015 and 2016. Moving to slide nine, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 6% year-over-year and 1% from the linked quarter with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I. Average loan balances were up 8% year-over-year. As we've been signaling, our growth is slowing compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition, pressuring loan terms and pricing in CRE and plain vanilla C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty verticals in C&I. Revenues increased 8% from the prior year driven by growth in average loans as well as increased fee income from agency multi-family originations. These factors were partially offset by loan yields, which declined 24 basis points compared to the prior year driven by increased competition. Loan yields increased modestly from the linked quarter. Provision for credit losses increased $37 million from the prior year to $49 million driven by allowance build. We built allowance over the last three quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans. In the second quarter criticized non-performing loans were up $282 million from the prior year to $463 million and the NPL rate increased about 50 basis points to 0.90%. These trends were driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans and to a lesser extent downgrades of taxi medallion loans. Second quarter credit results include the final results of the Shared National Credit's exam. We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. Of our approximately $3.4 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, our largest exposure is in exploration and production and our second largest exposure is in oil field services. Our taxi medallion loan portfolio is less than $1 billion in loans. In the face of growing competition from Uber and other entrants, taxi medallion values continue to decline and we're closely watching this sector. I'll conclude tonight on slide 10. Capital One posted solid results in the second quarter, highlighted by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. We're delivering attractive, risk-adjusted returns today and investing to sustain growth and returns over the long term. We remain compelled by the opportunity, need and urgency of digital transformation. We are entering a mobile, on-demand, real-time world. Digital has already disrupted many businesses and has created entirely new industries. The pace of disruption is sweeping, breathtaking and accelerating. Banking is inherently a digital business and is ripe for transformation. To win in the digital world, we can't simply bolt digital onto the side of our existing business or port analog banking services to digital channels. Technology and information will fundamentally change how banking works and unlock new capabilities and the ability to deliver entirely new experiences. To fully capture these benefits, we're deeply embedding digital into our businesses. We're becoming a destination for great digital talent; product managers, designers, engineers and data scientists. We're simplifying and modernizing our infrastructure to drive agility across the company. We're building foundational capabilities around software development, design and information and we're transforming the way we work to unleash the power of modern technology and great talent to drive innovation. We are making significant investments in our digital future. We don't build technology for technologies sake. We are working backwards from a future where the vast majority of interactions with our customers will be digital. We are already seeing the payoff. Our digital investments are creating a compelling customer experience, delivering data-driven insights and are a key enabler of the strong growth we are delivering. We continue to see strong growth opportunities across our Domestic Card business. We believe that the right choice to drive long-term value is to spend marketing and operating expense to capitalize on this window of opportunity. Taken together, digital transformation, Domestic Card growth opportunities, and rising industry regulatory requirements drive our investment levels, and we believe all three are strategic imperatives that are critical to long-term value creation. Last quarter we indicated that full-year 2015 efficiency ratio could be modestly above 54.5%, driven by incremental marketing and growth-related operating expenses. With strong Domestic Card growth opportunities continuing, we now expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be around 55%, excluding non-recurring items. While it's difficult to predict next year's efficiency ratio 18 months in advance, we can see a number of factors which will affect it. We expect the 2016 efficiency ratio will benefit from recent Card growth and recent cost moves, but the continuing investments in growth, digital and regulatory as well as the revenue pressures in auto and retail banking are expected to put upward pressure on efficiency ratio. Net-net and excluding non-recurring items, we don't expect much improvement in 2016 efficiency ratio relative to full year 2015. We're managing expenses tightly with the goal of offsetting digital investment, growth and regulatory expenditures as best we can with savings in other areas. One example in the second quarter is the choice we made to restructure our workforce as we become a more digital company. Pulling up, Capital One is well positioned to sustain attractive shareholder returns. Over the near term we've positioned Capital One to deliver financial performance with the following characteristics : strong revenue growth driven by growth in loans, pre-provision earnings growth more or less in line with revenue growth, higher provision for credit losses creating headwinds for net income, and significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval with share repurchases reducing share count and aiding earnings per share. Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up question. And if you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Nancy, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good evening, guys. Can you maybe just help us better understand the growth math? It seemed like the provision build was significantly higher than any of us had expected coming into the quarter. So, Steve, maybe you could just walk us through the outlook for charge-offs, expectations for growth and maybe help us just understand the qualitative component. Should we be thinking about a ramp in provisions from here given the growth that you've generated? Or do you think we're finally getting to the point that provisions could be commensurate with the loan growth profile? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, Ryan, hopefully this will be a repeat to what we've been talking about for a while, but I think as you say, it continues to be a source of difference. So let me talk in particular because most of this is driven by Card and focus there. As we've mentioned, our allowance is built off of three components : the loan balances at the end of the period, our 12-month forecast going forward, and qualitative factors for risks that aren't covered in the models. As mentioned, and we've talked about this for a while, we're in a growth period for Card. So that growth, all else equal, is going to be pushing up the allowance. And even more precisely we've given you a sense for what's going to happen to charge-offs. Our current allowance right now includes the \u2013 if you think about it, there's a rotation that happens every quarter. Our current allowance includes expectations for low NACO losses in the third quarter of 2015. We talked in our guidance of around 3%. And if you think about it, at the end of next quarter we will replace the third quarter of 2015 with the third quarter of 2016. Remember we have guided now consistently \u2013 there's not been a change in outlook for our loss content in Card. We've guided consistently over the last couple of quarters that we're going to be in the mid-to-high 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and higher from there. So all else equal, even before loan growth, just a quarter swap would mean an allowance build next quarter. And the same thing happened you can talk about this quarter. Now I always have to put in that qualifier of all else equal. Changes to our underlying loss expectations can have a real impact on allowance build because it happens over the next kind of four quarters. So it's really the combination of growth and our outlook for charge-offs that's going to ultimately work its way into changes in allowance. Operator : And we'll go to the next question that comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. I guess you guys have been seeing some good growth in Card. Could you just maybe talk about the types of growth you're seeing, what kind of competition you're seeing, what the loss content of that growth is because that kind of ties into the allowance question? And I'll ask my second question upfront. I guess there's some changes to the CCAR approach as far as the Advanced Approach is concerned. Maybe, Steve, you could just talk about how that might impact you. Thanks. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Do you want me to go first on the capital? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : (23:56) sure, okay. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Yes, look, I think the two things that kind of apply to us are they're going to move away from the old Tier 1 common ratio. That's not a big impact for us on CCAR. The other thing is at least for now it feels like CCAR and Advanced Approaches have been delayed indefinitely and that added more uncertainty, which we've talked about. So those are the two things that will impact us. Obviously it's not a model that we can control and we can't predict entirely what the changes are going be year-over-year, but on balance the biggest change was probably knowing for some period of time there will not be a combination of CCAR and Advanced Approaches. Rich? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Sanjay, the growth in the Card business is a very similar story to what we've been saying for some time now. We're seeing good opportunities and growth across the segments that we are growing and that we are investing in. In our Card business the loss content is similar to originations we've been doing for quite some time. The losses of new originations are higher than our highly-seasoned back book just because that back book was profoundly seasoned by anybody who survived the great recession and the very extended period of low originations for us and in many ways for the industry. So off of an unusually low loss back book, we are seeing very good origination opportunities and it's really more of the same that you've seen from us for a long period of time. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Next question please. Operator : Yes. And we'll go next to Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify one question on provision and then I have a question about the net interest margin. There was a reserve build in the Commercial segment, but is that also given the dynamics that you just went through, Steve, as they relate to car, are they similar for Commercial given what's going on there in terms of some of the credit stress? And then my margin question is, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes in terms of what's going on in yields across the different product areas and maybe what's going on in cost of funds? Thank you. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : So the provision in commercial, the drivers of that are primarily the energy and taxi remarks that Rich made earlier. And I'm sorry, the next question was \u2013 what was the question on net interest margin? Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : It was just largely about if you could give us some insights into what's going on in terms of yield expectations and what's going on in terms of your cost of funds expectations? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Well, there's kind of plusses and minuses and a lot of it obviously depends on which side of the balance sheet you're talking about. I mean, in general on the positive side we've moved to a higher mix in Card. That's probably been something that's been a help to net interest margin. I would say yields more generally across the portfolio have been going in the opposite direction. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Next question please. Operator : Yes. The next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Rich, you mentioned sub-prime auto competition again this quarter. And I was curious if you're seeing is it an across-the-board pickup in terms of aggressive activity? Or is it more one player because obviously where one participant that's had some strategic changes that has led them to get more active if you could comment on that. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's not across the board. It's a little more isolated, but it's a similar phenomenon we've been talking about for some time, but we, of course, are making the choice to be very consistent with our own underwriting here. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And just lastly, are you seeing any impact at all from the online marketplace lenders? My sense is probably not, but I just wanted to check on that. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. I mean, we're intrigued with frankly all of the startups in the financial services space, one category of which is the online lending and peer-to-peer lending and so on. The numbers involved are small relative to the magnitude of the balance sheets and originations. To most of us it would be probably hard to see that. I also do want to point out that most of this lending on the consumer side is focused on installment lending and that's not an area we're doing a lot of origination in. So we certainly don't see any direct effect. It would be hard to measure indirect effect. But even though we may not see much of an effect, we certainly have a real interest in watching what goes on in that space. Operator : We'll go to the next question and it comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon. Just wanted to talk about the 2016 efficiency ratio a little more. A little surprised that it would stay elevated relative to already increased levels for 2015, particularly in light of your asset sensitivity and obviously some growth in digital that should lower your cost of acquisition. Do you see more flexibility in the event that revenue pressures persist on the cost side, maybe in retail banking or across other areas of the business? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let me say a few things about the efficiency ratio. As you know and probably looking at our own conversation over the course of this year, it's hard to precisely predict efficiency ratio, but what we wanted to give investors a sense of that there really are tailwinds and headwinds that are competing pretty strongly with each other. And the recent growth that we've done in the card business, for example, is certainly a positive force. Offsetting that, of course, is the \u2013 what we'll do in terms of investing in card growth during the year next year. And a pretty big component is the digital investment as well and some of the other things that I mentioned. The \u2013 in terms of how these play out, the card growth will ultimately be beneficial to efficiency ratio as growth moderates. And the investment in digital \u2013 a lot of banks are talking about digital in the language of whether the expenditure \u2013 how the investment in digital compares to the cost saves. We are not primarily motivated by cost saving with digital because I think that's about fourth on the list of things that the power that digital provides. Right now, it is still a net negative and probably for an extended period of time measured purely by cost, digital will probably be a net negative. But even then on the cost side, we're seeing benefits already in statement and payment processing, telephone servicing costs, workforce restructuring that you saw, branch efficiency, data storage, a lot of things. But the bigger benefits are things beyond that that show up in terms of better credit risk management, faster product development, and ultimately, the kind of growth that you're seeing. So the reason that we took the time here to lay out efficiency ratio guidance was just to give you a sense of the commitment that we have to investing on the digital side and the commitment that we have to seizing the opportunity on the card growth side. And I think both of those factors are going to be significant enough that we don't see a lot of opportunity for the efficiency ratio to go down in the near term. All of \u2013 during the same time, we are working incredibly hard to save costs in one, minus those two areas, and I think today's announcement is a manifestation of some of those efforts. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And going back to Ryan's question a little more on the card loan growth that you're doing, a third of your business is below prime. How quickly is that growing relative to prime? Are you seeing a bit more migration into those segments as the economy improves? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Our mix is staying pretty steady. We're growing in all of the areas that we're investing in. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Carcache with Nomura. And sir, please check your mute function. And Mr. Carcache, please check your mute function. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hello. Can you hear me? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Bill. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Can you talk about the IRRs on the new loans that you're originating today versus what those IRRs have looked like over the past several years? And within that, can you give us a sense for what's been happening with customer acquisition costs over time? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Bill, IRRs are probably on the higher end, but still in the range of the kind of IRRs we've seen going back for an extended number of years now on our originations. The primary thing is the magnitude of origination opportunity that we see. But it is also the case that the octane measured in terms of pretty much any way we measure it, but most importantly by, ultimately, the NPV, NPV per marketing dollar, IRR and various things is on the higher end. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Do you have a follow-up, Bill? Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: No, that's it. Thank you. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, the next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess I want to ask two separate questions, I want to ask them together to make it easier. First, on the Card business, just such an impressive trajectory in your U.S. Card loan and volume growth, yet it's not seeing nearly the kind of follow-through that we kind of expected on the revenue side. I know you called out some of the payment protection plans as a negative, and I'm also looking at a pretty significant sequential decline in interchange revenue. And I didn't know if there was anything going on there, just there's a high rewards rate. And also sequentially, it went from like 12% to 6% interchange revenue growth as volumes are accelerating. So can you just talk maybe about that and any other factors that are weighing on U.S. Card growth? And then my second question is for Rich on SMB lending. Just, I noted your comments about the Alt lenders and can't help, when I look at the small business version of some of these alternative lenders, that their business have changed a bit Capital One's core competencies and direct marketing and mining data and looking for mispriced loan opportunities. Can you talk at all your appetite for SMB loans that are nationally and directly originated? Thanks. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Chris. Yeah. Let me start with the interchange. The net interchange metric can have quite a bit of quarter-to-quarter variability because it includes partnership contractual payments, it includes international card. And we periodically adjust our rewards liability based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that. So as such in any particular quarter, there tends to be a lot of noise around that. But if you sort of pull up beyond the quarterly noise, you're absolutely right in pointing out that net interchange growth has generally lagged general purpose credit card interchange growth. And \u2013 or purchase volume growth. And we would expect this trend to continue. In many ways, it's really a byproduct of the success that we're seeing. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be enjoying a lot of growth. We are making the choice to upgrade a lot of our customers to these products. And we're also extending reward products to existing customers who don't have rewards. So if you look at the effect of all of those together, that's why interchange growth is \u2013 lags purchase volume growth. And I think that while that will bounce around for quarter-to-quarter, I think \u2013 and over the longer run, those two metrics will converge. I think it still will be some time before they fully converge. And with respect to the alternative lenders, for example, small business lenders, we're very intrigued with some of these startup companies. I think that they have demonstrated a lot of innovation that \u2013 from which I think we can learn a lot at Capital One. The way that they do their underwriting, obviously the digital capabilities that they have, in a number of cases, they're using very sophisticated and interesting data analytics. The way that they do cash flow-based underwriting, the way that they do the daily collections kind of thing, there's a lot of very creative activities going on in that particular space. We're watching it carefully. And we \u2013 and we'll continue to see and learn from the people that are leading in this space. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, the next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Rich, maybe first a question for you. You mentioned earlier in the call that on the card side, the card portfolio mix has been pretty steady. But if we take a look at some of your regulatory filings, it appears that the sub-660 FICO cohort within the U.S. card is growing at a slightly faster rate in terms of the overall proportion of loans with that FICO score. So I guess I'm just curious, given that you haven't really changed your outlook for credit losses over the next few quarters, what do you need to see? What's the canary in the coal mine, particularly in the subprime side of things, that might make you reassess what your lost content in that particular part of the portfolio might be? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, Matt, you are right that while overall generally, the mix is about the same, there has been a very small increase in the subprime mix. But overall, when we look at our originations, when we look at the strategy that we have, there's a real consistency. And the phrase I say, sometimes the more things change, the more they stay the same in terms of how the opportunities we're pursuing and the nature of the growth that we're getting. When you ask the question what is the canary in the coalmine with respect to this business, obviously we look incredibly carefully at the metrics that begin on the origination side. So we look at the nature of the mix of applicants that we get and that tends to be an indicator of whether there's positive or negative selection. And then we track very closely every single month all of the metrics and early indicators of whether there are any issues. And at Capital One we predict outcomes before, during and after every single origination. So we monitor this incredibly closely. You also know that in things like the sub-prime space, we have about more than 15, approaching 20 years' experience in this particular space. So what I would say for it would be the same as I would say for any part of the Card business. We watch very carefully for adverse selection, we monitor the metrics extremely closely. And we stay mobilized to move and also to let our investors know when things change relative to our own expectations. But all that said, we continue to see really across the Card business a stability in the competitive environment, a stability in the origination environment, a stability in the consumer and their own behavior and really a stability in the vintages of our originations. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : And clearly, if we saw a canary in a coalmine, I don't think you'd be seeing the type of growth that we're currently seeing in the Card business. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Well, if I can follow up with another credit-related question, I guess more on the commercial side and specifically with the oil portfolio, it looks like that was \u2013 your outstandings were down about 6% quarter-over-quarter from what you reported in the first quarter. Can you give us a sense as to, if the commitment trend is roughly similar in that portfolio quarter-over-quarter? And there's been some anecdotal evidence that there's been some increased focus from regulators on that portfolio. I guess I'm just curious as you head into the fall redetermination, sort of what your thinking is in terms of the potential for provision pressure within that portfolio. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, obviously, that business we're very, very closely monitoring and on numerous calls recently we have been talking about that segment. One of the benefits of the upstream oil & gas business is the ability to do the borrowing base redetermination. So loan balances were down 6% from the prior quarter as a result of the spring borrowing base redetermination and our E&P borrowers decreased their balances to conform to the lower commodity prices and oil field services companies reduced their balance sheets. So we've pretty much seen across the energy business a pretty darn quick reaction by reducing expenses, particularly capital expenditures and taking advantage of the receptive capital markets. So all of that said, obviously you don't have to look very far to notice what's happening in oil prices and the volatility and risks there. So the allowance builds that we've had for several quarters now have been significantly driven by energy as well as in the taxi business as well, but that one we'll really have to monitor carefully. But we do like some of the inherent resilience dynamics that exist, particularly in the upstream part of the business as they move quickly to adapt to the oil pricing pressure. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Next question please. Operator : Yes. The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe A. Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. Just thinking about some of the comments you made about the revenue in the credit card business. Given that it seems like most of the incremental interchange revenue you're generating is going back to the consumer, could you talk about whether there's a increasing or decreasing percentage of the base that's actually revolving. And I've got a follow up. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Moshe, I don't have the metrics right in front of me, but I think there is a gradual migration away from a revolving towards the transacting side of the business, but I don't have a metric in front of me, nor do we report that. But just looking as you can see the pretty eye-popping growth in purchase volume, that would be consistent with that. Moshe A. Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And you've made some comments kind of about the fee and finance charge reserve. I mean that probably three years ago was probably at least $100 million higher, so I'm assuming with the growth in the business that that's a number that probably could be rising over the next couple of quarters? Is that reasonable? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. All else equal more growth would lead to more of a reserve there. Moshe A. Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Next question, please? Operator : Yes, the next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I wanted to come back to something you said about the allowance methodology and qualitative factors. I'm just wondering with the environment we're in where we have like a 40-year low on jobless claims announced today and oil prices and gasoline prices remaining low, are those things you factor in to your outlook? Do you have expectations there? Because it seems like those should be tailwinds or have been tailwinds for credit quality, particularly for sub-prime borrowers for the last few months. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Look I think the thing that you should really focus on in trying to forecast the primary drivers of provision are obviously charge-offs and allowances. We've given you a little bit of help on charge-offs over the near term. And the two things I really want you to spend your time on in terms of the allowance builds are really the loan growth expectations and the charge-off replacement phenomenon that I talked about. Qualitative factors can be important from time to time in terms of adjusting over the next 12 months, but I think if you focus on those two, that's going to be the most important factors. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Next question, please? Operator : Yes, the next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Just a question on payment protection. You indicated 25 bps are going to be gone by 2Q 2016. I just wanted to make sure I understood that we should assume that that's a ratable decline over the next three quarters. And then, the follow-up is what kind of offsets should we be thinking about that could potentially come through? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Betsy, so this has been a gradually running off revenue stream ever since we stopped originating new payment protection in 2012. And that will continue to just gradually run off until the event happens over the course of the first quarter. It won't be on a single day. It'll happen over the course of the first quarter where we basically shut down the back book business. And so from a run rate point of view where you'll see that effect fully is starting with the second quarter. And what we're saying is relative to full-year 2015, this is a 25 basis point effect. I wouldn't look for any specific thing to offset that. It's one of many, many things that affect revenue over time. Our point is other things being equal, that would take down the revenue margin by 25 basis points. So we have a very healthy revenue margin. We have great things going on in the business, but we are not intervening to do something on the revenue side to offset this. What we're doing is really just accelerating and getting over with something that was going to happen anyway over the next couple of years. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : The next question please. Operator : And the next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I'd like to just delve in a little bit to the 11% year-over-year Card growth. One of the things we're wondering is how much of that's really being driven by average balance growth from seasoned accounts, so say over 12 months, and how much is really driven by net new adds over the last 12 months? Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : As you can imagine, it's a very good question, Rick, because of course this is many vintages and various effects all happening on top of each other. I think the best way to think of this is that the majority of our originations and growth is from new account acquisitions. Just a general observation, the majority is coming from new account origination and the very natural early balance growth associated with that. And a sizeable minority is coming from credit line increases on more seasoned books, but we are approaching an equilibrium with respect to those effects. I flagged several quarters ago that we had a bit of an outsized credit line increase going on because we had had a brownout for the period preceding that. And we are pretty close to an equilibrium now, maybe just a little bit still of residual from on that credit line increase side. But what you see is approaching an equilibrium with respect to the mechanics of how growth works. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Next question, please. Operator : And our final question today will come from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery Scott. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you for taking my questions. Rich, you talked about your incremental investments in digital and as I look at the banks and you guys, it seems like digital is clearly the Wild West to a certain extent. So when you think about digital investments, how do you think about sizing how much of a budget you want to allocate to those investments? And really how are you thinking about that in terms of investments over the next couple of years? I mean is there a specific earmarked amount or is it just ideas that trickle up that you feel that you can fund on a discretionary basis? It'd just be helpful to see how you're thinking about that. Thank you. Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you, Sameer. Digital is becoming so all-encompassing into how life works and how the business works, it's increasingly difficult to even in a sense technically answer your question. But we don't start with a thing that says, okay, we have X million dollars to spend on digital and that is it. So what we do is we start strategically with the environment and say where is the world going and what does winning entail as the world goes there. And we work backwards and then develop a strategy and we figure out where we need to go as a company. And along the way you can imagine that digital is a centerpiece of that entire strategic agenda. And so everybody from the bottom-up builds the economics of their business working backwards from where they're trying to go as a business, and all of that adds up to our overall economics. We see if it makes sense. We drive incredibly hard to wring out costs that are not directly related to digital innovation and growth. I know you can't necessarily see those effects, but they are very significant, as are the digital investments on the other side. But I'd just like to stop and reflect a little bit on what is it that we're investing in, because I think a lot of banks say, and I've heard several of them say it, we're going to sell funds as digital investment. And so you tell me how much you can save and that's how much we can invest. That is a really, really tough way to take any institution I think to where it needs to go because the marketplace isn't waiting for us to do that on those terms. But on the other hand, we're not just investing in science experiments or seeing what's new and shiny object. When we talk about digital investment, it starts with talent. We're talking about bringing in top engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists often from tech companies and startups outside of financial services. And this is a very important thing and obviously it costs money to do that, but that's a foundational thing. We're talking about providing the digital workspaces and the most modern tools for these folks that's essential in terms of recruiting them and essential in terms of leveraging them. So often I think banks when they think about digital, they think I've got to go build apps, we've got to get customer-facing or associate-facing apps. Most of the leverage is really in infrastructure in terms of things like rationalized and simplified core infrastructure, increasingly we're focusing on cloud computing and building the underlying capabilities such that product development will be faster and faster and more effective over time. We're obviously investing in terms of product development itself and we're on an accelerating basis shipping product and you can go to the App Store and take a look at some of this stuff. It's pretty highly rated. We're investing in cyber security. This is an incredibly important area and we are putting a lot of very top talent and a lot of energy and investment into that. But the key thing is, this is not because we think this digital thing is cool and there's opportunities someday. These are delivering benefits right now on many fronts. While you can't necessarily see it in the numbers that you see, but the enhancements to productivity, the power of innovation, the dramatically growing customer experience benefits and it's inextricably linked to the growth that we are generating right now. So pulling way up from that it doesn't really start with this is the number. It's really increasingly sort of who we are and how we think about the business. So pulling way up, what we are so focused on is making sure that we can generate very strong returns for our shareholders and continue to invest in a future that has very strong returns for our shareholders over time. And right now we see right in front of us two very, very big opportunities. One of them is card growth and the other one is this digital opportunity. Both of them involve spending money to make more money later, but at the end of the day, I go back to the thing that we focus on every single day. How can we create value for our shareholders today and ensure that we can create value for them tomorrow? And the way to do that is to generate well above hurdle-rate returns, to make sure that our investments are very disciplined and driven by a net present value framework to the absolute most rigorous extent possible, and be sure that we are really obsessive guardians of capital, and in the end, distributing capital to our shareholders. So that's a long answer to your question, but I'm glad you asked because increasingly digital is who we are, and it's where the leverage is. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Terrific. Thanks, Rich. I appreciate the fulsome answer. Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President- Global Finance : Thanks, Sameer, and thank you, everybody, for joining us on this conference call tonight. We thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Just a reminder, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any questions you may have. Have a great evening, everybody. Thanks. Operator : And that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Jeff. For the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.1 billion or a $1.98 per share, and had a return on average tangible common equity of 14.3%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned a $1.99 per share. Net income was up $251 million versus the prior quarter driven by higher linked-quarter pre-provision earnings and slightly lower provision expense. Pre-provision earnings increased by $375 million versus the prior quarter as we had higher revenue and lower non-interest expenses. As a reminder, we had $188 million of non-recurring operating expenses in the second quarter. Excluding non-recurring expenses, operating expenses were relatively flat versus the prior year. Provision for credit losses decreased 3% on a linked-quarter basis driven by a smaller allowance build. During the quarter, we added $69 million to our UK PPI reserve with $49 million as a contra-revenue and $20 million in operating expense. We have included in an appendix slide in our earnings presentation available on our website, illustrating the impacts from non-recurring items to key line items and ratios in both the quarter and year-to-date. The increase in our UK PPI reserve is driven by proposed new rules announced by the FCA in early October. As always, our 10-Q will provide further details on the factors we consider in estimating our reserve. Excluding the impact from the build in UK PPI reserve, earnings per share in the quarter were $2.10 per share. Turning to net interest margin. As outlined on slide four, reported NIM increased 17 basis points in the third quarter to 6.73%, primarily driven by higher loan yields in domestic card and an additional data day to recognize revenue in the third quarter. We continue to be above the fully phased in LCR requirements as of September 30, 2015. On slide five you can see our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 12.1% as of September 30, 2015. On a fully phased in basis, we estimate the Standardized ratio would be approximately 11.8%. This fully phased in ratio is subject to change once we exit parallel run and we expect it to be lower. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 7.6 million shares, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We entered parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target. Let me now turn the call over to Rich. Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on slide seven with our domestic card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Year-over-year, ending loans and average loans were both up 12%, and purchase volume was up about 19%. We continue to see attractive and resilient growth opportunities in the domestic card business. Revenue increased 10% year-over-year, slightly lagging average loan growth. Revenue margin declined year-over-year and remains healthy at 17%. Year-over-year, non-interest expenses increased 7% with higher marketing and growth related operating expenses, as well as continuing digital investment. Credit continues to perform in line with our expectations in both our existing portfolio and our new originations. Two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. The third quarter has always been our seasonal low point. As a reminder, all else equal, seasonality results in increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter, rising the peak charge-off rate in the first quarter. This pattern has been particularly pronounced for the last couple of years and we expect that to continue. In the third quarter, the charge-off rate improved 34 basis points from the linked-quarter to 3.08% driven by seasonality. Year-over-year the charge-off rate increased 25 basis points, primarily as the result of expected growth math impact. We still expect the quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid to high-3% range in the fourth quarter. And in 2016, we expect the full year charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter, and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward. Slide eight summarizes third quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans were flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto loan growth is predominantly prime as subprime auto originations have been essentially flat for several quarters. As a result, the mix of our auto loans is shifting toward prime. Consumer banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Higher revenues from growth in auto loans was largely offset by the impacts of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances, and margin compression in auto. Non-interest expense increased 5% year-over-year, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans. Provision for credit losses was relatively flat compared to the prior year at a $188 million. Auto originations increased about 3% year-over-year and from the linked-quarter. We've discussed increased competition in pricing and underwriting for some time. In the third quarter, we continued to see aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We continue to lose some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. We've also seen some softening in used vehicle values, although they remain near historically high levels. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our longstanding focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers. Our consumer banking businesses face continuing headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2016. Planned mortgage runoff continues and auto margins are compressing from exceptional levels due to the mix shift toward prime and continuing competitive pressure. We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio for the remainder of 2015 and in 2016. Moving to slide nine, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Ending loan balances increased 5% year-over-year and 2% from the linked-quarter with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in CRE and C&I. Average loan balances were up 6% year-over-year. As we've been signaling, our growth has slowed compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in plain vanilla CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. Revenues for the quarter were essentially flat compared to the prior year and down 5% from the linked-quarter. Continuing spread compression drove the quarterly revenue trend. Year-to-date, revenues are up 7% with 9% growth in average loans, partially offset by the 22 basis point decline in loan yields. Credit performance remained strong for the majority of our commercial businesses, but credit pressures continue in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $66 million from the prior year to $75 million with higher charge-offs and allowance build. The charge-off rate of 26 basis points was up from both the prior year and the linked-quarter driven by charge-offs of taxi medallion loans. We've built allowance over the last four quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans. In the third quarter, non-performing loans were up $292 million from the prior year to $453 million, and the NPL rate was up 55 basis points to 0.87%. These trends resulted from downgrades of oil and gas loans, and to a lesser extent, downgrades of taxi medallion loans. On a linked-quarter basis, NPL rate improved three basis points. We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. Of our approximately $3.2 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, around half is in exploration and production. In this part of the business, loan structures provide some protection against the oil price cyclicality. Around a third of our energy loans are in oilfield services. We expect this part of the business will continue to present challenges and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern. Our taxi medallion loan portfolio is less than $1 billion in loans. In the face of growing competition from Uber and other entrants, taxi medallion values continue to be under pressure and we continue to closely manage risk in this sector. Finally, in the quarter, we announced the acquisition of the GE Healthcare Finance business, which will add approximately $8.5 billion in loans to our existing healthcare specialty business. We're thrilled to welcome GE Healthcare's outstanding leadership and talented associates to Capital One. The acquisition catapults us to a leading position in an industry with strong growth potential. We expect to complete the acquisition by the end of the fourth quarter. Capital One posted solid results in the third quarter, highlighted once again by strong growth in our domestic card business. We're delivering attractive risk adjusted returns today and investing to grow and sustain returns in the future. We continue to expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio will be around 55%, excluding non-recurring items. Our expectation for full year efficiency ratio implies a significant increase in fourth quarter non-interest expense and fourth quarter efficiency ratio. Both efficiency ratio and NIE are subject to potentially significant quarter-to-quarter variability. Both typically increase in the fourth quarter, and growth related operating and marketing costs will likely accentuate the fourth quarter increase this year. Given these three factors, we're still estimating full year efficiency ratio will be around 55% even though the third quarter efficiency ratio is meaningfully lower. In July, we said that we didn't expect much improvement in full year 2016 efficiency ratio compared to full year 2015. Since we gave that guidance just one quarter ago, the outlook for interest rates has reduced 2016 forecasted revenues. However, we remain optimistic about our progress and the trajectory of the underlying operating drivers of efficiency ratio. We are managing costs tightly across our business. Our card growth will create positive operating leverage. And while not solely motivated by cost savings, our digital investments are already delivering tangible savings and productivity gains in servicing, core infrastructure, and our legacy operations. We expect that these savings will grow and will help operating leverage over time. As we move three months closer to 2016, we expect modest improvement in full year efficiency ratio in 2016 excluding non-recurring items. Pulling up, Capital One is well positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over the long-term with growth potential and sustained returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval. And now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris - Investor Relations : Thanks, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to the other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, I ask that you please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Lauren, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Betsy. Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon, Betsy. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So just two questions, one a follow-up on what you just indicated that you have sufficient expectation for having some operating leverage in 2016, and that's primarily coming from the savings that the digital investments are making. So is that coming from legacy ops? You'd be able to run them a little bit more efficiently, or is that more from top-line, if you could just talk to those two things? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think it's a \u2013 there's no one place to point. If we go back to last quarter, we said we didn't expect much improvement in full year 2016 efficiency ratio, excluding non-recurring items of course, compared to full year 2015. We noted Betsy of course that we were predicting a volatile number 15 months in advance. We also said the investments that will pressure our efficiency ratio would over time contribute to positive operating leverage. And most notably, of course, those are our investment in card growth and our digital investment. We're now three months closer which helps reduce uncertainty somewhat and we have three more months of card revenue growth baking in the oven. We also continue to drive hard for cost savings and we've seen some solid tangible evidence of cost savings arising from our digital investments, and we know these savings will increase over time. And we have identified more contingent cost levers to manage some of the revenue uncertainty. And while we are of course still one and a quarter years away from the end of 2016, we have enough confidence to say that we expect modest improvement in full year efficiency ratio in 2016 excluding non-recurring items. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. All right got it. And then on your comments around the NCO outlook for card in 2016, is that a function of the 4% that you mentioned, average for the full year. Is that the function of what you're seeing in the portfolios today seasoning, or is that a function of how you think new portfolios are going to traject or is it a function of a potential slight slowdown in loan growth where reduction in new portfolios reduces the NCO ratios or increases the NCO ratios somewhat, maybe you could just tease that out a little bit? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Betsy, it's really, I think just a \u2013 how the growth math manifests itself in the context of having gone from a relatively low growth environment to an accelerating growth environment, and how the losses play out. Let's talk about that growth math for a bit. If you just looked at our back book, you'd see exceptionally low and still improving credit loss. And that's because the back book is made up mostly of customers who weathered the great recession, and it's also exceptionally seasoned as a result of low levels of originations over many years. So from the starting point of that back book, now almost any new business that we originate of course will have higher losses. And as a general rule of thumb, losses on new loans tend to ramp up over a couple of years, and then peak and gradually come down. So when we accelerate growth, the majority of the loss effects you're felt over the subsequent two years. And this is the dynamic we've been calling growth math and things are continuing very much consistently with our own expectations with respect to how the credit is manifesting itself on the early vintages. And so what we have done, as we get another quarter into this and another quarter closer is to give you a bit of an extended window into basically the same growth math phenomenon that that we've been talking about for several quarters. Jeff Norris - Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Rich, could you talk a little bit about kind of the competitive environment in cards? I mean as we've listened to some of the other players that have reported, one of the themes that has come up is that account acquisition hasn't been as much of a challenge as rewards. Can you kind of talk about both of those factors? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Moshe, my overall comment I would say about the competitive environment is that it's fairly consistent. It's pretty intensely competitive, but overall relatively consistent, again, relative to some of the things that we see in some of the other banking businesses that we're in. But taking the different components of what we're seeing here, starting with balances, just \u2013 industry balances as you know Moshe, of course, have been relatively flat for quite a while, but now industry-wide those are certainly moving up. So, industry revolving debt helped steady it about 1% for most of 2012 and 2013, but since July of 2014 it's been over 3% growth and over 4% growth in recent months. And bank card outstandings are up about 4% year-over-year. So the first factor that we see is that there is return to just ambient levels of kind of balance growth in the industry. Pricing has been stable in the segments that we play in. Competition continues to be very intense, especially in rewards but generally stable. The one place that we would flag as where the competition has really increased substantially, and to a point of concern is in the partnership side, the bidding has become very intense in this auction-based market and there've been some very aggressive deals which we're not going to pay whatever it takes in that space. But that to me is the most striking thing that is in motion. Specifically with respect to rewards competition, one thing I want to say is, while it has some stability to it, it is intensely competitive and it has been that way for a lot of years. So, I think the major players, who are in it are very invested in it and it sort of takes years to build the brand and the market position to be able to succeed in that space. I see the players in that space being generally investing intensely; relatively consistent with what we've seen in the past, but certainly that's a very competitive (25:24). Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Just a follow-up. I mean, given that you've got double-digit growth in net interest income and a decline actually year-over-year in interchange income, would you and what your comments just now about balance growth returning at the industry level, I mean do you think this is a little bit of the return of the lend-centric model? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, that \u2013 I wondered the same things as I saw some of the industry data, Moshe. I wouldn't necessarily declare that. I think that off of just such a stagnant growth environment, I think that there is some growth in the industry. But certainly relative to the last time, we saw the boom in the lending-centric environment, of course back then, Moshe, we saw some really kind of crazy practices that got into some of the products in the industry, just intense teaser wars all over the place. Now, of course, for those who choose to play in that segment, that's certainly going on. And people stretching in terms of credit risk and so on. It's what we saw again in the mid-00s. So I wouldn't say we see anything like that at this point, but I think it's good for you to make note that there has been a bit of a pickup in terms of balances and we'll have to see where that goes. Jeff Norris - Investor Relations : Next question, please? Operator : We'll go to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right, great. So I got one question on the charge-off rate expectations. So Rich, you mentioned 4% for next year and how losses would peak, I guess, in the first quarter. I mean is that what the trajectory will be into next year? And then we should expect it to moderate thereafter? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, could you just repeat your question one more time, Sanjay? Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Sure. Sure. Sure. So, you mentioned how charge-offs would peak in the first quarter, and then you talked about the full year charge-off rate being 4% for 2016. So should we expect a moderation in the loss rate after the first quarter? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. Our point about \u2013 there is a seasonal effect. There's two different effects going on. One is the seasonal effect. And if you allow yourself to just say, if everything else were equal, here are the seasonal patterns and I described those several minutes ago, and that has the characteristic of peaking, as you described. Overlaid on top of that is another very important thing, which is the growth math of the acceleration that we have had in our business and that actually picks up steam over time. So, for example, we had pointed to sort of in the second half of 2015 that you will start seeing the net effects of growth. In fact growth \u2013 very early on when you start to accelerate growth, the losses actually in a sense have a movement in the other direction because you get a build of a denominator before the numerator picks up steam. But anyway, it's around this time, the third quarter of this year that the growth math is starting to play an increasingly important role. That's why you're now starting to see year-over-year growth in our charge-off numbers. So the guidance for the full year 2016, we're not giving quarterly guidance but it will have seasonal effects and then the increasing growth math effects and they will combine in our view to generate a full year average loss rate of around 4%. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. I guess my follow-up question, maybe for Steve or yourself. When I look at the card yield, year-over-year, you obviously started growing loans at a faster clip. But the yield doesn't seem to be increasing all that much. Is that related to the mix of the types of accounts that you guys are originating or what exactly is driving that because I would have thought you'd see that move up some? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : I don't know why the yield would move up, Sanjay, because it's just average relative to the portfolio is. So I'm not sure you'd see a change in yield. I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding the question. There's not a mix change in the portfolio if that's (30:59) Jeff Norris - Investor Relations : Sanjay, I think we've lost you. If you want to follow-up with me after the call \u2013 feel free to do so. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Cool, thanks. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : So now let's go to the next question. Oh! You're still on, Sanjay? Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yeah, it's all right. It's cool. We'll talk afterwards. Thanks. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Next question then. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey good evening, guys. Rich, I know a couple of people have asked credit questions and maybe I'll try to ask it another way. So it sounds like 3Q or 4Q is really the starting point of the pickup in growth math. So assuming we don't see any further accelerations in loan growth, but does that imply that beyond 2016 we will continue to see a ramp in losses just because of the two-year period that you talked about before. And what does that mean for provisions, as we think about 2016? And lastly, does it continue to ramp once we get beyond that? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. There is too many factors that lie between now and the end of 2016 to make a forecast at this point on what's going on in 2017. You do make a very good point though, that we all should remember, that at the end of the day of course as we get into the latter parts of 2016, the allowance build will be driven very much by what's happening with losses and very importantly what's happening with growth at that period of time. But I think that the main point that I wanted to make is just the way growth math works. It's in the first two years after \u2013 for any vintage of growth, where the losses are climbing. And then they settle out and actually ultimately go down in any one sort of vintage of growth. So, all of this is the math of some things going and after they \u2013 so for example, as we get towards the latter part of 2016 and into 2017, some of the early growth vintages will be starting to settle out and you still have the effects of course of some of the more recent growth that we hope happens over the course of next year, for example. But I think that, keeping in mind, this general effect of what happens over the two-year period following a surge in growth and then understanding it's the blend of all the different vintages and the timing of that, I think that's pretty much how we would guide you at this point. Obviously, collectively, things eventually stabilize in just the math of when accelerated growth happens for a period of time and settles out. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Maybe just one quick follow-up for Steve. I think, some of us might think modestly down can mean different things. So can you just help us understand, what you would consider to be modest improvement on efficiency \u2013 the range? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think those words were chosen carefully and we're probably not going to go a lot further than the guidance that was given. So I appreciate you trying and we'd like to be more precise, but I don't think particularly at this point more precisions probably in your or in our interest. Next question please. Operator : We'll go to David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon. In the U.S. card business, let's (34:56) see that the card fees rose nicely versus the overall volumes, closing the gap more so than previous quarters. Is that function of maybe dialing back the contra-revenue rewards or is it more a function of better activation and engagement and could we expect this to continue? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I'm not really sure where you're coming to that conclusion. So what's bothering you (35:22)? David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: The domestic card non-interest income was up 7% and higher than previous quarters versus your purchase volume growth of 19%? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. There's just a bunch of different factors, I think, that can move around on a quarterly basis. I don't think there's anything systemic or trend-wise that we'd point out. I think it's much better to probably look at these things on an annual basis. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then on the auto regulatory environment, what's your outlook there, and has that been a part of the reason why you pulled back in subprime? And in terms of what would get you back into that business, given how fragmented the industry is, what industry conditions would you need for you to increase the originations? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So look, well we very much like the business and we spent 15 years building the capability to underwrite and manage risk in, for example, the subprime auto business. So the flagging that we have done in recent quarters about some of the practices that we see again is causing us to, ultimately effectively slow down the origination growth that we had had. We're still generating good business and we love the business. You mentioned the regulatory word, it is really not \u2013 our slow down, if you will, in origination growth is not driven by regulatory considerations. It's really driven by competitive situations, and in subprime most importantly some of the lending practices that we see that where I think more risk is being taken than we are comfortable to take to win a particular piece of business and that's really what we're flagging there. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Citi. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Rich, given your comments on partnership pricing, as you look out to 2016, what are your thoughts on portfolio acquisitions or other purchases. Are you seeing anything that's remotely of interest? You've got a pretty interesting deal on the GE Healthcare portfolio? How do you think about 2016? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well I mean, we've often said about acquisitions that, look, the marketplace is always in flux. And we said that we would continue to be interested particularly in asset purchases and partnership businesses. Those would be the primary areas of focus. The partnerships, in many ways, we've not been the market clearing price on some of the recent partnership biz, and I think our actions and discipline kind of speak for itself. But with respect to asset businesses we're really excited about the unique opportunity. It's very unusual thing to be able to, in an acquisition at an attractive price, get someone that is like the leading and just absolute amazing performers that somebody like GE Healthcare business is. So a lot of planets aligned for us to get that. It is a byproduct of as I've said we watch the marketplace and look for opportunities, but as you can see over the last number of years, we done more looking than we have buying anything. But I think the GE business represents a very special opportunity that arises, but it is a very unique thing. I don't think \u2013 I think it is you could probably measure in decades the number of times a business comes along with such a good business and a market leading position where that can be obtained at a reasonable price. So we're happy about that, but that's not an indication that we're moving in the big acquisition mode in the slight. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): If I could just clarify one quick thing. You had mentioned softer used car pricing for auto. Is that seasonal, I guess this would be the time you'd see that or are you sort of seeing something beyond seasonality that's noteworthy? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : First of all we've been talking about auction prices for a long time. And the biggest reason that we put so much focus on is, if you look back in a historical context, we are at record levels in terms of where auction prices are. And they have sustained at record levels for a long period of time. And now there're arguments for that. Cars are lasting longer and there're lot of things about that. But the thing that matters from an underwriting point of view is not how long a car lasts or its value on the other end, it's what its value is relative to what you underwrite, wrote it, expecting it. So I just think in general, there is asymmetrical risk in the auto finance industry when auction prices sustain as they have for a significant number of years at record levels. And probably although we underwrite to a decline in prices, at some point, I think there's just a risk that the industry gets a little too used to that. So that's in general, what we have been flagging here. Now, if you look at the Manheim Index, you could go bowling on that flat index. Our own index that we see in the marketplace that's measured a little bit differently actually has shown recent declines relative to that. But the main thing is not so much what has happened and no it's really not a seasonal point. The main thing is just when we see small effects happening, we just talk a little bit louder to remind everyone that there's asymmetrical risk at the moment with respect to where auction option prices are. But I've been saying for several years and they just keep on being high, but that's what I wanted to flag on that. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Next question, please? Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask another time on the U.S. card business non-interest income. I focused on last quarter net interchange revenue growth of only 6% last quarter, again this quarter 6% relatively flat. Steve, I thought you indicated last quarter that, that can bounce around and there's looks like a natural growth rate of interchange when you're growing volume at 19% that'd be a little higher than that. So are there any one-time items that are weighing your interchange growth or this is simply a function of all the high rewards cost products that you're having successfully in the marketplace? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that in any one quarter \u2013 I wouldn't put too much stake or stock in any one quarter with respect to this metric. But I do want to \u2013 and probably the best ways to look at that is looking at periods like year-to-date, for example. Interchange revenue for Capital One has been \u2013 it's growing at 8%, for example. But just I want to get a little bit behind why there is this disconnect? And it has been going for a few years now and it will continue, although at some point, these numbers will converge. But the difference between the GPCC purchase volume versus the interchange growth rate. And it isn't just \u2013 I mean, yeah so we are out with attractive rewards proposition. You can see them advertised on television for example. That is a factor. We are also upgrading rewards products for existing rewards customers. We're also extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And a higher mix of kind of all the originations that happened out there in the marketplace now have rewards than they had before. And really this phenomenon \u2013 every player I think is seeing the same phenomenon. There are differences in degrees depending on strategies and how they're \u2013 especially the choices people make on do you want to go into your existing portfolio, how much are you going to take some cannibalization impact or not? But I think the main point is we're still having solid growth interchange. It's well below purchase volume. That effect will continue over time. But in the longer run, these things will converge. In the meantime, we feel really good about the economics of reward products and the choices that we're making and the customers that we're originating. Steve, did you want to add anything to that? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : No. Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And I may have some unrelated follow-up. In the UK business, it looks like things fell a little bit sequentially. Can you think about (46:20) update on the UK business and how you are thinking about it and how changes in interchange rates in the UK could potentially impact your marketing and growth strategy there? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We really like our UK business. It's a tremendous synergy to have that business when we have such a big U.S. business and we have a lot of cross-pollination going both ways and good business ideas going both ways and some of our best ideas actually sometimes come from our UK folks. That UK business isn't just a clone of our U.S. business and the most striking difference, if you look at the two, is sort of the absence in the UK of the big top-of-the-market transactor rewards driven business. So while interchange dropped significantly, our business never was a really top-of-the-market spender, heavy business. So the impact on us is relatively muted from the drop in interchange. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Good evening, Rich and Steve. Can you tell us what proportion of your portfolio is comprised of your back book versus your front book? And maybe help us understand what a normalized mix level between those books tends to be as you continue to grow? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You know, Bill \u2013 you didn't just like the eloquence of this great story about how back book performs and front book performs. They are really not \u2013 we don't have a thing at Capital One called just the back book's over here and the front book's over here because it's all a state of transition. Everybody starts in the front book over time and then moves into the back book. It is a general descriptive method that we use to say that the metrics that you're seeing on our portfolio are driven way disproportionately by the changes at the margin especially in originations, but also in terms of things like line increases as well. So that the effects are so dramatic, particularly on a highly seasoned portfolio with just incredibly low losses like we have here. That's why we speak in terms of the front book and the back book, but they really \u2013 it's more of a method of explaining how the business works and... William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Right. But I guess I was kind of... Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Phil (sic) [Bill], if I could just say also, a big part of not being able to do what you would like in terms of forecasting it, I think you've heard Rich talk forever about growth being windows of opportunity we see in the market, and we're not planning every year to get a certain amount of growth when it's there and it makes sense we take it. So, that obviously makes it pretty difficult to look into the future and see how the mix is going to change over time, and hopefully it goes without saying that these originations are performing as we expect, and we believe these are going to work out really well for our shareholders over time. William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Right. I guess I was just trying to build off of the thought process that you guys described so well surrounding the growth math, and just the idea that you have peak losses somewhere around 18 months to 30 months. So if we just draw a line in the sand at, let's say, 36 months, then anything older than that is past peak losses, and you have declining charge-off rates relating to anything that's older than 36 months and anything younger than that is experiencing arguably rising charge-offs. And then so to the extent that you guys kind of stopped growing post the great recession and more of your book was comprised of the back book that was a larger percentage of your book, but now as you've been growing and kind of stepping on the gas, some of the newer vintages are representing a greater proportion of your overall book, and therefore that's creating some of the growth math headwind. And so I was just looking for a little bit of color around the interplay of those moving parts, but if you can share that, I'd love to \u2013 either, if you have some more color you could share on that, that'd be great. Otherwise, I have a follow-up I'd like to ask. Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, actually you did an incredibly good job, probably better than I did of actually explaining the growth math general dynamics. So if you have specific questions, we'll try to answer them, but I think that if you look at Capital One right now, we're in kind of a striking position if you look at our metrics relative to a number of players. First of all, you may remember that in the period preceding this, Capital One was actually near the bottom of the league tables in terms of growth. And we talked all about running off high balance revolvers. We kind of stopped talking all the time about that, but that's a phenomenon so we have had an exceptionally seasoned book. And then, now, as we're sort of on the leading side of the industry with respect to our growth, then you're also going to see our metrics will move in ways that will diverge from competitors, in striking ways and that's why it's really important that we all communicate as clearly as we can about growth math and separating what's the difference between just natural maturation of businesses and customers behaving exactly as we expect versus changes in underlying credit performance or things like that. So at this time, we are diverging from certainly some of the other players with respect to our credit performance. I again want to reiterate that things are coming in very consistent with our own expectations, both on the front book and on the back book. Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Spahr with CLSA. Chris J. Spahr - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. I noticed that most of the deposit growth has been in the other segment this quarter. Can you explain why that is and maybe if you'd raise the rates to kind of get that the business lines growing? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So that's really, our funding needs have been met more by wholesale funding sources including securitization, some brokerage CDs. We've been largely out of wholesale markets following the ING DIRECT acquisition and have been intentionally reestablishing our presence. That's just a market that you want to stay active in. Remember, wholesale funding is also an important part of the LCR calculations. So there're a couple reasons why we, in addition to being in a pretty efficient market, but we believe we're very well positioned to grow our deposits in our bank going forward. Chris J. Spahr - CLSA Americas LLC : And can you give some guidance on the PPI charge outlook going forward? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : I really can't. We had the rules issued by the FCA and there is some specificity in how those actually work. So there's a two-year window for customers actually looking for a relief. And what we did was we took obviously everything that was in that release and used it to come up with our best estimate of reserves, but there are a lot of unknowns with respect to how the final nature of this is going to come in and how customer complaints will come in and obviously we've done our best to estimate that in reserves and to the extent that things change that that will something that we make you aware of. Next question, please? Operator : And for our last question this evening, we'll go to Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks guys for taking my questions too. Looking at some competitor data and some comments from your peers, it looks like there was a pickup in account growth which you cited the fact that your loan growth has been substantially in excess of your peer group, which everybody's certainly been tracking pretty closely. Curious how much of this is a function of new accounts versus utilization in line limit increases? Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Rick, we also are enjoying a high level of account growth right now. Not sure I can speak for the other competitors but if you look at when we went from very little growth a couple of years ago, when the growth began, we said that our originations have picked up but also our line increases are going to be a little bit outsized here because we are making up for a period of time when we were not able to do line increases as we are working on a solution to a new regulation that had come out. And so, early on in our growth surge we were a little bit more than normally weighted toward line increases. That has now reached pretty much an equilibrium where the line increases \u2013 the majority of our growth \u2013 and by the way \u2013 well I would say just generally a majority of our growth is coming on the origination side, and important minority of our growth is coming from line increases but it's pretty much at sort of an equilibrium at this point. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Second question, and it's a non-sequitur, but during the quarter you issued some preferred that we potentially would have thought would've appeared in the preferred expense during the quarter, it doesn't seem to. What's the run rate headed into Q4 in terms of preferred expense? Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer : I think that's the semiannual payment. So it's December and June. That's why you don't see it this time around. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Jeff Norris - Investor Relations : Well, thanks everyone for joining us on this conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, the investor relations team will be here this evening to answer any questions you may have remaining. Have a great evening and thanks. Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Good evening. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve? Steve Crawford : Thanks Jeff, I\u2019ll begin tonight with slide 3. Capital One earned $920 million or $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter. Net of adjusting items, we earned $1.67 per share. Pre-provision earnings were down from the third quarter as higher revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses, driven by seasonal and growth-related costs. Provision for credit losses increased as we recognized higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build. On December 1, we closed on the acquisition of the GE Healthcare business, including $8.3 billion of loans and $500 million of goodwill. In addition to one month of operating earnings, there were two adjusting items related to the close of the deal. We had a $49 million allowance build related to pass rated loans and $20 million of deal related costs. As a reminder, for the acquired GE loans, we are required to account for term loans with credit deterioration under SOP 03-3, and current and revolving loans under our traditional loan accounting processes. Of the acquired loans, $835 million are accounted for as 03-3 loans. Turning to full year results, 2015 pre-provision earnings of $10.4 billion were up 3% year-over-year as higher revenue was partially offset by higher non-interest expense. Net income for 2015 was down 11% as higher pre-provision earnings were more than offset by additional provision from credit losses. Full-year efficiency ratio was 54.3%, excluding adjusting items. As you can see on slide 4, reported net interest margin increased 6 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.79%, in line with the prior-year increase. Turning to slide 5, as of the end of 2015, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standard fully phased-in basis, it was 10.7%. We reduced our net share count by 7.6 million shares in the quarter. We expect to complete our previously announced buyback program in the second quarter of 2016. [Technical Difficulty] $91 million over the prior year. Assuming no new issuance, we would expect to pay out approximately $205 million in preferred dividends in 2016. Specific quarterly payout schedules can be found in our regulatory filings. With that, let me turn it over to Rich. Richard Fairbank : Thanks Steve, I\u2019ll begin on slide 7 with our domestic card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, ending loans and average loans were both up 13% and purchase volume was up about 18%. We continued to like the earnings profile and the resilience of the business we\u2019re booking. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 11% from the prior-year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly. Revenue margin for the full year was 16.9%. As a reminder, we\u2019re on track to fully exit our back book of payment protection products in the first quarter. Payment protection revenue contributed about 25 basis points to full-year 2015 revenue margin, and we expect this contribution to go to zero by the second quarter of 2016. Fourth-quarter non-interest expenses increased 7% compared to the prior-year quarter, with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. Credit continues to perform in line with our expectation in both our existing portfolio and our new originations. As we've discussed for several quarters, two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. All else equal, seasonality results in an increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter rising to peak charge-off rate in the first quarter. As we\u2019ve said for the last three quarters, we expected growth math and seasonality would drive charge-off rate to the mid-to-high 3s in the fourth quarter. The fourth-quarter charge-off rate came in at 3.75%, in the middle of an expected range. We expect the upward pressure from growth math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full-year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. We don't normally discuss our charge-off outlook two years in advance. But given the sustained rapid growth rate, we want to give investors a sense of the growth math impact in 2017. I want to note that our 2017 charge-off outlook is our best estimate today for things that are fairly far in the future, particularly given recent volatility in financial markets. All that said, based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy, and competitive conditions, we expect full-year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates drove an allowance build in the quarter. And we expect allowance additions going forward, primarily driven by growth. Slide 8 summarizes third-quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans were down about $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage run-off. Consumer banking revenue for the fourth quarter was down 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage balances. Fourth-quarter non-interest expense was up 1% from the prior-year quarter, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loan. Provision for credit losses was up from the linked quarter, primarily as a result of auto seasonality. Fourth-quarter auto originations declined about 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, auto originations were up 1% to $21.2 billion. Prime originations continued to grow. Sub-prime originations have been essentially flat for several quarters before declining in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve discussed the effects of increased competition on pricing and underwriting, particularly in sub-prime. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers. Our consumer banking businesses faced headwinds in 2016. Planned mortgage run-off continues and auto margins are compressing from exceptional levels due to the mix shift toward prime and competitive pressure. We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio in 2016 even as we continue to manage costs tightly. Moving to slide 9, I\u2019ll discuss our commercial banking business. Ending loan balances increased 24% year-over-year, including the acquisition of GE Healthcare Finance business. Fourth-quarter ending loan balances also include about $900 million from a short-term agency warehousing transaction that is already paid down, which also will affect loan growth optics when we report first-quarter results. Excluding the GE loans and the agency warehousing transactions, loans grew about 6% year-over-year. As we\u2019ve been signaling, our organic growth has slowed compared to prior years because of choices we\u2019re making in response to market condition. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and CNI, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. Full-year revenue increased 7%. Revenue growth was below average loan growth driven by continuing spread compression. Credit performance remain strong for the majority of our commercial businesses but credit pressures continue in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios. While the charge-off rate for the quarter remained very low at 3 basis points, provision for credit losses increased $86 million from the prior-year quarter to $118 million, driven by allowance build. We build allowance over the last five quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans and the addition of the GE Healthcare loads drove a $49 million allowance addition in the fourth quarter. Compared to the linked quarter, criticized performing loans were up $290 million to $2 billion and non-performing loans were up $97 million to $550 million driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans. The credit quality of the GE Healthcare portfolio is in line with our expectation. The GE Healthcare loans we acquired run at a higher criticized rate than our legacy commercial business but that affect doesn't show up in the fourth quarter criticized loan metrics because of purchase accounting. We've provided visibility into that impact by disclosing the managed criticized rate which excludes the purchase accounting impact. In the fourth quarter, the managed criticized rate was 5.4%, 130 basis points higher than the reported criticized rate of 4.1%. As we book new healthcare loans and the marked loans paydown, this will create upward pressure on our reported criticized loan metrics over time all else equal. We like the GE Healthcare business and we\u2019re thrilled to welcome the new team to Capital One. We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Of our approximately $3.1 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, around half is in exploration and production, and around a third is in oilfield services. We expect that energy loans will continue to present challenges and we've been building reserves to reflect the concern. At year-end, approximately $190 million of our $604 million in total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This is about 6.1% of total energy loans. Given that oil prices have fallen since quarter end, unless they rebound, it is likely that energy loans will drive increasing criticized and non-performing loans for the reserve build and possibly increasing charge-offs in 2016. I'll close tonight with some thoughts on Capital One\u2019s full year 2015 results and our outlook for 2016. Two factors shaped our 2015 results; growth and investments. Growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes led the industry driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue, as well as increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. The costs of growth are frontloaded, but in our experience of more than two decades, revenue growth surpasses frontloaded costs over time and growth pays off on the bottom line. Provision for credit losses increased in 2015. Most of the increase came from higher allowance for loan losses, primarily driven by domestic card loan growth and the expectation of higher domestic card charge-off rates because of growth math. Full year efficiency ratio was 54.3% net of adjustments, better than our estimated range of around 55%. Three factors drove the favorability. Revenues for the quarter were strong. We benefited from a handful of miscellaneous fourth quarter expense items coming in favorable to expectations and we are getting traction on efficiency efforts across the company. Even from the lower 2015 starting point of 54.3%, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items. We are managing costs tightly across our businesses. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time. And while not solely motivated by cost savings, our digital investments are already delivering tangible savings and productivity gains in servicing core infrastructure and our legacy operations and we expect these benefits to grow over time. Pulling up our 2015 results and the choices that drove them have put us in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval. Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening. Rich, can you talk a little bit more about the slowdown in auto loan originations and maybe if you could add a little bit more color on how that ties in with your outlook across the credit spectrum? Richard Fairbank : Yeah, Bill, there's nothing really dramatic. There is really - the auto story is the same story we've been saying for quite some time. So for at least a year now, we have been flagging that in the subprime marketplace we see practices that are inconsistent with where we want to go from an underwriting point of view and we raised the flag about that in our calls, and we have said and continue to say today that within the context of maintaining, doing credit the way we want to do it, we are going to still go for as much origination as we can do in the subprime auto space. And the kind of net effect of this going on for a number of quarters, as we have signaled, it just - this is the first quarter that actually subprime originations are down, but it's again the same marketplace, but I think this is the effect that we have been signaling for some time. And so this is in \u2013 what I want to stress is, we still very much like the business. We do it on our own terms, and we have a great history and a real - and I think great opportunities to create value in this space. But we, as always, number one, put credit and our underwriting choices number one and the net effect of that at the moment is some reduced opportunity in the subprime space relative to what would otherwise be there. In the prime space, the opportunity continues. There are some competitive end marketplace issues on a smaller scale going on there, but we still really like the auto business. I think this is a continuing manifestation of coming off what I've kind called the sort of once in a lifetime unique set of opportunities and confluence of marketplace conditions that existed in the wake of the recession. And so, over time we are going to see a more normalized auto business. Operator : And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Maybe to kind of turn to the card business, let\u2019s talk a little bit about how you see the competitive environment now, and one of your competitors did announce a secured card program this week, so kind of infringing on that perhaps lower demographic segment and just maybe talk about the lay of the land as you see it from the card business. Richard Fairbank : So, Moshe, the card industry continues to be very competitive, but fairly rational industry. Marketing levels are high, but stable. Pricing, teaser lengths, APRs, things like that generally stable, and certainly in the places we play, we feel the pricing is resilient. Rewards are very competitive. There have been some increases in early spend bonuses, but overall it\u2019s pretty stable. And with respect to the subprime marketplace, there have been a lot of folks who have issued secured cards over time, and I think now there is another player in that space. I think so we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment there, but we continue to pursue the same strategy pretty much we've been doing for many, many years. An area also, when you talk about competition, we tend to - I tend to focus the conversation just on our own direct competitors. Of course a very relevant thing in the competitive environment is interchange as well, and so we also - as we\u2019ve talked about, want to keep an eye on interchange risk. A few of the larger merchants have negotiated lower interchange that will have an effect that we keep an eye on and also we are watching the evolving digital marketplace for payment alternatives and any impact there on interchange or disintermediation or tolls or anything that happens along those lines. So that's another dimension we should probably always add to our conversation about competition. Finally, in partnerships, that\u2019s the place that I have most pointed to as the intensity of the auction-based marketplace there at times, and in fact very often recently has led to market clearing prices that have been pretty breathtaking. And as a result, we have not had as much growth as we might otherwise have had in that particular space. The other thing about the card industry, I think worth pointing out is what\u2019s happening with just sort of industry growth. So, industry-revolving debt for most of 2012 and 2013, it held steady at about 1% year-over-year growth and then it maintained sort of little over a 3% growth since July of 2014, and in recent months, it has been over 4%. So that\u2019s certainly getting a little bit more octane there. And bank card outstandings are up 4.6% year-over-year. I think overall, if I pull way up about the credit card marketplace, I think it's a generally rational marketplace. I think we see opportunity for growth and very attractive returns. We monitor the marketplace obsessively and when we see windows of opportunity, which we do at the moment, we certainly go very hard to seize those opportunities. Moshe Orenbuch : Just given it\u2019s about a year, any update you can give us on your success in Canada? Richard Fairbank : So are you referring generally to our Canadian business, Moshe? Moshe Orenbuch : Costco Canada. Richard Fairbank : You are talking about Costco Canada? In September 2014 we launched a partnership with Costco and that deal did not come with a portfolio acquisition, so it was sort of at the margin origination business. That business has had nice traction in terms of our growth. It is not a big needle mover for Capital One overall, but it\u2019s certainly something that has had a fair amount of growth to it. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Certainly. Next comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, couple of questions. One was on just your comments around credit and I know you gave the outlook for 2017 in the low 4s. I think the guidance had been for around 4 for 2016. So I am just wondering, are you seeing a slower rate increase in 2016. Does the pace of what you are expecting as we move through \u201816 and \u201817 change at all versus prior commentary? Richard Fairbank : Betsy, explain the last part of your question one more time about \u2013 what did you say about \u201916. Betsy Graseck : I think that you had given guidance in the past around losses in \u201816. I'm just wondering if your guidance around that had changed at all. Steve Crawford : Not at all, Betsy. Guidance in \u201816 exactly the same. So all we are doing is adding \u201817 with some caution. That\u2019s a lot further in the future. And, again, there it\u2019s all about growth math. Betsy Graseck : Okay, all right. No, that's helpful and then just the follow-up is on your commentary around energy and if prices stay where they are today, you could see some criticizing classified increase as a result of reserve build. Could you give us a sense of the sensitivities there if you have any that you could share if prices stay flat where they are, what kind of reserve build we could see if prices go to 25, what kind of reserve build, anything you are willing to share there is helpful. Richard Fairbank : Okay, Betsy. We\u2019ve built reserves since the fourth quarter of 2014 and at year-end, as we said earlier, approximately $190 million of our $600 million allowance for loan losses in commercial is specifically allocated to the oil and gas portfolio. When we set our allowance each quarter we assume a material degradation in future prices relative to the forward curve. That said, oil spot - basically spot and forward prices have declined about 20% since the end of the quarter. And if they stay at that level, we estimate we will have to build about $50 million in additional allowance all other things being equal through the end of the quarter. Steve Crawford : Betsy, we are trying to give that to be helpful. And I know you\u2019ve heard that in a lot of other places, but part of the reticence of estimates like this is you've got the price impact alone, but then you\u2019ve got idiosyncratic things that can happen in particular credits that can be just as important. So what we are just talking about is really just a mathematical calculation of what would happen if the prices were closer to where they were currently. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And that question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. I guess, my first question is just how we should think about revenue growth into 2016 and 2017. Should we assume it tracks kind of loan growth and maybe you could just discuss kind of how the funding of that growth might play into that? And then secondly I was wondering if you could help me with just how we should think about the profitability of the GE portfolio that you acquired. Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Yeah. So I think you're right. The best way to think about revenues is that the primary factor there is going to be loan growth. The things that we have been observing about margin, net interest margin haven't really changed. You\u2019ve got probably a mix benefit on the card side, a mix benefit from the lower mortgage loans. You\u2019ve got a little bit of a negative against that in terms of the auto loans and then the big uncertainty factor is what happens to rates. And your second question was on? Sanjay Sakhrani : GE. Profitability of that portfolio. Richard Fairbank : I mean, we are really happy about the GE portfolio, but at less than 3% of interest earning assets, it's definitely accretive to our commercial business and to the company, but not really material overall. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And next question comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Hi, good evening guys. Just had a question on gas prices and if those continue to stay at these levels, at what point do your loss expectations start to tick down as you think about your outlook, comments for 2016 and 2017? Richard Fairbank : So you're talking about its impact on the consumer side? David Ho : Correct. Richard Fairbank : So David, I guess there is really two sides to this. The first is the potential of sustained low energy prices to cause economic stress in geographies that are heavily dependent on that industry. And keep in mind on that that our consumer lending businesses are mostly national businesses, so we don't really have any outsized concentrations in those geographies. We have about 5% of our card portfolios in parts of the country with high energy employment concentration. That said, when we look at these geographies, places like Houston, parts of North Dakota, Alberta Province and Canada, we do see slight upticks in card delinquencies. And where appropriate, we've taken steps to surgically tighten our underwriting in these geographies, although we want to be careful not to over-react to these very modest effects. But of course the flipside of falling energy prices is the direct benefit to consumers. And while the benefits are hard to disentangle from other economic effects, it's clear that falling gas prices translate into the equivalent of a pretty sizable wage increase for most households. So it's tough to gauge the net effect of these two factors. If I \u2013 my hunch is that it's a net positive on consumer credit. Steve Crawford : I think the thing that's been surprising today, is it hasn't shown up in consumer spending to the way that people would have expected. But obviously where it's going instead is to paying off debt, and given that we are in the credit business, that's not a bad thing either. David Ho : Thanks. And then separately, can you talk about some of the aspects of competition in the online deposit arena and any changes to your anticipated deposit beta, just given the current rate environment and some of what your competitors may be doing? Steve Crawford : I don't know that we talk much about changes in deposit data. I mean, we've often observed and when asked about it that the direct business does have higher beta than some of the more traditional forms of gathering deposits. But I think what you as investors are most interested in kind of the total cost of those liabilities, and it's not just about beta, it's also about mix. And one of the most profound things that's happened on the liability side is the shift in mix, with much of it going in the non-interest bearing. You haven't seen nearly as much of that at Capital One. So we would in general expect to have higher betas than the peers just as a result of the higher contribution of our direct and online business. But I think the mix is kind of something on the other side. I don't think you'll ever see us venture out too far. There have been so many fundamental changes in the marketplace, regulatory, technology changes that I'm not sure of past is going to be prologue, but we like our funding position and the fact that it's diversified across traditional and direct channels. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And that question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Just two questions. One is, I may have missed this, Rich, but could you just clarify what aided the interchange revenues in the quarter. And then my broader question is, as I think about all of the guidance, I just want to make sure I'm understanding everything correctly. It sounds as if the \u2013 there's clearly going to be PPNR growth, given the very spectacular asset growth that's occurring. But how should we think about the net income line on a year-over-year basis? Steve Crawford : So on the net income side, like I think we've told you that on the top line, it's primarily going to be a function of loans. Rich is giving you a directional guide on where we expect to go from an efficiency standpoint. Actually, I know you listened to our call, so now with two years of charge-offs, you can actually get a pretty reasonable view on not only what net charge-offs might be, but also what the allowance needs might be in the coming year. Obviously, there is a little bit of a new factor in commercial with respect to losses that make that less a function of card losses. And then the last piece is, we've had an increase in preferred dividends. So we've given you some of the important building blocks there, which I think are due to fill in. Richard Fairbank : Eric, on the interchange number, fourth quarter net interchange grew 18% from a year ago and a 11% a linked-quarter basis, which happens to be pretty much in line with our purchase volume growth of 19% from a year ago and 8% from last quarter. I would not get overly focused on any one quarter. I mean, when our interchange growth number was very low, I said this, when it's at this level, I say it again, there is a lot of factors that affect that quarterly number. If you look at full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume growth of 21%. Removing the quarterly noise, net interchange growth has generally lagged general purpose credit card interchange growth and we expect this trend will continue.  Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful with strong growth of our flagship products. We're also building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and consistent with the industry extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And as you can imagine, there is -- that entail some near-term cannibalization. But it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise and we're committed to doing that. And also as I mentioned earlier, with a few merchants out there driving interchange through their individualized negotiations and things like that, that's also another factor that we have to keep an eye on. So I wouldn\u2019t get carried away with any one quarter, but we\u2019re much very much like the growth we're having in our spender business and it\u2019s part of the long-term franchise strategy. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Certainly that question comes from Don Fandetti with Citi. Don Fandetti : So Rich, you had sort of talked a little bit about loan growth in cards and wanted to just get your sense. Would you be surprised to see sort of an industry pickup? And where do you see better sort of relative demand for credit? Is it on the subprime, prime side, or is it sort of across the board? Richard Fairbank : You know, I -- my intuition is it is this effect of revolving credit picking up is an across-the-board thing. And by the way, when you look at revolving credit numbers when card purchase volume numbers pickup that also goes into that number. So I think that after several years of frankly really being in the doldrums, the card industry across the board is getting a little bit more octane. Steve Crawford : That\u2019s obviously the industry overall, our growth rates were pretty strong. Richard Fairbank : I think, you were talking about an industry point, Don. Don Fandetti : Yes, just generally across the board, clearly you guys have been above the group. So okay, thanks. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And that question will come from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Brian Foran : Good evening. I guess, for investors, recession has become part of the conversation. It's probably not the base case for many, but it's a risk. People are worried about, where six months ago, it was viewed as a zero chance. Clearly tonight, your base case, you've given us very clear charge-off guidance and commentary on growth math. But you've got endless data you can look at, is there anything you're seeing in the data that would make you at all nervous about 2016 being the year the US dips into a recession, or is it kind of all-clear from the consumer perspective based on what you're seeing? Richard Fairbank : Well, I don't want to get too far on either sides of your little continuum that you portray there. But let me say this about the health of the consumer. First of all, there has obviously been turmoil in the markets recently, including concerns about the global economy, especially China and closer to home concerns about the potentially disruptive consequences of falling oil prices. Having said that, most indicators of the \"real economy\" at least in the US continue to look pretty strong. We've seen sustained improvement in labor markets in recent months and steady home price growth. Consumer confidence remained solid. And as we talked about earlier, falling energy prices, while they will stress certain sectors and certain geographies, they will also directly benefit consumers. And if anything, I feel, it would probably be a net positive for the overall health of the consumer. Of course, our most reliable view, Brian of consumers comes from our own portfolio from direct indicators of consumer behavior like payment rates and purchase volume, and from leading edge credit indicators like delinquency flow rates. These indicators all look consistent with our views of seasonality and growth math, and they are not giving us cause for concern. Obviously, the economy is something of a wildcard, and as the turmoil we're seeing in financial markets spills over into the real economy, we would expect that to show up in our credit metrics eventually. But we're not seeing any indications of that now. Brian Foran : I appreciate that. I guess, a smaller follow-up, the revenue suppression or the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees, it's been a while since we've had to think about that. Can you just remind us, is the best thing just to grow it proportionally with the charge-off guidance or is there \u2013 does it behave differently somehow as growth math get profits [ph]. Steve Crawford : Your instinct is pretty good. I mean, there are some other factors if you went back in the history, you would see, it kind of depends a little bit on where you are on the cycle. But the biggest driver of it is going to be credit. There is a little bit more seasonality to it, because it's a six to seven-month calculation as opposed to charge-offs, which are 12 months. So there is a little bit of seasonality into it. But with most of our figures, we try and point people to annual numbers and it should follow more of what's going on in the credit front. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And this question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Chris Brendler : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just want to ask a follow-up question on the US card business. The interchange growth, coming back this quarter, the strong purchase volume growth. Typically you've seen your marketing campaigns have a limited shelf life, but it seems like Quicksilver and the cash back rewards are still extending your lead in the US card business. Have you seen any degradation of the effectiveness of this program? And on the interchange growth discussion earlier, I just want to make sure that there is sort of a \u2013 there is that negative impact here that's causing the disconnect between purchase volume and interchange growth that may have been smaller this quarter, or is there actually something that's going to add to interchange income in any given quarter like this one? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : So Chris, the purchase volume growth is really coming from success and traction that we're having across our business, not coming from any one product, any one part of the business, it's coming from success of our rewards program, coming from new account origination, and it's coming from credit line increases, and as we do credit line increases, of course, people are spending money as they use the card even more. So there is a lot of things that are lining up right now to lead to a pretty strong purchase volume growth, one of which is the success of some of our flagship programs. On the interchange question... Steve Crawford : Yeah. The one thing -- as an example, the reason we try and point to longer-term trends is the rewards liability can kind of obscure the underlying trends on any particular quarter, which is why you\u2019re better off looking at it on a longer basis. Next question please. Operator : And that question will come from Rich Shane with J.P. Morgan. Rich Shane : Guys, thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. First, I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about what's going on with rewards and perhaps how this plays out. When we think about the intensity of the rewards space right now, it almost feels like issuers are giving away transactions. It may be not a loss leader, but it\u2019s certainly much more than breakeven. And that works really well in an environment where lending is so profitable, because credit expenses are so low. Would we expect that as credit begins to normalize, do you think that we'll start to see some of this competition abate? Richard Fairbank : Well, that's a -- Rich, I don't know how to speculate about that particular thing. I think, I feel like the rewards business, look, you're absolutely right that the rewards business is intensely competitive. And one thing I've said about the rewards business, it's really hard to be a casual player in the business, really ramping it up this quarter, putting it on TV this quarter, pulling back the next quarter, this is about very sustained investment, building a brand and being willing to what it -- to do what it takes on the timing of cost versus payback and things that make it difficult for companies to sustain their investment in this particular space.  As you know, we've invested for years and I think we\u2019re in a good position there to get a bunch of traction and enjoy the financial benefits of that. It is also the case and you are correct that the rewards business has now extended farther across the credit spectrum deeper into the revolver business in a number of things and a higher proportion of Americans are ending up with rewards cards, including a bunch who are regular old revolvers.  Now, on the face of it, it\u2019s not that big a deal economically in the sense if someone is a revolver, they -- once they start revolving on the card, the reward economics aren\u2019t that relevant any more. So your thesis is an interesting one. My own belief is this will continue to be as far out as we can see, pretty intensely competitive business.  I do not describe it as a business, where you just give everything away and make your money on the rest of the business. We work very hard to have our -- spend our business be an economically strong business in its own right, but this is certainly intensely competitive and I think some players will invest heavily to compete there and others will be a little bit more, not as intensely investing in that space. Rich Shane : Hey, Rich. Thank you. An appreciation of you taking such a theoretical question and spending so much time on it. I'll pass on my second question. Thank you guys. Steve Crawford : Next question please. Operator : Certainly. That question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : Thank you, good afternoon. I know you talked about returns and growth at the higher end of the bank range, but I guess maybe if you look at the return to generating today that Capital One is generating, you\u2019re generating return on GAAP equity in high single digits, return on tangible equity in the low teens, is that -- so that's, are you comfortable with those levels, or do you think you\u2019re under earning what you should be? Just some thoughts around the returns you\u2019re generating today versus what you would target longer term? Steve Crawford : Yeah. So, look, I think most of the industry has kind of looked at on a return on tangible equity and there were, I think a little over closer to 13% this quarter. And what we have said, what Rich has consistently said was that he believes we should be at the higher end of banks with respect to growth and returns. We haven't seen the final league tables. My guess is this year, we\u2019ll probably not be at the higher end. That\u2019s not a commitment we make every year. Obviously, you\u2019ve heard an enormous amount of our discussion over the past two years about this being a window of opportunity for us to grow and that that growth in both the card business and digital is obviously something that costs money. Rich, I don\u2019t know if you want\u2026 Richard Fairbank : Well, our investors and how they get paid overtime is an incredibly central and important question always. Since our founding days, we've been very focused on building a company that can generate superior sustainable financial performance. And to do this, we need three things. Core earnings power that has the octane to deliver attractive current returns and fund investment in the future. There are a bunch of businesses in banking that, in our opinion, don't sort of have enough earnings power to do that. That's one reason we've tried to focus on the places that do. Secondly, we need a strategic positioning in the marketplace that allows us to capitalize on opportunities. And third, we need the credit discipline to be able to respond to the windows that open and close in the marketplace. And we focus on these three things throughout our two decades as a public company. Right now is a critical time in the marketplace. We are generating above hurdle returns, but are also investing to capitalize on two very significant opportunities.  The card growth window, which is itself the reward of years of investment and a sweeping digital transformation of our industry. Both investments are going incredibly well at Capital One. And we expect the benefits will increasingly show over time in our financial performance through growth, operating leverage, bottom-line return and capital return. Bob Napoli : Next question please. Operator : And we have a question from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : Thanks for taking my question. Rich, a question for you, given what's happened in the market over the last three weeks or so, I'm curious how you\u2019re thinking about buybacks in the first quarter and the second quarter, given that your shares are now closer to tangible book value than they\u2019ve been at some point. I noticed that your buybacks in the fourth quarter were pretty consistent with the prior couple of quarters, should we assume that that buyback pace remains or is there any way that you can potentially accelerate that in the first part of 2016? Steve Crawford : Look, we're not going to speculate too much about what's going to happen going forward. I do think it's worthwhile pointing out, remember that we have a CCAR plan that's been approved through the second quarter of 2016. So, there is not really a tremendous amount of flexibility outside of what's already been approved, some, but not a lot. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thanks, Steve. And then just one follow-up if I can, there is slightly above average growth in your commercial real estate multi-family portfolio, I realize it's not a huge portfolio for you, but a number of other banks had suggested that that's an area where they are getting a little bit more cautious market by market, I'm curious what drove that and if there was any part of that portfolio that was increased by the GE purchase? Steve Crawford : Multi family. Matt Burnell : Yes. Steve Crawford : I don't think there is anything, Rich, I'm not aware of anything in particular to point out in multi-family and I don't think there was any additions from GE. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thanks very much. Steve Crawford : Next question please. Operator : And our last question tonight will come from Matthew Howlett with UBS. Matthew Howlett : Thanks for taking my question. Just to clarify on the efficiency ratio guidance, the guidance is still for a modest improvement in \u201816 over \u201815, with that really being driven by the back end of 16, could you just sort of comment on the headcount reduction and is that sort of part of the improvement? Richard Fairbank : So, we don't give guidance with respect to the timing. Our guidance, our full year number is -- headcount, some of the recent announcements you've seen on headcount impacts at Capital One are of course part of the continuing dynamic management of this company as we continue to adapt in the marketplace and continue to obsessively drive toward superior and sustainable returns and positioning this company to win in a rapidly changing environment. Steve Crawford : I just want to add, the specific word on efficiency was we expect some improvement in \u201816 and more in \u201817, just to go back to the actual language. Matthew Howlett : Got you. Thanks for that. And then, Rich, just moving to last question on the charge-off guidance that you're sort of looking out into \u201817, is that sort of the new normal of a low 4%, is that what we could look at as being a new normal where you want to be in terms of a midpoint of a cycle and is that sort of what we're targeting long term or is that something we can look at as a long-term benchmark for where are you as card charge-offs will run? Richard Fairbank : No. It's a great question. We discuss all the time what's the normal, I've been for 20 years wondering exactly what's the normal in the card business and there are so many factors. I'm not sure that I think it sort of eludes a full generalization. The key things that we are saying is this. Off of a base and extraordinarily low charge-off level of these highly seasoned portfolios like ours and really the competitors have a similar kind of situation. But unusual factor number one, a highly seasoned back book that has like survived the Great Recession.  On top of that, some dramatic growth numbers that in our more than 2-decade history of being a -- building a growth company, we have a lot of experience with how growth math works and that's why we very much want to get out in front of these numbers and explain all other things being equal, how growth math works.  And so that, and we've even done the unusual of going all the way out into 2017 to describe that effect, because we want our shareholders to understand the mechanics of how growth math works, other things being equal. So that's not the same thing as declaring what's a normal for the card business, but what it is doing is giving you a sense of how a dramatic surge of growth on a very seasoned base, how the math of that works and the settling effect that starts happening overtime. Steve Crawford : Well, that concludes our call this evening. Thank you very much for joining us on the call this evening and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any questions you may have. Have a good night. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for your participation today.",

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve? Steve Crawford : Thanks Jeff, I\u2019ll begin tonight with slide 3. Capital One earned $1 billion or $1.84 per share in the first quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased 10% from the fourth quarter to $3 billion as we had higher revenues and lower marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses increased linked quarter driven by higher charge-offs and a $286 million allowance build including $73 million of allowance build in our oil and gas portfolio.  As you can see on slide 4 reported NIM decreased 4 basis points from the fourth quarter to 6.75%, driven by one last day of recognized income and a full quarter of lower yielding GE commercial assets, partially offset by higher interest rates. NIM increased 18 basis point year-over-year fuelled by strong growth in our domestic card business. Turning to slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.9%. We reduced our net share count by 12.8 million shares in the quarter. As we completed our previously announced incremental 300 million in repurchases in the first quarter. We are on track to complete our remaining C card authorization by the end of the second quarter of 2016. As we continue our parallel run for Basel III advanced to purchase, we estimate that our common equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was above our target of 8%. Let me now turn the call over to Rich. Richard Fairbank : Thanks Steve, I\u2019ll begin on slide 7 with our domestic card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our ending loans and average loans were both up 14%. We continued to like the earnings profile and the resilience of the business we\u2019re booking. First-quarter revenue increased 12% from the prior-year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%. As a reminder, payment protection revenue contributed about 25 basis points to full-year 2015 revenue margin. Because we completed the exit of our back book of payment protection products at the end of the first quarter, we expect this contribution to go to zero in the second quarter revenue margin. Purchase volume in the first quarter increased about 20% from the prior year. Net interchange revenue for the total company also increased 20%. Although the two growth rates were the same this quarter, we\u2019ve consistently emphasized the need to look at longer term trends to understand that interchange growth without the quarterly volatility. For the past several years, on an annual basis net interchange growth has been well below domestic card purchase volume growth. We\u2019d expect this divergence to continue as we continue to expand and strengthen our rewards franchise by originating new rewards customers and extending rewards to existing customers. Also a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks that will make their way into interchange revenue overtime. First quarter non-interest expenses increased compared to the prior-year quarter, with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. As we've discussed for several quarters, two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. All else equal, the first quarter is the seasonal peak for charge-off rate. Our guidance for domestic card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from growth math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. Based on what we see today and assuming relative stability and consumer behavior the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rise in charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter. We expect allowance additions going forward primarily driven by growth. Slide 8 summarizes first-quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans were down a little less than $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage run-off. Ending deposits were up about $5.3 billion and versus the prior year. Auto originations in the first quarter were $5.8 billion, about 13% higher compared to the first quarter of last year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, originations shrink particularly in subprime. This quarter, originations growth was stronger including in subprime. We had good success with our originations programs and it appears that competitive intensity may have softened a bit in the quarter. But we wouldn\u2019t take much from any one quarter of results. We still feel the same way about this business as we have for several quarters. We remain very vigilant about competitor practices, in our underwriting we assume used card prices declined further. We continue to focus on resilient originations and we continue to expect gradual or normalization of margin and credit. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased modestly from the first quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage balances. First quarter revenues were also aided by rewards liability release associated with discontinuing certain checking products. Non-interest expense increased compared to the prior year quarter driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing. First quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, mostly as a result of growth in auto loans and a modestly higher auto charge-off rate. We also added to the consumer banking allowance for loan losses in the quarter. As we previously discussed, we expect auto charge-offs to increase gradually and in the first quarter we observed a decline in used vehicle values. These two factors drove the allowance addition. In our retail deposit businesses, customer needs and preferences are changing driving changes to the function, format and number of our branches. Like all banks we\u2019ve been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In 2015 branch optimization costs were about $50 million. We are planning to accelerate these efforts and we expect branch optimization cost to be elevated in 2016. We are still formulating specific plans and timings, but based on what we see today we expect to recognize branch optimization expenses of about $160 million in 2016. In the first quarter, actual charges were $11 million. This category rather than the consumer bank P&L. We expect several factors to put pressure on our consumer banking financial results in 2016. In the home loans business planned mortgage run off continues. In auto finance, margins are compressing and charge-offs are rising modestly. And our deposit businesses continue to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect these factors will negatively affect consumer banking revenue, efficiency ratio and net income in 2016 even as we continue to tightly manage cost. Moving to slide 9, I\u2019ll discuss our commercial banking business. Ending loan balances in the quarter increased 27% year-over-year, and average loans increased 24% including the acquisition of GE Healthcare Finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE ending loans grew about 10% year-over-year. While competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and CNI, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. Revenue in the first quarter increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue growth was below average loan growth because of continuing spread compression. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $168 million from the prior-year quarter to $228 million, as we continued to build reserves. We\u2019ve been building reserves over the last six quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans. Downgrades of oil and gas loans drove first quarter increases in criticized and non-performing loans. The commercial bank criticized loan rate was 5.6% in the first quarter comprised of the criticized performing loan rate of 4% and the criticized non-performing loan rate of 1.6%. We continue to focus on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the first quarter at $3.2 billion or about 1.5% of total company loans as some exploration and production customers drew on their lines in the quarter. Unfunded exposure decrease to $2.7 billion, total exposure including both loans and unfunded exposure decline to $5.9 billion, we expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern. At quarter end approximately $262 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8% of total oil and gas loans. Including unfunded reserves plus allowance we hold $359 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio. While our current reserves fully reflect all the information we have today as the turmoil and the energy industry continues future developments could lead to further reserve builds and possibly increasing charge-offs. I'll close tonight with some thoughts on first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another strong quarter of growth in domestic card loan balances and purchase volumes driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue, as well as related increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. Non-interest expense decreased 6% from the linked quarter driven by seasonal declines in marketing and operating expense. First quarter non-interest expense does not represent a run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons. The first quarter is typically a low point for non-interest expense. Our businesses continue to grow. We expect about $100 million in elevated branch optimization cost to impact the remainder of 2016, and we expect the net impact of FDIC surcharges and premium changes to add about $20 million to quarterly operating expense beginning in the third quarter of 2016. Provision for credit losses increased in the quarter. We added to the allowance for loan losses, primarily because of domestic card loan growth and the expectation of higher domestic card charge-off rates because of growth math. We expect these factors to drive further allowance builds in 2016. We also build commercial banking reserves in the quarter to reflect increasing risk in energy loan. Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017 excluding adjusting item. To be clear there were no adjusting items in the first quarter. We planned to deliver efficiency improvement despite the additional pressure from elevated branch optimization cost, higher FDIC expense and deterioration in marketing expectations for interest rate. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time, and we continue to tightly managed cost across our business. Pulling up, we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval. Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start Q&A session. As currently the other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any questions after the Q&A session, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Sam, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Rich, I heard you say don't look just in each quarter in terms of like growth rate of interchange income, but you had a couple of quarters where it's kind of match or been close to matching the level of the growth rate in spending volumes. Could you just talk a little bit about what will cause it, I mean, if you're saying that it will diverge and go lower, like what is the cause in the future. Have you got specific plans for growth and can maybe just relate that to how you see the competitive environment for rewards right now? Richard Fairbank : Okay, Moshe. So the most important point is to just reflect on the volatility of this number and particularly as we turn in the second consecutive quarter of where this \u2013 the number meaning the net interchange growth number where it is as high as it is, we go out of our way to remind folks that there's a lot that goes in to this particular calculation and these contribute to its volatility. So, let me start Moshe with just the volatility side of this thing. The net interest interchange metric includes partnership, contractual payments and international card and consumer bank net interchange and also we update our rewards liability every quarter based on points earned and redeemed the redemption mix and redemption rates. And so, any one quarter we probably spend more calories explaining that volatility than we do just reporting it just to make sure that folks focus on the longer term trends. If you look at the full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume growth of 21%. So, if we get pass the quarterly noise part of the conversation. Let's talk about why net interchange growth has generally lag domestic card purchase volume growth and why we also expect that to continue. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful with -- yes of course strong growth in flagship products like Quicksilver and Venture and our Spark card, but we're also building a long term franchise very consciously and consistently by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And as you can imagine this entails some near term cannibalization when we do this. But it's all part of building stronger, deeper customer franchise. And those trends \u2013 I mean we're well on our way with respect to those trends, but they will continue. And also -- and this is something that will be a newer effect in the numbers that's not in our prior numbers, a few of the larger merchants have negotiated customer interchange deals with the network and those economics on negotiations that have now happened will make their way into the interchange metrics for card players. So, you ask the question about rewards competition. This is a very competitive space, I think the competition has intensified a bit over the past years, over the past year really issuers are continuing to introduce new offers, upfront bonuses have been gradually increasing over time. I still look at this, as the player its generally rational, intensely competitive and our strategy is design to go right into a marketplace like that. So, we'll keep an eye obviously on interchange risk, I mean, that's a different orthogonal factor, but I think that we still feel pretty optimistic about that. That variable overall in the marketplace and all-in-all as we post another quarter of pretty strong performance we \u2013 it\u2019s really more of the same story that we've seen in the past and despite intense competitive we still see a window of opportunity to grow and beyond sort of the notion of window here I think this is just part of the same strategy of Capital One to invest in and going at the top end of the marketplace and I think we're very pleased with our success. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks very much. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to Rich Shane with JPMorgan. Rich Shane : Thank you for taking my questions. Really there is sort of related, Rich, you've been very clear about your decision to be little bit more cautious in auto. Over the last several quarters you're actually going back probably four, five quarters, you've been pretty bullish on the opportunity in the card space. Do you see that opportunity still being there? And in light of the growth that you're experience now, I understand the growth math impacting losses into 2016, why are you so confident that they're going to start to flatten out into 2017 as you continue to grow? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Rick, several questions there. First of all you mentioned auto and card, so let me do a little cross calibration relative to those two. We see growth opportunities in both businesses, in fact you saw an auto actually growth stepped up a little, although we went out of our way to say, don't get carried away with that. I think our message is really the same as before, frankly, in both businesses our message is really the same as we had last quarter. On a cross calibration, I think the auto business is a little bit further along in the sort of the natural evolution of a market and the competitive dynamic associated with that and I think we see less growth opportunity there even though at the margin we're both vigilant and very much working to capture the opportunities that are consistent with our underwriting. On the card side, I think that the marketplace is despite very competitive is still, I'd say it's very rational. The competitors have staked our different positions in the marketplace with different strategies and several are succeeding all at the same time. Where we are finding growth is an opportunities that are through the result of investments for years and strategic focus and testing and a lot of things that give rise to a more sustainable growth opportunity. Again, I still would flag nothing last forever and we'll take this one quarter at a time. But we feel the same way about the card business as we do a quarter \u2013 did a quarter ago. I think there are still lags on the growth opportunity here. And again, it will all be down within abandons of caution and knowing that window is always open and close, but I think we still are quite bullish about this opportunity. Now, then you said, so what about growth math? The growth math, because we have the \u2013 the key thing about growth math that is \u2013 that's so central to our explanation about credit at the moment is not just that we're doing a lot of growth right now. And as you know Rick, growth entails sort of peak losses on a vantage in the first couple of years before a thing settled out. So you have that component, but the fact that it is on top of almost we never quite seen before the extend of such a season resilient back book that the juxtaposition of high growth on top of a highly season back book creates particularly more dramatic growth math effects. All of that said, it's also the case that if you overlaying a bunch of vintages that have the same credit growth dynamics, there is just a natural seasoning effect that occurs. Frankly whether growth continues or whether growth slows down that becomes a pretty strong effect in causing the credit effects of growth math to settle out in the latter part of the time horizon that we have provided guidance for. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good afternoon. The couple of questions, one was just on Richard mentioned, the custom deals that the larger networks has struck with some of the larger merchants. I just wanted to get a sense from you as to the pace of impact on your fee rates that you're anticipating from this. Is it something that is a few basis points over a year time or it just tens of basis points over a couple of quarters? Maybe give sense of magnitude and timing and then whether or not you feel that as it plays out to other merchants, this is just something we should put in our model for the next year or two? Richard Fairbank : So, I think there are some \u2013 there are really kind of a couple of one-off things that have happened, that have been negotiated and those will become enduring effects relative to those merchants. So those effects will make their way over the course of the next number of quarters into a change in the run rate of interchange from those couple of merchants. And I don't think this is just like a see [ph] change in how the industry works, but we just wanted to flag that these I think well known things that have gone on in the marketplace, have a natural impact as they flow into any of the major card players. Betsy Graseck : So, is it changing your go-to-market strategy with rewards as you indicated with this, this is just kind of noise in the background as oppose to we have to change, how we are thinking about rewards with this custom deals happening? Richard Fairbank : The reality is the merchant marketplace even though it\u2019s a lot more consolidated than it was years ago, it still when you really stand back and look at it a strikingly fragmented marketplace and this does not have any impact on our overall strategy. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Rich, you talked about possibly more provisions in the oil and gas portfolio, could you just talk about the sensitivity going forward? Richard Fairbank : So, I think that, look, I don't think we want to be in the sensitivity business. I think we did scenario last time that went through sort of the mathematical impact of a one unique set of assumptions about prices and all that happened is our own provision was different, but the external scenario was different and our own allowance build reserve and everything else ended up being unique. So, I think what I would say is this. It maybe useful just to pull back and just talk about the provision in the quarter for a minute and then I come back and comment on your question, but if we look at our -- we had a $157 million of the $228 million commercial provision expense was related to energy and $18 million was due to charge-offs mainly in the oil and field services segment. We build reserves by $139 million, and of that our unfunded build was $54 million. As we used higher utilization assumptions for some borrowers given the somewhat defensive behavior that we saw during the quarter, and then lower oil and gas prices run off on hedges and declining collateral values also impacted our borrowers and contributed to the reserve build. And then there were some odds and end to round out the build in provision. So, I think that what we have done in terms of allowance and unfunded reserve builds reflects what we see with our customers and in the marketplace at this time, but I think it is also the nature of markets that sometimes feed on each other that I think that they still needs the deleveraging of the oil and gas industry, still needs to happen. I think we've reserve for that which we see and I think it's our expectation that it will take a while and have continuing credit impacts as this thing fully plays out. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And just a follow-up, just that revenue margins disclosure going forward in terms of protection products, how much of the 25 basis points was in the first quarter, that's going to go to zero on the second quarter? And then when I look at the U.S. card \u2013 sorry the domestic card revenue margin, that came down quite significantly year-over-year. Could you just maybe talk, speak to the trajectory going forward maybe? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Okay. First of all, to your cross-sell question. As we mentioned we fully exited cross-sell at the end of the first quarter and we'll have no cross-sell revenue in the second quarter. But yes, some of that affect happened in the first quarter, the first quarter was I don't have the exact number in front of me, but something in the neighborhood of half of the -- is around 10 basis points and being the amount of revenue that we got and that was around 10 basis points. So that would be your answer on that. The domestic card revenue margin, it's interesting how stable that has been over the years. That has been \u2013 there's been a lot of factors that have worked in opposite directions on that margin. There is certainly been a macro effect that we've been flagging over time in terms of things that we call franchise enhancements where we continue to make choices in the customers favor and that have a bit of impact on revenue. The most dramatic of these in recent years has been this cross-sell effect and it is now fully playing out. I think the biggest impacts on revenue margin going forward will not be so much of the franchise \u2013 further franchise enhancement, although here and there those always go on. I think it\u2019s the \u2013 whatever happens in the competitive marketplace which is every intense, and we will continue to monitor that, but I think we're going to stay out of forecasting business with respect to revenue margins. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to talk about some of the asset sensitivity and I know it's been coming down the last three or four quarters. I know that the outlook on rates obviously continuous to evolve but certainly little lower here versus your expectations. Can you talk about just your balancing strategy and how do you think about positioning this year? Richard Fairbank : Yes. It's not our policy and try to end up with a large asset sensitive position that's kind of naturally what we end up with as a result of the balance sheet that we have. So we find ourselves in an asset sensitive position but I think we probably if we could do it in an efficient way work to not have as much sensitivity. I should mention we do have some work underway that suggest deposit pricing may not lag as much as we've originally estimated.  There's no final decisions estimate on that point and we probably won't had a more fully formed analysis of that until the second quarter in terms of how it might change our disclosed impacts. But we're taking all of the actions that we can at our accounting friendly to manage the interest rate risk. And really what we're trying to do is balance kind of near term net interest income sensitivity which longer term changes in economic value. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs Ryan Nash : Hi, good evening guys. Steve, maybe you could follow-up a little bit on that last comment you made about that deposit pricing likely won't lag as much you expected, what is it given that betas have been extremely low across the industry? What is that you're seeing that leads you to the conclusion that it might not be as low. Steve Crawford : I think we are all struggling with and as you look across the industry at management comments, with the extraordinary change in the actual balance sheets of different depositories and then the extraordinary influence of central banks and the market place and a real uncertainty is to how regulation impacts, deposit flow is going forward and the nature of completion, we're not a period where history provides much comfort to try and figure out where we're headed. So, I think it\u2019s just not surprising that we will continue to be to look at our assumptions on interest rate, sensitivity and risk management and frankly trying to be creative about how this environment which is so different and unlike an unprecedented to how that's going to unfold and what that should mean for how we manage interest rate risk. Now if in fact things due change and our model suggest we are less sensitive, I think that will be a good thing and we'll have avoided for instance, putting on more hedges than we would have otherwise done. So, but I think this is something that everybody in the industry expresses a lot of uncertainly about and its continuing to look at what the implications of that our for rate risk and rate risk management. Ryan Nash : See if you let, let me interrupt, almost 10% expenses are up 6%. I take the fact that there some headwinds over the next couple of quarters from the branch optimization from the FDIC, but if we continue to see loan growth at these various strong levels, can you help us understand just the magnitude of efficiency improvement, do you think you can continue to drive similar like levels to what we've seen year-over-year, would you expect to see somewhat of a deceleration. And what is a future benefit of the branch optimization that you're doing this year? Thanks. Steve Crawford : Yes. We really spend a lot of time on the guidance that we gave last quarter and Rich talked about some of the challenges that have emerged over the last three months to that guidance which were absorbing and keeping where it is. And I think with all the puts and takes that's about as far as we prepared to go. Obviously the branch optimization in and of itself on a narrow basis creates savings, but we're also investing in that business in other places and really what we want to do is talk about this on consolidated level. Rich, I don't know whether you have anything to add. Richard Fairbank : Nothing. Steve Crawford : Okay. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Chris Brendler : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just wonder to see if you any additional color you provide on the strong purchase volume growth in the U.S. card business, 20% is very strong and it seems like most of your competitors are trying to piggy back on Quicksilver and other successes in the cash back space. Any thoughts on the competitive environment with that 20% growth, can you sustain that level? And I'd also like you to address the private label businesses, is that contributing to that strong growth or is that actually dragging on that. It seems to me you haven't really invested or done a whole lot of private label since you bought that HSBC business? Thanks Richard Fairbank : Okay. Chris, the purchase volume continues to be strong, let's talk about where we're seeing it. We're seeing it across various segments in our business that are growing nicely and obviously the spender and rewards business is growing in our revolver business where we focus on revolvers rather high balance revolvers, we see it in small business. But the growth results from success of our rewards programs, it results from new account origination but also credit line increases. And there is an element of this as you're familiar with the fact that we over the last couple of years increased credit line quite significantly making up for kind of a brown-out that preceded that period of time. Now we're in equilibrium with respect to credit line increases. But as people utilize extra line as you have new originations just the utilization of the card, all of these thing help grow purchase volume. So, the purchase volume numbers are the results of direct success in spend oriented programs as well as it\u2019s a byproduct of all the growth that's going on at Capital One. Can we sustain this? I think that we're in a good competitive position, but obviously a lot of other competitors are investing heavily and have a lot of very successful things that they're doing, so we will continue to take this opportunity as far as it will take us but we're cognizant of the intense competition there. Private label with respect to growth rate is in a different place because that's relatively modest growth rate, because we have not been adding lot of big partnerships. Some of our existing partnerships are having nice growth but that business is in an intense competitive period around auction prices and we've gone to a bunch of auctions. We've tended to come up empty handed lately because of \u2013 we're not been willing to go to some of the extreme levels that we have seen where the market clearing price goes. All that said, we like the partnership business and I think it has continued opportunity, but in that business that is so auction driven, I think we have to be very respectful about the nature of the auction pricing cycle within that business and make sure that we don't do unnatural things for the seek of growth. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Citi. Don Fandetti : Yes. Rich, if you look around at the major card issuers, it looks like consumer credit very strong. But if you look on the edges for example, the marketplace lenders, they're starting to have problems, and I was just curious if you thought that could be canary in the coal mine or if you think that just a more of a reflection of aggressive growth and maybe not having good credit underwriting in their DNA? Richard Fairbank : First of all, I want to start with your opening point, consumer credit and especially card credit have been exceptionally strong for some years now. And for Capital One if you peel away the effects of growth math that's still very much the case. And when we look at our back book for example credit is strikingly stable with some pockets have even continuing improvement. And this very strong credit environment has been the result of for ourselves and the industry highly -- highly seasoned back book is made up largely of customers who weathered the great recession, a more disciplined consumer who is less likely to be over stretched or over indebted and a economy that has slow though it has been sort of on a long sustained kind of recovery here. But from where we sit today, my biggest worry and it kind of gets to your question is the potential impact of growing a competition and actually the growth itself that we see of credit around us. We\u2019ve seen a growth of revolving debt creep up to about 6% recently. That\u2019s pretty high relative to the low and sometimes negative levels since the recession. And both consumers and creditors have been very cautious. Beyond card growth, we\u2019ve seen growth in other non-mortgage debt. We\u2019ve seen it institute [ph] in lending, auto lending and installment lending and we are watching that closely as well and installment lending which I think the banks have gradually returned to has been the primary asset class for the alternative lenders and you may remember we had an installment lending book that into the great recession was probably our worst performing portfolio. So we -- my point is primarily a installment lending point but the broader point is all of this -- the math of the amount of growth that we see in the credit market place is not lost on us. Now it is in the context of a particularly on the card side growth being flattish for a long period of time so we are not overly alarmed by just a surge of growth but we\u2019ll certainly have to keep an eye on this. And we know that in the end the growth, the things that we see in the market place with respect to growth not only affect our growth opportunity they can affect credit with the selection quality of new originations and can impact existing customers who take on more debt from other players. So, all of that is stuff that we look at, at this point Don we have not seen these effects in our performance. We\u2019ve reaffirmed our guidance but it\u2019s just a reminder why we focus so much on resilience. We don't set growth targets in company. We focus on capturing highly resilient opportunities when we have them and in the end always that we're in the risk management business, but right now net-net we still feel very good about our opportunity here and we feel very good about the credit outlook. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill. Ken Bruce : Thanks. Good evening. I would like to piggyback off of the questions around credit. I guess you've talked about the general performance. Can you address the subprime portfolio, subprime credit card portfolio that's obvious grown a whole lot. And then just interested if it's in performing in line with your original expectations and if you could dimensionalize how you expect the economics of that portfolio to perform over the next year, 1.5 years? Thank you. Steve Crawford : Ken, it is performing consistent with our expectations, and we've been that business for a long period of time and what we see is consistent with what we've learned over the year about that business and we like its profitable business. We like its resilience and we're continuing to grow in that of one of many segments that we're growing in at the moment. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Wassterstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wassterstrom : Thanks very much. Maybe just a follow-up on that last point. Could you give us a sense of -- in the new accounts that are being booked, how they compare from a FICO stratification standpoint, or some other underwriting metric to the historical growth? Richard Fairbank : Yes. We're growing in segments in which we have a lot of history and a strong track record even through the great recession. We're in our branded card business. It\u2019s probably not exaggeration to say when we look at the major places we're investing, we're growing in all of them with the exception of one \u2013 we are growing in all of those and there is one place we're not growing, we're actively working to continue to dial that down and to shrink it and that's the high balance revolvers. The combination of these factors has driven our portfolio mix of 650 and below assets, a little higher over the past year. Generally though our portfolio mix has been about one-third plus or minus, I think recently it\u2019s been a little bit more on plus side. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson. Arren Cyganovich : Thanks. Excuse me, there is -- one of your competitors in the online banking business had acquired a brokerage and wealth management company. I was wondering what you see as the opportunities? I know you have some of that business that you've built organically. And are you pursuing that strategy? Is there an opportunity to grow that or acquire other businesses related? Steve Crawford : We're not \u2013 we're certainly in that business. We're not a big player in brokerage and wealth management space. I think that it is not \u2013 it\u2019s an area on an organic basis we continue to work to growth opportunities. We're kind of a small player. I don't think that the big wirehouses are shaking in their boots about Capital One. But especially for our existing customers we've got some really nice, very refreshing high value products for our customers, but it still off of a very small base at this point. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Matt Burnell : Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Rich, I wanted to follow up on a couple of earlier questions in terms of you've mentioned for several quarters the opportunity, particularly for growth, particularly in cards. I am curious what you see as a potential yellow flag or warning signal that might signal to you that maybe that growth opportunity is coming to an end? Is it economic factors or is it some of the competitive factors that you mentioned earlier? Richard Fairbank : So, I think \u2013 look, the economy is always a wildcard there, but I don't think that is where that \u2013 as our growth I think is going to be more driven unless there's a dramatic kind of change in the economy. I think it\u2019s going to be much more driven by the competitive environment and the related impacts of that competitive environment on the credit environment. And we just learned long ago one of the things that makes this business what it is in terms of the opportunity to make money and get growth opportunities, but on the same its always something that we have to remind ourselves is the relationship between competitive practices that both how intensive the marketing is, the underwriting practices, the pricing and those things, how much they impact not only growth but ultimately make their way into the credit side of the business as well. And this is one business where our own customers and a lot of credit business this customers have a lending product from one bank. In this case people can have credit cards with a lot of players and then of course they hold the lending products from others as well. So as I have said and I still actually would describe the credit card market place this way, on a cross calibration with the rest of the industries that we are in, I think this is the most rational of the market places. But certainly the thing that we are watching the most is the level of supply out there and I think the underwriting competition has been very rational which is a good thing, but we will continue to watch that competition and then look for impacts that can come with that, that would signal to us that it would be appropriate to slow down or whatever. But again, you always know us, we are always in the go out and look out and [Indiscernible] at things to worry about, but I think that we continue to like the opportunity in the current space. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our final question today comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Chris Donat : Hey good afternoon, thanks for squeezing me in, me in here. Was just curious to follow up on the last question, as we look at the disclosures in your 10-Q we see that your subprime credit card balances have been growing in the high teens or even 20% in the fourth quarter. In terms of the competitive landscape are you really facing much competition or do you have a lot of running room compared to what other issuers are doing? Richard Fairbank : So one of the things that has been striking to us is the amount of -- there\u2019s a lot of consumer credit is in that space. There is a number of major competitors are actually growing in that space and also what impacts that business a lot is the what spills downstream from the prime business as consumers migrate. And so, when you -- and you can look at the overall disclosures on how much the various banks have of 660 and below. And you can see that there is a pretty sizeable amount of business that each of the players have. I think they have different strategies with respect to them. Capital One\u2019s case we explicitly actually target certain pockets within that business, other players it\u2019s more of a byproduct of more generalized marketing that they do and some of the retail bank players I think they are going to this space with your own customers that they know well. So I think that it\u2019s a more competitive space then I think sometimes urban legend will have it, but that Capital One I think just has a more unique approach to the business and one of the striking things I\u2019ll mention again about the card business is the major card players have staked out unique strategies for how they play in this business and relative to most businesses that we are in I am struck by the differences in those strategies and frankly look around and see a lot of successful players doing smart things given where they are and the bone structure of assets that they have and it leads to the simultaneous success I think of a number of players. Richard Fairbank : Well thank you everyone for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. As I mentioned before the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Thanks again. Have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Dede, and welcome everyone to Capital One's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2016 results. With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One's Head of Finance and Corporate Development; and Scott Blackley, Capital One\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott will walk you through this presentation this evening.

Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and for more information on these factors, please see the section titled forward-looking information in the earnings release presentation and the risk factors section in our annual and quarterly reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Fairbank. Rich. Richard Fairbank : Thanks Jeff and good evening everyone. I wanted to begin this evening by welcome Scott Blackley. In May, we announced that Steve Crawford was appointed to the role of Head of Finance and Corporate Development and that Scott was appointed to CFO reporting to Steve. This is Scott\u2019s first earnings call as a CFO, and he\u2019ll continue to be a key leader in our investor communications. Scott brings tremendous experience, expertise and insight to Capital One. He has been our controller since March 2011 and our principal accounting officer since July 2011. Prior to joining Capital One, Scott held various executive positions at Fannie Mae, and he has more than 20 years of experience in consulting and public accounting, including an appointment to the SEC as a professional accounting fellow and as a partner with KPMG. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott. Scott Blackley : Thanks Rich. I\u2019ll begin tonight with slide 3, Capital One earned 942 million or a $1.69 per share in the second quarter. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $1.76. Adjusting items in the quarter included a 54 million build in our UK payment protection insurance customer refund reserve which was partially offset by a gain on sale of our interest in Visa Europe of 24 million. A slight outlining adjusting items can be found on page 11 of the slide deck. Pre-provision earnings decreased 1% on a linked basis as higher revenues were offset by higher non-interest expenses. Provisions for credit losses increased 4% on a linked quarter basis, as modestly lower charge-offs were more than offset by a higher linked quarter allowance build. We have provided an allowance report by segment, which you can see on table 8 of our earnings supplement. Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our domestic card business, we built $290 million of allowance in the quarter. Two factors drove that increase, balanced growth in the quarter and our expectation of rising charge-offs associated with growth math. Our allowance covers 12 months of losses, so as we continue to move through 2016, we are picking up more of the loss increases that we\u2019re projecting in to 2017. And as we have been saying, based on the credit guidance we have today, we expect allowance build to continue. Allowance in our consumer banking segment increased 58 million in the quarter. This increase was attributable to our auto business, where we build allowance for new originations that included a higher portion of subprime and we expected auto auction prices will decline from current levels. Lastly, we had a net $50 million build in reserves in our commercial banking segment. We build allowance in the quarter to address increased risks in our taxi medallion lending business, particularly in Chicago, where we have around a $100 million portfolio and taxi medallion trading values decreased by about 60% in the quarter. In our oil and gas portfolio, our allowance for the quarter was essentially flat. But we released 57 million of reserves per unfunded commitments coming out of the spring redetermination process. Turning to slide 4, you can see that reported NIM decreased 2 basis points from the first quarter to 6.7%, primarily driven by lower yields on investment securities. Net interest margin increased 17 basis points year-over-year, fuelled by strong growth in our domestic card business. Turning to slide 5, I will discuss capital. Our 2016 CCAR results demonstrate our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. As previously announced, following the approval of our 2016 CCAR capital plan, our Board authorized repurchases of up to 2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.9%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis it was 10.8%, and we reduced our net share account by 8.6 million shares in the quarter. As we continue our parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches, we estimate our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remains above our 8% target. Given existing and likely changes coming in capital regulations, we no longer believe that advanced approaches will be our long term constraint. Accordingly, until we exit parallel run for advanced approaches, we plan to only report our standardized approach common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. Before I turn the call over to Rich, I want to call out that in the third quarter we expect a one-time rewards expense that will reduce net interchange income by approximately 45 million to 55 million. Our rewards liability has been measures on a slight lag to quarter end. In the third quarter, we expect to complete some system enhancements that will move their rewards liability cut-off to the last day of the quarter, resulting in a one-time increase in rewards costs in the third quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Richard Fairbank : Thanks Scott. I\u2019ll begin tonight on slide 7, with our domestic card business. Growth of loans and purchase volume remained strong, although growth decelerated modestly. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $9.6 billion or about 12%. Average loans were up $10.1 billion or about 13%. Second quarter purchase volume increased about 14% from the prior year. Competition is picking up across the domestic credit card market from the rewards space to subprime. Overtime this can have impact on the growth opportunity and even credit quality in the business. While we always watch vigilantly for these effects, we continue to find attractive growth opportunities in the parts of the market we\u2019ve been focusing on for some time. Revenue for the quarter increased 12% from the prior year quarter slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margins declined modestly with our exit of the back book of payment protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%. Non-interest expense increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter, with higher marketing and growth related operating expenses, as well as continuing digital investments. Net interchange revenue for the total company increased 9% from the prior quarter versus the 14% growth in domestic card purchase volume. As we\u2019ve discussed, there\u2019s considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these two metrics. For the past several years, on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below domestic card purchase volume growth. We\u2019d expect this difference to continue, as we originate new reward customers in our flagship products and extend rewards to existing customers. Additionally, a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks. These deals are putting pressure on interchange revenue and we expect the pressure to continue. As we\u2019ve discussed for several quarters, two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality, growth math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the second quarter of last year and seasonality drove the improvement in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter. Our guidance for domestic card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from growth math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rates to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. And while it\u2019s still 18 months in the future, based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low force with quarterly seasonal variability. Our domestic card business delivered strong growth in returns in the second quarter, and we really like the business we are booking. While we continue to closely watch the market place, we still see attractive growth opportunities in our domestic card business. Slide 8 summarizes second quarter results for the consumer banking business. Ending loans were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Growth at auto loans was offset by planned mortgage run-off. Ending deposits were up about $6 billion versus the prior year. Second quarter auto originations were $6.5 billion, about 20% higher compared to the second quarter of last year. Similar to our domestic card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business we\u2019re booking and continue to believe that the through-the-cycle economics of our auto business are attractive. Sustained success in the auto business requires active management of competitive cycles rather than aiming for arbitrary growth or market share targets. Immediately after the great recession, we had a unique opportunity in auto that we vigorously pursued. Gradually as competition intensified, some subprime players adopted more aggressive underwriting practices that we chose not to follow. As a result, our subprime origination stayed essentially flat for a few years before shrinking in 2015, despite growth in the subprime market. Our prime originations continue to grow during this period. In the first half of 2016, these competitive practices seemed to have subsided somewhat, which enabled us to grow our subprime originations. Even though we\u2019ve had two quarters of stronger growth, the auto market and competitive practices remain dynamic. While we opportunities for growth, we remain very vigilant about competitor practices. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient originations, and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-offs as the cycle plays out. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter decreased modestly from the second quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and planned run-off of mortgage balances. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 1% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing. As we mentioned last quarter, we\u2019ve been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In the second quarter, actual charges related to branch moves were about $35 million. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve recognized about 45 million of the $160 million in expected cost for 2016. These costs show up in the other category rather in the consumer bank segment. Second quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily driven by additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio which Scott described. For several quarters, we\u2019ve said, that we expect pressure on our consumer banking financial results. We expect the pressure to become more visible in consumer banking quarterly results in the second half of the year. In the home loans business, planned mortgage run-off continues. In auto finance, margins are decreasing and charge-offs are rising modestly, and our deposit business continues to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect that these factors will negatively affect consumer banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income, even as we continue to tightly manage costs. Moving to slide 9, I\u2019ll discuss our commercial banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances increased 29% year-over-year including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare Finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 13% over the same time period. Average loans increased 27% year-over-year while average deposits increased 3%. Revenue was up 17% from the second quarter of 2015. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $79 million from the prior year quarter to a $128 million, as we continued to build reserves. We\u2019ve been building reserves over the last six quarters to reflect increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans. Criticized and non-performing loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The commercial bank criticized loan rate was 5.3% in the second quarter comprised of the criticized performing loan rates of 3.7% and the criticized non-performing loan rate of 1.6%. We continue to focus on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the second quarter at $3.0 billion or about 1.3% of total company loans. Unfunded exposure decreased to $2.7 billion. We had a net release from the reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio, driven by reductions in our unfunded exposures following the spring redetermination process. But we still expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges. At quarter end, approximately $265 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8.9% of total oil and gas loans. Including unfunded reserves plus allowance, we held $310 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio. I\u2019ll close this evening with some thoughts on second quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another quarter of strong growth in domestic card loan balances and purchase volumes, as well as growth in auto and commercial loans, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. Non-interest expense increased modestly from the linked quarter, but second quarter non-interest expense remains below our expected run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons. Our businesses continue to grow, we expect about $115 million in branch optimization cost to impact the remainder of 2016, and we expect higher FDIC expenses in the second half of 2016. Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing. Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio, with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items. We plan to deliver efficiency improvement despite pressure from elevated branch optimization costs, higher FDIC expenses and recent deterioration in market expectations for interest rates. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage overtime, and we continue to tightly manage cost across our businesses. The 2016 CCAR process concluded in the quarter. The Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan, so we expect to maintain our dividend and repurchase $2.5 billion of stock over the next four quarters. Pulling up, we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval. Now Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff Norris : Thank you Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy there are other investors and analyst who may wish to ask a question. Please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the call, the Investor Relations team will be available. Please start the Q&A session Dede. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll start the question with Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions, one is on the reserve. Just wanted to understand when during the quarter do you make decision to do the reserve top up and this is something that\u2019s looking forward just on a four quarter basis or is this on a - more of a two year basis, an eight quarter basis. Scott Blackley : Besty its Scott, thanks for the question. Let me just reiterate that for our consumer facing businesses there\u2019s kind of three parts that impact the allowance. The first is that we take the outstand as of the end of the period, the second is that we look at our loss expectations for the next 12 months and then we also have qualitative factors to account for some of the non-modeled risks. In this quarter, we had $4 billion of growth, we increased the losses in our allowance window which is totally consistent with what we have been signaling in our guidance for rising charge-offs and of course as we every quarter we true-up qualitative factor. So those were really the factors, the same process that we do each quarter for the allowance. Betsy Graseck : Second question is just on the interchange that you talked about, pressure on the interchange coming from some specific deals that large merchants are doing with the network. And I think Rich you\u2019ve mentioned this on prior calls, just wanted to get a sense as to, is this an acceleration here and is it large enough for you to consider or think about changing how your rewards are structured. Scott Blackley : Betsy, it\u2019s the same phenomenon with pretty much the same merchants that I talked about in the past. So these are big merchants so therefore you\u2019ll see the effects on our metrics as this rolls through. Some of it is in there and some is rolling in to the numbers. But it will not necessitate a change in anything about our strategy of going after the rewards business and continue to believe in the growth opportunity in that business. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Rich, maybe if I could start off with a question on credit. We\u2019ve now had 13 months of double-digit loan growth in the US. You\u2019re reiterating the guidance on charge-offs for and low for us next year. You noted the impact of growth math will decelerate. So I\u2019m just trying to understand if let\u2019s just say loan growth were to remain steadier even decelerate from here. Given the way that the book seasons, how far out is it going to take for charge-offs to peak and then related to that when would you actually expect provisions from growth mix to actually peak. Richard Fairbank : Hey Ryan, Look I\u2019m reluctant to predict peak per say, we like to explain very much the mechanics of how things work. Growth math which on the way up and as growth is increasing, growth math works one way and then slowing growth in some ways works the other way. That would impact provision expenses directly by reducing the allowance build driven by loan growth. And overtime slower growth could also reduce the pace of growth math related to cards overall loss rate by accelerating the point at which the natural seasoning of older growth offsets the growth math effects of newer growth. But a lot depends really on the magnitude, and mix of the remaining growth. So, we are growing at a pretty rapid pace now, so even if the loan growth flows a bit from here, it is still quite a bit of growth relative to the highly seasoned back book. So you\u2019re right about the math, I\u2019m reluctant to pick a peak here because there are a lot of factors involved, but I think that everyone should understand the way growth math works and the way it works as growth accelerates and as growth is big and then it tends to be a good guy, as it works through on the other side. The growth math of a particular vintage has most of its impact over the two years following that, and then there is really a seasoning from there and so this is really just the net seasoning math of all the different vintages and the size of those. Ryan Nash : Got it. Maybe if I could just do one unrelated follow-up, Rich. Very healthy quarter for growth in auto, you said that you\u2019re still seeing some competitive pressures. Maybe can you just expand a little bit on those comments, what you\u2019re seeing competitively and one of the regional bank Huntington talked about the sensitivity to a fall-in in the Manheim. They said if the Manheim fell a 100 they would see charge-offs go from 20 to 30. Can you may be just talk quantitatively or qualitatively about how you would expect the sensitivity to charge-offs to a falling Manheim. Richard Fairbank : As credit people we are always worriers, right. And so we have - the auto business is a classic business that we really like the business, but we need to have our eyes very wide open about where we are in the credit cycle, which may or may not be the very same thing as in the economic cycle and we have to act accordingly. So at the top of our worry list is underwriting practices, because that not only affects volumes as we pull back, but it also can so quickly make its way in to credit quality and not only for those doing those practices, but it can ripple effects on the industry. So it\u2019s a top of our list, its concerns has been competitors practices, and we have lagged particularly in the subprime area some concern about that. That as I mentioned is actually looks like its mitigating somewhat, I don\u2019t want to declare victory on that, but that\u2019s a positive here and we\u2019ll keep an eye on that. The next thing is just the amount of supply out there, and from the amazingly low levels of supply a few years ago, this has been a very natural return to more and more supply in the industry and you can see every year there\u2019s a little bit more out there and more competition and that\u2019s why overtime margins have gone down, and so far we feel good that some of the most critical things like LTV have stayed, haven\u2019t gotten affected yet. A lot of pricing, a lot of the impact has been more on the pricing that affects margins. So that\u2019s kind of the competitive side of it, and then as we mentioned for quite a long time, we\u2019ve got to remember the collateral value side of this thing, and the fact that used car prices have been at record levels for a long time is certainly a matter concern and we said pretty much there\u2019s only one way for them to go from here. Interestingly if you look at the Manheim index, that is pretty flat, may be ticking down a little bit. We have our own recovery index on our own business and that has been actually declining really for the last couple of years. Interesting point, well why would our recovery index would be disconnected a little bit from the Manheim index? I think that\u2019s a little bit more about that our mix is a little different from Manheim\u2019s\u2019 mix. The Manheim mix has a higher proportion of larger vehicles, they have been increasing in price. Lately prices for smaller vehicles have been declining and on a relative basis we have more of a mix of smaller cars and fewer trucks basically than the Manheim index overall. So I think we see more of that effect than the industry does. But the main point is, the only way from here is down and we underwrite to an assumption that this thing is coming down right away. How it actually plays out, we\u2019ll have to see. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got any like scenario modeling quantitatively to share with you, but I think you\u2019re focusing on the right concerns in the business. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Rich, just to follow-up on Ryan\u2019s question, it sounded like some of the provision increase in auto had to do with some higher anticipated severity, but is there anything that you\u2019re seeing that caused you think that there\u2019s going to be a change in the frequency of default in auto. Richard Fairbank : No, I think that our outlook was frankly relative to last quarter probably a little more bullish, just more locally bullish about the auto business because of a little mitigation that\u2019s going on in the competitive environment of subprime. But I think the way to think about the auto business is that off of the once in a life time levels from some years ago, there\u2019s a gradual normalization that\u2019s very much kind of how the market works, and I think that we see that going on, but we don\u2019t see indicators that would suggest that there\u2019s some turn in the business and we talked about the used car issues we\u2019re keeping an eye on, but other than that I think more this is us worrying as oppose to reporting some real degradation in the business. Eric Wasserstrom : And if I can just follow-up on the optimization cost, can you just remind me what the full year figure is and where will we see come to the benefits of that manifested in the income statement? Richard Fairbank : When you say optimization you\u2019re talking about the branch restructuring cost? Eric Wasserstrom : Correct. Richard Fairbank : Well you\u2019ll see obviously the charges will be broken out in the other area, but they will be spread throughout the income statement, they\u2019ll obviously be recognized overtime. We\u2019ve already recognized about 40 million of the 160 million so that means we have another 80 to go in the second half. Scott Blackley : If you think about this quarter, a good portion of the total charges that ramp through our occupancy and equipment line item, which really reflected some accelerated depreciation and some additional cost associated with closures. Richard Fairbank : It\u2019s a 160 total, so 40 in the first half, the run rate will be up 80 versus the first half, so it will be about 120. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And next we have Rich Shane with J.P. Morgan. Rich Shane : I think in a lot of ways that the positive factor for Capital One over the next 18 months is going to be given the ramp up in car charge-offs the stabilization that you point to in 2017, what I\u2019m trying to understand is, and I think this sort of gets back to Ryan\u2019s question as well. Given that you are still in a high growth mode at least through the first half of 2016, why aren\u2019t we going to see the impact of growth math impact charge-offs in 2017. What gives you confidence that it\u2019s going to start to flatten out? Richard Fairbank : I want to be perfectly clear that the business we\u2019re booking this year absolutely impacts the 2017 numbers and growth math plays out over a multi-year period. So I want to be perfectly clear, we are continuing book a lot of business here and these vintages then have to work their way through and they tend to over the first couple of years reach their peak and then moderate from there. In fact you can see our guidance about 2017 charge-offs is higher than 2016. So I want to say that this how a growth math works. Rich Shane : I think you guys recognize the same thing in terms of how important that issue is, given that you provided guidance in terms of charge-offs for \u201917 a little bit earlier than you have in the past. Richard Fairbank : Absolutely Rich. The way we looked at it is that and why we stepped out of character a little bit to provide guidance farther out in to the future is that we were moving in to a period where two things were true, one is that we were growing at a pretty rapid rate and expected to do continue to do that, which is in fact turned out to be the case. And it comes off of just a - you probably won\u2019t see it again in your years of following this industry in terms of how seasoned and recession sort of survived the existing back book is. And so that impact of all of that let us to feel it was important to give a sense of where, with a lots of other things being equal growth math would take our credit. And along the way to explain to you how growth math works. But I want to pull up on this, I found over the many years in building Capital One, just about anything that\u2019s really value creating involves digging a hole before the benefits come. If it weren\u2019t that way, everybody would rush in and do it and actually would kill the opportunity. We have many years of experience in studying credit and understanding how value gets created overtime by origination. But the key is very solid underwriting, incredibly rigorous, what I call horizontal accountings that one understands the full vintage economics and how they perform overtime and then finally helping our investors along the way to understand what comes with that journey. But if we pull way up at this very time when there is credit losses are going up, allowances being built, we feel great about the business that we are booking. We\u2019re incredibly happy that we\u2019ve had the growth opportunity for the period of time that we have. We know competition is increasing, but we\u2019re still pretty bullish that we can get some continuing growth opportunities, and I think this can be a real value creator for our investors. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And next we have Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson. Arren Cyganovich : Rich, in your prepared remarks you talked about competition picking up in the domestic credit card market across all of the platforms that you work and reward subprime. And my question is more about you still finding opportunities in here, but you\u2019re also seeing this increasing competition. I\u2019m trying to balance the way that you\u2019re discussing this. It seems as though that it\u2019s becoming more difficult and maybe you\u2019re signaling that loan growth could slow a little bit from here. I\u2019m trying to understand what you\u2019re trying to tell us in that comment. Richard Fairbank : I think for those who know me, how I try to operate in this thing. It\u2019s less about signaling and more about just describing what we see and sharing with you what are the - so what\u2019s of that. So I start with, we are very bullish about our growth opportunity. It is factual matter that the growth rate is down over some of the highs of the last couple of quarters on a year-over-year basis, but we\u2019re continuing to have pretty significant and to us very attractive growth. But we are very obsessive about how competition works. So often people always talk about well what\u2019s the economy doing and how big is the opportunity. Number one on our list is, what is the nature of the competitive environment, and that of course in its most first order effect effects growth itself. So it is noteworthy that competition from rewards all the way down to subprime despite sometimes protestation of folks that they don\u2019t do subprime there is an increase and in fact the actual growth rate in subprime by our tally industry is actually higher than in prime. And you can see in the overall revolving debt numbers, growth is up. So all other things being equal, that increases the challenge with respect to our own growth rate. But again, we\u2019ve created some pretty unique opportunities and we like the value that we\u2019re offering customers and the customer experience and we feel good about that opportunity. The second thing and I made the same point last quarter and I make it so often is, what we\u2019re seeing here is a very natural part of how the competitive cycle works. But increased growth overtime tends to make its way into credit metrics in the industry as well. This is an industry where all of us share a lot of the same customers. So it is a natural part of the cycle that when you have sustained competition typically, we tend to see on a delayed basis that that makes its way in to industry credit metrics. And then the thing that even more worries and that we look for and we have not seen this is sort of the next stage in cycles do people actually start really compromising their underwriting standards and that becomes something that is kind of at the next level in how these cycles evolve. So we feel great about the opportunity, it\u2019s not lost on us as a competition has increased, and industry growth is up and we will watch incredibly vigilantly, we will continue to pursue this growth window because we are very focused on windows of opportunity. As a company, we believe in this window, we will continue to pursue it with our eyes wide open and that\u2019s kind of how we operate Capital One. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And next from KBW we\u2019ll here from Sanjay Sakhrani. Unidentified Analyst : I just wanted to touch back on the competition, is it due to existing players or are there new entrants that are coming in both the credit card and the auto side? Richard Fairbank : This competition, by the way there\u2019s not like some big thing that happened in the last quarter. This is a creeping increase in competition, it\u2019s primarily by the biggest players in the business who in fact definitionally dominate the business. So you\u2019ve seen some increased competition in the reward space, you\u2019ve seen some competitors strengthen some of their rewards proposition, value propositions. There\u2019s actually been people stepping up and announcing they are going to step up some of their marketing, and finally we can see it in just in some of the growth numbers across the segment. I would also point out that there is sort of pulling back beyond credit cards or auto for that matter. There continues to be growth in other forms of consumer credit like installment loans and student loans. So that\u2019s part of the supply equation as well, but this is something that we\u2019d give a continuing description about this phenomenon, because over time these things affect the business. But the main point I want to leave with you is in the card business and really in the auto business, we remain bullish about the opportunity and very bullish about the business that we have been able to generate. Unidentified Analyst : And then separately on the efficiency ratio side, how much leverage do you guys have in terms of for the next year. How should we think about that? Richard Fairbank : I don\u2019t know there\u2019s much to do beyond the guidance that we\u2019ve already given you. Is there something else that you\u2019d like to discuss just kind of as far as we\u2019ve been prepared to go? Unidentified Analyst : Yeah just wanted to quantify in terms of the continued improvement in 2017. Richard Fairbank : We are not going to go to the quantification, the guidance kind of is what we\u2019ve stated and it\u2019s been stated for a while, so it\u2019s going to be a function of a whole bunch of things, but that\u2019s a long way out going in to \u201917. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Chris Brendler : Can you talk at all the comments on interchange pressure, as I look at your net interchange stands about 15 basis points last two years? How much of that is increasing rewards expense and how much of the decline recently has been from this margin effect. My sense is most of it is higher rewards expense rather than some significant decrease in interchange rates? Thank you. Steve Crawford : Again I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get in to the main issue on line by line with each of these things and the factors that are driving our income statement. We\u2019re trying to give you a sense of the major things, but you\u2019d kind of heard our commentary on what the impacts are that\u2019s kind of probably where I\u2019d leave it. Chris Brendler : I guess ask a different way, if I look back historically net interchange used to be a 150 basis points maybe five-ten years ago and now we\u2019re down to 87. Is this the rate for the bottom or do you think it will stabilize at some point? Richard Fairbank : I think that the entire industry is - look there\u2019s competition both on the front-end kind of marketed products and what are the rewards that are being offered. And the other trend is very important one to point out is, the extension of more rewards deeper in to various competitors including our own customer base. So, I think that will play out for some time. I don\u2019t think this is a race down to zero. I really believe in the business and I think that we are incredibly bullish about the opportunity in this business and the long term economics in the business. I think we have wanted to point that over a multi-year period there is this migration that has gone on. Scott Blackley : And again just look at the rewards decline in a vacuum. The rewards that we\u2019ve provided to customers in terms of additional share of wallet have been very important to the business. So there are other things that contribute to the value of that relationship besides just what\u2019s happening in that rewards. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : I know that you don\u2019t think about the reserve as a percentage of loan in the credit card business. But it seems like there\u2019s a bit of disconnect, right, you\u2019ve given a lot of specific guidance that you\u2019ve actually been meeting on a monthly and quarterly basis in terms of the charge-offs and then there are those of us on this side that seems to be getting wrong of their reserve build. With what seems like relatively stability in the charge-offs right, you\u2019re talking about charge-offs that averaged a little more than 4% for the first half and you\u2019re saying pretty much that for the full year. So not a big change in the next couple of quarter and then low fours after that. So this doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s a big change in that. I understand that you\u2019ve got to provide for growth, but are we close to a point where we should be seeing that reserve to loans being relatively stable? Scott Blackley : Hey Moshe its Scott. I think that using coverage rates is a tough thing for our business because we do have a lot of seasonal activity as you know. And so you know as sounds fluctuate that those coverage ratios can send false signals. I think I would say that as we told you we expect losses increase 2016 to 2017, and that means that the rate of allowance growth in those periods is going to be more than the loan growth all else being equal. And as Rich mentioned, there is going to be a point where you start to see the growth math effects moderate and at that time we would expect that relationship to change, but we do expect that we\u2019re going to continue to see fluctuations in the allowance quarter-to-quarter. I really to appreciate that modeling that thing is tough. And I\u2019m going to just give you a very blunt hypothetical example, a 10 basis points move in loss rate which can easily happen, not be anything more than noise can trigger a 90 million allowance change. So there\u2019s nothing that I would point to and I definitely believe that the most important thing for you to look at in terms of where think credits\u2019 going and what\u2019s driving our allowances as well as the guidance that we\u2019ve already provided. Moshe Orenbuch : Scott we\u2019re not trying combative here, but the problem is if you\u2019re telling us that the guidance is the same, that\u2019s where we are struggling, because if the guidance is the same and we\u2019ve seen the additions over the last five quarters, what is different? Is it just that --. Steve Crawford : We didn\u2019t provide you guidance on allowance still. Moshe Orenbuch : Understood. Steve Crawford : So that\u2019s not something that we\u2019re prepared to do. What we can tell you is what drives allowance, growth in our portfolio, change in credit card charge-offs insight in to, and then Scott provided a very real example, a 10 basis points change which is not very much which is one-third of the reserve build we had this quarter. So you\u2019re not difficult to totally understand the genesis of the question, but over the last 18 months as we knew that this was going to be a real consideration and we really deliberately tried to talk about the three or four factors that drive our allowance. And actually as Rich said earlier, despite the discomfort, stepped out and went even further trying to predict loss rates in 2017, just to give people a sense as to the fact that there weren\u2019t surprises here. We really like the growth we\u2019re having, but think about it as a capital investment in growth. It\u2019s something that we believe is going to lead to real economic value creation. Moshe Orenbuch : Or maybe this will be one of the advantages of [CCAR]. Operator : Our next question is from James Fotheringham with the Bank of Montreal James Fotheringham : So if growth math works both ways, just roughly, how meaningful a deceleration in loan growth from the current level hypothetically would be required to affect a change in provision say with a two year view all else being equal. And I\u2019m not looking for precision here, but roughly do you need hundreds of basis points in deceleration to affect the change, and is the relationship on the way down linear or is it more of a step change. Thanks. Scott Blackley : The fact that we\u2019re having deceleration in growth if you go back to I think Scotts excellent explanation. If we just lower growth next quarter, by definition we are going to have a lower allowance build for that growth. And then if you have lower new originations than you have a higher percentage of the back book relative to the front book comparing to what you otherwise would have. So that and that in some degree will drive down the allowance filled. But that\u2019s all else equal as well, so I don\u2019t know that we can go a lot further than that and give you some intuition about the way that this is going to unfold. Richard Fairbank : I don\u2019t think people should expect that if the very high growth rate we\u2019ve been going on turns in to a pretty high growth rate that you\u2019re going to see some big sea change here. This is still - we are origination at - these are a lot of originations and as a percentage relative to the back book which is great news for value creation a bigger and bigger percentage of our book has actually been recently originated. So growth math will be with us in terms of the - how losses go up. That\u2019s going to be with us through - that\u2019s not going to suddenly turnaround. But I think what I like so much about this is coiled spring of economic value for which we are paying upfront through higher, through allowance build and a loss curve that is front loaded. That coils the spring of value creation. In a business and in an industry that doesn\u2019t have that many of those kinds of opportunities and this is in many ways really the pay-off for the information based strategy where we invested for years. And I\u2019d also point out too that we\u2019re a company that while a lot of companies look around and say what\u2019s the next thing we can buy. We are a company that is designed to as in origination based company, where can we really massively test and find growth opportunities that really pay-off in the long term and work with our investors to understand the journey of how the performance actually plays out. But the pay-off is not going to come in the near-term by credit losses turning around and going down. Over the longer term each vintage will peak and actually go down and there\u2019s a continuing dividend that will be paid over time. But right now this is the period of rising losses and growth math on the way up. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Thank you gentlemen. Our last question of the day will be from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Matt Burnell : Just a couple of administrative questions first, the release of the unfunded commitments in the oil and gas portfolio, where did that run through the income statement? Was that in operating expenses? Scott Blackley : Matt this is Scott. The release actually runs through as part of our provision expense. Matt Burnell : And then the FDIC insurance assessments, have you quantified the size of those? Steve Crawford : Yeah, that will be about 20 million a quarter starting in the third quarter. Matt Burnell : And then just on the taxi medallion portfolio, I appreciate it\u2019s not huge, it\u2019s than a $1 billion obviously. But do you have any color as to how you\u2019re thinking that will continue to perform, are there other cities where you\u2019re concerned about a meaningful drop in valuation similar to what you saw in Chicago? Richard Fairbank : Matt let me start and other can pile in. So first of all, if you look at the allowance build in this quarter, I mentioned that we have 100 million in Chicago and we did observe in that market a pretty steep decline in prices of traded taxi medallion. So that\u2019s principally what\u2019s going on in that market. The other market that we have our principal exposure to its in New York, which is a different market. I think we\u2019ve talked about that in markets where it\u2019s a hail market, prices are seemed to be more stable, and so I don\u2019t want to give you too much confidence about where we see things move in to New York. But definitely our level of concern about Chicago is much higher than what we would say in the New York market place, it\u2019s just a different mix and small right now. Jeff Norris : Well thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call today, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember if you have further questions, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to try and answer them. Have a great evening everybody. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for joining.",

And with that, I'll turn the calling over to Mr. Fairbank. Rich? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin tonight on slide four with our Domestic Card business. Loan growth and purchase volume growth remained strong. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $8.8 billion or about 11%. Average loans were up $9.4 billion, or about 12%. Third quarter purchase volume increased about 12% from the prior year. We continue to like the return and resilience profile of the business we're booking. In the quarter, we also announced that we entered into an agreement for a new partnership with Cabela's, and the acquisition of Cabela's co-branded card portfolio, which has roughly $5.2 billion in outstandings. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Cabela's is a great retailer with a powerful brand and highly engaged and loyal customers. Revenue for the quarter increased 8% from the prior year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth. Even with the positive margin impacts of higher subprime mix, revenue margin declined year-over-year as expected, with our exit of the back book of payment protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the third quarter was 16.6%. Non-interest expense increased 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to gain scale and improve efficiency. Net interchange revenue for the total company grew 9% from the prior year quarter versus the 12% growth in Domestic Card purchase volume. As we've discussed, there's considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these two metrics. For the past several years on an annual basis, net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth. We'd expect this difference to continue as we originate new rewards customers in our flagship products and extend rewards to existing customers. Additionally, a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks. These deals are putting pressure on interchange revenue and we expect the pressure to continue. As we've discussed for several quarters, the dominant driver of year-over-year charge-off rate trends is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances in our front book season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book. Growth math began to impact charge-off rates in 2015. We still expect the peak impact of growth math in terms of its contribution to year-over-year change in our loss rate to be in 2016 with a diminishing effect in 2017 and only a modest effect beyond that. In the third quarter, growth math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the prior year and seasonality drove the improvement in charge-off rates compared to the linked quarter. Looking ahead, two effects are together moderately impacting our charge-off outlooks since last quarter. One effect is better than expected growth, especially in subprime. While we are growing nicely everywhere we are investing, we are seeing particular success in subprime, which has raised the mix modestly. Our proportion of loans below FICO 660 has grown from 35% one quarter ago to 36% at the end of the third quarter. Subprime has higher losses than average and they're also more front-loaded, so it tends to have a pretty immediate impact on our near-term credit metrics. Beyond the growth and mix effect, we have revised slightly upward our front book loss expectations for 2017 and slightly downward our front book loss expectations for 2018 based on the composite performance and projections for hundreds of credit programs. These effects together lead us to raise our full-year 2017 charge-off guidance from the low 4s to the mid 4s, with normal seasonal variability and excluding the modest benefit we expect from adding the Cabela's portfolio. With nine months of actual results in the books, we expect 2016 full-year charge-off rate will be around 4.15%. We expect the changes in guidance to largely play out over the next three or four quarters, so the expected impact of higher charge-offs is mostly captured in our current allowance. While we are modestly raising our loss outlook for 2017, our internal view of 2018 losses is unchanged with slightly improved expectations for front book performance offsetting higher subprime mix. Pulling up, the higher growth in subprime mix are also driving up our revenues and pre-provision earnings. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business, but it's clear this opportunity won't last forever. The marketplace is moving and competitive intensity across the Card business remains high; and revolving credit growth is now 6% year-over-year. We will continue to monitor the marketplace vigilantly. But in the meantime, we continue to like the opportunities that we see. Slide five summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 2% compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about $8 billion or 5% versus the prior year. Third quarter auto originations were $6.8 billion, about 22% higher compared to the third quarter of last year, with strong growth in prime, near-prime, and subprime. Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we liked the earnings profile and resilience of the Auto business we're booking and continue to believe that the through-the-cycle economics of our Auto business are attractive. The auto market and competitor practices remain dynamic. While we see opportunities for growth, we remain very vigilant about competitor practices. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient originations, and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-offs as the cycle plays out. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased about 3% from the third quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was partially offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of mortgage balances. Non-interest expense for the quarter also increased 3% compared to the prior-year quarter driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we've been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital. In the third quarter, actual changes related to branch moves were about $60 million. Year-to-date, we've recognized about $106 million of the $160 million in expected costs for 2016. We expect branch optimization costs to continue in 2017. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the Consumer Banking segment. Third quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily as the result of charge-offs and additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio. Growth in auto loans, the expectation of gradually rising auto charge-off rates and the expectation of declining used vehicle values drove the trend in consumer bank provision for credit losses. For several quarters, we've said that we expect pressure on our Consumer Banking financial results. In the home loans business, planned mortgage runoff continues. In auto finance, margins are decreasing and charge-offs are rising modestly. And our deposit businesses continue to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect that these factors will negatively affect Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income even as we continue to tightly manage costs. Moving to slide six, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances increased 28% year-over-year, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare Finance business. Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE, ending loans grew about 12% over the same time period. Average loans increased 28% year-over-year, while average deposits increased 2%. Revenue was up 27% from the third quarter of 2015. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on slides 14 and 15. For the total Commercial Banking business, third quarter charge-offs were $108 million, primarily driven by charge-offs of Chicago taxi medallion loans and to a lesser extent, oil and gas loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 66 basis points. We added to reserves for some third quarter weakness in New York City taxi medallion values, but the reserve additions only partially offset the charge-offs flowing out of reserves, resulting in a net reserve release in the quarter. Combining both charge-offs and reserve changes, provision for credit losses declined $14 million from the prior year quarter to $61 million. Criticized and nonperforming loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 1.5%. Now I'll pass the call over to Scott. R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Rich. I'll begin on slide seven. Capital One earned $1 billion or $1.90 a share in the third quarter. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share was $2.03. Adjusting items in the quarter included a $63 million build in our UK Payment Protection Insurance customer refund reserve, of which $47 million was an offset to revenue and $16 million was captured in operating expense. A slide outlining adjusting items can be found on page 12 of the slide deck. Pre-provision earnings increased modestly on a linked quarter basis as higher revenues were only partially offset by higher noninterest expenses. As I highlighted last quarter, we had a one-time rewards expense that reduced net interchange income by $38 million, driven by the completion of some system enhancements that moved our rewards liability cutoff to the last day of the quarter. Provision for credit losses was flat on a linked quarter basis as higher charge-offs were almost entirely offset by a lower linked quarter allowance build. An allowance roll-forward by segment can be found on table eight of our earnings supplement. Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across businesses in the quarter. In our Domestic Card business, we built $349 million of allowance. This build was driven by growth and subprime mix in the quarter and incorporating our charge-off expectations for the next 12 months into our allowance calculation. In our Consumer Banking segment, allowance increased $31 million in the quarter, almost entirely driven by growth in our Auto business. In our Commercial Banking segment, we had a $48 million reduction in reserves, driven by charge-offs in our taxi medallion portfolio. Recent reserve movements have focused on taxi and our oil and gas portfolios, and we have provided details for those portfolios on slide 14 and 15 of the appendix of tonight's slide deck. Turning to slide nine, you can see that reported net interest margin increased 6 basis points from the second quarter to 6.79%. That was primarily driven by day count. NIM also increased 6 basis point year-over-year, which was fueled by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. Turning to slide 10, I'll discuss capital. As previously announced following the approval of our 2016 CCAR capital plan, our board authorized repurchases of up to $2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. In the quarter, we accelerated the pace of our buybacks and repurchased 17 million shares, or $1.2 billion of our authorization. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.6%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.5%. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rich. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: I'll close tonight with some thoughts on third quarter results and our outlook as we head into 2017. We posted another strong quarter of growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes, as well as growth in auto and commercial loans, driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense and allowance for loan losses. We've been working hard to improve efficiency by growing revenues, realizing analog cost-savings and other efficiency gains as we become a more digital company, and tightly managing costs across the enterprise. Our efforts are paying off. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 52%. Excluding the impacts of UK PPI, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 51.4% for the third quarter and 51.8% year-to-date. It's clear that we're on track to deliver much more than our prior guidance of some improvement in our full-year 2016 efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items. Even with the expected significant seasonal increase in non-interest expenses in the fourth quarter, we now expect that our full year 2016 efficiency ratio will be substantially lower than full-year 2015. In 2016 we are already on pace to deliver the efficiency ratio improvement we had expected to achieve in 2017, primarily driven by enhanced revenues and concerted efforts to drive out analog costs. From this more efficient starting point, we expect that our near-term annual efficiency ratio, excluding adjusting items and the expected impact of Cabela's will be in the 52%s, plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that we should be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains. Pulling up, our strong growth over the last two years puts us in a position to deliver solid EPS growth in 2017 assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycles. We expect that revenue will grow and will drive growth in pre-provision earnings as well. We expect the upward pressure from growth math on the allowance for loan losses will begin to moderate, and we're reducing share count. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder return driven by growth and sustained returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval. And now, Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Unverified Participant : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself as usual to one question, plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Kevin, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operation Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good evening, guys. So, Rich, thanks for the update on the credit guidance. Can you maybe just flush out a couple of those comments for us; and in particular, what it means for the allowance? You talked about higher charge-offs, but that largely being in your allowance already. So I guess just one, what is driving the changes in the back book expectations for 2017 and 2018, and is that just mix? And you noted that you still think that you're on track to deliver solid 2017 EPS growth. You referred to it as a coiled spring. Do you still think that's achievable given your expectations for slightly higher charge-offs? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Okay. Ryan, there's a bunch of great questions that you have. I think, Scott, you can take the allowance thing. So, first of all, when you said it's \u2013 tell me about your change in back book expectations. We don't really have any change in back book expectations. The change in expectations that we're talking about is driven by two factors, okay, and a key part of this point is that better than expected growth, especially in subprime is a key part of our revised guidance. And as for our front book loss expectations, we revised them up... Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, sorry. Rich, I meant front book. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, exactly. So, and as our front book loss expectations kind beyond \u2013 in other words, beyond the effect of the growth in mix, so I'm trying to de-average all these effects. There's a slight upward revision that we made in the quarter for 2017 and a slight downward revision in 2018. And that's driven by a composite of like many multiple vintages across like hundreds of lending programs. And just give you just a little bit more granularity behind this, if you compile them all and pull way up over the patterns that we see, 2015 programs are coming in with slightly higher losses than 2014 programs. And now, 2016 programs are coming in a little bit better than 2015 programs. And so, the higher 2015 origination losses make their way into the late 2016 and 2017 numbers, the lower 2016 origination losses make their way into the later 2017 and 2018 numbers. Now these are all very modest effect is the most important point I want to leave with you. The other thing is our view of the value creation from our lending programs is not only bullish and high, just to put it in perspective, this thing we're calling the front book, which is, basically, everything that \u2013 all the growth we've had since the higher growth began. So we're talking about 2014, 2015, 2016. Our view of the value creation for that is that the high end of anything we booked in the last 15 years. So, back to your question about, how we feel about the earnings potential in the business, what you actually have is a Card business, if you kind of pull up on a yearly basis, that has maintained pretty flattish earnings and strong earnings power, while absorbing a whopping increase in, especially front-loaded credit costs, that come in the form of originations that are : A, higher than the back book; B, that have their losses more front loaded; and C, of course, it flows right through allowance. And so this brings a lot of pressure right upfront when we grow at the kind of trajectory that we're talking about. Hopefully, you can see when you look at the numbers and do the math on what we are booking here, this is a coiled spring of a lot of earnings power, and we're \u2013 and that's why we continue to work hard to originate and grow what we can very prudently during this window of opportunity. Scott, why don't you comment about the allowance part of this question? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah. Yeah. Ryan, let me spend a minute and just kind of walk through some of the puts and takes in the allowance. So, one way to look at the build is to start off by taking the coverage ratio from last quarter and applying it to the change in ending balances. That really ignores the effects of growth and subprime mix that are impacting the loss rate, but you can see that if you kind of start with that static coverage ratio and apply it to the change in balances, that's going to explain roughly a third of the build. Be mindful that when you get to Q4 if you're going to try to do that calculation, you need to adjust for seasonal balances. So just keep that in mind. Now the rest of the build is really associated with the loss rate and kind of the mechanics of doing the calculation of the allowance. Rich just walked through in detail the drivers of our updated charge-off guidance, growth in mix, and performance. So most of that guidance change happened during periods that are included in our Q3 allowance. And so we captured those as part of our updated allowance calculation this quarter. In addition to that, the mechanical effect of the quarter swap, which is moving forward the loss forecast one quarter, results in us dropping off Q3 2016 and adding Q3 2017 to the allowance calculation. Our forecast, as you know and as we've been saying, is for losses to be higher in 2017 versus 2016, so that change in quarters, all things equal, adds to the allowance calculation. And on top of that, we always have qualitative factors which are for risks that are outside of the models. So just kind of pulling up, though, looking ahead, I want to give you kind of some of the building blocks as you think about how you can calculate the estimates of the allowance movements in 2017. So we told you a couple of key things. One, we told you that what the full year loss rate for 2017 is expected to be. We told you that the increase in our loss guidance has already been captured in the current allowance. And we've told you that we expect the impact of growth math is diminishing in 2017 and only has a modest effect beyond that. So all of those factors, I think, collectively give you a good base to start kind of building up what your loss expectation is going to be in your 2017 allowance. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking my questions. I'll step aside so others can ask questions. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Ryan. Next question, please. Operator : Next with Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Go ahead, please. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thank you for taking my question and thanks for that very detailed explanation about the ALL (27:47) outlook. If I could just maybe follow up, Rich, on the commentary about the coiled spring, which Ryan also referred to. I mean, should we expect 2017 net income given the factors that you've just highlighted to be above the 2016? And I guess the issue I'm really getting to is we're seeing this outstanding growth at incredible marketing efficiency, and yet we're seeing ROE decline despite the impacts of the share repurchase. So I'm just trying to understand kind of what we're looking for in terms of secular profitability? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: So, Eric, I don't want to go beyond the forward-looking statements that we made in the prepared remarks. But I think the key way to look at this, again, is a pretty dramatic growth for several years on the order of what we're talking about puts a lot of pressure on the P&L of the Card business, and it has been absorbing that. Now meanwhile and I always used this term of a coiled spring, I think it's a great metaphor, but meanwhile when we look at the value of what we're retaining here, we're very bullish and that's why we're growing at the rate that we are. But I think all I would say is, again, just think through the mechanics of kind of the timing of how this plays out. You start with a lot of growth, which has more cost but especially, most importantly, impacts the credit metrics and especially goes right through the allowance line. So how the earnings power shows up, the line item where the earnings power will really start to hit that inflection point is really as allowance builds start to mitigate. And that, of course, happens right at the time when looking ahead, the growth math effects are also starting to really settle out. And our point is we are approaching that period in this dramatic period of growth in the Card business, and I think that's why we're not giving specific guidance on earnings power. We're just saying that we should start seeing earnings power play out over time as this \u2013 the growth math does its very predictable things. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay, thanks that's very helpful. Thanks very much. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : Your next question, Don Fandetti with Citi. Go ahead. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Rich or Steve, I guess, I wanted to clarify, it sounds like you said that the 2016 vintage is coming in better than the 2015, and 2015 worse than 2014, which makes sense. I mean, it just seems \u2013 can you talk a little about how 2016 could possibly be coming in better, and why that might be the case? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Right. There's many, many ways we look at that, but starting with mechanically, the actual vintages themselves and the very early credit metrics, things like delinquencies on those vintages. Additionally, Don, we also just look at the mix of what are the metrics, things like credit scores and so on of the business that we're booking, what is that blended distribution. And all of the key indicators we look at, and this matches our own intuition about what's going on as well, show a positive impact for 2016 versus 2015. Now I want to make it very clear, 2015 is going to be a very successful year and very profitable and with very good long-term credit performance. We're talking about small changes relative to expectations as we revise \u2013 as we always do every quarter, our own credit outlook. We're just kind of painstakingly trying to break down the components so you get a better understanding of this. But we feel great about 2014 front book. We feel great about 2015 front book. 2016, all the early indicators of 2016 suggest that from a credit point of view, it's going to come in a little bit better than 2015. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's real helpful. And then just quickly, you've been pretty active in subprime cards. Do you expect the other banks to sort of reach down? You saw JPMorgan talk a little bit about it as early as Q2. Can you talk about competition in that segment? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah. It's a striking thing. We've talked a lot about industry growth, and we talk often about industry growth has gone from very low single-digits or even occasionally negative a couple of years ago to 6% and that has our attention. But here's another stat that's an interesting one. If you look at the composition of the industry's growth over the last 12 months, about \u2013 and I'm going to just exclude Capital One from the whole calculation because your question is an industry effect there, about 31% of the growth is in subprime. And so subprime growth has certainly picked up now, it's growing faster than prime, and certainly that has our attention. Now I do want to say, on the other hand, it remains well below pre-recession levels in absolute terms because there was such an exodus from that part of the business over the years following the Great Recession. So, at times I think you hear from some players, subprime we don't do that. Well, all I'm saying is 31% of all the growth is subprime, and somebody is doing it. And so, yeah, that has our attention. And it's part of \u2013 it's one \u2013 it's an important part of the overall \u2013 if you kind of look at the industry story and this, by the way, is the number one thing that we worry about, more so than like the next recession; obviously, we worry about things like that, too. But the industry growth being at 6% and the subprime component of that, and then also the, beyond card growth when you look at student lending, auto lending, installment lending, that's been running for a while now at around 7%. So we're pretty obsessive about these things. It causes us to believe, first of all, that we have a window, and it's just another reason we've doubled down and gone really hard while we have this window. It means we have to be doubly and triply obsessive about looking for indicators of things that inevitably happen when supply goes up a lot, and those indicators can be broad-based impact on credit metrics, as well as, of course, just directly affecting response rates and things like that. So we're on the lookout and as we kind of always do for our investors, try to raise these flags. But we feel very good about what we're booking. We like the resilience of what we're booking, and we still are moving forward with resolve to continue to capitalize on these opportunities. But there's no doubt the industry growth data is just one more reason to remind ourselves that everything is a window of opportunity and we have to carefully watch the industry from here. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And we go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning or good afternoon. It feels like morning here. I'm just wondering on Cabela's, maybe you could give us a little bit of some color around how you expect it's going to be impacting various line items in the business overall? Any investment spend that you need to do to prepare for it? And if there's any of what you expect Cabela's to do to your numbers in the commentary that you gave on the outlook for 2017? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Hey, Betsy. This is Scott. In terms of our guidance, so all of the guidance that we gave is excluding Cabela's. We haven't yet finalized all of our projections in terms of impact for Cabela's. We think it's a fantastic partner. We're extremely excited to have won that business. It's a powerful brand. Incredibly loyal and engaged customers. So we're pretty thrilled about that. We're still working on all the details of the closing of that transaction, so don't have more information about that at this point. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just separately, follow up on the vintage discussion that we just had. Just wondering, I know you mentioned that 2016's seasoning better than 2015. Are we talking about the first quarter of 2016? Just wanted to get a sense as to how long you think it takes for things to season and why the trajectory so soon into the 2016 cycle is looking better? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, I mean, this is all something that with every passing month gives you a little bit more clarity. And that's why on all of this stuff we triangulate from just the literal vintage analysis but we already looking at all the vintages of 2016, can see a gap relative to early vintage reads versus 2015 and in the same way that 2015 had a gap relative to 2014. But again, there are \u2013 it is a triangulation, or it's reinforced by just kind of watching the underlying dynamics of what \u2013 of even the mix within the mix of all of the programs and looking at the distributions of who's applying and it's something that's composite across hundreds of programs, but all of the signs are consistent with us that there is this \u2013 all of this we're talking about is modest effect. But enough that I \u2013 it was worth mentioning that 2016 is a positive relative to 2015. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : Go next to Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson. Go ahead, please. Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. I guess, relative to the window of opportunity you still see in Domestic Card in thinking about how much the subprime has grown, do you still expect to see that higher take-up rate on the subprime? Or do you have any kind of expectations for limiting that at some point if it grows too large relative to the other piece of the portfolio? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Arren, one thing we've kind of been featuring subprime here. I don't want to diminish the really good momentum that we have in pretty much all of the parts of the Card business that we're investing in. And we're pretty bullish about our growth opportunity in all of the areas. We've had more recently kind of a surge on the subprime side, and \u2013 but who knows, I \u2013 I don't want to project what will happen to mix on a relative basis. I think we like all of the things we're booking. I think we have reasons to believe we can continue to grow in all of the areas, but it was worth highlighting, though, that the kind of recent surge that we've had on the subprime side. But I wouldn't extrapolate to that to some significant continuation of that surge. Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, thanks. And then just secondly, wondering if you had any updates on Capital One 360 Caf\u00e9s that you've been testing in different markets. If it's too soon for anything you can share from the impacts of putting those stores into various cities? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, the Capital One Caf\u00e9s just tended to pull way up. As you know, we're a national company in just about everything we do, except we are local in really only 20% of the nation in retail banking. And so, Capital One Caf\u00e9s are kind of the manifestation of how we're re-imagining the future of banking and also how we can kind of enhance the national banking presence we already have through our old ING book that, of course, we call Capital One 360 now. The key thing there is it's not about putting a branch on every corner; far from it. It is about building kind of, if you will, flagship stores in key metropolitan areas and using that as, in many ways, a manifestation of banking re-imagined relative to the very traditional way that banking has been done for forever, basically. So we have been gradually expanding our footprint in the caf\u00e9s. We've been very pleased with the early results from the caf\u00e9s and we are \u2013 what we see is reinforces our view that this will \u2013 this is a good thing to continue to build out on a very thin basis, distribution in major metropolitan areas with these caf\u00e9s. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Arren. Next question, please. Operator : Next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Go ahead, please. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all of the detail you've provided on the credit card side of things in terms of your expectation for losses. The question I frequently get from investors is your outlook for the auto portfolio given that that's also growing at a relatively healthy pace. Can you give us a sense as to \u2013 and maybe a similar way of thinking about losses and originations in 2016 versus 2015, and what your thoughts are in terms of forward-looking losses for the auto portfolio? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: So thanks, Matt. I'm not going to give you specific like numerical guidance about the Auto business, but let me just pull way up about auto. As we've talked about \u2013 first of all, we really like the Auto business. I think it plays to Capital One's strengths, and we built a very strong and kind of leading presence in that space. The Auto business after the Great Recession was something that I don't think we'll see again in our lifetime in terms of unique opportunity to grow and create value with high margins and exceptional credit quality because so many players had headed for the hills and consumers were, gosh, they were even at times walking away from their houses and still paying on their cars. And used car prices were just at incredible highs. So much of our commentary about auto has been predicting, saying it's got to be that this thing will normalize over time, and the journey since then has really been one of normalization where pretty much every year the margins are going down, every year credit losses have kind of gone up. Now in Capital One's case is \u2013 two things I want to say. Anything that we \u2013 we've also had a mix change going on within Capital One over the last few years that has been more market growth and so that has tended to dampen this effect. But let me also say, really, if you stack vintage after vintage year after year in auto, they have been, the last few years, going up year over year, but the overall thing that we've seen is we've been \u2013 surprised is probably an overstatement, but I think we have kind of predicted something, a more rapid normalization than we've actually seen. All of that said, I think the Auto business is still in a good place for us to generate profitable business. But it is mostly kind of normalized, and it has a number of things going on in the industry that cause us to be very vigilant, most importantly, kind of underwriting practices there. But I would say really over the last few years, the actual credit performance has been strikingly good and maybe even a little better than expected. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please? Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Oh, I'm sorry, Matt. You have a follow-up? Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Just to follow up on the \u2013 if I can for Scott on the buyback. If I take the average price of Capital One shares over the course of the third quarter, that was about $68.68 versus the 17 million shares you said you repurchased, is a little less than $1.2 billion in buybacks versus the $2.5 billion announced buyback program for the four quarters of the capital planning cycle. Can you give us a sense, Scott, as to how you all are thinking about the buybacks for the next three quarters? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, you can see that we've \u2013 this wouldn't be a ratable use of the buyback. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. Stephen S. Crawford - Capital One Financial Corp.: So I think that's the one thing that we point out. And obviously, we're trying to be opportunistic and look at the market and use the authorization that we have within CCAR in the way that we feel is most productive. And that's really what has led to the acceleration year-to-date in the total amount of repurchases we have authorized for the year. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : (48:54) Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Next \u2013 oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just to finish that thought. So looking forward, Steve, should we think about acceleration over the \u2013 relative to a ratable buyback over the next three quarters? Stephen S. Crawford - Capital One Financial Corp.: Again, we don't have a tremendous amount of flexibility as it is with our repurchase authorizations, so I don't think I'm going to get more specific. Obviously, we have the limitation in CCAR that we can only do the amount authorized for the year. And it's really just a function of looking at the marketplace and where we are and how quickly we want to use that authorization. But I think we've demonstrated that it \u2013 you shouldn't count on it always being ratable going forward. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Next question, please? Operator : Go next to Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Go ahead, please. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to first ask on \u2013 really on the efficiency of your marketing. We saw marketing spend go down 6% quarter on quarter. I know it will bounce around a bit. But with your Domestic Card growth in the double digits, it looks like you're being very efficient with that spend. I'm just wondering if you've cracked the code to higher efficiency or if there's something sort of temporary going on with the lower spending on marketing. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, on marketing, I wouldn't put any particular emphasis on what you see in the third quarter. As you know, the fourth quarter is seasonally, by quite a bit, our highest quarter and there are reasons for that, of course. And turn on a television, you probably can see that because we're sponsoring bowl games and the ESPN bowl week. And there's a lot of things that we line up seasonally in terms of our marketing blitz in the fourth quarter. The other thing I want to say about marketing is that while I think on a just kind of pulling way up calibrated across the years, I think marketing efficiency's at a pretty high level right now. It's maybe a commentary on our marketing, but probably as much a commentary about the window of opportunity we have to grow and the success of that. One thing is very clear : competitors have stepped up their marketing. Competitors are stepping up their advertising. Competitors are working \u2013 in a number of cases they have, in fact, sort of duplicated some of the Capital One products themselves. This game will require a pretty high level of marketing. And that's probably the case even as the growth opportunity wanes a little bit just because it's the nature of how this competition works. So, we feel great about our marketing, but to continue to succeed it's going to take a fair amount of marketing. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : And then just shifting to the oil and gas, your held for investment portfolio decreased quarter on quarter, but unfunded exposure increased only by $100 million or so and mostly in midstream, is that just a reflection of confidence in that portion of the oil and gas portfolio? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, this is Scott. I think that if \u2013 when you look at that portfolio, we obviously see some opportunities in midstream. We think that there's been a lot of rationalization that's happened in the E&P sector as well. And then in oilfield services, that's probably the area where we continue to see risk, those are companies that are still struggling with kind of the effects of reduction in capital spending. So that is an area where in midstream we are seeing some selected opportunities and taking advantage of those. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Chris. Next question, please. Operator : We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. I guess I have another question on the loan loss reserving from here on out. Scott, maybe you could just go through it a little bit more, I want to paraphrase a little bit of what you said. It seems like you probably have one more quarter of pressure in terms of build because you're lapping a tougher quarter and taking out an easier one, but thereafter, you're kind of going to grow the provision in line with loan growth. Is that a fair assumption to make? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, thanks for the question. And just to kind of go back. So what we've told you is that we expect losses are going to grow into 2017. We haven't given you any kind of specific quarterly guidance, so I'm not going to go into kind of the \u2013 how you might calculate the quarterly swap. But I do think you've got kind of the right thread, which is that we do expect the impact of growth map be diminishing in 2017 and with a modest effect beyond that. That's going to meaningfully impact kind of the way the allowance works out as we get into 2017. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And I guess a follow-up question for Rich, just on Cabela's, you've talked about how these large deals are pretty aggressively priced historically. I mean, what was \u2013 what kind of struck you with Cabela's that it made it quite worthwhile for you to go for it? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, I've been pretty vocal about the nature of the auction environment and how easy it is for companies to get caught up in the frenzy of this kind of bidding. What we have said is on a selective and disciplined basis, we really do want to grow the partnership business. We want to grow this business where we can find partners that have attractive, loyal and growing customer bases, compelling value proposition, and who want \u2013 who their view of what they're trying to achieve through a partnership is, in fact, very consistent with what we would want to do and very customer focused. Now Cabela's is an amazing franchise. I mean, for I think anybody who walks into one of these Cabela's sees this is not your, like, typical store. This is all designed around a customer experience. People, customers spend \u2013 the amount of time the average customer spends in a Cabela's is actually measured in terms of hours. It's different from your typical kind of shopping experience. So we are attracted to the customer focus that they have and it's all about brand and franchise and that kind of thing. So what we did is enthusiastically went after this, but said that it still has to be within the context of a financial deal that really works for us and, of course, that works for Cabela's. In this particular case, I think that we found a meeting of the minds, and I think Cabela's liked the opportunity they saw with us, and we were able to maintain our financial discipline and actually win this transaction. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Sanjay. Next question, please? Operator : Go next to Chris Brendler with Stifel. Go ahead, please. Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon. Actually to follow up the last question. Just overall, your opinion of the private label market, the attractiveness of that market, the competitiveness, it seems like these deals are difficult to win. Could you talk all of how merchants or retailers you've added to the portfolio since you've bought it from HSBC? It seems that they're \u2013 this is sort of a unique situation here at Cabela's being run (57:08) public, but have you had success winning other retailers? And do you like this business? Any disclosure on how fast it's growing relative to the rest of the Card business would also be helpful. And then a follow-up question, a different question, on the share count is down a little over 3% this quarter, nice reduction. Is that all buyback? Is there anything else going on there? Thank you. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Okay. So first of all, your question was about private label. One thing I want to say is that the Cabela's deal is actually a co-brand partnership, so let me just pull way up. In what we call our partnership business, there are two types of credit card programs. One is private label, which is not a Visa, MasterCard. That is just a retailer's card. And the other is co-brand where the retailer or the issuer is issuing a Visa card or a MasterCard, and there is spend both at the store and outside of the store. As it turns out, the key to a co-brand program, and a really good co-brand program is kind of the Holy Grail. That's what \u2013 when you probably talk to any card issuer, I think the great \u2013 there are a handful, a few \u2013 a couple of handfuls and maybe a little more than that of like truly great co-brand programs. And the thing that characterize it, in addition to strong retailers and that kind of thing, is this is where you see high out-of-store spend to supplement good in-store spend. And when you see that, then all the kind of strong economics and the way credit cards work is a great thing and that's why there's a lot of \u2013 all the card issuers are really trying to get those great flagship programs. I would put \u2013 absolutely put Cabela's in that category. Now private label is, again, it's a different business, not a co-brand business by definition. All the spend that's going on is inside the store. And there, our \u2013 I think our focus has been going after the really top of the line retailers. And we have not been going after the middle or lower end of that marketplace. So where you see us, where we've had a lot of growth and great success is, for example, with Kohl's. We also have Neiman Marcus. We have Saks. But Capital One's focus has been more at the upper end, and we've added \u2013 I don't know have the count, but we've added several brands that are really good, modestly sized brand on the private label side. The private label business is pound for pound not as profitable as the pure branded Card business. It's a great business to have in conjunction with a branded Card business. But it, for us, has lower returns, but it's a natural part of our business. The top co-brands are something that are very additive to any card program, and we're pursuing those with a lot of interest. Stephen S. Crawford - Capital One Financial Corp.: On your second question, the reduction was all a function of repurchase, but as we talked about earlier, we obviously can't keep it at the same level for the next three quarters. We used more than our pro rata authorization this quarter. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : Go next to Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Hey. I just want to sort of do a little back of the envelope math about the change to the charge-off guidance for 2017. If we sort of take a rough estimate and say that you've increased the outlook for charge-offs in 2017 by about 30 basis points and we also make the assumption that the 2015 vintage, which is driving this, represents somewhere between 15% and 20% of the book. That would suggest in order to get to the change that you have described, somewhere between 150 and 200 basis point change in your loss outlook on that particular vintage. If you can walk through that math and either point out \u2013 either agree with it or sort of dispute one of the points here, that would be helpful, so we can understand the magnitude of the change? Stephen S. Crawford - Capital One Financial Corp.: Rick, I don't even know how you would get there, because we talked about so many factors in the calculation of the allowance, growth and mix and the quarter swap, there's tons of \u2013 so decomposing that to just the vintage composition, I don't know how we could do that without having a 45-minute conversation and getting into a lot more detail than we're going to. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Stephen S. Crawford - Capital One Financial Corp.: So I understand the effort, but I don't see how we could actually get there. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. I mean, so let \u2013 perhaps given the numbers that you have, you could, without sort of \u2013 could you put some context around the change to the 2015 vintage from where you were at the beginning of the year to where you are now? Stephen S. Crawford - Capital One Financial Corp.: I think, Rich can put context around it in terms of these were really modest changes. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: So, Rick, I want to go back to \u2013 remember an important part of the change in the guidance for 2017 is about growth in subprime mix. So we're already dealing with a \u2013 only a part of this effect. And then beyond that, this is the composite effect of many, many different things that are going on. My point about 2015 was in many ways to help, if you pull way up to give a little bit of kind of tangibility to \u2013 well, why would be saying one year's loss outlook is up by a little bit relative to a quarter ago and the next year's loss outlook is down a little bit relative to a quarter ago? And it's really just because as these things play out, 2015 is coming in a little higher than 2014. And 2016 is coming in a little better than 2015, and that's pretty much the way the math works out. These are all very successful years of origination with \u2013 I think you're going to really like what we have booked there. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Rick. Next question, please. Operator : Go next to Bill Carcache with Nomura. Go ahead, please. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to ask about a different topic. Can you share any thoughts on the current expected credit loss model? And any perspective for, I guess, the broader industry? And then for Capital One in particular in terms of how you guys are thinking about the impact? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah. Hey, Bill. Thanks for asking about that topic. It's, obviously, something that we are focused on, have a lot of people who are starting to build out some of the work. I have a couple of thoughts on that. One, the rules that have come out there allow for a fair amount of judgment and guidance, or judgment. It's more principle-based guidance as opposed to a set of rules. So I do think that you may see some divergent practices initially. And I think that you'll see the of the industry kind of coming together on some topics over time. So I'm a little cautious about getting ahead of \u2013 putting out kind of estimates and guidance on CCIL (01:05:38) because I do think that we'll see kind of people's estimates kind of converge over time as we all kind of get together on some of the interpretation issues. Pulling up for us, when we look at kind of the effects of CCIL (01:05:55), I think we're probably not going to be in the business of giving any kind of estimates on that until we are well into kind of being certain that we know how the standard is going to be interpreted and kind of what the net impacts are going to be here. So, that may not be that you're going to hear from me on this topic until well into next year. Stephen S. Crawford - Capital One Financial Corp.: And just to add a little bit of color to that, one of the reasons to hold off, right, is to the extent that you have literally all of the losses you expect over the life of the loan to be booked upfront through your income statement, one could assume that there would be positive benefits to how much capital you need to carry as well. So there's a whole bunch of things that are going to move here and how CCIL (01:06:41) gets integrated and how people think about the combined reserves and capital you need for the business. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our final question today from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you and good evening. Thanks for squeezing me in. My question is on credit. Sorry, I know we've been beating this to death, but I'm hoping you might be willing to discuss what you think normalized losses are within the U.S. credit card book and I don't mean necessarily within your guidance, but just how do you think about normalized losses, and dimensionalize it by prime and subprime, if you could. Just realizing we're not there yet, but as you think about what normalized would look like at some point in the future, you kind of said that auto is back to being normal, and I don't think credit card is. So if we could understand how that looks, that would be very helpful? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Okay. Well, Ken, first of all, I want to say, and I don't think auto is fully normalized per se. I mean, I think it's inched up a little \u2013 I'm talking industry losses now. It's kind of \u2013 I think there's a little bit still to go in the normalization of auto losses. And as I said, in many ways, it keeps a little bit outperforming in a good way, our own expectations of that normalization, but I think there's a little more normalization still to happen. In the U.S. Card business, every card player has a back book that is at exceptionally low loss levels. It's because for years \u2013 a couple of things behind that. And most importantly, anybody in our back book who like survived the Great Recession, not surprisingly, is pretty resilient and having great credit performance at this point. Additionally, most players didn't grow very much for a whole bunch of years there, so that there isn't a lot of kind of front book effects on people's existing books. So, against that backdrop, our belief is, at some point, there will be some normalization of that credit. And I'm reluctant to pick numbers, because that's going to depend on a lot of things. And one of the things it's going to depend on is how much subprime the industry does, for example. You go back to the late 1990s, there was a \u2013 in the middle of an economy that didn't really move at all, credit card losses went up quite a bit just due to a lot of \u2013 and probably subprime is a wrong word, just a lot of risk expansion, a lot of lending in the Card business. And so I've just been around long enough that I find myself the longer I do this, the more reluctant I am to declare what a normalized loss rate is. But I think there is a net pressure over time that will pull up losses for kind of existing books of all players including Capital One. We also have one other effect that at some point will be beneficial to Capital One, which is the actual \u2013 the other side of growth math, which is the seasoning that \u2013 remember, we've talked about the general pattern of credit programs is they have higher upfront losses. Now, it depends on what kind of credit program, whether it's an origination, a line increase, what part of the subprime is a little different than prime, but if you pull it all together, the general pattern is for front book programs, they have higher losses early on, and then they gradually settle out over time. So with the big front book that we have at Capital One, that will at some point become a bit of a good guy in terms of the seasoning effects. I'm not here to predict the exact timing of that and so on. So I think over the longer run when we think about our own book, there is kind of just upward pressure on all Card businesses and some long run seasoning that I think will be beneficial for Capital One. The key thing that we focus on since I don't think that we feel we can absolutely predict, like the precise through the cycle loss rate for our businesses is everything that we underwrite, we assume significant worsening and we focus actually more so than the loss rate itself that we predict, our biggest focus is on resilience, because even some of the low loss programs, this is really the story of banking in general. A lot of times some of the low loss programs look great and until they don't and they don't have much of a buffer there. So in all of our underwriting, we are very \u2013 in addition to doing all the projections we always do about losses and the whole life cycle of a vintage, we are very focused on resilience so that we have a maximum chance to not only like the business in its full net present value, but to like the business a lot when we get there in the middle of a bad economic cycle. So that's kind of a long answer, but that's \u2013 in the context of all of that, we believe that the business we're booking over in this front book is particularly resilient, and frankly has particularly good economics. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : For a long time, so you can't argue that. Thank you. I think that's it. You've been very generous with your time. I appreciate it. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Ken. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Ken. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: And thanks, everybody, for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great evening, everybody.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott? Scott Blackley : Thanks Jeff. Let me begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $791 million or a $1.45 per share in the fourth quarter. Pre-provision earnings were down from the third quarter as higher revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses driven by seasonal and growth related costs. Noninterest income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $42 million of accounting hedge and effectiveness driven by the magnitude and shape of the rate changes in the quarter. Provision for credit losses increased as the smaller allowance build compared to the third quarter was more than offset by higher charge-offs. Notable items in the quarter included the following; a build in our U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve of $44 million or $0.09 a share, an impairment charge associated with certain acquired intangibles and software assets of $28 million or $0.04 a share, and an allowance build in our auto business reflecting a change in accounting estimate of the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt borrowers of $62 million or $0.08 per share. Turning to full-year 2016 results, Capital One earned $3.8 billion or $6.89 per share. Pre-provision earnings of $11.9 billion were up 15% year-over-year as higher revenues were partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net income for 2016 was down 7% as higher pre-provision earnings were more than offset by additional provision for credit losses. Full-year efficiency ratio was 52.7% excluding adjusting items down from 54.3% in 2015. As you can see on Slide 4, reported net interest margin increased six basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.85% in line with the prior year increase and primarily driven by higher card yields. Turning to Slide 5, as of the end of 2016 our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 10.1%, which reflects current phase in. On a standardized fully phased-in basis it was 9.9%. We reduced our net share account by 9 million shares in the quarter or 2%. Full-year 2016 share count came down 9%. As you know we had an authorization to repurchase up to 2.5 billion of common stock. We've now completed 80% of our authorization at an average price of under $72 per share. With that let me turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks Scott. I'll begin tonight on Slide 8 of our Domestic Card business. Loan growth and purchase volume growth remained strong. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year our ending loans grew $9.2 billion or about 10%. Average loans were up $8.9 billion or about 11%. Fourth quarter purchase volume increased about 10% from the prior year. We continue to like the return and resilience profile of the business we're booking. Revenues for the quarter increased 9% from the prior year slightly lagging average loan growth. Even with the positive margin impacts of higher subprime mix, revenue margin declined year-over-year as expected with our exit of the back book of payment protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the fourth quarter was 16.8%. Domestic Card purchase volume grew 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter net interchange revenue for the total company was flat versus the year ago quarter. As we discussed there's considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these two metrics. For the past several years on an annual basis net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth and we'd expect that to continue. Noninterest expense increased just 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to gain scale and improve efficiency. As we discussed for several quarters the dominant driver of year-over-year charge-off rate trends is growth math which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances in our front book season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book. In the fourth quarter growth math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the prior year. Seasonality and growth math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter. For the full year 2016 charge-off rate was 4.16% in line with our guidance. We continue to expect full-year 2017 charge-off rate to be in the mid-4 with quarterly variability. Growth math remains the largest driver of expected trends in the 2017 charge-off rate. Growth math began to impact charge-off rates in 2015. In terms of contribution the year-over-year change in the charge-off rate, the peak impact of growth math was in 2016. We expect the impact to moderate in 2017 especially in the second half of the year. Beyond 2017, we expect growth math will have only a modest effect. As an update on our Cabela's transaction, we do not expect to receive regulatory approval prior to October 3, 2017. This is the day when any of the parties involved in either the retailer deal or the bank deal can choose to terminate the transaction. Within the next week or so we expect to either withdraw our bank merger act application or have our application denied by the OCC. Ordinarily a bank would withdraw its application before receiving a denial but in this case our bank deal is tied up with the retailer deal which requires us to get consent from Cabela's in order to withdraw. In either case whether we withdraw application or it is denied we will not be in a position to refile our application until after we have completed our work under the AML consent order. We remain committed to this deal and we will continue to work with Cabela's and Bass Pro toward completing the transaction. Pulling up, we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business but the marketplace is moving. Competitive intensity across the card business remains high and revolving credit has been growing at about 7% year-over-year meaningfully faster than household income growth. As these trends continue, we believe the Domestic Card industry has moved into the more intense part of the competitive cycle. Now against this backdrop we continue to monitor the marketplace vigilantly and we continue to dynamically manage our origination and underwriting and anticipation. We believe the growth window of opportunity remains open but it's clear that this opportunity won't last forever. Slide 9 summarizes fourth quarter results from our consumer banking business. Ending loans grew about 4% compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about 5% versus the prior-year. Fourth quarter auto originations were $6.5 billion with strong growth in prime, near prime and subprime. Some of the aggressive competitor practices have moderated somewhat but we see opportunities for continuing growth the auto market and competitor practices remain dynamic and we will be very vigilant. Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business that we're booking. Our underwriting assumption include a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient originations and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-off as the cycle plays out. We also expect upward pressure on the auto charge-off rate as a result of the accounting treatment of bankrupt accounts that got discussed. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased about 3% from the fourth quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was partially offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of mortgage balance. Noninterest expense for the quarter increased 5% compared to the prior-year quarter driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing. For the full year we recognized about $160 million in branch optimization cost in line with our expectation. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the consumer banking segment. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior-year primarily as a result of charge-offs in addition to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio. We expect that several factors will continue to negatively affect consumer banking financial results. In the home loan business planned mortgage runoff continues and in auto finance we expect that margins will continue to decrease modestly and net charge-off rate will rise. Moving to Slide 10 I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Fourth quarter ending loan balances increased 6% year-over-year driven by growth in selected industry specialty. Average loans increased 16% year-over-year. Average loan growth resulted primarily from the acquisition of the GE healthcare business in the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue grew 18% from the fourth quarter of 2015 and noninterest expense was up 15% consistent with the growth in average loan. Provision for credit losses declined 52 million from the fourth quarter of last year as allowance release driven by the impact of higher oil and gas prices was partially offset by higher charge-offs. Fourth quarter charge-offs were primarily driven by continuing pressure in our taxi medallion portfolio. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 47 basis points. Criticized and nonperforming loans rate were stable in the quarter. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 1.5%. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolio. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on Slide 14 and 15. I'll close tonight with some thoughts on fourth quarter result and our outlook as we head into 2017. We posted another quarter of strong growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes, as well as growth in auto and commercial loans driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense and provision for credit loss. We've been working hard to improve the efficiency by growing revenues realizing analog cost savings and other efficiency gains as we become a more digital company and tightly managing costs across the enterprise. Our efforts are paying off. Our efficiency ratio for the full year 2016 was 52.7% net of adjusting items an improvement of 164 basis point from 2015. We continue to expect that our near-term annual efficiency ratio excluding adjusting items will be in the 52s plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility. Over the longer term we continue to believe that we should be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains. Pulling up our strong growth over the last two years puts us in a position to deliver solid EPS growth in 2017 assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycle. We expect that revenue will grow and will drive growth in pre-provision earnings as well. We expect the upward pressure from growth math on the allowance for loan losses will moderate and we're reducing share count. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth in return as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval. Now Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Rich, you mentioned the Domestic Credit market is in the intense part of the competitive cycle, I guess. When we think about how that impacts the growth trajectory looking out to 2017, should we expect the growth rate to moderate because of that? Richard Fairbank : I think that it will contribute to a - I think this window is still open but as I've been saying kind of every consecutive quarter you know this thing won't stay open forever so I\u2019ll leave you with two points. One, we're still all-in in pursuing the window but I think that but let me comment for a bit just about the kind of natural physics that go along with the what's happening on the supply side. First of all just to comment on the supply side. You know after a number of years post the great recession where the growth of revolving debt was near zero or even negative, it is crept up in the last couple of years and now it is running at a 7% year-over-year rate and obviously that's a faster growth rate than the economy is doing. And if you look at this growth it is broad-based although subprime growth has picked up and is now growing faster than prime. So currently if you exclude Capital One's impact on the metric about 34% of the industry's growth is in subprime and subprime card loans are growing 13% year-over-year versus prime which is growing about 6% year-over-year. Now I really want to stress this is off \u2013 and particularly in the subprime side off of a - much lower base following the great recession, so let's just ground that a little bit. We went back and looked at the data here, prime loans decreased 12% from prerecession levels and they began growing again in 2011. Subprime loans decreased 43% from prerecession levels and didn't start growing until 2014. So subprime industry outstandings right now are at 74% of prerecession levels and prime industry outstanding are basically right at prerecession levels. So clearly the subprime growth is - happened later and its off of the lower bank but the growth has physics and that's what I know - I'm always focused on because when you have - consumers taking on debt and competitors you know supplying more debt that can affect both the volume and the selection quality of new origination, as well as of course you know impacting existing customers who along the way can take on more debt. So what we do when we see that is we just - we try to manage Sanjay in anticipation of this because we view it as the physic and we are very - we've always said we can't predict the economic cycle but we really can watch and react to the credit cycle which isn\u2019t the same thing as the economic cycle. So we are very focused on resilient, we try to anticipate how supply changes end up making their way into the credit performance of who we might originate and if I pull way up on all of that, we can continue to make very conservative assumptions in our underwriting, we managed to a belief that we are now in the intense part of the cycle but even with all that considered we still see a important growth opportunity available for us, is the window of opportunity and we will continue to pursue it obviously with our eyes very wide open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. My follow-up question is on the Cabela's portfolio. So when we think about that deal, can that deal be consummated without the bank merger occurring? So could you buy the portfolio without doing the bank deal? Or is that a non-starter for Cabela's? And I guess when we think about the partner you have in on that deal, are they willing to be patient and wait for you to sort out the AML stuff? Richard Fairbank : If we are to buy this it requires a bank merger act application and approval. Now we and Cabela's all the parties in this transaction are working incredibly hard to make this happen and obviously with respect to our own AML order which is the thing at that needs to get to for the approval to happen here, we're all in working incredibly hard. We're working with Cabela's, we are very committed to this transaction and we believe this can be a great deal for us and for Cabela's Bass Pro. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next move to Don Fandetti with Citi. Don Fandetti : Yes, Scott. I just wanted to clarify, the $42 million hedge amount, I guess that's why the other segment had a negative, and in theory, I guess we add that to the adjusted revs of $6.593. Am I thinking about that right? Scott Blackley : Yes, I think we experienced what I think a lot of other banks experience where the shape of the curve moved. That does go to other and it is a offset to noninterest income. Don Fandetti : Got it. And then Rich, real quick on the 2016 Card vintage, Domestic Cards, was curious if you had any update on how that's trending? Richard Fairbank : We still see '16 as coming in better than 2015 so our prior statement we feel viewing that the same way. Operator : Next question comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Hi. I just want to parse out the rate of increase in 2017, for the credit card charge-off rate, in the mid-4%s. You did mention that the growth math would slow. At what point do you think the credit normalization impact would slow, or do you? Richard Fairbank : What are you defining as the credit? The credit normalization impact meaning growth math. David Ho : No, just the natural re-levering of the consumer, some of the leverage impact you're seeing on the margin, just getting back from historically low levels, aside from growth math. Richard Fairbank : Look what we have tried to describe to help our investors think about the credit card growth - the trajectory of credit card charge-offs is to divide it into two very different thing. One is what we call growth math which is the impact of - on the charge-off rate of the seasoning from a acceleration in origination. And the other is the general probably industry-wide affect that relate to the consumer, the amount of debt they're taking on and probably where things are in the economic cycle. We said for some time now that the - that our numbers are going to be dominated by growth math and we are we're still saying that but I'm also saying that we should just all understand we are kind of at that part of the cycle where the industry I think is off the bottom with respect to the exceptionally low levels of charge-offs that we've seen from the very, very seasoned portfolios, all across the industry. And so over the longer run our portfolio like all the card players is going to be - our performance is really going to be driven by this industry and affect but for now still the big story at Capital One is the seasoning of the - our front book and the math of how that plays out over - particularly over - as we played out in '16 and now in 2017. David Ho : And in terms of the\u2026 Richard Fairbank : Sorry, go ahead David. David Ho : Sorry. Just one more question. I was fascinated by - you bring up a very good point about leverage kind of rising above income. Do you think that that in isolation could create an environment where consumer credit, and that space, continues to exhibit some of the lost attributes that you just called out, in absence of any kind of shock to rates, gas prices, or employment? Richard Fairbank : I think we have to take the holistic picture here. I mean I think it is the card business has been benefited by a number of years of having relatively low growth and particularly on the subprime side a big shrinkage and a delayed growth. So I think it's all has to be evaluated in the context of - from where it started and for how long it's been going in and where it's headed. So our primary point has been - look in the end this is physics. The year after year just amazingly low losses it is - as we've said some quarters ago this has to be the bottom, things are going up from here all of that said you know I think that - I mean we are still - we are pursuing growth opportunities and continue to be optimistic about the originations that we can generate., So again we try to adjust based on an assumption that over time things will just gradually normalize. We try to get in front of that anticipate that, make our origination choices in the context of that and this view that we carry around internally, we just share that with our investors. So I think we're still pretty bullish about the opportunity. But I've said probably a year ago, I said that when I cross-calibrate all the businesses especially the parts of commercial, the auto business and the card business that the card business was in the most benign and competitively benign part of the cycle and that auto and commercial were farther along in the competitive and credit intensity. I would say the card business is certainly, I think caught up to the others - the others interestingly have had a little bit of almost a low if you will, and some stability there but all of the businesses in pulling way out banking in general is still moving along towards the more intense part of the credit cycle. But I think card has caught up. Operator : Next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, Rich. Thanks. Following up on that last answer, how should we think about the things like marketing and rewards cost growth into 2017, given that commentary? Is there going to be any reduction there? And how do you think about Capital One's kind of role in that kind of competitive dynamic? Richard Fairbank : I want to separate in a sense the intensity of competition around the heavy spender from the commentary I gave about lending. It's really in a sense two different business, the spending business and the lending business and both are competitive, both have become more competitive. But my commentary was really about the lending business because of the interaction between supply and ultimately the performance and things that make their way into consumers and credit performance and things over time and what I call kind of the physics of how cycles work. The spender business is one that when I get concerned about supply and the intensity of competition, it's not a concern that is going to ripple into the credit performance. It's all a matter of the level of competition. How much it cost to get accounts, how we go out and market to get those accounts. What is the prevailing level of rewards that people are offering and in the end what choices should we be making. So in the - so let me now comment about that business. That has also and it's - it will be a surprise to no one that say this, that has also become more competitively intense. You have seen some players on the cash back side kind of raise their offers up to a level higher than they were before and more consistent with some of the industry leaders there. You've seen probably the most intensity is come at the very top of the market going right after the very heavy spenders and that's a very priced customer segment. It's also very tough to prevail in that space, and that's very competitive. So we have said all along this - this market, I can't remember the last time I said that this market is not that competitive. I think it is very, very competitive and it is particularly competitive at this moment. Now when we look at this we - and you made a comment about our role in this whole thing, I mean as there are a few players who I think have gone very heavy into the spender business and we are one of them and all of us are contributing to that competitive intensity. But one thing I have found over the years and I believe so strongly about this business, this is a business that's about sustained commitments and building of a brand, building of a customer experience that is at the very high end a digital experience now that becomes very, very important in this thing, it's about the building a brand the marketing capabilities, and also product offer. Now we - it is not our view to just go rush out and just keep changing product offers constantly. It is our view that we need a very good offer, which I think we have across our businesses and then the leverage is in really being great across the dimensions that I mentioned. All of that said we continue while the competition is intense, to continue to grow that business significantly, we continue to really like what is happening to our customers when we get them and their balances, their utilization, the percentage that are first and wallet and a lot of characteristics that are key to the success of the program. So this is going to be competitive, I don't see a real course correction for Capital One here. I think that we are continuing to be one of the players that's going hard at this space and I think that we continue to see everything that we see is consistent where this is very value creating and generating of great long-term annuities. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks. Just as a somewhat unrelated follow-up, on the Auto bankruptcy, Scott, did you say like what caused - what triggered this, and over what period of time it would have otherwise been reported? Scott Blackley : Yes, Moshe thanks for the question. I'm just kind of run through a summary of what we're doing. So the bankruptcy change is accelerating charge-off timing for certain bankruptcy accounts. So starting in 2017 within 60 days of receiving the notification of bankruptcy, we're going to charge that loan down to collateral value regardless of payment status. The net impact of that as you might be able to figure out is that we'll accelerate the charge-off timing and then we're subsequently going to have an increase in recoveries. So we would expect that over time, those things are basically going to start to offset each other. The change here is really an accounting shift and doesn't reflect a change in what we're seeing in the business for our expectations, recoveries or cash flows. We are still working through some of the process changes to implement that. So there's a bit of uncertainty as to when the exact impact will show up in charge-offs. You'll see this in a few other process change we're making, they\u2019re going to start impacting the auto charge-offs really in the first half of 2017. You're going to see kind of a one-time larger impact as we process our current portfolio of BK loans. That will show up in the monthly metrics. We're going to put a marker on that so that you can see it. And then in terms of why, really this is something where I think our past practice has been pretty much where others have been in the industry. We're moving to a more conservative practice. I think that's really consistent with how regulators prefer big banks like us to manage things. Operator : Next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hi, good evening, guys. Rich, in the past you used the phrase uncoiling the spring. I'm not sure if you referenced solid EPS growth on the call. But, I was wondering, do you still feel confident that we could see an acceleration in EPS growth? Or do you feel that the competitive pressures that you've talked about, from either the window closening or too much supply coming to the market, are going to prevent us from inevitably seeing that? Richard Fairbank : I feel great about our prospects for generating earnings power from the coiled spring of growth that really three years of growth in the card business, where we have gone all into seize the opportunity when we really like this opportunity and you have watched the, pretty breathtaking upfront costs of doing that particularly in terms of - on the credit side, both the front-loaded - the front-loaded nature of credit cost in what we originate but then of course that even being more front loaded by the allowance builds that precede that. So that creates quite a coiled spring of earnings power and while it is true that the industry dynamics always are at play here, I think there is a lot of coiled earnings power here and while the precise levels of exactly how would, how it delivers itself always depends on industry things too. This is a pretty big effect and I do look forward to having the in a sense the potential energy that's been stored up in this spring to turn into the kinetic energy of earnings. Ryan Nash : Got it. Maybe just one follow-up. Rich, you talked about all the progress that you made on efficiency this year, with over 160 basis points. When I think about the outlook today versus the last time we heard you speak, we've obviously seen the outlook for interest rates improve a lot, which I know historically was a headwind to efficiency gains in prior years. You talked about $160 million of Branch optimization costs, which I would assume likely won't repeat. Can you just give us a sense of, what are the incremental investments that you're being forced to make that are preventing you from making further efficiency gains this year relative to what you did in 2016? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : So I don't feel we're being forced to make a lot of incremental investments. We are certainly continuing to invest important places we're investing is as we talk, many, many times is on the digital side and it's - as I've said for a long time the digital transformation of us really into operating like a technology company that's not a one or two or three years thing that is, that is the transformation that - that in many ways the lifetime transformation because the world will continue to change. What I do want to say about that though is, while we continue to invest in that business. The very visible well, there are many benefits including growth and customer experience and ability to have an increasingly well controlled environment and compliance, the associated experience and all the stuff there are many benefits the meter, if you will of visible cost benefits that we're able to achieve directly as a result of the digital investments that meter is also growing too. So we don't have any change to share with you in terms of our outlook in the near term relative to efficiency ratio. But what we see \u2013 benefit that one of which is on the cost side, I think it is going to be a good guy that's going to help us over the long-term continue to achieve increased efficiency in the company, even as we also go out and capitalize on the enormous benefits that come from this digital transformation. Operator : Next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi good evening. Question just on the efficiency topic you were talking about. Expectation is that it remains around 52%, which what I hear in that is, that you're expecting the - that any expense build is going to be in line with revenues, or is it the other way around? I mean, with marketing in particular, do you anticipate maybe a near term continuation of an uplift driving revenues, and then feeding the revenue growth behind it to hit that 52%? Richard Fairbank : Well first of all, I want to say the guidance is in the 52s plus or minus reasonable variant of uncertainty there. But so we do believe that we're continuing to capitalize on the growth window. I think our marketing investment is going to be still pretty significant when you look at the competitive levels on the one hand but also the opportunity on the other hand. I think marketing investment is certainly going to be there and I have commented on some of the other investments. But I think when you pull up on all of it, which is a growth agenda and investment agenda and a whole bunch of savings that are also happening in the mix master, it nets out to an expectation of efficiency ratio in the 52s over the near term. Betsy Graseck : And then on the provision side, you talked about Domestic Card 4.5%-ish, in that range. Is that -- we get typical seasonality throughout the year, I would expect. But is there anything else that would drive how that NCO is likely to traject throughout the year besides just seasonality? Richard Fairbank : Yes. So if you - so the two things - so seasonality we would expect to be the typical seasonality effect. We have talked about growth math on an annual basis that growth math being the upward, the upward pressure on charge-offs that comes from the seasoning of this front book of substantial originations. So, we've described, its biggest effect is in 2016 it still has an important effect in '17 and then it becomes pretty modest after that, that speaking one year at a time. If you look within a year it tends to move okay. That it's a bigger effect in the first part of this year then it is in the latter part of the year, just not as a seasonal thing, but consistent with the fact that this is gradually diminishing as an effect. So that, so that in addition to seasonality I think it's useful to put a little slope on the growth math effect over the course of the year. Scott Blackley : One thing - Betsy this is Scott, one thing I do want to clarify our guidance is that losses in 2017, are going to be in the mid-4s. I think you put out a point estimate we've intentionally used mid-4s. Operator : Next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of small follow-ups on Auto. Rich, you mentioned that the competitive environment there is improving a little bit, and I think you made similar commentary last quarter. If we can just understand in what form you're seeing that, is that on pricing or on rate? Or, how is that manifesting itself? Richard Fairbank : Okay. First of all, we should use a small letters not capital letters, with respect to this effect. It is - and we made a pretty big deal - we spoke with some alarm really about a year ago and you may remember it was in the year ago quarter that our originations I think our subprime originations dropped and then it dropped pretty materially at that time because we were alarmed about the underwriting practices that we started to see in the marketplace but not by most players but on a more isolated but important basis, we saw in one or two cases and it one or two competitors. That was more of a subprime phenomenon. It related to the amount of documentation and data that was going to be required to underwrite a loan and willingness to do it on a more low doc basis, which we didn't want to go there. That has not disappeared. That has mitigated if you will, so that we see the effect, but it is not as rampant as it was a year. So that is improving with a small eye if you will. Okay, but certainly don't - and then the other, the other thing that's going on I think in the prime part of the marketplace which has been very competitive in many ways, probably a little bit more competitive than cycle average, if you look at some of the effects on the margin side. I think there might be just a tiny bit of easing maybe about related to and I'm speculating here with respect to maybe certain capital requirements for players and the attractiveness of prime auto relative to that, this is again a relatively small effect, but certainly I would say the kind of steady - in steadily increasing pressure on the - competitively on the prime side has lightened up a little bit, but it's not, it's not a big effect but it was enough that we who especially when we talk about the auto business, we take what the market will give us and we don't take anything more than it will give us and buy and in the context of that, we've just found that this year it's got a little bit more to give us. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thanks for that. And just on the - backing out the bankruptcy effect from this change in recognition, is there any change in your underlying you view on credit evolution? Richard Fairbank : No, so if you separate that effect, we have said even obviously that the bankruptcy accounting effect that raises the expected number for next year. If you take that effect out, we do still expect that our charge-offs will be higher next year than this year. This is actually just a continuation of the kind of normalizing effect it's been going on for a number of years. And as we've mentioned over the years, we have seen and probably over the last few years, just a - each year successive vintage coming in just a little bit higher in terms of credit losses than the year before all very much consistent with very good business and all of that and is again the natural physics of kind of how the marketplace works. And the other thing on Capital One's loss rate is that we have for years our prime percentage in our portfolio has been going up and so that has - that's been an offsetting factor in the loss rate but as we've said over a number of years, there is still this gradual normalization that's going on and we still feel very good about the opportunity in the business. Scott Blackley : I just want to pile on, I mentioned this earlier, but I just want to reiterate that the change that we made in accounting really was not associated with new or different view about recoveries or how we look at that and really was just moving to a more conservative process in that business. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Chris Brendler : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. On the net interchange growth of just 1%, I understand that it can be volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I just want to make sure I'm clear here, that roughly 9% growth for the year, is that a good run rate? And can you just help us figure out or explain what drives that quarter-to-quarter volatility? I think in the past it may have been expansion of rewards programs or tweaking rewards programs. Just given the level of investor concern about rewards costs these days, any comment there would be he helpful. Richard Fairbank : Okay. So first of all - and we've always said the quarterly this thing balances all over the place and this is - you can't draw a lot. So I want to talk a little bit about the volatility and then let's talk about sort of the bigger picture though trends that are going on. So quarterly it can fluctuate because an individual quarters we update our rewards liability based on points earned and redeem, redemption mix, redemption rates. It includes partnership contractual payments, international card, consumer bank net interchange. And so, there are lot of things that go into the quarterly number. What we have said is this phenomenon of interchange - net interchange growth being well below purchase volume growth, I think is something that while individual quarters can bounce around that is a real effect that's been going on for the last couple of years and we would expect it to continue. We're building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers, we're extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards very importantly of course we're originating a lot of new business with strong flagship products like Quicksilver Venture, our spot products for small business that have very attractive rewards. So our continued investment in the business and continuing to build a franchise that affect will continue. The other thing that has gone on \u2013 on a rolling basis over the course of this the past four, three or four quarters is what's happened with respect to a few a small number of merchant deals where interchange was renegotiated downward and that there is two ways that plays into our portfolio. One is when the interchange rate drops, obviously we feel that effect but there is kind of a lasting effect too because the handful of merchants where this interchange became lower are also growing faster than the economy. And so their growth will over time continue to roll through our numbers, so pulling way up, we continue to be very bullish about the opportunity to grow our spender business, all of our calculations are with our eyes wide open about the fact that net interchange growth is going to lag the pretty eye-popping growth. We've been able to get in the - on the reward side of the business, but when we incorporate the full economics of our spenders and we have years and years of experience with this and lots of tests and rollouts and many, many things that the integrated economics for Capital One given the franchise that we have built, I think continues to be very attractive even in the context where there is will be a delta between purchase volume growth and net interchange growth at least in the in the foreseeable future. Chris Brendler : That's helpful. Thank you. And then, a follow-up on a related basis. The U.K. business has seen some interchange reductions. I assume that's filtering through there. But I'm surprised International Card was not broken out separately in the release. Any signaling there? And also, I'm also surprised that the weaker pound isn't having a more dramatic effect on the outstandings in that segment, just because it would seem like the underlying growth, actually, is a little stronger, just given how much the pound has been hit. Scott Blackley : Hi Chris, this is Scott. Yes, so on the international given that component of our total card businesses just gotten continued to be smaller and smaller, we no longer felt like it was important to material for us to break that out separately. So going forward, you'll see us having total card and Domestic Card. We're not going to separately break out Canada or the U.K. so you'll see that kind of working its way through our monthly metrics and the rest of our financial reporting starting with our 10-K. Operator : Next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Rich, I wanted to follow up on your comments around subprime growth in Card. In looking through the public filings, it doesn't seem like the larger players are increasing their sub-660 FICO exposure. So, I wondered whether you were perhaps seeing smaller players growing in subprime? Can you comment on where the supply is coming from? Richard Fairbank : It is coming from all of the above. It is definitely coming in some of the larger players. And I can't speak to their back books, what I can speak to is the good solid data we have on what is happening in the origination marketplace and there has been. And the data that I gave you, that is excludes Capital One therefore, by definition is the industry, but, and I think you've actually seen a player to comment on, stepping up a little bit here and I don't want to overdose with the point. This is off relatively small base. And it is in the context of some other players also growing probably across the board, all the way from the top of the market but there is a tail that is extending into the - below 660 marketplace that is real and these are real customers picking up more debt and we also validate this too when we look - we can follow the industry's trends with our own customers by looking at the credit - while beyond, looking at our own customers and what are their balances we look on collectively all of their credit bureau reports and see what's happening there. And we see that same phenomenon that is in the industry data, it would be shocking if we didn't. But we can see some increase and these are relatively small effects but some increase in indebtedness for example in our own customer base. Bill Carcache : Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you. Separately, if I could throw in a question about capital. If we were to stick with standardized, how much room is they for your CET1 ratio to fall below, call it the 10% range? Obviously, some regionals are running below that, but they don't have as much exposure in Cards. I was hoping you could share with us a little bit about how you're thinking about that. Scott Blackley : Yes, I don't want to front run the process on capital, I think we understand the importance of capital return, I think we've been very creative in our process, whether it was - I think the first to use the de minimis exception last year front-loading, stock repurchases this year at attractive valuations. I think one of the things we're actually most pleased about is the fact that we've been able to put a lot of capital to work organically and acquisitions, which I know this is a market that particularly in the financial services industry, good growth has been hard to come by. So, I\u2019ll end where were Rich ends, where Rich ended his prepared comments with the profitability that we have we believe we can both continue to fund growth and return a good amount of capital to our investors and we think we can do that even though there is still a fair amount of uncertainty in the environment with respect to the regulatory front. How CCAR is going to change, what's going to happen to Basel IV, Cecil, some of the other long-term factors that are going to drive the way we allocate capital. Operator : Next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Matt Burnell : Thanks for taking my question. Scott, maybe just a quick one for you. In terms of the bankruptcy change, just want to make sure that what you're - what I think you're saying is, that the reserves that you took in this quarter are basically the entire effect that you think you'll see in terms of the provision that will be needed for the Auto portfolio. Then going forward, it's just - it's effectively business as usual in that business, other than the bankruptcy effect on the loss rate itself. Correct? Scott Blackley : Now you've got that right and just to kind of repeat that to make sure we've got that clear. So the allowance build reflected kind of the change that we saw in accelerating losses into the allowance window. So I think that's going to cover the vast majority of the effect. And so I mentioned, we'll start to see recoveries come in overtime and offset that increase. So, you will see a bubble in '17 and then you'll see that start to settle down. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then for my follow-up, just a question on the revenue margin. Obviously, that came down about 30 basis points this year, year-versus-year because of the U.K. portfolio. How are you thinking about that margin going forward? Is there going to be the same effect on revenue margin in the card business from the U.K. portfolio in 2017, as we saw in 2016? Scott Blackley : I'm sorry, just to clarify, are you talking about the year-over-year decline in the Domestic Card revenue margin? Matt Burnell : Yes. Scott Blackley : So the Domestic Card revenue margin won't be affected by U.K.'s PPI. Matt Burnell : Okay. My mistake. But, is your outlook for that going to be basically flat? Or is it going to continue to come down because of the competitive pressures? Scott Blackley : Matt, we have really gotten into forecasting revenue margin by line of business. I think what we've done is kind of pulled up and look at the things that are driving margin for the company overall and general rates going to be a positive assuming forwards play out the way that they have that hasn't happened in the past, but I think there is more feeling that rates could actually mature the way that the forwards are expected. I mean if you look we've gotten benefits from a higher mix of card and a lower mix of mortgage. So I'll let you know make your own forecast there in terms of mix probably being a beneficiary. There have been some, as Rich mentioned these were throughout his comments there's also been a little bit of rate pressure on auto and normalization there. So it's kind of - the story hasn't really changed over the last couple of years. We've gone out and made big predictions about potential changes in revenue margin and ultimately they been pretty flat. So that's made us a little bit less bold. I think you have all of the factors that you have to think about the major things are going to drive net interest margin for the company. Operator : Next question comes from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Ken Bruce : Thanks. Good evening. Appreciate all your comments in trying to tease out some of the moving pieces here. I guess, in the context of transactors, in particular, you kind of point out that the economics of that business are still very attractive. I think many of us are concerned that they look attractive to everybody, and so that there's going to continue to be this pressure on the rewards and the various incentives used to kind of acquire those cards. Is there a way to frame, in your mind, kind of how that annuity looks today versus maybe five years prior to now? Does it take you 30% longer to effectively have a positive NPV out of those cards? Can you give us some sense as to how it's -- kind of the timeliness of the economics on that business? Richard Fairbank : Ken I think this annuity - look I want to go back to - this has been incredibly intensely competitive for a long time. We see that there is a flurry right now with respect to a few products, some breathtaking giveaways in terms of - for a period of time up front miles and things like that but the - first of all I just seen anything ebb-and-flow over time a lot. The second thing I would say is in many ways our own - when we look at these annuities in many ways they are improving every year for Capital One because of the investments that we're making to really build the business I want to go back to the part that I think you all see - the world sees so much is what is being offered in terms of rewards and obviously that has become more competitive. But the - for the last several years we've been offering pretty much the same rewards products and so you know we've already internalizing those economic. The reason I say this is an all in business that it doesn't work to just bounce in and bounce out is what incredibly important is things like the - how long these annuities last, what is the attrition rate, what is the first in wallet rate, what is the mix, the profile of how heavy your spenders are when you're getting them, what is happening to customer metrics on customer satisfaction, net promoter scores, the digital experience, and we have had nothing but progress year-after-year on this and our own annuities are actually getting better and better and actually more economically attractive. It\u2019s not to say I don't worry a lot about competition and focus on that and we talk about it all the time but this is about franchises and people can't will themselves in the franchises overnight is taken us a number of years to build it and I have a lot of respect for the competitors who are going after this space and there's some great players that are doing this but this is attractive business for those who have built a franchise and I'm as excited today about it as I was three months ago, six months ago and one year ago. Ken Bruce : Understood. I think I get a sense of that. Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Looking at the subprime growth in the portfolio, it's been roughly over two times kind of the prime growth on the revolver side, U.S. Card business. And, I can hear the caution that you're kind of trying to lead us to in terms of kind of where we are in the cycle. I appreciate that. Does, in your mind, that need to slow in order to kind of achieve some of the -- kind of the lower growth math impacts that you're talking about for 2017 and 2018? Richard Fairbank : Ken you known me for many, many years. We obsess in the best of times. We obsess about everything credit because in the worst of times is too late to be obsessing about everything credit. So I remember one of our leading investor called me Dr. Doom in the 90s because I kept focusing on that even though we're in such an amazing kind of boom time. My point is these are all effects that play out over a course of years. My real point has been that just people need to watch all the metrics as I\u2019ve been saying for a lot of quarters and we really believe there is power that you can manage - to say something I said earlier it's hard to predict economic cycles but there's a lot of leverage in managing within the credit cycle. And so I give you a calibration of where we see the marketplace is, it means that we add probably even an extra layer of caution in our own originations and in our choices to the earlier question does that impact growth. I mean in some sense all other things being equal it slows down growth a bit but with all of that going on a lot of - we've been talking about this and anticipating this interactions for a long period of time. So I still go back if I pull way up in this business we're very happy we see the growth window when it is been there. It is still there the competition is heating up, we're still going after it. We continue to build a coiled spring of earnings power that - there's a lot of upfront cost now but a lot of earnings power that is being compressed in this spring. All of this is in the context of an industry marketplace that is moved off the bottom, it's only got one way to go and over time it is just physics but we can't predict exactly how these will play out but I think that the - the earnings power and the growth math that are associated with how that plays out is a real phenomenon and I think has a lot of value creation baked into that. And we continue to be bullish about the business and about our prospects to deliver some nice numbers for our investors. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our call for this evening. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Jeff Norris for closing or additional remarks. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, and thanks everybody for joining us on the conference call today and for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great night. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today.

Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Fairbank. Rich? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Jeff. Capital One earned $810 million, or $1.54 per share, in the first quarter. Excluding adjusting items, we earned $1.75 per share. Pre-provision earnings for the quarter were $3.1 billion and we posted strong year-over-year loan and revenue growth across our businesses. I'll begin tonight's call by discussing the major themes that are driving our overall first quarter results and our outlook for 2017, Domestic Card credit and total company efficiency ratio. Based on portfolio dynamics and industry conditions we observed in the first quarter, we now expect that the full-year Domestic Card charge-off rate will be in the high 4%s to around 5%, with quarterly variability. That is up from our prior expectation of the mid 4%s. With the benefit of more data, we have refined the expected shape and timing of credit losses on our front book programs booked over the last few years. Our originations in 2014, 2015 and 2016 remain highly resilient. Even with our revised charge-off guidance, we continue to expect that these vintages will drive earnings for years to come and generate total NPVs at the high end of all the annual vintages we've booked since the early 2000s. Over the past year and a half, we have seen increasing competitive intensity, a growing supply of credit and rising consumer indebtedness. As we move through 2016, we tightened our underwriting around the edges. Our actions over the past four quarters have led to a deceleration of our growth, just as the industry is accelerating. We still think there is a growth window, but the window is gradually becoming smaller. I want to turn now to another important driver of financial performance and that is efficiency ratio. We have been working very hard to enhance the efficiency of the company as we grow the business and invest in our digital transformation. Over the past two years, we have lowered our annual efficiency ratio by nearly 200 basis points to 52.7% net of adjustments. We are continuing to drive hard for efficiency gains. We are converting customers to digital, using technology to simplify and automate our operations and driving out analog costs. On the third quarter earnings call last year, we guided to a near-term annual efficiency ratio in the 52%s, net of adjusting items. We are now seeing the opportunity for even more progress in the near term, so we are revising that guidance. We now expect annual efficiency ratio for 2017 will be in the 51%s, net of adjusting items and plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility. Efficiency is a key way that the investors will get paid, and we will continue to drive hard on this lever. Over the longer term, we continue to believe we will be able to achieve additional efficiency improvement, driven by growth and digital productivity gains. On the earnings calls in each of the past two quarters, we have stated that we believe we are in a position to deliver solid EPS growth in 2017, assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycles. The higher expected charge-offs and related allowance impacts put pressure on expected EPS this year. But the improved efficiency outlook partially offsets the earnings impact from credit. While there is a lower margin for error and based on what we see today, we should be in a position to deliver 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth in 2017. It's important to note that all of the guidance we're discussing on tonight's call excludes the potential impact of the announced Cabela's transaction. So now I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss first quarter results for the company. Scott? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Rich. I'll begin tonight with slide three. As Rich mentioned, Capital One earned $810 million, or $1.54 per share in the first quarter. Excluding adjusting items, we earned $1.75 per share. We had one adjusting item in the quarter, a $99 million build in our UK Payment Protection Insurance customer refund reserve of which $70 million was an offset to revenue and $29 million was captured in operating expense. A slide outlining adjusting items and adjusted EPS can be found on Page 13 of the slide deck. Pre-provision earnings were up from the prior quarter, as slightly lower revenues were more than offset by lower non-interest expenses. Efficiency ratio in the quarter was 51.6%, excluding adjusting items. Provision for credit losses increased from the prior quarter, driven by both a larger allowance build as well as higher charge-offs. An allowance roll-forward by segment can be found on Table Eight of our Earnings Supplement. Let me take a moment to explain the movement in the allowance across our businesses in the quarter. In our Domestic Card business, we built $441 million of allowance. This build covers the loss forecast change for 2017 that Rich just discussed. In our Consumer Banking segment, allowance increased $61 million in the quarter, almost entirely driven by growth in our auto business. Looking ahead, in our April monthly credit results we expect a one-time increase in charge-offs of approximately $30 million due to accounting changes in the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt accounts, which I discussed in our last earnings call. For the year, accounting changes will increase our auto businesses charge-off rate by approximately 20 basis points. These losses were fully provided for in our 2016 allowance. In our Commercial Banking segment, we had a $32 million reduction in reserves, driven by the impact of continued improvement in our oil and gas portfolio. Recent reserve movements have been focused in our taxi and oil and gas portfolios, and we have provided details for those portfolios on slides 15 and 16 in the Appendix of the slide deck. As you can see on slide four, reported net interest margin increased 3 basis points in the first quarter, to 6.88%, as higher rates and mix benefits more than offset day count in both linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons. Turning to slide five. As of the end of the first quarter, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.4%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.3%. We believe that we are now at the destination capital ratios appropriate for our current balance sheet mix. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Rich. Rich? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on slide nine, with first quarter results for our Domestic Card business. As I discussed earlier, loan growth and purchase volume growth decelerated in the quarter, but remained strong. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $6.5 billion, or about 8%. Average loans were up $7.9 billion, or about 9%. First quarter purchase volume increased about 7% from the prior year. Revenue for the quarter increased 7% from the prior year. Higher revenue from loan growth was partially offset by revenue suppression associated with higher delinquencies and charge-offs. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.3%. Non-interest expense increased just under 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to gain scale and improve efficiency. Charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.14%, up 48 basis points from the sequential quarter. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.71%, down 24 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. In the first quarter, delinquencies began to turn down on a seasonal basis. Pulling up, we continue to be concerned about the supply of credit in the marketplace. Revolving credit grew at about 6.5% year-over-year, the seventh consecutive quarter it has grown much faster than household income. Against this backdrop, we have been tightening our underwriting. We still see growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business, but our growth window is gradually getting smaller. Slide 10 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 5% compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about 6% versus the prior year. First quarter auto originations were $7 billion, with strong growth in prime, near prime and subprime. Competitive intensity in the auto finance marketplace softened a bit, which contributed to our growth. While we still see attractive opportunities for future growth, there are also reasons for caution in the auto industry, including declining auction prices and an increasingly indebted consumer. Based on the competitive environment we see today, we expect to increasingly emphasize price and margin over volumes in our origination strategies. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. And we dialed back on some less resilient programs even as overall originations have grown. As the cycle plays out, we expect the charge-off rate will gradually increase and the growth will moderate. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased about 6% from the first quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was partially offset by margin compression in auto. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing. First quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily as the result of charge-offs and additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio. Moving to slide 11, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. First quarter ending loan balances increased 5% year-over-year as we continued to grow in selected industry specialties. Average loans increased 6% year-over-year. Higher average loans as well as higher non-interest income in our capital markets and agency businesses drove revenue growth of 11% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Non-interest expense was up 21%, driven by growth, technology investments and other business initiatives. Revision for credit losses declined $230 million from the first quarter of last year, primarily as a result of the change in allowance as well as modestly lower charge-offs. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 14 basis points. Criticized and non-performing loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 1.2%. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil field services and taxi medallion portfolios. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on slide 15 and 16. I'll close tonight by recapping the key themes driving our outlook for 2017. We expect the full-year Domestic Card charge-off rate for 2017 to be in the high 4%s to around 5%, with quarterly variability. We expect total company efficiency ratio, net of adjusting items, to be in the 51%s, plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility. And we expect the improved efficiency outlook will partially offset the earnings impact from our revised credit outlook. While there is a lower margin for error and based on what we see today, we should be in a position to deliver 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth in 2017. Pulling up, we are struck by the amount of change that is coming in the marketplace and the opportunity to capitalize on that. We have invested heavily in transforming our company and driving growth opportunities. We are well on our way to rebuilding our infrastructure with a modern technology architecture and along the way we are redesigning how we work. We are delivering resilient growth across our businesses. We are driving improving efficiency. And we're building an enduring customer franchise and our momentum is growing. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth and returns as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval. And now Scott, Steve and I would be happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Just in terms of the card growth outlook, what is the implication of that for rewards and marketing expense, Rich? Is there some possibility that perhaps that starts to plateau or even decline? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: So, Eric, we continue to be very positive about the success of our marketing and, frankly, the growth of our spender business. In fact, frankly, the growth of all of our business. But my comments about gradually dialing back around the edges from an underwriting point of view is entirely related to the competitive environment and its impact with respect to credit and revolving credit and the choices that we make there. The rewards business is \u2013 the top of the market spender business is a very competitive business, but we continue to be successful. Our actual growth rate in spenders and heavy spenders continues to be very good number there. And so we will continue pretty much the way we are going with respect to our marketing and growth plans. My only point, and I don't want to overdose on this point because, in many ways, it's a gradual continuation of something that we've been doing probably since the beginning of 2016, and that is just dialing a little bit around the edges of our programs in response to what we see is an increasing amount of supply out there and increasing amount of indebtedness. So we're still going hard for growth. Even, frankly, on the revolver side of the business, we think there are good growth opportunities. Our point is just that this is a continuation of a trend that's now, frankly, five quarters along. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : All right. Thank you for that. And just one follow-up, please in auto. The issue of residual values is one that's been talked about quite a bit. And one of the theories postulated in this quarter was that the delayed tax refunds were causing there to be incremental pressure on used car values in the period. Any legitimacy to that in your view? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, we have ourselves speculated about that. I don't think we have a good way to know that. Our own observation has been just kind of pulling up on the used car values, Eric. While the Manheim Index has stayed pretty high, it's starting to fall now. We have always created our own index based on the cars that we deal in. And that metric was moving down earlier and farther than some of the metrics that people were looking at overall in the industry. With respect to, therefore, shall we say, the Capital One Index of used car prices, we have been expecting that to go down. We underwrite assuming it'll go down actually quite a bit and stay down. That's an underwriting assumption. But even in terms of our own forecasting, it dropped below our forecast decline rate in the first quarter. So that certainly got our attention. Eric, well, it's too early to know whether that might have been related to the tax thing, but we will see. But it certainly underscores a very important thing to monitor in the auto business. And really, at the top of our list, frankly, in the auto business is used car values and the fact that for so many years they've been so high. In some ways, they only had one way to go from here. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good evening, guys. Maybe I could start off with credit first. Rich, just what drove the net charge-off guidance change? Secondly, should we be using the $7.21 adjusted EPS from 2016 as the base for 7% to 11%? And then, look, I know it's very preliminary, but just given that a lot of the growth from 2014 and 2015 are likely starting to peak out in terms of losses, 2016 obviously we'll get through a decent bulk over the next couple of quarters. Just wondering if you'd give us any sense for where you would expect charge-offs to go from here, given the fact that we have undergone growth math now for the better part of two-plus years. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Right. So, Ryan, a bunch of questions there. First of all, with respect to the base upon which you calculate the EPS growth. R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, Eric, this is Scott. Table 15 of the Earnings Supplement has the schedule that shows the adjusted EPS, and you'll see the full-year 2016 and it is $7.21. So you're correct in that. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: And Ryan, relative to growth math, yeah, let me just talk about growth math and how that relates to the revision in the outlook that we have talked about tonight. So this revision is entirely related to the front book of Capital One, the growth book that is from 2014, 2015 and 2016. And so think of it this way basically, this is playing out from a slightly higher base than we had earlier expected, but the underlying dynamic is exactly the same. So right now we're near the peak of the growth math effect in terms of the year-over-year impact on the loss rate of our card business. That impact moderates over the rest of 2017, with only a small tail in 2018. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : That will be from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks. And along with the guidance on charge-offs, Rich, could you talk a little bit about how you see the reserve? Because there seemed to be a little bit of a disconnect this quarter compared to previous ones, given that you had both a slowdown in the dollars of loan growth and slowdown in the dollars of delinquency growth and yet the provision \u2013 the reserve was built. What's the outlook for that? How long would you need to maintain that extra reserve given the comments you just made about the tail of charge-offs? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, Moshe. it's Scott. Going to the reserve, as you said a couple times, there's really three components of the reserve loan balances that are as of the end of the period, our loss expectations for the next 12 months and then qualitative factors for risk and uncertainties. The biggest driver in what drove the Domestic Card allowance build in the quarter was the updated credit outlook that Rich discussed. So that was the primary driver. And then there's also growth in the quarter after you back out the expected seasonal paydowns. And on top of that, as always, we have qualitative factors. So it's really being driven by the credit outlook, but also by those other factors. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. But just to follow-up on that, the growth and ex-those seasonal factors would likely have been smaller than in prior periods, right? And so maybe you could just also \u2013 Rich had talked about the tail of that credit really dissipating as you get towards the end of this year and into next year. How long would it be that you would need to maintain the reserve at that level? At what point could it be used to essentially offset some of those charge-offs? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah. So, one, the allowance is definitely covering the losses that we anticipate for the next 12 months. So that's the starting point of that. I think about where the allowance is going from here is a lot of, as Rich talked about, growth math. What you should anticipate with the allowance is the upward impact on charge-off rates from growth math starts to moderate. I would expect that the allowance builds are going to start to be driven really by credit, our outlook on credit, on the economy and growth. And so you'll start to see them moving a little bit more just in terms of those drivers as opposed to the growth math drivers. But, Moshe, beyond those kinds of things, I don't think I'm going to get ahead to say that there's any part of the allowance that we're saving for later in the year or anything like that. It's all based on our outlook for the next 12 months. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citi. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes, so Rich, in terms of a subprime card outlook, in terms of moderating the growth, I guess can you talk a little bit, is that being driven by more competition from other banks or are you just getting a little more concerned around where credit's trended versus your model? Can you elaborate a bit more on the subprime side on cards? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, Don. So you probably heard us for, I would guess, four \u2013 this is like the fifth quarter now that we have been talking pretty vocally about supply out there in the marketplace. And the last few quarters we have pointed out the pretty striking growth rate of subprime itself. I don't have the number right in front of me, but I believe it's 14% year-over-year subprime growth for an industry that's growing at half that overall. Now, again, Don, that's off of \u2013 and I really want to stress this \u2013 it's off a much lower base that retracted significantly after the Great Recession. But still, that certainly has our attention, that subprime growth. And so the primary thing about the competition is not so much that it slows our growth down because fewer people respond, although I think there is that effect. Much more our focus on the competitive aspects in these lending marketplaces is what it does to selection quality and what it does ultimately to the nature of credit. And so the gradual decline in our growth rate, this is really now speaking of the whole card business, and I think as you can also see with our subprime percentage, that generally it has stayed flat or slightly actually grown over this period of time. But my point is a more universal point beyond subprime. The slowing of growth of Capital One has been probably minority parts affected by competition directly and majority parts just our own dialing back around the edges of our underwriting. And when I use this term, dial around the edges, what I really mean by that, we have hundreds of programs that we launch every year. And as we watch these effects in the marketplace and study all of our little test sales and everything else, we don't so much go in and out of programs and just stop doing things. What we do is we just tighten up a little bit and we take the marginal cuts around the edges and we just dial it back a little bit. And so pretty much if you go back to the peak growth of Capital One on the outstanding side was probably what we announced about one year ago. And from that point, which was really way at the kind of industry leading growth, we have just gradually dialed back a little bit off of that thing, plus a little bit more competition, leading us to where we are. The other thing I want to say is there's no dramatic thing right now that there's a change in the slope of our trajectory with respect to this. This is more of a continuation of the same thing that we've been doing for an extended period of time. And the reason I made my comments about growth is I put together accelerating industry growth and sort of continuation for us dialing around the edges still in the context of aggressive marketing, especially at the top of the marketplace. All that I think adds up to some moderation of growth, but that's more of a continuation of the trends that we've seen as opposed to any new point that I'm making today. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And that'll be from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please pick up your handset or release your mute. We're still not able to hear you. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Sorry. Good afternoon. I just had a question around the vintage performance for the Domestic Card book. I know you called out before that the 2016 vintages had been performing slightly better than 2015. In terms of the seasoning, is that still the case? And how large is the magnitude of the drop-off from some of the vintages that are moving past peak? Does it tend to be flatter or more steep for subprime? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Okay. So, first of all, left me talk about 2016 and relative to 2015. So as we just talked about over the last year and a half, we have been really starting at the beginning of 2016 and increasing as we move through 2016, we were tightening our underwriting around the edges. As a result of these actions, we expected that credit losses on the 2016 vintage would come in lower than losses on the 2015 vintage. And the first indications were consistent with that. Given some of the trends in the industry and our latest data points and performance, we now believe that 2016 originations will come in on par with 2015 vintage losses. And I think there's an interesting thing I want to pull back on, a phenomenon I've seen a lot over the years, which is as you move into the parts of the cycle where growth is accelerating, you see effects that aren't exactly the same as you see in the rearview mirror. Now, we try to anticipate that and get in front of that. And as you can see, ironically \u2013 and it's not ironic. I mean, it's a fine outcome. But what we thought was getting around it to such an extent, 2016 was going to be lower than 2015. And, in fact, the very, very early reads on the vintages would be consistent with that. It turns out that the sort of offsetting effects ended up that we're on par between the two. But that's just to us so typical of how markets work. And our dialogue with you over time is trying to continually give you our view of the marketplace in which we operate. We then make our choices in anticipation of that and then calibrate as the results come in. So we feel great about all of our growth programs, 2014, 2015 and 2016. And even on this day when we're actually doing an upward recalibration of the loss guidance, I again want to say these three years of outsized growth are going to really pay handsomely in terms of the earnings power of the company over time. There was a \u2013 you asked and I realized there was an earlier question I didn't answer on how are the vintages from the beginning of this growth spurt doing. So let me just talk a little bit about our 2014 vintage because those are first originations in our accelerated growth period. And we can already see evidence of delinquencies and losses peaking and starting to moderate. So, again, this is the dynamic we've seen over and over for 20 years. What this call is about is calibrating when you have, in this case, three years of growth vintages piled on top of each other, to see how the actual timing and shape of the curves plays out for hundreds of programs. There are recalibrations along the way. And this is one of those recalibrations and it's a recalibration upward. But it takes nothing away from the dynamic of how all of these growth programs work, the incredible earnings power that they carry. And I think also we're going to look back and be really, really appreciative that we \u2013 and this was a conscious choice, of course \u2013 but really accelerated our growth in the period when the industry was not growing. And, in fact, it's an interesting thing that we're a little bit decelerating into the industry's acceleration at this point. And the performance of the 2014 vintage is typical of the way these vintages will turn and really be the basis for the earnings power in the future. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll move to Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet : Thank you. Good evening. I appreciate you taking my question. If I'm understanding your guidance correctly, the charge-off rate and the allowance as a percentage of loans that we now see are both at about 5.1% in Domestic Card should not keep rising and basically can hold at or below these levels. Is that a correct interpretation? And then separately, is it reasonable to assume that both of those metrics, the charge-off rate and the reserve rate, can both remain at or below these levels that we saw this quarter if the labor markets remain healthy, as we look out at the rest of this year and into next? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, Scott, do you want to answer some of that? You go ahead and start, and I'll... R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah. Let me talk a little bit about the allowance and then, Rich, you can talk about where rates are going. So in terms of the allowance, remember that the allowance is always based on our ending outstandings and balances that exist as of the end of the quarter. So some of the charge-off guidance that we've given also incorporates \u2013 the guidance by definition incorporates the charge-offs that we may incur on growth throughout the year. So there's a little bit of that that's baked in to there. But pulling up on the allowance, just to reiterate a few things. So, one, implicit in our EPS guidance is our view that the Q1 allowance build is going to be the peak quarterly build for 2017. I mentioned that for Domestic Card, as we've talked about the upward pressure from growth math is starting to moderate as with work through 2017. And so with that type of pressure gone, we should see the allowance then starting to just be moved by more macro types of things as well as growth. So changes in those factors, all of them can certainly cause things to move around. But at this point, based on the guidance and what we see today, we think that that was the peak for allowance builds in 2017. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: And, Bill, just to comment about your question about where losses go from here. We've been very focused on trying to share with investors the impact of growth on credit metrics. There's always the economy and other things that can affect things and we don't really \u2013 we're not really trying to be in that prediction business. But we're in the growth math story, we're actually at an important moment here because this is the peak of the growth mass effects. Now, that's not the same thing to say this is the peak of losses in a sense that, I mean, we've got seasonality and a lot of things going on that help here, too. But growth math is by definition the upward pressure on losses that come from an outsized burst of growth. So we're talking about upward pressure. But here's the key thing, this is the peak of those growth math effects. As I saw in one of the analyst articles, Speaking Nerdily, if you talk about the second derivative, we are now the rate of growth is going down from here. And, in fact, the growth math effect will moderate over the course of this year and just has a small tail in 2018. And what you're left with, of course, is, with respect to credit, is just all the other factors that drive credit, the industry factors, the economy factors and everything else. But the growth math story from this big burst of growth will have mostly played out over the course of this year. Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet : That's extremely helpful, Rich. Thank you. If I may squeeze in my follow-up. I wanted, Rich, to follow up around your earlier comments around lower recovery rates impacting severity in subprime auto. But I was hoping to ask you if you could please focus your thoughts a little bit more on the frequency side. There has been obviously a lot of concern in subprime auto in recent months that's trickled into subprime card. And I just was hoping that you could discuss whether in your view delinquency rates in subprime auto and subprime card are highly correlated in this market, or are there differences between subprime delinquency trends in card versus auto? I would love to hear your thoughts on that. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, well, the first thing I want to say is that card delinquencies are a lot more telling than auto delinquencies. And so that's point number one. So whenever you \u2013 I always just take as one part of a lot of pieces of information when you're looking at auto what's happening to delinquencies because the way that people pay, and, frankly, really what happens is they wait. A lot of people wait until the moment before a car would be repossessed. And then the key thing is the payment rate at that point. And that's a lot more telling than the delinquency patterns that precede that. So that's just more of a general observation. Whereas in the card business, delinquencies tend to just march on their way to charge-offs in fairly predictable ways. There has been a lot written about and talked about the auto business. And we have been one of the vocal commentators about the auto business for a long period of time. And I want to say you may notice, Bill, that we actually grew. We grew in our originations in the quarter. This was a pretty solid year of growth for Capital One. And so our actions in each of these businesses I think are reflective of our view of these. We've looked with quite a bit of concern on the card side about the growth of supply. And that's been the key driver for us to dial back there. In the auto business, the underlying consumer is the same. The economy effects and various things are the same. There's one anomalous difference that's going in the opposite direction of the card business, and it is the thing that has led us to be growing despite being so vocal about concerns about this marketplace. And that is what's happening on the supply side. There are at least a couple of big players in the marketplace that are pretty significantly dialing back and have done so gradually over the course of the last year. And as I've always said, for however important you think supply matters on the card side, it matters even more on the auto side because there's an auction marketplace there. And the supply and the pricing when you have auctions going on one dealer at a time really pressures the performance of growth and ultimately can have ripple effects on credit. So here we are with all of our concern about used car prices, our concern about consumer indebtedness that is growing and we're trying to also incorporate the supply side that is moving in the opposite direction that's led us to have a surge of growth here. We're actually now stepping in more to probably take that in terms of price and margin, less so in volumes just because we continue to share the macro concerns about progressively moving along in the cycle relative to consumer indebtedness. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll move to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. Good evening. I'm sorry to keep asking this question, but just on the charge-off rate as we look out to the next year, Rich, taking all your comments together, as we look out to next year and to first quarter, in the absence of some kind of macro weakness or macro impact, it would appear, given that you have a small tail related to growth math, that you wouldn't see significant pressure year-over-year in the charge-off rate. Obviously, there's seasonality through the year this year. But as we look out to next year, it would seem like there shouldn't be much of an upward bias to the rate. Is that correct? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, Sanjay, I'm going to stick with the comments that we have made on that topic. But with respect to growth math, the story is really just has a small tail next year. And it's really mostly going to be a story about where the card industry is and the economy are at that time. And we won't probably be talking that much about growth math anymore. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess when we look at this range of EPS growth that you guys have called out for this year, is the delta just what the provision might be, or are there other factors that we should consider? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: I think that the range represents \u2013 I mean this is not like a massively scientific exercise. Obviously, there are judgment calls. This represents the range that we believe that we can do, even despite the credit pressures on earnings this year. And I think it's a reflection of the underlying earnings power of the business, the continuing momentum of efficiency. But that's the range that we chose there. It's not massively scientific. R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: I'd just add in, I think that the range certainly takes into account the charge-off guidance range that we gave you, but also the fact that other parts of the income statement can move up and down and that we're not expecting to, as long as we're inside that charge-off range, that that's a direct path through either way and that there's going to be puts or takes to land inside that EPS range. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Pardon, I just want to say one other thing about that one. We don't usually, I mean usually, but we rarely \u2013 I have to think back when's the last time we gave EPS guidance at Capital One? It was a long time ago. So a little bit probably all of you should be wondering what on earth are we doing stepping out and doing something like this. But the reason for doing it is that we really did want to show the underlying earnings power of the business, the momentum we have on the efficiency side and, in a sense, demonstrate that even with the front-loaded pressure that happens whenever you have a credit event because then you bring all the allowance effects for it and it gets to be pretty intense, that there is still earnings power at a time like this that the business can generate. And I think that that's really the point that we're making here. We're also making the point that this doesn't have like an infinite capacity to absorb surprises from here. And we want to be clear about that. But we're certainly all-in driving to generate that EPS growth. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll take that from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you and good afternoon. Rich, the RoE has come down over the last couple of years, and I guess driven in part by the growth math. But your capital ratios have come down to where you've targeted. So we shouldn't see returning of capital beyond earnings. What is the right RoE for Capital One, the return on tangible equity? Where would you like it to be? What kind of a range is proper as the business mix has shifted? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, Bob, one thing that's very clear right now, there are a couple of things that are pressuring RoE. At the top of the list is growth. And with growth comes a double whammy on the credit side. One because of originations have front-loaded loss curves. So you have that effect. And then of course on the allowance side, you're bringing forward everything even more so. And the other thing is the significant investment that Capital One has been doing in transforming our company in response to the biggest revolution in the history of mankind and something that's going to absolutely transform banking and is only in the very early stages of doing that. So those two effects collectively have pulled down the earnings power of Capital One relative to what you might say is the more inherent earnings power. So where do we go from here? I'm not going to give a specific guidance on that number, but both of these things we're investing in are going to be good guys in terms of the returns of the company. The tremendous growth over the last few years in the card business as we pass through the seasoning of the vintages turns into a significant good guy on the earnings side, and that's a pretty sustainable kind of earnings stream there. And there's a striking thing that's been happening on the tech side, and that is that while we continue to invest heavily in technology and we will continue to do so, we also keep a meter of what are the savings that are directly attributable to this. And this meter is growing and it's growing pretty darn significantly. So it's very clear where that's headed over time and that's going to become more of a good guy over time. So the very thing that's holding down earnings in the recent time period and sort of like now is the very thing that over time is going to be the things that I think will propel both the returns to be higher and, frankly, put Capital One in a position to be at the higher end of the League Tables in terms of growth. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. And my follow-up question is just on rewards. Are you seeing any signs? Do you think that rewards competition has peaked as credit losses start to move up a little bit, does that put some pressure on the ability to offer rewards for the industry? So do you expect to see \u2013 have you seen competition stabilize and do you expect it to pull back at all on the rewards side? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: I would not invest on any thesis that rewards competition's going to get to be less. I'm going to predict it will increase. Now, the rate of increase may lessen. There's been a lot of competition in the last year, but I don't see any evidence that rewards competition is declining. I think what you might see is maybe it's going to settle out more. I think that's the optimistic case that it settles out. Frankly, I really think if you go back and talk about how do you win, I'll give you my own view, how do we win in the heavy spender marketplace. So much of the conversation and what's on TV and everything is about product. And product, of course, it's an important thing and it's a thing that there's a lot of arms race going on about. But winning is about product. It's about marketing. It's about customer experience. It's about brand. And it's hard to snap your fingers and get in a great place with respect to those. But a comment about each. I think maybe over time the product competition might settle out a little bit because that's where it has been most intense. Marketing, we spent more than two decades building this company around in a sense the science of marketing as well as the art of marketing. But what you see in terms of TV marketing and so on, behind-the-scenes, the even in many ways more important thing is the whole world of digital marketing, the power of information-based strategies to do that. That's a very important part of this. The customer experience, that's classically thought of in terms of things like the call center servicing experience. And companies like Capital One have invested heavily in that and have really, really I think now high performance with respect to that. But there's a whole new world coming on the customer experience side. And that's, of course, the digital customer experience where we're going all in on that and that's going to be a real competitive battleground of differentiation. And finally, in the end, the hardest one to buy, but maybe the important one is brand itself. And I think the companies that have really gone all in on quality and sustain their investment in this part of the market for a long time are going to be rewarded by that. That's certainly what we're doing. So if I pull way up on that, certainly, we're all watching the competition around product. I think this'll be a competitive marketplace. In the end, I think competitors are going to fully internalize to win, you've got to win across all those dimensions. And the best ones will. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll take Matt Burnell with Well Fargo Securities. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Rich, you've mentioned several times tonight your focus on efficiency and improving the efficiency down to 51% this year, around that area, from 52% previously. Can you give us a little more color as to what initiatives or what areas would be most likely to benefit from that focus, relative to... Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yes. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : ...rather than what it might have been three to six months ago? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, yeah, Matt. First of all, I want to clarify the guidance is in the 51%s. The prior guidance was in the 52%s. So I just want to be clear about that. So first of all, we've been very, very focused on this. And it is clear to us, in many ways back to the earlier question that was asked about the return profile of the business, it's very, very clear that a central way that our investors get paid is through operating efficiency. And so we have been very, very focused on that. Where have we been generating that? First of all, just plain old-fashioned operating leverage. If you look at the numbers in the card business, you can see that. On the technology side, the relentless pursuit of efficiency. Even though I've said many, many times the technology investments are not motivated first and foremost in order to save money, frankly, it's for a lot of the other benefits that of a great customer experience, the ability to transform how the business works and so on. But along the way, the cost side is going to be an important beneficiary as we drive out analog costs and bring down the costs of our technology infrastructure and things like computing, storage, software development. Also benefiting the efficiency side I think has been opportunities we've seen, frankly, on the old-fashioned again, on the pricing and margin side. We've had some opportunities across our business on that side as well. All of these things have been moving in the same direction and with a lot of driving from us. But all of it is manifesting itself in the ability to lower by a whole notch the efficiency ratio for the very year that we are now entering. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. That's helpful. And Rich, or actually maybe Scott, let me go on that idea of the pricing and margin side. You actually grew average interest-bearing deposits this quarter by about $6.5 billion. Didn't see much of an increase in the cost of those deposits. Can you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about deposit beta going forward? If there's anything unusual in that growth in the interest-bearing deposit base? Stephen S. Crawford - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, Matt. It's Steve Crawford. There's nothing unusual. The growth, there was a little bit of a mix difference in the growth which drove the increase in deposit costs in the quarter, but really performance as expected. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll go to Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back over one other issue related to operating expenses and that's on the marketing side. Rich, you talked about the window getting smaller here. Does that mean you're likely to have to spend more on marketing to get the customers you like? Or because the window is going to be tougher, you might just give up on some of the opportunities? I'm just trying to think if we should think about marketing maybe having some upward pressure on it or not in coming quarters. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah. Well, so the first thing \u2013 I'm glad you asked the question. The first thing that I have found over time, and I think we're seeing it now, as the competitive cycle moves along and we start trimming around the edges as we've been doing for a while, that thing doesn't directly translate into marketing because we still are doing the same programs and we still want our customers to sign up for those and we still very much want to make sure we get positive selection relative to that. And so what tends to happen as you move through the more competitive part of the cycle is that marketing, you just get a little bit less for a similar investment in a lot of ways. So that's point one. But that's a very important distinction. It's not like we're getting good return on it. We are very, very pleased with the return and we measure that. We have metrics all over the place about the different denominators, the return on this marketing. And I think we feel very, very good about it and it's very comfortably above a threshold. The second point I want to make is, a bunch of the marketing cost is for going right at the top of the marketplace. That's the rewards part of the business. That is a business that it's competitive in the classic business sense of competitive, but it doesn't have that second overlay of the credit impacts of so much supply. So there we just we continue to actually see a lot of success in what we would call the spender and heavy spender part of the marketplace. We're happy with our investment and our returns there, and we're continuing to market there. So the only thing that's really getting trimmed around the edges is the underwriting cuts for our various credit programs. That's going to lead to a continuation of the slight deceleration you've seen over the last four quarters. Doesn't really have a lot of impact on marketing. But I would also say that we're not looking at this and saying, oh, my gosh, we've got to now massively ramp up the marketing to try to stay competitive. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. Thanks very much. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll take John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Good afternoon. Rich, I heard what you said about 2016 vintages being on par with 2015, but a couple of your peer card players have actually indicated that 2016 is actually heading above 2015 levels. And I just want to get your thoughts on that. Is there risk that 2016 could actually be higher than 2015? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, the first thing I want to say is whenever we are on any statement that I would make about our portfolio, the more recent stuff is always more subject to uncertainty and, therefore, to change than things that are older, obviously, because the older it is, the more established the vintage curves are and it's really not going anywhere in that sense, right? Even this revision that we've been talking about here, in some ways 2016 had the most revision on a proportional basis, probably then 2015, a lot less so 2014 and so on. It's just that same principle. The closer you are to having just been originated, the more information is still coming in that makes it subject to revision. Now, I think the right way to look at 2016 vintages and their performance is what our competitors are saying, because not only have competitors said that, we have looked at credit bureau data. And if you construct vintage curves out of credit bureau data, you can find that exact effect that in 2016, the vintage curves in many ways starting around the second quarter industry-wide started gapping out relative to earlier ones. Okay? Now, to us, this shows up in a different way, which is the thing I said that where we were headed to have 2016 better than 2015 because we had made anticipatory cuts with a tighter credit box. That effect that you're referring to, Jonathan (1:07:11), actually led to an offset of these two effects. So it's kind of a wash and our 2016 appears to be on par with 2015. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then separately, just in terms of the growth math impact, I guess it's implying you still expect a degree of earnings leverage as this plays out. I mean, what type of magnitude of leverage do you expect? Is this something you would still call a coiled spring? And when now do you think that that could materialize? Thanks. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: We've used the term coiled spring to describe the creation of earnings power from our card growth. And, well, basically as we're growing rapidly, the near-term returns of course are pressured by these high upfront costs. And with vintage curves with higher up-front losses and allowance build that brings it all forward. And then you put several years of growth in succession, and that further amplifies and extends this effect. So that's basically what we call the coiled spring and it remains in a very coiled position. The precise timing of uncoiling depends in many ways on the actual shape and timing of the vintage curve from hundreds of programs. But the key thing that \u2013 the first thing to look for is as we now take one metaphor of coiled spring and turn to another term called growth math, the thing to look for is when the rate of increase in charge-offs starts to decline. And that is happening basically as we speak. So what happens as the growth math effect plays out over the course of this year and there's a small tail of that next year, that puts us in a position to enjoy more of the benefits of the spring uncoiling. But to be fair, the uncoiling is not a moment in time. This is a phenomenon that happens as the vintage curves from a bunch of programs gradually settle out, the loss curves gradually decline and there's just a continual uncoiling that goes on as that happens. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : We'll take Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is Manam Ghusali (1:10:00) on for Betsy Graseck. Quick question. Can you speak to what impact the Cabela's portfolio would have on your NCO outlook? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Could you repeat the question. Sorry, I couldn't hear the last part there. Unknown Speaker : Could you speak to what impact the Cabela's portfolio acquisition would have on your NCO outlook? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Sure. Well, let's just go through a few things. One, remember that all of our guidance excludes Cabela's. And so until we actually are able to have a really firm date as to when that thing is going to close, we're excluding it from our guidance. So just a reminder on Cabela's, that deal still requires regulatory approval, just not for us but for others. And so as soon as that regulatory approval happens, we'll be looking to close as quickly as possible. And at that point, we would anticipate providing more information about the impact of that deal on the company's outlook. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thanks. And separately, your tax rate was a lot lower this quarter. Was that related to the accounting change on RSUs? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, this is Scott again. And that's absolutely right. We did have a reduction of around $24 million of a benefit that went through the tax line item that was associated with the new accounting standard. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thank you. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : We will take Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I want to reconcile a few things here. When we look at the NCO guidance for 2017, it's essentially been raised twice since you first laid out the framework for 2017 about 15 months ago. The second thing that we're trying to understand is, and Moshe alluded to this, there was a pretty significant and atypical reserve build in the first quarter. And you saw the normal seasonal runoff, you saw the improvement in delinquencies. And Scott alluded to the fact that other factors drove reserve build. When we parsed through all of this, I think the takeaway that you led everybody to is that the 2016 vintage is seasoning worse than you expected previously. That's great. Now we need to understand why that's happening. I mean, I think that's really the crux of what's going on here. And we know what; now let's try to delve into why. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Rick, so first of all, this is not entirely just about 2016. Proportionally, just like I said earlier, the more recent the thing we're looking at, and in many ways, this is something I've seen before in the past because obviously we don't have a lot of data preceding that. But the more recent, the more there's been an adjustment. So proportionally, the 2016 vintage was adjusted the most, but there was an adjustment in 2015 and even an adjustment in 2014 as we're watching the various vintage curves play out. So I just wanted to make that clarification. It's not entirely a 2016 story. So I don't think we're in a position to put a precise finger on this effect that was commented on earlier that a few other players have talked about something in 2016. We see in credit bureau data there's definitely some gapping out a little bit in terms of vintage curves. But we go back to watching the marketplace evolve. The trends that we saw six quarters ago start to accelerate in terms of the supply side of the business. And we have been pretty vocal about that there are a natural set of things that happen when the industry supply increases. One can't predict exactly when they are or what magnitude, but they tend to happen. So we're not really in a sense surprised by any of these effects. In terms of precision on what's going on, I don't think we've got a great explanation. But I think that this is in many ways what happens as markets get more supply. And we've got to also remember, we're coming off the bottom of the most seasoned and we probably won't see this again for hopefully not for a long, long time in terms of what happened with the Great Recession, but the seasoning of everybody's portfolio and the survivorship of everybody's portfolio and what has happened now as the industry off of that base starts growing and then, frankly, accelerates into a higher level of growth. For us, it's all part of a natural process of our actually decelerating into their acceleration. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, Rich. And, look, we start with the premise that you guys are really good at credit. That's been our thesis on the stock. And I guess what I'm hearing is that ex-post factors in terms of competitive behavior have had a material impact on credit performance, on vintages that you thought you had a pretty tight understanding on. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, I think competition for more than 20 years, Rick, I have seen the competitive environment affect credit performance. And so I'm not sure that there's any new point that I'm making here. And nor are we saying, gosh, there's some big industry effect. I want to go back to what we said before. We made a conscious choice to grow way above market rates, not only in 2014, but again in 2015 and well into 2016. That's a lot of growth on top of each other. Growth programs have an inherent uncertainty about how the actual vintages precisely play out on their shape and their timing, not their ultimate outcome and the returns which we feel fabulous about. In many ways, what we're talking about here is a refinement with the benefit of more data that has led to an overall modest upward revision in terms of the overall loss rate that we expect in 2017. And that's just a reflection of how the management of the business works. And this time, unfortunately, it's an upward adjustment and that hurts in terms of the allowance build associated with that. But the underlying story is really the same. The earnings power of the growth, the opportunity we see in the card business including in the subprime part of the marketplace, the coiled spring, the earnings power, and, in fact, even at a time like this, we still like our chances to get pretty good EPS growth in the 7% to 11% range R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Rick, I've got to come back just real quick on your allowance question and make sure that we have this really clear, because the allowance build in the quarter was principally driven by the change in charge-off guidance. That is vastly the build. We always add qualitative factors on top of that. And when you've got an environment where there's a lot of competitive activity going on, those are factors that typically get captured in your qualitative factors. So like every period, we added those on top, but growth is a factor there, too. So I wanted to make sure that it was clear that the primary factor was the change in charge-off guidance. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And our final question comes from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good evening, gentlemen. And I appreciate the time for the question. Look, I really appreciate all the commentary you're trying to provide around credit. I have really two questions that I'm hoping you might be able to give us a very blunt or factual answer around. In terms of losses, there's this concept of cumulative losses. I know you're familiar with it. Is there a way to frame 2014 or 2015 vintages in terms of cumulative losses in subprime credit cards? I mean, everybody's looking at growth curves and they may understand that they peak a couple of years after the vintage. But it'd be really helpful if we knew what the end state of those losses would be within what Capital One's doing on subprime credit cards. If not for Capital One specifically, what would your assessment be of the industry cumulative losses? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, Ken. The very concept that has a lot of power in auto because it's a term loan doesn't really work so well on the card side. And also depending on where people play in the subprime marketplace, the losses can vary by a multiple of each other. So we have spent two decades building in a sense the information base and database capability to identify in the subprime marketplace who are the diamonds in the rough, if you will, the people that look like maybe they're not so good credit, but turn out to be a lot better than that. And that's a couple of decades worth of investment, including making it through the Great Recession successfully. But the cum loss concept isn't really probably the operative thing. What I will say is, most importantly, we measure this in terms of the net present value of our programs. And to go back to something I said earlier, we go and we measure before, during and after every program what is the net present value of that program. And we have hundreds and hundreds of programs. We add those all up by year and then look at what the entire value created for that year is. We have done that and we continue to revise that all of the time. Our current view is, even including the latest data on credit, is that 2014, 2015 and 2016 vintages, the total net present value of these is really at the very high end from all \u2013 you'd have to go all the way back to the early 2000s to find something exceeding these levels. And so, to us, it's about the value creation. And the other critical variable is the resilience. How do these perform under stress? And I think what we like about this collectively, all the things we're originating, is I think there's a lot of earnings power there. The resilience I think has been well demonstrated. And I think the growth programs that we're talking about today are the foundation of a lot of earnings power for Capital One for years to come. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just finally, you pointed out that other credit card companies are growing. That obviously gets you in a little bit of a situation where they're potentially increasing leverage on the same customers that you've in essence capped out yourself. How do you protect yourself in that environment where there could be increasing indebtedness in the U.S. card book so that you could mitigate some of that risk? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Ken, it's a great question and it's a question we obsess about every single day because, in this business, customers, they don't just say, I've got one credit card and that's all they do. We can do all of our underwriting and have it just seem perfect and then the customer can take on a lot of debt, big high lines and other things, even in cards or beyond cards, and then that can spoil what we had planned. There're no guarantees in this business. What we do is try to watch a few decade's worth of experience in doing this and try to build in, most importantly, the resilience for things that might happen. How do we build resilience? Be very, very careful on credit line. How do we build resilience? Build it into the margin of the business, build it into the way that we manage the accounts over time and do this in the context of being absolute students of what is now more than two decade's worth of experience in the good times and the bad, the good decisions, the mistakes, the whole thing, the Great Recession. And while there are no guarantees, that is basically what we do. But your question I think goes to the heart of why in the end this isn't an actuarial science. This is a dynamic risk management business. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you for your time and all your conversation this evening. Appreciate it. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Bye, Ken. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, thank you, Ken. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on this conference call today. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. The investor relations team will be here in this evening to answer any questions you may still have after the call. I wish everybody a good evening. Operator : Everyone, this concludes the call for this evening. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Fairbank. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Jeff and good evening everyone. Capital One earned just over $1 billion or $1.94 per share, in the second quarter. Pre-provision earnings for the quarter were $3.3 billion and we continued to deliver year-over-year loan and revenue growth across our businesses. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to expect domestic charge-off rate for full-year 2017 to be in the high 4s to around 5. We continue to expect full-year efficiency ratio for the total company to be in the 51 net of adjusting items and plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility and while the margin for error remains tight based on what we see today, we remain well positioned to deliver 7% to 11% growth in EPS in 2017 net of adjusting items. All of our guidance excludes the potential impact of the Cabela's transaction. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss second quarter results for the company. Scott? Scott Blackley : Thanks Rich. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1 billion or $1.94 per share in the second quarter. In the quarter, we recognized $12 million of non-interest expenses related to our anticipated close of the Cabela's transaction. Excluding these costs, earnings per share was $1.96. We will continue to break out future deal and integration costs as well as the initial allowance build associated with the onboarding of the Cabela's assets. The closing of this transaction is still pending regulatory approval. Pre-provision earnings increased 6% on the linked quarter basis as we recognized higher revenues and lower non-interest expenses. Provision for credit losses decreased 10% on a linked quarter basis as higher charge-offs primarily in our commercial banking business were more than offset by lower linked quarter allowance builds. We have provided an allowance roll-forward by business segment which can be found on Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our domestic card business, we built $155 million of allowance in the quarter, two primary factors drove that build balanced growth in the quarter and our expectation of rising charge-offs. Allowance on our consumer banking segment increased by $36 million in the quarter. This increase was attributable to our auto business where we build allowance for new origination. In the second quarter, we had about a 40 basis point impact to our auto charge-off rate from the initial effective accounting changes and the timing of charge-offs which I've discussed over the last couple of quarters in our calls. Beginning in the third quarter and continuing throughout 2018, we expect these accounting changes to increase annualized charge-off rates by 15 to 20 basis points after which the effect begins to reverse overtime. Lastly, we had a $4 million release in reserves on our commercial banking segment as we released reserves associated with loans that moved to charge-offs which was partially offset by reserve builds primarily focused in our taxi medallion business. Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin was flat for the first quarter at 6.9%, and it was up 15 basis points on a year-over-year basis fueled by strong growth in our domestic card business and higher rates. Turning to Slide 5, I'll discuss capital. As previously announced following the Federal Reserve's conditional non-objection to our 2017 CCAR plan, our Board has authorized repurchases of up to 1.85 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2018, and we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share which is subject to Board approval. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.7% which reflects current phase-in. On a standardized fully phased-in basis it was 10.6% and with that I'll turn the call back over to Rich. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Scott. I will begin on Slide 9 with second quarter results for our domestic card business. Loan growth and purchase volume growth decelerated in the quarter but remained strong. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $4.3 billion or about 5%. Average loans were up $5.8 billion or about 7%. Second quarter purchase volume increased about 7% from the prior year. Revenue for the quarter increased 7% from the prior year in line with average loan growth. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%. Non-interest expense increased about 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Our domestic card business continues to gain scale and improved efficiency. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.11% and the 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.63%. Both metrics were down a few basis points from the sequential quarter compared to the second quarter of last year both metrics were higher as expected. The impact of growth math remains largely in line with our expectation. As a reminder, growth math is defined as the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances in our front book season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book. We continue to expect the impact of growth math will moderate in the second half of 2017 with a small tail beyond 2017. As growth math runs its course, we believe that our delinquency and charge-off rate trends will be driven more by broader industry factors. Slide 10 summarizes second quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans grew about 5% year-over-year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about 6% year-over-year with a four basis point increase in deposit rate paid. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, auto originations were up 14% to $7.5 billion with strong growth in prime, near prime, and sub-prime. As we discussed last quarter, competitive intensity in the auto finance marketplace remains a bit muted which continues to contribute to our growth. While we still see attractive opportunities for future growth, there are also reasons for caution in the auto industry including expected declines in auction prices and an increasingly indebted consumer. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices and we've dialed back on some less resilient programs even as our overall originations have grown. As the cycle plays out, we continue to expect the charge-off rate will increase gradually and that growth will moderate. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased about 9% from the second quarter of last year driven by growth in auto loans as well as deposit pricing and volumes. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in marketing. Second quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year primarily as the result of charge-offs and additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio. Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances increased 2% year-over-year and average loans increased 4%. Higher average loans as well as higher non-interest income in our capital markets and agency businesses drove revenue growth of 9% compared to the second quarter of 2016. Non-interest expense was up 11% primarily as the result of growth technology investments and other business initiatives. Provision for credit losses increased from the second quarter of last year driven by charge-offs in the oilfield services and taxi medallion portfolios. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 80 basis points. Criticized in non-performing loans rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.9% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 1.0%. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oilfield services and taxi medallion portfolios. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves, and other metrics for these portfolios on Slide 16 and 17. I will close tonight with a summary of key second quarter themes. Capital One continued to post solid year-over-year growth in loans, deposits, revenues, and pre-provision earnings. We continued to tightly manage costs and improve efficiencies even as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation and we continued to carefully manage risk across all our consumer and commercial banking businesses. Based on what we see today, we are affirming our guidance for full-year 2017 domestic card charge-off rate, total company efficiency ratio and growth in EPS. All of our guidance is net of adjusting items and the potential impact of Cabela's. As Scott mentioned, the Federal Reserve completed its CCAR process in the quarter. Our capital plan received a conditional non-objection which requires us to resubmit a revised capital plan by December 28. We will resubmit our capital plan and are fully committed to addressing the Federal Reserve's concerns with our capital planning process in a timely manner. Pulling up, we continue to be struck by the amount of change that's coming in the marketplace and the opportunity to capitalize on that. We have invested heavily in transforming our company and driving growth opportunities. We are well on our way to rebuilding our infrastructure with a modern technology architecture and along the way we are redesigning how we work. We are delivering resilient growth across our businesses. We are driving improving efficiency and we are building an enduring customer franchise. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth and return as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval. Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts, who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up and if you have follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Liane, please start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good evening. Just wanted to ask about the vintages that you're seeing in the loss trends within the card vintages. I know you had indicated last quarter that your updated charge-off expectations incorporate your expectation for losses in the 2016 vintage to be on par with 2015, is that still the case or are you seeing any changes there? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Hey John, our expectations are the same 2016 vintage on par with 2015 vintage. Jeff Norris : Your follow-up. John Pancari : Okay all right, thanks. Yes a follow-up to that was just on the auto front. I know you had indicated that you do expect charge-offs in the auto book to increase moderately over time just consistent with the general pressure you're seeing in the business. Can you just help quantify the piece or just help quantify that what you mean by moderately there and then also are you providing at a higher level at this point given the worsening severities as used car values have pulled back? Scott Blackley : John why don't I start on the back end of that question and turn it over to Rich. So in terms of our allowance process we've been assuming kind of used car prices to fall and it continued to fall. So we've already been building that into our allowance and I think that that's something that we would expect to continue. Richard Fairbank : John relative to the charge-off outlook, you could go back and it's probably for the last three years I've been saying that we expect charge-offs to gradually increase in the auto business and we're saying it again. Now and the reason for that is the same reason that that's driven this conversation over these years which is off of an exceptionally low base of charge-offs that the phenomenon of normalization we have fully expected. Now the interesting thing is Capital One's charge-offs that we have posted over time in general haven't gone up in that way and there's been a couple of things going on there, the biggest thing has been sort of a gradual mix shift, up market in that sense the particularly the higher growth that we've gotten at the higher end of the market has sort of offset that effect but beneath it all, if we look at the things like the sub-prime business there. There has been some gradual normalization going on it's a natural phenomenon. Probably all in all, the amount of normalization has not been as high as we have ourselves internally forecasted because we've been pretty cautious about what we expect with respect to new used car prices and frankly some of the competitive dynamics in the auto business I think have kind of helped in competitive meaning the easing of some of the competition particularly on the sub-prime side I think has eased things. So if we look in hindsight at this, three or four year period while we've been raising our estimates for losses, we think there's been a lot of value creation, there's good opportunities for growth. The business is in bit of an odd place with some easing competitive intensity but still the other dynamics that are associated with increasing potential for risk things like used cars but all in all, it's -- there's a good opportunity right now but I think you should expect losses will gradually go up over time. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Jeff Norris : Are you there Ryan? Ryan may be you come back. Let's go to the next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Rich, you talked a little about credit in the credit card business. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment from a growth perspective I mean we've seen a little -- a number the large banks are starting to actually show some growth acceleration and so what are you kind of looking at that's different and kind of how do you see that playing out over the next year? Richard Fairbank : Yes, I mean Moshe we first of all we believe the opportunity to grow continues in the card business. What I would say is the exceptional opportunity has mostly run its course and now there's a more just there is just a good opportunity let's talk about the exceptional opportunity for a second while a lot of people were not -- they weren't as heavily marketing and not as seeing the growth opportunity that we saw, we pretty much captured several years of outsized growth and I think that it served us very well even though we all know of course the upfront costs of that in terms of credit and allowance have been little rough on the P&L. What I think has happened over time, the competition has definitely intensified but it's not irrational. So let\u2019s talk about it at a couple of levels. First of all at the where it's most -- where it's competition is most obvious to everyone who has like a television or anything else is in the reward space and it is very clear that marketing levels are up, rewards, rewards levels on various cards are up, we've not only seen several players come forward with higher, higher things like cash card rates. One of the striking things to me is what's happening on the co-brand side in the process of the renewal of Co-brand deals, there has been a pretty significant cranking up of some of the rewards associated with those. The other striking thing happening Moshe on the competitive front at the top of the market is the early bonus the giveaways associated with that. Now we that particular area we worry a lot about and we pretty much live inside the frontier of those early bonuses only because we have so much experience over the last 20 years on what happens when you get the Hoppers, the Teaser Hoppers, the Bonus Hoppers the various folks there. So I think we all have to keep an eye on what happens there, so it is clear that that the table stakes are higher, the investment is higher and the competition is higher at the top of the market going after rewards. That said we continue to be very pleased with our performance there and we continue to -- continue to winning in that space is about sustaining investment and about winning in product, marketing, service, digital experience brand there's a lot to that but we very much note the competition but we were all in and we still like very much what's going on. The other thing I would comment though is about more the revolver side of the marketplace. I think people are you are seeing more growth there but I'd put it in the rationale category, we don't see really anything going on about pricing in that marketplace; we don't see underwriting standards being compromised. So I think it is that the more kind of normal phase in a market which is just people stepping up and investing more and trying to grow more. So in the context of all of that, I think it's still a reasonably healthy card marketplace, the growth opportunity we had before is not quite what it was but we still we still like the opportunity. Jeff Norris : And do you have a follow-up, Moshe? Moshe Orenbuch : Yes if you just kind of extend some of that to auto, you mentioned there is some easing in the sub-prime, are you tilting more in direction or more in the prime in that business at this point? Richard Fairbank : Well I think we're pursuing the same strategy that we probably a big word for this the same -- the same approach and underwriting standards pretty much consistently across from the top of the market through near prime and into the part of subprime that we play as well. The point I would make is that the competitive easing is more in the near prime and prime part of the marketplace. So that therefore the opportunity for growth is a little higher there. So it's in a sense same approach same strategy, same underwriting but a little bit different market dynamics depending on which part of the market we're talking about. Jeff Norris : Next question please? Operator : And we will take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Do you hear me this time? Jeff Norris : We got you, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Okay. Sorry about that. I was having headset problems. A question for Scott. Scott, you noted that the card reserve build was for both growth and the expectation for higher charges which I'm assuming you're trying to imply 2Q 2018 charges would be above 2Q 2017 but just given what we -- everything you're seeing competition vintages what you're seeing in terms of your delinquency improvement I guess there was no change in the macro or the competitive environment. Any sense about how you would think about charge-offs for 2018 and/or when would you actually expect to see charge-offs begin to level off on a year-over-year basis? Scott Blackley : Yes, Ryan, thanks for the question. Look as we said last quarter, we thought that Q1 was the high point for reserve build in the domestic card portfolio as growth math is starting to moderate in through the back end of 2017 with the tail after 2017. The effective growth math on the allowance is no longer going to be the biggest driving factor and that's been over the last couple of years that's been the really big driver. So what I would say with the allowances as we move through 2017 increasingly, the allowance is not going to be really driven by kind of that upward pressure of growth math that we've been talking about but it's really going to be driven by more just the overall industry factors and where those go, I think is it's something that we'll be talking about going forward but I don't have a forecast for you for 2018. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then maybe if I could just ask one quick follow-up Rich when you reiterated the EPS guidance 7% to 11%, you noted again that the margin there remained tight. Can you maybe just give us a sense of your confidence of hitting the target and what are the key swing factors at this point in time just in terms of being bottom of the range versus top of the range? Richard Fairbank : So yes thanks Ryan. Look I want to start by saying that I stepped out of my character and you might have wondered what happened to Rich Fairbank that you knew because I haven't you'd have to go way back a lot of -- a lot of years ago to where we have given EPS guidance because kind of to your point, I mean this is in the end the difference of large numbers and it's subject to very big swings associated with allowance and other things that can happen. So we generally and I want to make sure people know that I'm generally don't plan to be in the EPS guidance business. The reason that we kind of stepped out and did that last quarter was really more to show the market that while there's a lot of noise associated with some of these credit numbers, our story is our belief and growth math that the belief in what we could do on the efficiency ratio side, the momentum of the company, and our ability to successfully get there, I think we felt pretty confident about that but again we cautioned of course and to your point it's a pretty small range. So what is the biggest drivers of that? I mean the biggest driver still always is credit and in a world where everything's on balance sheet and small changes in expectations lead to you know this into the whopping allowance effect that is certainly something that is a probably at the top of the list for the biggest effect. On that one we feel good about the trajectory of growth math but we know that small, small changes can have effect. So we're certainly aware of that. I think that is the big one I think beyond that, the -- I think the trajectory of our spending on things like marketing, the seizing of growth opportunities, the timing of progress on our continuing quest for efficiency will also be factors that play into this and the other thing I would say of course that rates, interest rates they can always play a factor. But that's just a little window into our own dialogue with ourselves about this but when we look at those things while there is always risk associated with the guidance like this, we feel, we like our chances, we like our momentum here, and we continue to maintain that guidance. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Good evening. Just wanted to circle back on underwriting standards that you may have tightened over the past year and large part trying to get those vintages to perform in line with expectations. Have you seen or have you done an additional tightening for 2017 vintages are you comfortable in your underwriting standards there? Obviously it's hard to track FICO but, in terms of the mix how does that stabilize as well? Richard Fairbank : Yes, David, we one thing is of course this is hundreds of programs we're talking about and changes that we constantly do around the edges. But to generalize it was around the beginning of 2016 that we started tightening around the edges and we talked about that and it is that tightening that had led us to be pretty confident that in fact 2016 vintage was going to come in better than 2015. You may recall that we had talked about that and certainly had early indications consistent with that. Some of the slippage in the marketplace and relative to our expectations there was kind of -- we\u2019re now more these are more on par with each other. Over the course of this journey, watching the marketplace, the competitive environment, the greater supply, and continuing to look at all of our programs and where credit was coming in, to your question, we have continued to tighten a bit around the edges and important, but not only but probably the majority contributor to our reduced growth is just our continued tightening and particularly the tightening that's going on is less around the origination side and more about the timing, just the size of lines and the timing of line increases under the philosophy let's continue to really book the customers, take advantage of the window of opportunity. In our own time, we can choose when and how much to extend the credit lines that's more of a kind of stored energy that we get there. So and by the way in the marketplace is no doubt the marketplace become more competitive, so that's also contributed to our slowdown as well. But all of that said I think that we have high expectations for 2017 coming in as a very strong vintage. David Ho : Right. As a follow-up what kind of card growth year-over-year are you comfortable with while still maintaining your 2017 guide and obviously your the outlook for 2018 in terms of growth math diminishing, is it more in line with industry growth how do you think about kind of the range there versus the kind of the industry average growth year-over-year? Richard Fairbank : Well we're specifically not giving guidance year-over-year for card growth but I think you're asking what card growth, do we need to kind of be able to maintain our EPS guidance was that were you linking those two. David Ho : Yes. Richard Fairbank : Well because the reason I say that is the amount of card growth is look I think at this point for the rest of the year the amount of card growth is not that bigger driver on the EPS, it will have quite a bit of impact on next year's EPS and other things. But across the reasonable range of card growth that we would look at for the rest of the year, anything in that range probably wouldn't have that much impact on the EPS. Relative to next year's card growth we're not going to give guidance on that but I want to come back to my point that we're -- we continue to be all-in in terms of capitalizing on growth opportunities that are out there, they've gone from -- the growth opportunities have gone from exceptional to good. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Steven Kwok : Hi this is Steven actually filling in for Sanjay. Just wanted to see if you can elaborate around the issues that's pointed out in the CCAR planning process and how comfortable should we be that the problem will be remediated? Scott Blackley : Yes, hey thanks for asking the question and as you might expect, we're not really in a position to talk about kind of the Fed process around CCAR, that's all guarded by confidential supervisor information that we're not have liberty to disclose, so the things that I can tell you if you want to have the most that we can tell you is really to point you to the Fed CCAR report and they're going to give you the best description of kind of the issues that they thought that there were. I will only just reiterate the point that Rich made which is we are fully committed to meeting the requirements and resubmitting our capital plan within the timeframes that the Fed has established for us. Steven Kwok : Got it. And then the follow-up question is just around the sub-prime consumer behavior, have you guys seen any changes around the behavior of them? Richard Fairbank : I would say generally no. I -- we certainly note that the growth in revolving debt in sub-prime is higher than that in prime. By the way the last few months that's kind of settled down a little bit but it's still higher than prime. So we certainly have our eye on that. Of course that is also in the context of coming off of a base of a pretty big retraction -- retrenchment since the Great Recession. So we will keep an eye on the data about the consumer I mean the economic -- economy metrics. But beyond that we have not seen a lot of behavioral change, we have talked in prior conversations about the fact that there is some normalization generally going on that can have some in second quarter of 2016, we saw some as an industry effect not just the Capital One effect a little gapping out of some vintage performance that that all would be consistent with the marketplace moving along and getting a little more competitive and consumers getting a little bit more indebted. But beyond that, we haven't seen anything unique to the sub-prime space and that's why our strategy pretty much continues we've just been a little cautious around the edges. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Two questions one on how you were thinking about recoveries. We heard from some others recently that there's some pressure on pricing in recoveries and I know you're not using third parties as much as some other folks or may be if you can give us a sense to what you're seeing in the marketplace and how you anticipate that impacting you? Richard Fairbank : Betsy, yes, we don't sell as much of our charge-off debt as other people do but we still do participate in that market. But just pulling up overall on recoveries it's interesting recovery we always tend to look at that independently of other metrics but I've certainly seen over the years how recoveries move in tandem with a lot of other dynamics going on. So for example in this journey that we've talked about of the industry credit normalization some of the things were even our own expectations about credit performance we've found things were came in a little higher than, than we had expected. Recoveries was right in there as one of the little culprits in that. So we have seen generally some softening of recovery rates beginning in the third quarter of 2016 which continued into early 2017 they were stable in the second quarter but we'll have to keep an eye on recoveries and in many ways I think they will go in many ways as the overall credit market place goes. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. And then the follow-up just on the tax exposure right now you provided us just a spreadsheet showing us the exposure but wanted to understand how you're thinking about that in particular given that the criticized performing loan rate increased quite a bit in the quarter does that suggest that you were preparing to just build the reserve further as, as time goes on here? Scott Blackley : Yes, hey Betsy it's Scott thanks for the question. So a couple of thoughts here first of all as, we've been disclosing the details about the taxi portfolio for a few years because it's been an area that we want to make sure that our investors and others had a good insight into what our exposures where they're that\u2019s on Slide 17 in the material. We've got about 580 million of taxi medallions on the balance sheet as of June 30, 17% allowance coverage ratio so well provided for their. Of that around 530 million is New York City taxi medallions and I think that, at this point, it's well understood that with the arrival of Uber and other competition that there's a lot of pressure in the value of these medallions and we've been seeing that pressure actually in revenues and in cash flows for several years. And as a consequence of that we've actually been carrying and writing down our loans to the lower fair value or carrying value for several years. So we've -- we're kind of well on our journey to making sure that we keep these loans marked at market prices. In Q2 we had a total provision of expense on taxi around 55 million which was primarily charge-offs but we also build allowance which was all based on kind of our view of the changes in the value of medallions that happened in the quarter. I will tell you that I've read the comments from other banks that have come out recently I feel very comfortable with our marks and where we are on our portfolio and I just say kind of in terms of what we might see going forward, right now, we're working aggressively with our borrowers to restructure loans where possible we're taking steps to make sure that we're protecting our collateral. I think the allowance and our charge-off levels are indicative of kind of where prices are today but there's certainly a risk that if this market doesn't stabilize that we could be subject to further write-downs if we see, kind of fair values and prices drift further south. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Can you remind us what percentage of the cards within your partnership business or store only versus also general purpose cards that have a Visa, Master Card logo on them? And can be used for out of store spend and then are you seeing any kind of difference in customer payment behavior between the cards that are good at the partner store only versus the cards that can be used for general purpose spending. Scott Blackley : Hey Bill this is Scott we don't -- we don't actually breakdown in any detail kind of the partnership from our broader card portfolio that's not information that we're going to be able to provide you. Bill Carcache : Okay, I guess may be perhaps just if you could comment at a high level from your experience whether there's any customer kind of taking order preference for you know whether they're going to pay that private label store card first versus the general purpose card if you can any color on that at a high level would be helpful. Richard Fairbank : Bill -- I, we were not in the great recession; we were not big players in the partnership business. We did an acquisition since then but of course we couldn't resist but peek back and see what we could observe of in the Great Recession and under stress. I carry around an intuitive view and I certainly have not seen anything to inconsistent with this that in general the -- these co-brand cards, a defining thing that I would put on the co-brand cards that have a lot of out of stores spend and become like a primary spending vehicle. These things are top of the line and I think that that we would believe that they would lead the league tables in terms of resilience. We've all had a lot of conversation both in our partnership business and frankly across our whole commercial business about the woes of retail and what does that mean and I think that if you look back at the Great Recession I think that the private label card did seem to get hit harder. But one thing I would say in their defense is you move from a position of sharing economics to having the entire economics and I still think most people are motivated by the desire to payoff and keep a good credit record. So look I carry around the intuitive belief that our private label business probably runs a little bit more risk than that -- than the high end co-brand programs but that I haven't seen anything to cause us to say that I feel I think we still believe in these programs you're going to get the vast majority of customers to repay but it certainly is a risk. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Chris Donat : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to shift a little bit to expenses first with marketing Richard you talked about going from an exceptionally good opportunity -- an exceptional opportunity to just a good opportunity should we expect you to continue with sort of this level of marketing spend or does it get harder to attract the customers you want now that you're no longer in the exceptional opportunity for U.S card. Richard Fairbank : Yes, well so a bunch of things to say to that great question. First of all notice what we said that our dialing back in many ways is the dialing back of growth the slowing of growth is in many ways driven by more conservative choices about the timing and magnitude of line increases, how much credit line is granted at the outset those kind of things none of which really have anything to do with marketing. So, we continue to be all in on the origination of accounts and I don't -- I don't see any change in that and even by the way in dialing around the edges, dialing around the edges, those edges tend to be around approvals in the context of the same marketing it's just when we get hundred customers in there, there might be a few more percent that that might not make it through the -- the filter kind of thing. So that that is kind of point number one so, so what of which is our quest for pretty sizable growth of accounts continues and we feel pretty bullish about the prospects. The other thing is and other thing that I've learned over the years of being in this business. There is some investors feel like okay well there's going to be less growth therefore you don't have to spend money on marketing usually it almost works sometimes the other way because other people step up the table stake go up. And unless we really say okay in a particular segment, we're just not going to compete, it sort of have to pay more to get to stay to stay in place kind of thing. Now there comes a point where things get so irrational we have from time to time just pulled out of things but my point about the card business I still would call it more, it's just something that's more competitive but generally rationale. So we -- I think our investors should carry around the assumption that we're going to continue to be aggressive in our marketing and I think it's while the marketing efficiency is compared with the last couple of years, last two or three years that have been in the exceptional category, marketing efficiency is little more in the \"normal category\" but we're still all in on this marketing and I think that will continue. Chris Donat : Okay. Thanks for that and then just a follow-up quickly with Scott on the salaries were down $88 million quarter-on-quarter was there anything elevated either in the first quarter or unusual in the second quarter? Scott Blackley : Yes, in the first quarter we had a lot of just kind of the normal taxes and such that happens in the first quarter where that starts to run out into the second quarter, so that it doesn't carry through. So nothing unusual there and is more or less consistent with kind of the seasonal trends. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey guys thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Look we've had a interesting discussion about the impact of ride share on taxi medallion prices. How do you manage risk in the auto portfolio from ride share you\u2019re probably in the next year or two start to get back a lot of cars with a ton of miles on them. And I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s something you're thinking about in terms of risks or how you sort of account for that in terms of underwriting? Richard Fairbank : Rick, look I think you make a good point I think the -- I think there are a number of factors that while I must admit, I don't think we have put a real focus on I don't remember being in a meeting where we're talking about your specific point. I think if you pull up and think about the auto business and some of the longer-term issues all the pressure from the tech companies on the things like the ride sharing, you\u2019re talking about even looking further down the pike at what would be the impact of all the technology changes in automobiles and in the limit the driverless cars. But even on that, even before the day finally comes when we down the road we're all doing our work in the back seat and there is no driver long before that I think we all have to be very vigilant about what is the impact of technology change is there come to be I mean generally the quality of technology has sometimes allowed cars to last longer and has been a good guy in the auto business. But the question is will there be a tipping point where the old cars just don't cut it and the new ones are so much better. So this in fact I just want to pause for a second and just kind of seize the moment that one of the -- one of the things that I don't I think banks don't do that well I think Capital One did not do that well on things like Uber story is pull way up across all of our lending businesses and ask what is the impact given that industry after industry is being revolutionized, what is the impact especially I think in the commercial C&I business of the revolution that's going on in our clients' businesses and if we just go and make one loan at a time and do our nice underwriting standards we could wake up and have a lot of rude surprises like we did in the taxi kind of business. So I don't have a great answer for your specific question but one of the things that we put a lot of energy into Capital One is pulling way up and instituting not only I mean the conversation but instituting a kind of risk management process associated with the extraordinary revolution that's happening in our industries, in our clients' industries, and in some of our core businesses it's a great challenge. Scott Blackley : Rick, one other thing I would just mention we definitely in part of our underwriting practice in assuming that auction prices continue to fall is taking into account the longer lives of cars that our allowance is only 12 months, so it certainly isn't going to capture the shift in that you're talking about in terms of ride share. But part of the reason why we continue to really pay close attention to auction prices is there's a variety of risk that can impact that over time and when we're originating these loans, we're thinking about kind of all those risks as we do that which is a reason why we continue to plan for auction prices to move lower from here. Rick Shane : Got it. And again my point is not are there going to be fewer cars on the road because we use them more densely or is there going to be a technology shift that basically makes old cars obsolete? I'm actually thinking about the more immediate which is that I'm assuming of a fair number of customers who are taking loans from you guys with the idea that they might be in the ride share business and if the economics don't work out for them, those are cars that are very, very likely to come back and have very high mileage and I'm curious if one of the things that we're seeing against you guys or so quantitative, if we're seeing higher mileage on the repos that are coming back in? Scott Blackley : That I don't at the top of my head, I can\u2019t I actually can\u2019t give you an answer to that one, I can do some follow-up we can circle back with you but Rick overall we're taking into account all of those statistics and formulating kind of our expectations around auction prices and resale values. So I think that's kind of embedded in our assumption. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran : Hi, I\u2019ve got one question on fees and on technology and digitalization? On fees, it\u2019s a pretty strong quarter and in particular service charges have been a drag for a long time that are now up year-over-year and Interchange revenues up a little faster than spend volume. Can you maybe just describe is this any kind of inflection point or is it more quarter-to-quarter noise just fees actually was a pleasant surprise this quarter to kind of figure out what drove that? Scott Blackley : Yes, thanks Brian for the question. Non-interest income was up about 16% in the quarter. And there's a few things that are going on there, non-interest income per share is lumpier than net-interest income. It certainly doesn't move quite as consistently with loan volumes and so I just kind of go through and talk about a few of the drivers. So you're right that net Interchange was a large driver that contribute about $100 million in the quarter-over-quarter variance and if you think there we have the higher seasonal purchase volume which was favorable and then as usual we have kind of the normally quarterly adjustments to rewards liability expense those kinds of things that run-through there and can create some quarter-over-quarter volatility and we saw that this quarter. We also in the first quarter had some UKPPI expense that ramped through there, so that created just under $40 million of favorability when we look at the linked quarter and then kind of I just kind of also point out that in our commercial business that business has some lumpy fees that come in and we did see around $25 million of higher quarter-over-quarter fees. Those are businesses that that have a business model where they generate fees and normally we see them kind of a little bit there are some puts and takes at this quarter they just happened all kind of worked in our favor and so they all came in a positive way. But that's kind of the overall picture, I think they're all part of our business model but I would say that we would expect that that line item is going to continue to be a bit lumpy. Richard Fairbank : Brian I just want to add you asked if there's an inflection point in the Interchange thing. I think that we don't think that it bounces around a lot from quarter-to-quarter, this happened to be a quarter where there was strong Interchange but that's not necessarily a breaking point I think that we continue to expect Interchange growth in net Interchange revenues to be below growth in purchase volumes. And let us not forget last quarter, I think the growth was negative. So this thing is much better just quaint your eyes and look at like annual, annual trends in sort of the relationship between purchase volume growth and Interchange growth. Brian Foran : Maybe coming back to the closing remarks of the opening scripts, you made around digitalization, this is something really three years now you've been talking about in pretty organically and when you started it was kind of remember when you first said wrestle APIs, I had glue sounds like which call am I on but we've seen more and more banks come out and really start talking about, you\u2019re talking about two or three years later, so if I'm going to talking to investors that helps make it like okay see I believe was talking for so long is important but still find it's hard for people to kind of put some tangible parameters around it, how does digitalization and APIs and Middleware actually translate to better revenue or better cost. So I\u2019m sure there is some hesitance about telling your competitors everything you're doing but I wonder if there's are there one or two examples you could give backward looking, how this multi-year digital journey has started to produce benefits either greater revenue or less cost or a combination of both? Richard Fairbank : Yes, thank you, Brian. So first of all, we've been -- look I mean it was 20 some years ago that same phrase I use now it's a build I used it way back then which is build an information based technology company that happens to do banking competing against banks that happen to use information and technology. And I'm very struck that I've got the same battle cry 20 some years into that. But the other striking thing to me even though I think Capital One's pretty well positioned to do something like this is just how staggering the amount of change that that's going on and that will happen in the industry and the need to really transform ourselves across talent and infrastructure the way we work, how we develop software where really there's nothing that left unchanged. So where have we seen the -- where can you see the benefit, no one can disentangle, what -- no one can prove what happens when your customers are a lot more delighted. How that affects things like growth and retention and things like that but I just would say that and it's very easy Brian for you to I'm not going to rattle them all here there's a lot of various proof points associated with a dramatic increase in Capital One's the customer satisfaction, the go to the app store and look at the ratings on the App Store that between the digital experience, the customer experience go to our own -- go to our own website and look at the ratings that and reviews that people put up on our own account. There for a variety of reasons, one of which is our digital transformation we have had a tremendous momentum with customers that that, that is pretty linked to the kind of exceptional growth that we have seen look in the auto business I don't know if you've seen some of the technology that we're employing in the auto business associated with auto navigator, I would suggest take a look at that, that's pretty interesting. I can never prove to you what the contributions of delighted customers are on the growth front. Secondly on the marketing front there is there is an obvious and dramatic transformation going on in marketing and how it works and the growing role of digital marketing, digital marketing itself is got the word digital in it and it's about digital capabilities and in fact information based strategies that has been an important contributor to Capital One's success. The other thing that's going on is you've seen what's happening with our efficiency ratio, which got worse before it got better but the important thing is that it's getting better by a lot. And when I started on this journey I said that look I want to make one thing clear so, many banks are saying in there -- in their public statements we are going to sell fund our digital investment I say I've been saying to investors for years and it's really five years actually this -- this journey has been not the three that you necessarily refer to but that over this journey I said that I don't believe anyone can transform their company and be competitive in the future by self funding this transformation that is you've got to pay now and get benefits later. I also said that the biggest motivator of our digital investment is not the -- is not a cost objective it really is much better customer experience a -- building a way more dynamic well managed fast first to market better controlled all those other kind of benefits that come with this. All of that said it's very clear that we are increasingly reaping important sizable benefits and efficiency as a result of years of digital investment and the efficiency comes across the distribution channels of retail, call centers, operations, centers it also the transformation and how we work as long-term benefits many of which we've started to realize. So the interesting thing is a journey that was never motivated to be number one for the sake of cost savings something where it cost a lot that the costs were a lot higher than the than the benefits at the outset those relative meters are on their way to some significant change in position there and the -- so it is the efficiency ratio would be that the final place that I would point to. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Yes, hi thanks for taking my question and just one question. Going back year I think you're -- you were having better than industry card growth I think you were somewhat balanced between new accounts and line extensions. You now pulled that growth and I'm wondering has the composition of growth changed is it coming more from one of those aspects or the other and to the extent it's changing what does that mean to the risk characteristics going forward. Richard Fairbank : John, so we -- we had if you dial all the way back I may get my years slightly wrong here but I think around the well '13 timeframe we had what we called the brownout of line increase and that was driven by a new regulatory requirement that required you to obtain income -- customers income before we could actually do a line extension and implementing the whole way to obtain that data and so on led to a brownout in our line increases even as our originations were continuing at a reasonable level. Then what happened is the -- right around the time that we got the technology and the ability to address the regulatory requirement, that also coincided with sort of the big growth opportunity at Capital One it contributed to but also coincided with so that we had a surge in line increases and then a surge in young customers who are also eligible for line increases. So I flagged over the especially 2014, 2015 time period that we were having a more than probably normal level of line increases in the overall mix of our business. Over the past I'm getting my timeframes I'm only approximating here but something I would argue around to be around the beginning of 2016 we got into pretty much an equilibrium between line increases and originations themselves and we have generally been in that equilibrium ever since. To your point and to an earlier point that I said if anything our dial back more on the line increase side than the origination side of late so it is possible the mix between those two could move to the other side of equilibrium but I don't think these changes are big enough to call that out. But I think that the more -- the more important thing which is what we called out in the 2014-2015 timeframe that those were more than a the little bit more than their share of the line -- the normal share of line increases. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our last question from tonight is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Ken Bruce : Thanks, good evening. Nice quarter the first question I have is this really relates to losses and in the quarter for the U.S. credit card business is at 5.11 that was a pretty substantial improvement in the month of June just based on the monthly reporting is -- was there anything specific that impacted that June performance and had something on the order like close to 50 basis point improvement month over month. Richard Fairbank : Ken, no nothing that jumped out at us. One thing that were certainly were delighted to see the 47 basis point sequential quarter improvement in charge-offs but we always caution don't get too carried away with any one month. Because in fact as a point in the opposite direction that you obviously noticed the delinquencies after several months of going down actually went up a bit in the month. So they're kind of going in the opposite direction I think we looked at both of those, look we looked very carefully at every month worth of data but I think that we should all just squint our eyes a bit and look at a bit the bigger pattern and don't -- don't get too carried away with any one month of data. The big point is we still expect the growth math effects measured in terms of year-over-year increase in delinquencies and loss rates to moderate over the rest of 2017 to have a small tail in 2018 and in fact, we were just talking about this today that one of the quarters we're actually going to, say goodbye to the growth -- to growth math and it's and it's not going to really be newsworthy and we're going to be back and rising and our numbers rising and falling with the dynamics of the marketplace but we are growth math quarters are numbered here before we retire it which is a good thing. We look forward to that retirement party. Ken Bruce : I'm sure. There was a similar small shift but one if it continues could be have a substantial impact on that growth math but there's a the slight shift in the above 660 credit scores versus the below 660 credit scores; is that something that is a specific strategy of Capital One to accelerate one versus the other or is that just kind of a by-product of what you discussed around the trimming around the underwriting and so forth and if I could just make that a two part question you kind of answered Betsy\u2019s question around recoveries differently but have you seen a change in the charge-off debt prices that are in the market. Richard Fairbank : On the charge-off debt prices I do not have any reason. I haven't been in a conversation associated with that and I think that I would have heard about it if something was newsworthy there but I don't rely on me for a latest read on that. The -- let me talk about the sub-prime mix so, our sub-prime mix has been -- our first of all our strategy as a company is stayed very steady over the years and we've been going as you know right at the top of the market and all the way through to the higher end of the sub-prime market place and over the -- over the last couple of years basically during this growth surge you have seen our sub-prime mix grow from I'm doing this from memory but around 34% up to 37% last quarter and it dropped down to 36%. First of all I want to point out in the world of all the precision we all live by, these are rounded to the nearest integer. And sometimes the story is nothing more than a rounding story obviously when you go up several hundred basis points that that there's a trend there and what we've said is the -- the opportunity that we have seen in the sub-prime market place relative in and I'm now speaking in the -- in the years of 2014, 2015, also the lower competitor little bit lower competitive intensity there all of that contributed to sub-prime's share growing a little bit. The strategy is really the same, the number is settle down a little bit Cabela's is going to come along and hopefully everything works out perfectly there and it comes in and that will take a little bite out of the sub-prime mix as well. But the big story is I think we see the opportunity to be across the board you're probably right a little bit more of our trimming around the edges has been in the higher risk areas or higher loss areas so that that just brings the sub-prime thing in just a little bit but I, my main point is the more things change. The more they really stay the same. Jeff Norris : Thanks Rich and thanks everybody for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with slide three. Capital One earned $1.1 billion, or $2.14 per share in the third quarter. Netting the adjusting items in the quarter, earnings per share were $2.42. Adjusting items in the quarter, which can be seen on slide 13 in the appendix of tonight's slide deck, included the following : $108 million or $0.14 per share of restructuring charges related to realigning our workforce as our business continues to evolve and we change the way we work; $105 million or $0.14 per share related to the impact of closing the Cabela's acquisition in the quarter. This included $76 million of allowance build, and $29 million of deal-related costs. In addition to these two adjusting items, I would also like to highlight two notable items that impacted the quarter. First, we had $114 million or $0.15 per share related to the estimated impacts of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. We have included a slide in the appendix of tonight's deck outlining hurricane impacts. And secondly, we had $69 million of gains, or $0.09 per share, related to investment portfolio repositioning that we did during the quarter. Pre-provision GAAP increased 4% on a linked quarter basis, and 10% on a year-over-year basis to $3.4 billion. Provision for credit losses increased 2% on a linked quarter basis, and 15% year-over-year. We have provided an allowance roll-forward by business segment, which can be found on table 8 of our earnings supplement. Let me take a moment to explain the movements in allowance across our businesses. In our domestic Credit Card business, we built $330 million of allowance in the quarter. That includes $76 million for the onboarding of the Cabela's assets, and $35 million related to the estimated hurricane losses. We expect that the hurricane effects will impact delinquencies in the fourth quarter in charge-offs in 2018. Allowance in our Consumer Banking segment increased $16 million in the quarter, driven by a $23 million auto allowance build related to estimated hurricane-related losses. Net reserves in our Commercial Banking segment were impacted by the change in value of tax medallions during the quarter. As a reminder, since last year, all of our taxi medallion loans have been carried at the lower of cost or the fair value of the medallions. During the third quarter, we continued to see deterioration in taxi medallion values. This had two effects. First, we marked the entire loan portfolio to the lower fair value estimate. Second, we moved the remainder of our performing asset medallion loan portfolio into non-performing asset status. As a result of these effects, we took a net provision charge of $92 million, which was comprised of $167 million of net charge-offs for the updated portfolio valuation, and which was partially offset by $75 million of allowance release related to the loans that we moved from performing to non-performing status. Turning to slide 4. You can see that reported net interest margin was up 20 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by day count, higher short-term interest rates and asset mix. Net interest margin was up 29 basis points on a year-over-year basis, primarily related to higher short-term interest rates and asset mix. Turning to slide 5. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.7%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.6%. Consistent with my past commentary, based on our current mix of business, we believe our CET1 ratio is around destination levels. Quarter-over-quarter, our CET1 ratio was flat as dividends, our organic growth and the closing of the Cabela's transaction essentially consumed the capital that was generated. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on slide 9, which summarizes third quarter results for our domestic card business. On September 25, we completed the acquisition of the $5.7 billion Cabela's co-brand card portfolio. We're really excited to partner with Cabela's, a great retailer with a powerful brand and highly engaged and loyal customers. Scott already discussed the third quarter impacts of the acquisition from allowance build and deal costs, which are included in our adjusting items for the quarter. We expect purchase accounting credit marks on the acquired loans to temporarily suppress the domestic card charge-off rate through November. We'll continue to break out the Cabela's impact in our monthly credit 8-Ks through the end of the year. We also expect the addition of Cabela's to reduce the run rate of some of our domestic card metrics particularly delinquency rate, charge-off rate, and revenue margin going forward, all else equal. Compared to Capital One, the Cabela's portfolio has a lower margin and lower delinquency and charge-off rate, and our partnership includes a revenue and loss sharing agreement, which further impacts the metrics. Cabela's reduced our September domestic card delinquency rate by 21 basis points, and we expect the run rate reduction to be about 15 basis points. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we expect Cabela's to reduce the domestic card revenue margin by about 65 basis points. And after the impacts of the purchase accounting credit marks subside, we expect that Cabela's will reduce the run rate domestic card charge-off rate by about 25 basis points beginning in December. Turning to the third quarter results, ending loan balances were up $9 billion or about 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. Excluding Cabela's, ending loans grew $3.3 billion or 3.6%. Average loans were up 4%. Third quarter purchase volume increased 7.7% from the prior year. Excluding Cabela's, purchase volume increased 7.2%. Revenue for the quarter increased 5% from the prior year, largely in line with average loan growth. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.7%. Non-interest expense increased about 3% compared to the prior-year quarter. The efficiency of our domestic card business continues to improve. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.64%, and the 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.94%. Excluding Cabela's, the charge-off rate would have been 4.66% and the 30-plus delinquency rate would have been 4.15%. We've been guiding to a range of high 4s to around 5% for full year 2017 domestic card charge-off rate. With nine months of actual results already booked, we expect to come in at the high end of the range, both excluding and including the expected impact of Cabela's. We expect that impact to be favorable to the 2017 full-year charge-off rate by single-digit basis points. We expect the effects of growth math will continue to moderate with a small tail in 2018. As growth math runs its course, we believe that our delinquency and charge-off rate trends will be driven more by broader industry factors. Slide 10 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 5% compared to the prior year. Auto loans were up about $7 billion, or 15% year-over-year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage run-off. Ending deposits were up about 3% versus the prior year with a modest 6 basis point increase in deposit rate paid. Compared to the third quarter of 2016, auto originations were up 4% to $7 billion with balanced growth in prime, near prime, and subprime. As we discussed last quarter, competitive intensity in the auto finance marketplace remains a bit muted which continues to contribute to our growth. While we still see attractive opportunities for future growth, there are also reasons for caution in the auto industry, including expected declines in auction prices and an increasingly indebted consumer. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices, and we've dialed back on some less resilient programs even as overall originations have grown. As the cycle plays out, we continue to expect the charge-off rate will increase gradually and loan growth will moderate. Consumer Banking revenue for quarter increased about 10% from the third quarter of last year, driven by growth in auto loans as well as deposit pricing and volumes. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 2% compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans. Third quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily as the result of charge-offs and additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio. Moving to slide 11. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances increased 2% year over year. Average loans increased 3% year-over-year. Higher average loans as well as higher non-interest income in our capital markets and agency businesses drove revenue growth of 4% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Non-interest expense was up 13%, primarily as the result of growth, technology investments and other business initiatives. Provision for credit losses was $63 million, up $2 million from the third quarter of last year. Scott already discussed the third quarter charge-offs and allowance impacts from the taxi medallion portfolio. There were additional allowance releases related to the oil and gas and healthcare loan portfolios. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 96 basis points. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 4.3%, up 40 basis points from the second quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was up 1.2% (sic) [was 1.2%] (14:16), up 20 basis points from the second quarter. Credit pressures continued to be focused in the taxi medallion and oil field services portfolios. We provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on slides 16 and 17. Capital one continued to post year-over-year growth in loans, deposits, revenues and pre-provision earnings. We continued to tightly manage costs and improve efficiency, even as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation. And we continued to carefully manage risk across all our Consumer and Commercial Banking businesses. We're planning to resubmit our CCAR capital plan by December 28, and we remain fully committed to addressing the Federal Reserve's concerns with our capital planning process in a timely manner. We're affirming our 2017 guidance for domestic card charge-off rate, total company efficiency ratio and EPS growth. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we expect full-year 2017 domestic card charge-off rate to be at the high end of our range, with and without Cabela's. With nine months of actual results already booked, we expect 2017 total company efficiency ratio to come in at the low end of the 51s, net of adjustments. Over the longer term, we continue to believe we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement, driven by growth and digital productivity gains. And while the margin for error remains tight, we continue to expect 7% to 11% growth in EPS in 2017, net of adjusting items. Going forward, we expected to deliver solid EPS growth in 2018, net of adjustments, and assuming no substantial change in the broader credit or economic cycles. Pulling up, the pace of the digital and technology transformation of the world is accelerating. The seismic changes in the marketplace are creating huge fault lines that will forever change banking, and create defining challenges and opportunities. We are well on our way to transforming our company to capitalize on these opportunities. We are rebuilding our infrastructure with a modern technology architecture, and changing the way we work. We're delivering great value to our customers with simple innovative products, caring service, and a compelling digital experience. We are driving resilient high-value growth, and we are improving efficiency. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth in returns, as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval. Now, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Appreciate all the disclosure. I guess, first question on future allowance builds. I guess, when we look ahead over the next year, should we assume that the provisions more closely are aligned to loan growth, but not for that small tail of growth math going forward? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Hey, Sanjay. Thanks for the question. We've been talking about the effect of growth math on the allowance for some time. And with growth math moderating, and having a tail in 2018, there are still some effects that are yet to come into the allowance, but beyond that, I would expect that we'll see the allowance being driven by the growth in the portfolio, as well as factors that should be impacting the broader industry. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And a follow-up just on the overall health of the consumer. I guess, Rich, you've talked about how the consumers have more choices in terms of leverage for the last year-and-a-half or so. But as we look at the underlying state of the consumer, do you feel like their ability and health has been fairly consistent, and not deteriorated much over that period of time? Thanks. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, Sanjay, I feel like we're kind of in the credit cycle, sort of middle of the cycle. And I mean, you can \u2013 there are things that are locally relevant about the Credit Card business that are different from the auto business, but kind of pulling way up on the consumer. While we're very obsessive about indebtedness and competitive intensity, I think that we're in a relatively stable part of the cycle. The economic indicators continue to look pretty benign. We saw trends actually flagging over the last year-and-a-half, with more alarmed trends in the auto and the Credit Card business related to \u2013 well, in the Credit Card, on the supply side; the auto, on the underlying side. But just going back to Credit Card, the surge of credit card supply in the second half of 2015 and especially in 2016, we were concerned by that, and especially, if you extrapolate that. Since then, we've subsequently seen some pullbacks, which may be a response to the recent credit results of the card players. So, it feels like it's settled out a little bit and something that would be consistent more with the middle of the cycle; still moving forward as the cycle progresses there. Then, you look on the supply side, mail volumes, marketing levels, new originations, they're still intense, but they're settling out I guess a little bit here. Then, we look at the revolving debt data from the Fed, and that's down a little bit to 5.8% growth year-over-year. Now, obviously, that's well above the rate of income growth, but at least within the sort of middle of the cycle you feel things a little bit more settling out. We can't help but point out, though, the sustained growth in the other non- mortgaged debts : student lending, auto lending, installment lending, which have recently been growing at about a 6% rate. But if you look at the total level of that debt, it's significantly above the pre-Great Recession peak. And that's especially true of student lending. And then, the other factor on the consumer, of course, is the tremendously low sustained interest rates that they have enjoyed and, therefore, at this point, the debt servicing burdens and other measure of financial obligations are pretty stable, and they're lower than they were pre-Great Recession. So, if I pull way up on all of this, it feels kind of mid cycle. We spoke with a little more alarm over the 18 months and 12 months ago. But I think we'll obviously be very obsessive about this. But within this context, I think there are growth opportunities in our credit businesses. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, (23:00) please. Operator : And we'll take your next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. A two-part question. Scott, Can you maybe expand on the comment you made about some of the pieces haven't made it into the allowance just yet? And then, second, most issuers have provided 2018 charge-off guidance. So can you maybe give us a sense where you think, assuming a stable environment, charge-offs would be? And if you're not going to give us a specific number, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in terms of the impact of growth math, the impact of peaking of some of the vintages, and then everything else, including competition in the environment? Thanks. R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Ryan, on the allowance side, the allowance window is 12 months. We're sitting here at Q3, so we still got the fourth quarter of growth math in 2018 that we would expect will be impacting the allowance, so not more than just that. And then, in terms of kind of where 2018 is headed, I'll turn that one over to Rich. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yes. Hey, Ryan. On the \u2013 growth math has been the big story for Capital One for a long period of time. And it was \u2013 as a company that generally hasn't guided to credit loss numbers for the following year, we felt it was very important to step up and give guidance for the significant effects that were going to happen that we're going to be independent of the industry worsening or things like that. And the growth math is well on its way. You can see \u2013 I think September is a particularly strong month. But things bounce around for month to month. But you can see the growth math effects settling out. And as we said for a long time, we expect a small tail of growth math in 2018. So, the other thing to watch, of course, is the back book, because by definition, in fact, when we speak about this, our front book is 2014 and on, and our back book is 2013 and before. And our back book, and I think this is very much an industry point, it's been a good guy for a long time, stable or improving \u2013 really, mostly improving for many years, recently, kind of stable. We have recently seen a little bit of uptick in back book charge-off rates, and I think this is an indication of some industry normalization. If you look at the industry securitization trusts, which I know you do, Ryan, you can see this effect, you can see it in the Capital One securitization trust, you can see it in most of the other competitor trusts, particularly those that have not been added to recently. And I don't think that this is a different effect than all the things we talk about, about credit card industry moving to the middle of the cycle, but I think for all of us, we won't have the benefit of a tailwind from our back book anymore. And I think that \u2013 so, as we look forward about our own performance, growth math is going to be playing out, and we will be subject to the industry effects that will play out with others. There's only a little qualifier I'd say on that, when we watch the credit performance of others, some who are in a higher growth period will have their own growth math effects playing out in their numbers, that may be company specific. But for us, I think our numbers will be driven by a growth math that is at the more advanced stages plus the overall industry effects. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Rich, you guys obviously worked pretty hard to get Cabela's done. I know it's possible, but there could be some large private label RFPs out there. Would you look at those, given Cabela's, and the sort of resubmission? What is your thought process there? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, I mean I think that those would be independent choices on the merits of whatever the opportunity is. So I do want to say, this has been a long journey to get to the finish line on Cabela's, and we're grateful to be in that position. I think it's a great business. We're really going to enjoy that. But, as you know, our considerations are always very deal specific. But I don't think the having of Cabela's, or the Cabela's journey affects our view about opportunities going forward. I think we'll take those on the merits of the particular case. Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. Rich, with your (28:54) growth on the U.S. card business sort of slows to the 3% to 4% range, curious where you see the leverage in terms of that slower growth. Is it tighter underwriting? Is it reduced rewards? Is it reduced marketing and advertising? Where should we see the benefit of that come through, as you basically stop gaining so much market share? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Right, well, I mean, I don't speak of reduced growth so much in terms of, wow, we have reduced growth. I can't wait to take advantage of the benefits. I think there are things that happen when growth slows. The main thing I want to say is, we have capitalized with exceptional growth during a window, a kind of sweet spot in the competitive environment, and where the consumer was really where the whole industry was. That led to exceptional growth for several years. And as you know, Rick, we don't set growth targets. We want our people to very much take the opportunity that the market gives them. And we've been saying for some time, we think it's a more kind of \u2013 maybe I'll describe it as a normal opportunity at the moment instead of the exceptional one that is there. Now, the thing that took us from exceptional growth to sort of normal growth was a combination of a significant increase in the competitive environment. And then also in reaction to that, our own pullbacks around the edges, and it was just trimming around the edges and picking the stuff that I think had the most resilience and the best performance. So, what will all that mean? I think that we feel very good about the value that's being created by the 2017 vintage. We think the growth opportunities continue on a pound per pound basis, the sort of NPV per account or any of these things to be at the high end of our experience. But the slowing of the growth also advances growth math toward its destination, where in 2018, there is a small tail, and then this thing is pretty much \u2013 at some point, actually, an important point, the growth math turns into a good guy, down the road, as it moves more and more toward a back book status, and enjoys the \u2013 some of the real payoff from all of this growth really comes in, if you call kind of Phase 1, the upfront and rapidly increasing losses, Phase 2, the sort of stable part where everything's settling out, and then Phase 3 is, all other things being equal, generally the steady gradual improvement of these vintages as they season. And I think that will be a good guy for the sustained earnings power from this surge of growth that we've had. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I agree with you. We think what you guys did was you made significant investments in 2015 and 2016 that are going to come to fruition. We're starting to see it now, we think it continues through 2018. But at the same time, it does appear that whereas you were growing probably 2x the industry 18 months ago, you're growing 75% of the industry today. And so beyond the seasoning that you're talking about, which again, is virtuous, I'm wondering if there are going to be other impacts we should be thinking about in terms of either tighter underwriting or lower expenses? Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, I mean, the expense story I think you've watched it play out, and we are continuing to drive efficiency both from growth and from, frankly, just good old-fashioned old-school squeezing out of and being very cost efficient, as well as what I might call new school efficiency, which is really related to leveraging \u2013 in many ways, transforming how we work, how we leverage technology for our customers and for our companies. So, those are certainly good guys over time. Let me also just say one other thing about the industry growth and you may remember along the way I've been calling out from time to time, hey, we're in a period where there's \u2013 I remember in 2014, we said I just want to point out there's \u2013 we have an unusually high amount of line increases, because there had been some deferral of line increase in the couple of years prior to that. And so there's always kind of two growth stories that play out for any company. And in many ways, one relates to potential energy and one is kinetic energy in the sense of physics. But we do all our marketing, and so much of the energy of the company goes into generating accounts. And then, there are choices about when we grow the lines on those accounts. And that creates a kind of a second wind of growth opportunity. One of the things that has happened in Capital One for us over this last period of time is the actual growth machine of account origination has grown probably more than meets the eye. We continue to be pretty bullish, frankly, about the opportunity to continue to get accounts. And a lot of the, what we'd call trimming around the edges relates to let's just go a little slower, a little lower in terms of the line increases. Let's save some of that potential energy. But, partly, why you hear quite a bullishness in my voice is that the underlying marketing and origination and value creation machine at Capital One is going strong, and probably even higher than the, sort of, year-over-year growth numbers might indicate. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just follow up on that last point you were making about the potential energy. Should we think about your line increases as something where you apply sort of the same analytics, and run tests and experiments to see what sort of results you get with line increases? And do you use that potential energy as something that can stay in the bank for multiple years? Or is it something that deteriorates over time? Just curious how you think about it. Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.: Well, first of all, it's subject to all of the information-based strategy and massive, kind of, scientific testing that we have done for over two decades in building this company. The distinction that I would make, and I feel on a customer origination, a customer is right for an origination at a certain period of time, and if you don't get them at the right moment, you're probably not going to get that growth opportunity. When that customer is a customer, I think when you make the choices to increase line \u2013 I mean it's not like entirely just do it whenever it's right for us kind of thing, but it certainly is one that there's a lot more discretion, I think, and a lot more opportunity to feel the marketplace, really size up where we think the consumer is at the moment, and where adverse selection and various things are, and then make the choices. But a very common thing that we do, when we see things and see risk, kind of, bubbling out there in the marketplace and competitive things going on, we often pull back on that form of energy a lot more than we pull back on the kinetic form. And that's partly when you see going on here. So, Capital One growth engine is continuing on pretty darn strong. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay, just to clarify with Scott, the 7% to 11% EPS growth, that includes the adjusting items, but not the notable items, correct? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah. So, the 7% to 11% excludes adjusting items, but it includes the notable items. So it includes the effects of the hurricanes, and it includes the gains on the security sales. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Christopher Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. I want to ask a question on the deposit side, just sort of blocking and tackling what you're seeing as rates rise, and maybe you could comment on deposit costs and trends within the three segments, being Consumer Bank, Commercial Bank, and Other. I guess I'm surprised, and should we be disappointed that the bank segments are shrinking and Other is rising? Or is that part of the strategy? Thank you. R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah. Chris, why don't I, kind of, give you just a general high-level overview of where we're thinking about deposit betas? Directionally speaking, we would expect or overall betas are going to be more or less in the higher end of regional banking peers, really because we've got a deposit mix that includes more savings and money markets than many of our peers. So we'll be a little bit on the higher end there. But if you think about us just in total about \u2013 relative to the peers, most of our commercial deposits are operating accounts, and we have a smaller portion of commercial deposits than many of our peers. Our online deposits are typically have a relatively low average balance, so those are a little bit stickier than you might expect. And then, when I look at our branches, the rates in our branches are already competitive with traditional bank branch players. And then, finally, we have a relatively low amount of non-interest-bearing DDA. So, when I look at all those moving pieces, our portfolio level beta has really more or less been in the middle of the pack. When I think about \u2013 brokered obviously has a very high beta, and we'll certainly see that impacting our overall cost of funding for the company. But from an overall perspective at this point in the rate cycle, betas for us have moved pretty modestly. We think we've picked up some of the benefits of that in our net interest margin, but I still think there's a ways to go yet, before betas start to be more responsive to additional rate moves. Christopher Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And the segment question? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: In terms of the segment, the brokered deposits are sitting over in our Other category. If you look across all of the segments, you see a pretty small amount of movement in rate paid in Consumer. Commercial has a larger move, which is not surprising. I think those are deposits that are a little bit more sensitive to rate moves. And then with brokered, those have very high betas, and so you've kind of seen those move proportionally with the market. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Thank you. Good evening. You reiterated your guidance for 7% to 11% EPS growth in 2017. And I know that you're not giving 2018 guidance, but intuitively, shouldn't there be an inflection in 2018 growth relative to 2017, given that the provision will grow \u2013 or should grow more in line with loans, all else equal? Just trying to make sure I understand the dynamics of the moving parts. I know there are a lot of moving parts, but just all else equal, the provision dynamic, if maybe you could speak to that, Rich and Scott. R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, Bill, just remember, on provision, we still are talking about growth math in 2018. It's the tail of that, so we're starting to see the end of that effect. And so, on the one hand, you've got kind of the tail of growth math. We've got a little bit of the normalization of the back book that we're seeing through in the current quarter that's going to influence 2018. And then, on the positive side, a little bit of opportunity in terms of on where we're going with efficiency. But that's \u2013 we've made lot of progress on efficiency. So to continue to make progress there is really going to be tough work, but we think we can grind some of that out. So, on balance, we've got pressures going in different directions still, and that kind of gets us to solid EPS in 2018. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Okay. Thank you. If I may, for Rich, Rich, you've talked about, on one hand, issues surrounding increases in the supply of credit, and also growth math. Could you perhaps comment on the interplay that you foresee in card between, on one hand, those normalization headwinds from growing supply, and the seasoning effect tailwinds from slower growth on the other? Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. I mean, I think the \u2013 let's talk about our front book and growth math. So, we're in the advanced stages of that journey. And I think relative to a lot of players whose growth has come more recently, we're in the more advanced stages of that. And so, I think we will \u2013 as we say, we still need \u2013 there is a small tail of growth math for 2018, but that is moving farther along, where it goes from being sort of a bad guy on the overall credit numbers, to, in the longer run, actually becoming a good guy. So that's a little bit more of a long-term effect, but we certainly look forward to that, and that's one of the \u2013 it is in that part of the cycle for \u2013 it's in that part of the life cycle of the vintage, where a lot of the value gets created. And then, there's the back book which is going to move right along with the industry. I'd be very surprised if pretty much \u2013 all the seasoned back book of the competitors, I'd be surprised if they didn't pretty much move very closely together. We're not in the prediction business and I think we'll watch how those move. The only thing we did is just make note that, in recent months, there has been a bit of an uptick that you see across the industry. And again, I don't think it's surprising. I think what's been striking really about back books is they have been such a good guy for so long at some point. I think we're seeing natural industry cycle effects playing out there. So I think our biggest point is that the sort of unique story of Capital One and the growth math that was so intensely playing out because of the magnitude of our growth, I think relative to our seasoned books and relative to what the industry was doing, I think that's \u2013 it's mostly played its course. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks. Rich, clearly you're not tremendously concerned about the consumer. The auto business continues to grow quite nicely. And you talked about the origination machine on the card side being very strong. I guess what would it take for you to see in order for that to kind of trend upward again in terms of growth to a faster level, particularly given that, at least at this stage, the industry is growing somewhat faster, not a lot, but somewhat faster? I've got a follow-up also. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Moshe, Is that a credit card point? Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Credit card. Yeah, yeah, credit card, I'm sorry. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Credit card point, yeah. Well, see, in fact, it's interesting that you mentioned auto. You've known Capital One for a long period of time, and we read the marketplace, and then really seize opportunities when we see them. But a lot of times, we're near the top of the league tables or near the \u2013 sometimes we're near the bottom of the league tables of growth depending on the situation. So, we're dialing back during the period of time over the last 18 months, when there was a surge in industry supply, there was a surge in growth of subprime supply in the industry where you started to see credit metrics coming in a little bit higher than expected. And that has mostly characterized the journey over the last 18 months. I did mention that, in response to some of these effects, it appears that the industry has dialed back a little bit. Several players have actually talked about dialing back. And, Moshe, that could open up more opportunities. We're not planning on it. We need to see validation before we do that. But I feel better about the industry and what it has to give us now than I did say a year ago when we were saying, boy, you look at second quarter 2016 for the whole industry, vintage curves were gapping out a little bit, and there were a lot of things bubbling that I think frankly have settled out a little bit between then and now. So, we've got our underlying origination machine going. If we see more opportunity, we'll certainly take advantage of it, but we're not here to predict that. If you look at the auto business, Moshe, you have seen how much we have moved from capitalizing on a growth opportunity after the Great Recession \u2013 in the early stages in the wake of the Great Recession, growing at really pretty high rates for years. We started speaking alarm about underwriting practices, we pulled back quite a bit. Then the competitive situation softened and we really stepped into it, and leaned into it again, so we will always be very vocal about these opportunities. I think that paradoxically, while the actual growth numbers for Capital One are down, our bullishness about sort of the quality of the opportunity, and the bullishness that the card business is not sort of running away \u2013 the industry isn't running away with things is actually up a little bit. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thanks. Just as a quick follow-up for Scott, you talked a little bit about deposit betas. We don't have the third quarter numbers yet, but back in the second quarter, your benefit from a rising rate environment kind of ticked down over the course of 2017. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 because it seems to be that you're a little more \u2013 I don't know if it's more conservative or actually have a less beneficial outcome than some bank peers into a rising rate environment? R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.: Yeah, I think, Moshe, if you looked at, as you obviously have, our rate risk disclosures, you can see that we're pretty close to flat against kind of where forwards are headed. And we are modestly and have been modestly asset sensitive for small changes in rates. We're more liability sensitive for larger changes in rates, but we certainly aren't trying to place a bet on where rates are moving. We're trying to be pretty neutral to where forwards are headed. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And our final question tonight comes with Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hello? Hi. Two questions. One, just on the mix of the portfolio with the above and below 660. Obviously, you put that in your deck. Just wanted to get a sense as to when you're thinking about portfolios, does it matter to you whether or not that portfolio would come in and skew the split you have here of above and below 660, the 65/35 that you have this quarter, or if you'd be willing to let that skew change in any material way? Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, Betsy, we would take that one case \u2013 one opportunity at a time. As a general observation from years of doing this, when we have looked at subprime skewed portfolios, in the card business, we have tended not to be comfortable with the risk, and especially, the amount of credit line that has been extended to so many customers. Cabela's interestingly, obviously is an acquisition at the top of the market. It did move the metrics of our mix, but we just really liked that particular opportunity and we went for it on its own metrics. But I think over time, it is more likely that you'll see Capital One in pursuit of higher end opportunities than lower end opportunities just because of the two decades of experience we have in the sort of upper end of subprime. And we're very familiar with the many dangers that can come when folks haven't underwritten it conservatively enough. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, no, that's helpful. And then, my follow-up was just on how you're thinking about the benefit of the digitization on expense ratio over time. I'm not asking for what 2018's going to be but as you think more on a three to five year kind of timeframe, do you feel that the investment spend that you're making today is something that could materially move the expense ratio from here? Or it's more likely to be a grind, grind, grind? I guess my question is, is there a step function you see coming? Or are we grinding our way through to better efficiencies over time? Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, I'm a big believer that investment in technology ends up being a good guy. Well, it doesn't happen automatically. But investment in technology the way that we're doing it by not just putting a piece of technology in or not just building an app, or some customer-facing thing, but really focusing on transforming from the bottom of the technology stack up. Our foundational technology, and also leveraging that to transform how we work, I think that's going to be a significant good guy way down the road. On the way to that journey is a lot of technology investments. So, as you may recall, Betsy, over the last number of years, we've been saying, look, we're investing a lot in technology, and there are two meters that are running. One is the increase in investment in technology itself, which has been significant over that period of time. And another meter is, the cumulative run rate benefits that we also are now starting to generate from that technology investment, combined with really proactively transforming how we work. The nice thing is, I think that second meter of the cumulative benefits, that's a meter that will keep growing. I just want to say along the way, we continue to invest in technology a lot. I don't think a day will come when we say we have arrived. We're not going to keep investing in technology. But what happens is, the second meter, the benefits of this are going to just keep increasing over time. And so, I think it is a contributor to long-term better efficiency for the company. There's no moment of \u2013 there's not, like, in our near future, a step change in economics. But one thing that I think we're very focused on at Capital One is, and a very critical way that investors will get paid is through improving efficiency. And to do that, both through the old school techniques of just really trying to manage tightly, but then really getting so much of the opportunity from the transformational opportunities that technology gives, that's what this journey is about. It's a long-term journey, but I think you can already start to see the benefits. And I think you will gradually see more and more of them over time. Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.: Thanks, Rich. Thank you, Scott. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the conference call tonight. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great evening.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome, everybody to Capital One's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott? Scott Blackley : Thanks, Jeff. Turning to slide three, I will cover results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Capital One posted a net loss of $971 million or a loss of $2.17 per share. Excluding adjusting items we earned a $1.62 per share in the fourth quarter and $7.74 for the full year of 2017. Adjusting items in the quarter, which can be seen on slide 14 in the appendix of tonight's slide deck, included the following : $1.77 billion or $3.61 per share of tax expense related to the impacts of the tax act. $76 million or $0.10 per share of restructuring expenses largely related to the shutdown of our mortgage originations business. And $31 million or $0.07 per share from the build in our U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve. In addition to the adjusting items in the quarter, I\u2019d also like to highlight a few notable items that also impacted the quarter. $169 million or $0.22 per share of charges for a mortgage rep and warranty settlement which is included in our discontinued operations. $113 million or $0.15 per share of charges related to our Commercial Taxi Medallion lending portfolio. Before I go into our results for the quarter, I\u2019d like to spend a minute on a few tax reform items which are highlighted on slide four. The total net impact of tax reform on Q4 earnings was $1.8 billion of which the biggest piece was the DTA write-down reflecting the change in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. For 2018, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 19% plus or minus. I\u2019ll caution that since tax reform was only recently passed there is still the potential for adjustments to all of our current tax related estimates. Pre-provision GAAP earnings decreased 5% on a linked quarter basis. Provision for credit losses increased 5% on a linked quarter basis as a smaller allowance build compared to the third quarter was more than offset by higher charge-offs. We have provided an allowance roll-forward by business segment, which can be found on table 8 of our earnings supplement. Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our domestic Card business, we built $118 million of allowance in the quarter driven by seasonally adjusted growth and the effects of the small tail of growth math on credit losses in 2018.  Allowance in our consumer banking segment increased $29 million in the quarter. The allowance in the quarter was driven by a planned accounting change to accelerate timing of charge-offs of repossessed vehicles which was partially offset by an allowance release as hurricane-related losses came in lower than our prior estimate. Net reserves in our commercial banking segment were impacted by our move of a significant portion of our Taxi Medallion business to held for sale. We\u2019ve marked that portfolio to our estimate of a reasonable market clearing price and coupled with other Taxi related adjustments, this drove provision expense of $113 million in the quarter. In the quarter we settled the mortgage rep and warranty litigation matter which drove a loss of $160 million -- $169 million in discontinued operations. With this settlement, we have closed all of the material active litigation from our legacy rep and warranty related exposures. Turning to full year 2017 results, Capital One earned $4.1 billion or $7.74 per share on an adjusted basis. Adjusted pre-provision earnings of $13.4 billion were up 11% year-over-year as higher revenue more than offset higher non-interest expense. Net income for 2017 on an adjusted basis was up 4% as higher pre-provision earnings more than offset higher provision for credit losses. Full year efficiency ratio was 51% excluding adjusting items down from 53% in 2016. Turning to slide five, you can see that reported net interest margin was down 5% or five basis points from the third quarter primarily driven by lower domestic card yields from the full quarter impact of the Cabela\u2019s portfolio, as well as slightly higher rate paid on consumer deposits. Net interest margin was up 18 basis points on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by higher mix of card assets on the balance sheet and the benefits from higher short-term interest rates. Turning to slide six on common equity tier 1 capital ratio, on a Basel III Standardized basis was 10.3% which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.2%. We continue to believe that CET 1 under stress is our binding constraint. After digesting the effects of tax reform and adjusting our capital plan, we believe our CET 1 ratio on a fully phased in basis will trend back towards the mid-10% range. Lastly, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve at the end of December, while we cannot comment on any aspect of our regulatory feedback we are committed to addressing the Federal Reserve\u2019s concern with our capital planning process. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks Scott. I\u2019ll begin on slide 10 with fourth quarter results for our domestic card business, which include a full quarter of impacts from the addition of the Cabela\u2019s portfolio. The run rate Cabela\u2019s impact on charge-off rate, delinquency rate and revenue margin played out as expected in the fourth quarter. Ending loan balances were up $8.2 billion or about 8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding Cabela\u2019s, ending loans grew about 2%. Fourth-quarter purchase volume increased 15% from the prior year. Excluding Cabela\u2019s, purchase volume increased about 8%. Revenue for the quarter increased 4% from the prior year; revenue margin for the quarter was 16%, down 73 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by the expected 65 basis point impact from Cabela\u2019s. Non-interest expense increased 1% compared to the prior year quarter. The efficiency of our domestic card business continues to improve. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.08% and the 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.01%. Excluding Cabela\u2019s, the charge-off rate was 5.36% and the 30 plus delinquency rate was 4.18%. The full year 2017 charge-off rate was 4.99%. Excluding Cabela\u2019s, the charge-off rate was 5.07%. In the second half of 2017 we\u2019ve seen the effects of growth math moderate and we continue to expect a small tail in 2018. As growth math runs its course, we expect that our delinquency and charge-off rate trends will be driven more by broader industry and economic factors. Slide 11 summarizes fourth-quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans grew about $2 billion or 3% compared to the prior year. Average loans were up $2.6 billion or 4%. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up $3.9 billion or 2% versus the prior year with a 12 basis point increase in deposit rate paid compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. In the quarter, we exited the mortgage originations business. We determine that our originations business did not have sufficient scale to be competitive in a market where scale really matters. Scott discussed the adjusting item related to our exit, which runs through the other category. While fourth-quarter auto originations were down 5% compared to the prior year quarter, the auto business continues to grow with Ending loans up 13% year-over-year. Competitive intensity in auto is increasing, but we still see attractive opportunities to grow. We remain cautious about used-car prices and our underwriting assumes that prices decline. As the cycle plays out, we continue to expect the charge-off rate will increase gradually and loan growth will moderate. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased about 9% from the fourth quarter of last year driven by growth in auto loans as well as deposit spread and volumes. Non-interest expense for the quarter decreased 3% compared to the prior year quarter driven by our ongoing efforts to tightly manage cost. Provision for credit losses was down from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily as the result of a smaller allowance build. Compared to the sequential quarter, provision for credit losses increased, driven by additions to the allowance that Scott discussed. Moving to slide 12 I\u2019ll discuss our commercial banking business. Fourth quarter Ending loan balances decreased $2.3 billion or 3% year-over-year driven by our choice to streamline and pullback in several less attractive business segments, late year pay downs on agency multifamily loans and the write-down of Taxi Medallion loans. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 average loans increased 1% and revenue was up 2%. Non-interest expense was up 11% primarily as the result of technology investments foreclosed asset expense related to the Taxi portfolio and other business initiatives. Provision for credit losses was $100 million up $34 million from the fourth quarter of last year. Scott already discussed the fourth-quarter impacts from the decision to move most of the Taxi Medallion portfolio to held for sale. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 85 basis points. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 4.1% down 20 basis points from the third quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.4% down 80 basis points from the third quarter. The ongoing recovery in oil and gas markets has improved the credit performance of our oil and gas business. We\u2019ve seen our E&P portfolio return to health but we continue to see credit pressure in oilfield services. We\u2019ve provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for the oil and gas portfolios on slide 17. Capital One continued to post year-over-year growth in loans, deposits, revenues and pre-provision earnings. We continued to tightly manage cost even as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation, and we continued to carefully manage risk across all our consumer and commercial banking businesses. We met our guidance for 2017 coming in at the high end of our domestic card charge-off rate guidance, the low-end of our total company efficiency ratio guidance and delivering 7.4% growth in EPS net of adjustments. Our 2017 results put us in a strong position as we enter the New Year. Loan growth decelerated in 2017, but we still see opportunities to book attractive and resilient loans in our card, auto and commercial banking businesses. Marketing was down a bit in 2017. We expect marketing in 2018 will be higher than 2017. On the credit front, the impact of growth math on our overall charge-off rate began to moderate in the second half of 2017, and we expect a small tail of growth math in 2018. As growth math runs its course, we expect that our domestic card charge-off rate trends will be driven more by broader industry and economic factors. Our efficiency ratio improved significantly in 2017. Over the long term, we continue to believe we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gain. We expect the new tax law will also give us a significant boost. In the near term, we expect a majority of the tax benefits will fall to the bottom line. Why only a majority? I believe markets behave in predictable ways passing some of the benefit from companies to consumers and the economy. A surge in tax benefits as a way of working its way into the marketplace through increasing competition including higher levels of marketing, lower prices and higher wages. Responding to these actions will likely consume some of the tax benefit in 2018, and these competitive effects will likely increase over time. As all these effects play out, we will continue to lean into our long-standing investments in talent, technology, innovation and growth. We are bullish about the long-term benefits of our investments. Taking all of this into account, we expect that our current trajectory, coupled with the new tax law will enable us to accelerate 2018 EPS growth net of adjustments and assuming no substantial adverse change in the broader economic or credit cycles. Pulling up, in 2017 we advanced our quest to build an enduringly great franchise with the scale, brand, capabilities and infrastructure to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our industry and our society. We made strategic moves to position our businesses for long-term success. We continued to grow and serve customers with ingenuity and humanity. Our digital and technology transformation is accelerating, and we delivered solid near-term financial results for shareholders while investing in our future. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth and returns as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval and market conditions.  Now, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff Norris : Thank you Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, investor relations team will be available after the call. Leanne, please start the Q& A Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey good evening guys. Rich, maybe you could expand a little bit on the last comment regarding accelerating EPS. I guess, one, would that exclude the benefits of tax. And when I look back on 2017, you may 7.74 yet there was almost $0.50 of notable items, you had business exits like mortgage [indiscernible], so can you maybe discuss or give us a little bit more color on the components of the accelerating EPS? And I have one follow up. Scott Blackley : Ryan, this is Scott. I\u2019m going to start and talk about the kind of some of the items that were in 2017. If you think about it, there\u2019s -- in this business we always have a few things that come and go. We make decisions about trade-offs along the way. So we feel like 7.74 is a good benchmark to start our guidance for 2018. Beyond that, I would just say that we call those items out as notable because I think they are important for you to understand kind of the trends but as I mentioned, I think there\u2019s trade-offs that we make along the way when we look at those kinds of things. Rich? Richard Fairbank : So Ryan as you know, we typically do not give EPS guidance, and we are not giving a specific 2018 EPS forecast. In the prior quarter we told you that we expected solid EPS growth and then tax reform passed, which is clearly a good guy for EPS growth, although we expect the benefit to make its way into the marketplace over time. The timing of how that plays out is hard to predict. So all said, we expect that our current trajectory coupled with the new tax law will enable us to accelerate 2018 EPS growth net of adjustments, and assuming no substantial adverse change in the broader economic or credit cycles. Ryan Nash : Got it. Maybe I could on a different point, so when I think about some of the comments that you made on credits, we have growth math fading, last quarter, there was mention of back book normalization, you have Cabela\u2019s plus the impact of tax reform should be positive. So we heard from another issuer that some of their recent vintages have been, have been getting better, so while I understand that you don\u2019t want to give credit guidance or for EPS guidance, can you maybe just talk about how you are thinking in terms of credit going forward, and that and I guess a small piece for Scott, you talked about a small piece from growth math and seasonal growth how should we think about reserves going forward? Thanks. Scott Blackley : So yes, we\u2019ve said that in 2018 growth math still has a small upward tail. And then eventually it becomes actually a good guy in the long run. The earlier vintages of our front book, vintage 2014 and 2015 have stabilized and eventually they\u2019ll start coming down gradually as I mean that would be our expectation. Now of course losses on the newer vintages of our front book 2016 and after which are earlier in their seasoning process are still increasing. So when we take the blend of all of that the risk of the overall front book is still increasing modestly in 2018. But we are getting pretty close to the point when maturation on earlier vintages of growth fully offsets the impact of newer growth and this is all again kind of what we call growth math. Richard Fairbank : Ryan, just to come to your last question on reserves, from here going forward I think that the biggest drivers of what\u2019s going to impact the allowance as Rich said, really are the things that are going to be impacting our overall loss rate, which are broader industry events in trends, economic factors and the growth that we have during each period. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you, good evening. Maybe to approach Ryan questions a little bit differently. When we think about expenses in 2018, I think Rich you talked about the efficiency ratio and Scott that 51% and the fact that marketing might go higher, could you talk about how that efficiency ratio might trend through 2018 as you are reinvesting a little bit of the upside from tax? Richard Fairbank : Well my primary comment about tax, the tax effect was how we think over time, and I\u2019ve seen if - I think there are some parallels that I\u2019ve seen in the past of how these things have a way of making their way into the marketplace. So again that one we\u2019ll have to see over time. With respect to the efficiency ratio, we\u2019ve been working so hard on this, and it\u2019s kind of a blend of what I might call old school and new school progress, old school being just the classic really work hard and drive every penny of savings, and new school of course really is leveraging the benefits of the extraordinary technology transformation that is literally going to change everything about how the industry works. It\u2019s certainly going to change everything about how Capital One works and change how the business works, how the customer interaction model works, and it will affect how we work, and the nature of our underlying operating model. Now that takes many, many years. That\u2019s a continuous evolving process, but we\u2019ve seen 300 basis points over the last couple of years of benefits. And that that\u2019s a blend of the old school and new school kind of thing. We don\u2019t have any -- we are not making any specific guidance about 2018, and frankly efficiency ratio can vary in any given year. But I think over the long run, we continue to believe that we can achieve gradual efficiency improvements driven by growth and the many types of productivity gains that come from technology transformation. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And maybe on credit quality just specifically when we think about where the opportunities might arise going forward I mean is there a greater opportunity go a little bit more downmarket as a result of some of the tax benefits in terms of profitability. I mean, can that impact credit quality as we look ahead. And then just to clarify on Taxi Medallion, I mean should we expect, that that portfolio will be sold and there wouldn\u2019t be any major impacts going forward? Scott Blackley : Yes, why don\u2019t I start with the Taxi Medallion? So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we put the majority of that book in held for sale. That means that I\u2019ve got an expectation that we are going to be able to sell that within a reasonable period of time. We marked it at a price that we thought was a reasonable estimate of where that would clear the market. So while we\u2019ll have to see where that settles out we feel pretty good that we\u2019ve put that risk principally behind us, and that we won\u2019t be talking about that any further. But again, that\u2019s a portfolio that at this point it\u2019s going to be carried at the lower cost to market. And so if we did see any adjustments, we would make those along the way. Richard Fairbank : With respect to the tax reform, the impact on the U.S. consumer and maybe specifically the subprime consumer, I\u2019ll give you just a few thoughts on that. I think, it\u2019s hard to predict how this will play out. If likely there will be positive effects, both to the consumer and to the broader economy. While there is some direct benefits to the consumer, I think with respect to this particular tax reform the primary benefits of this are indirect, and they are going to play out over time, and in many ways it\u2019s a little bit a flip side of the same coin of what I was saying with respect to what happens to the tax windfall relative the company, and I believe firmly that it\u2019s just overtime makes its way into the marketplace in for in terms of more competition, lower pricing, higher wages, more investment and these things do have an impact on consumers. Now with respect to the subprime consumer, it\u2019s possible that this might have a stronger impact. More subprime borrowers struggle with day-to-day expenses and modest increases in wages, and take-home pay will likely have a somewhat differential impact. But I think we shouldn\u2019t exaggerate this impact because many subprime book borrowers are doing well in the current economy with relatively solid incomes. So we are not baking any impacts into our outlooks for subprime credit although we are certainly hopeful that tax reforms will have a benefit. I do want to put a cautionary note relative to the credit opportunity and that is because my primary point about tax reform and trying to predict how it plays out is one of predicting competitive effects and the way things move into the marketplace. I think the biggest driver, I mean, other than very big changes in the economy, the biggest driver of our appetite to grow credit and particularly in this segment is really driven by the supply and demand \u2013 the supply and demand that we see in the credit marketplace. And if we look back to the -- I think there's an interesting lesson. I myself want to go off -- go back and dusted off a little bit from the 2005 bankruptcy reform. The 2005 bankruptcy reform created somewhat of a windfall in the marketplace. And what in that period of time now of course there were lot of factors going on. But we saw that windfall make its way into the marketplace in the form of more up marketing, more aggressive pricing and frankly in that particular case also, and again there are other things going on, more aggressive underwriting. And so, at the end of the day the competitive intensity became problematic. So, I think \u2013 so we\u2019re going to have to see how this thing plays out, but we are not putting into our credit forecasts or really our business growth forecast, the direct impact of this because we\u2019re going to watch as it plays out. But if I pull up, I'm hopeful that we can find similar growth opportunities in the near-term by overall how the marketplace appears to us and one factor would be this one. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hi, Rich. If you look at the December domestic card delinquencies on a year-to-year basis, they actually improved a little bit again in December. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that trending? And then, I think in the past on the charge-off rate in card you sort of have called it out when you expect it move. So is no news, good news meaning that maybe you could come hang out around this sort of five -- low 5% range? Richard Fairbank : So, Don, I think that our domestic card charge-off rate increased on a month-over-month basis by 21 basis points between November and December. And that's kind of in line with what we would expect from normal seasonality. Now when things come in just consistent with seasonality, that's a good thing because there is also other effects, growth math and things going on, so we certainly saw that as a good month. On a year-over-year basis the increase in our December losses was a few basis points more than December, I mean, more the November, excuse me, but the underlying trend of moderating year-over-year increases is clear. So it\u2019s another month of performance that's consistent with our own expectations of how growth math works. But with every month that plays out we like the confirmation of that and so we view it as a good thing. But I again noticed our guidance about a small tail of growth math etcetera. Our commentary on this is really unchanged from the last quarter and frankly several quarters, but this is certainly playing out consistent with how we would've expected. Don Fandetti : Got it. We were sort of looking ex Cabela's on the delinquencies, but quickly on the auto delinquencies, it looks like they were up a good bit year-over-year? Was there some type of one-time adjustment? Richard Fairbank : Yes. On auto nonperforming loan side there was an impact of -- we made an accounting adjustment to include some of the repossessed assets as loans, we move those at other, that\u2019s impacting that. I don't think that I can recall anything otherwise that would impact DQs particularly in the quarter. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Richard Fairbank : Sorry, I think our own view of the data we see over the -- the monthly data we've seen this quarter is consistent with our view that we've been talking about that, I think the auto business is really performing quite well from -- and probably the industry right at this moment performing quite well. From a credit point of view, we worry about the things that the risk that are out there like used car prices in particular and possibly a increase in competitive activity, but for right now my observation is the auto marketplace is in a pretty good place competitively. The competitive intensity steps up a bit in the fourth quarter which is why our origination volume was down off the kind of unusually high levels of a year ago where the competition had backed off quite a bit. But I think we're still seeing generally performance that\u2019s consistent with the middle of the cycle and something that confirms our own confidence and happiness about our own choices and are performance. Jeff Norris : Now, next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good evening. How are you? Richard Fairbank : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Two questions. One just on the growth math, how much growth math do you think was in this quarter versus the prior quarter, I\u2019m just trying to understand if we saw some deceleration already that you\u2019re looking for? Richard Fairbank : We are seeing deceleration, but my point is not so much a \u2013 well, I mean, yes, we've seen it in the second half. We saw the deceleration in the third quarter. I'm speaking of our growth math itself and that's the impact on the year-over-year loss rate driven by our front book. So, we saw deceleration in the third quarter and again on the fourth quarter. So, I mean, every quarter there\u2019s small effect, but it's all part of the natural phenomenon here and I think that's why we expect a small tail in 2018. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just the follow-up on the use of the tax benefit, you are in a position where you could have pretty important impact on your earnings if you ratchet up the marketing. And I get your point that in prior periods when you had one-time changes, there was lot of heavy competition that might not have had a long tail benefit to it, but we're in a different spot now with the pretty permanent decline in the tax rate. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you think that -- given that more permanent tax rate change doesn't make us to wait and see what others do or take a leader position in trying to get that incremental customer in the door with a stepped-up marketing program? Why wait to see what the competitors do? Richard Fairbank : Well, Betsy, I think that we have a hypothesis about how this thing plays out over time. I think we already carried into -- on Capital One we carry an investment agenda that we believe very much in and that we will continue to invest in. I think we feel pretty good about the growth opportunities that are there. We\u2019re going to take advantage of them. But I think we are going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue doing the kind of things that we've been doing. And my primary point -- my kind of two points about the tax law is, one, we\u2019re reluctant to give guidance to investors about how much this is going to drop to the bottom line because I think it will have a way over time to make its way into the marketplace. And of course we\u2019re going to need to respond to that. And my other point is that, I think there will be impacts that it has on the consumer and I think in the near term particularly some of those may be good, but I think what -- we already feel pretty good about our growth opportunities. Marketing is going to be a little up over last year and we\u2019re going to just watch very carefully how this plays out. I'm struck by others who say -- who are so confident about what percent of the tax impact is going to fall to the bottom line because I don't feel that we have that particular ability to predict this because I think it's the marketplace thing. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Chris Brendler : Hi. Thanks. Good evening. I just like to talk about the domestic card for a second, growth ex Cabela's has slowed down to low single digits, it\u2019s obviously a competitive market but you're still out there with this pretty aggressive marketing on both the Quicksilver and Venture products. Is that something that you expected to rebound in 2018? Or is just a new normal? Thanks. Scott Blackley : Well, I think you've seen our purchase volume metrics there and purchase volume growth continues to be pretty strong. The slower growth of Capital One outstandings is probably partly a comment on the marketplace a little bit, but the direct impact to the marketplace, but I think it's more so a comment about the choices that we have made. So I want to you know we kind of think back to the last -- really back to 2014 in sort of early to mid 2014 we said that we anticipate an outsized growth benefit and told the marketplace we expected to grow significantly. And in the second half of 2014, all through 2015 and into 2016 we grew pretty much at the top of the league tables. Around that time, we started flagging that we are concerned about certain supply -- competitive supply issues out there. We\u2019re very carefully monitoring what's going on in our own metrics. And we started to dial back a bit. Not a huge dial back, but dial back progressively around the edges in 2016. In early 2017 you remember when we said that we saw in our own data and in industry data a gapping out of vintage curves a bit. In the second quarter 2016 vintage and we said it striking that it happened, but it's not surprising because this is sort of the natural effect. So, over this period of time we have been as the marketplace has been increasing in supply we have dial back and want to be sure that we can get confirmation about exactly where that read is with respect to the consumer and the impact of competition. Over the course of this year competitive intensity has settled out a little bit. Supply -- the growth of our revolving credit, it has slowed down. It\u2019s still above GDP growth of course, but I think there are a number of signs that things are settling out a little bit and that's a good sign. What we worry about is whether things rapidly go toward a bad place competitively and I don't think that is happening. So hopefully there will be a little more growth opportunity next year than there was this year. But I think mostly the numbers on the outstanding side that you see from Capital One are really a reflection of choices on our part and the actual -- the marketing that we\u2019re doing and the products that we are selling we feel very good about it and I think are generating nice results. Chris Brendler : Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up, I\u2019ll ask about deposits, the consumer deposit cost picked up little bit this quarter. You also saw some decent growth in the consumer deposits. I guess the question all time about your online deposit business and how robust that business is and how sensible is to rising rates. My sense is its doing pretty well. It's hard to see with your current disclosures. Can you just talk about the deposit pricing environment and what you see going forward little bit of focus on online versus offline? Thanks. Scott Blackley : Yes. I think if you want to understand Capital One on the deposit side, I think the first thing I would say is just study direct banking and study local banking because we\u2019re blend of the two. And we -- our deposit pricing will reflect that blend overtime. And for example, at the end of last year we made some pricing moves and a little bit at the beginning of this year that will make their way into our numbers as we make sure on the direct side of the business that we stay in a reasonably competitive place. The other thing to understand about Capital One as you think about our deposit business is that we overtime are working to build the national business. We overtime have brought in -- we have grown a lot, our outstandings have grown a lot both from organic growth but also from acquisitions like the GE Healthcare acquisition, the Cabela's acquisition. So if you look at the deposit-to-loan ratio it's on the low end of sort of our norms and overtime we would expect that to grow because their assets have grown, they will be growing and we\u2019re building a national banking capability. The reason I mention that is that pretty much any bank who is looking to grow its deposits quite a bit will end up paying up more for deposits in a bank who is at the high end of the deposit-to-loan ratio. So it's really not just an issue of what somebody's beta is, it's really kind of \u2013 its kind of a -- its the double strategic question of what beta of a business is and what is the growth appetite and needs of that particular business. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Thanks guys for taking my question. Hey, Scott, one of things that jumped out to me is that the tax rate that you\u2019re suggesting for 2018 substantially lower than many of the other companies we\u2019ve spoken. I assume that this is a reflection of differences between GAAP and tax accounting. And I'm specifically wondering if this is another signal that charge-offs which drive tax are going to potentially exceed provision which drives GAAP? Scott Blackley : Rick, I think actually the answer is a bit simpler than that. If you think about Capital One virtually the lion share of our income is from U.S. sources. And so taking down the domestic tax rate from 35 to 21 was a huge tailwind for us, because that impacts the lion share of our income. And then on top of that if you think about we do have some tax-advantaged assets that we own that generate some credits and that's what takes the fully loaded rate inclusive of kind of the stack cost down to the 19% level. So, I don't think there's more to it than that simple explanation. Rick Shane : Got it. It\u2019s interesting because, historically, your tax rates been a little bit lower, but this is substantially lower. Just one quick follow-up question, the $62 adjusted number, does that include or exclude the discontinued operations? Richard Fairbank : The $62 excludes discontinued operations. And you can see -- we got a slide there in the appendix that gives you the specifics of what we adjust out. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening. Rich, if we see year-over-year change in delinquencies that you talked about earlier actually turned negative which doesn't seem that far-fetched given that we were at 70 basis points year-over-year change back in February down to the kind of like around six now. And I wonder if you could maybe help us think about whether that could actually provide a basis for releasing reserves, all else equal? Richard Fairbank : So, one thing I want to say as you look at the year-over-year change in delinquencies, of course, think about the Cabela's impact that will be in the new numbers and not in a year ago's numbers, so all the way up until the fall basically the fall of next year they will sort of the that effect, so we\u2019ll have to keep that one in mind. So, the year-over-year change in delinquencies or charge-offs or any of these are going to be driven really by a combination of growth math and industry factors. The good news is the growth math is reaching the latter stages of being a bad guy if you will. Long run we think it can be a gradual good guy. But of course we have the industry effect that I don't want know to -- I want to make sure we shine a little bit of light on that. We\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of quarters, earnings calls about back book. If you look at -- if you want to get probably the purest, look at sort of industry effects, just go to the securitization trust and just look at everybody\u2019s back books. And what you will see is for many years the back book -- everybody's back books were a good guy relative they were improving year-over-year. And what striking if you graph the year-over-year change in people's back book delinquencies and also charge-offs you just see this packed kind of set of lines that goes from the negative below the horizontal axis which is a good thing and it just moves over time to the horizontal axis and even in the last year it has been above that which is a nerdy way to say it's gone from being a good guy to a little bit of a bad guy. So there are industry effects. It's very natural that at this stage of the cycle there would be industry effect. And the other thing for each issuer than is on top of whatever happens with each of our back books is to think about what's happening to everybody's front books. Capital One is I think a little benefited by the fact that we\u2019re farther along in that particular journey than some of the other players, but it is through the everybody's front book that most of the industry normalization happens because it is-- the credit hungry people that get the new accounts and then that tends to be right there at the frontier of how normalization happens. So, we believe there is an industry effect that is happening. We expect it will continue and we\u2019ll have to -- and how that thing plays out relative to the growth math going from overtime for us from a bad guy to a neutral guy, to a good guy. That\u2019s going to in the end drive our overall credit numbers. Bill Carcache : Thanks Rich. And if I could just follow-up, it seems like that all the discussion around the things we\u2019re talking about with delinquencies bode well for revenue suppression. Can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the trajectory I guess on revenue margin? I think there's a lot of focus on slowing growth and the impact that that's having on the top line. But I wonder just if there are some offsetting benefits that we should also be thinking about kind of along those lines. Any thoughts would be helpful? Thanks. Scott Blackley : Yes, Bill, this is Scott. So, certainly suppression is been driven by the same set of factors that have been impacting the credit metrics and the allowance. So as those start to moderate, I think that we would certainly expect that suppression will also be driven by broader industry factors and the things that are impacting our overall loss rate. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks. My question was about, when I look at the portfolio, the subprime portfolio has continue to come down from 37% earlier in the year to 34% to end the year in the fourth quarter. Should we -- given the underwriting refinements that you've done, should continue to see that trend continue going forward? And then just as we think about when the growth is coming from higher credit score does that change the shift between transactors and revolvers and any implications of those on the loan yield? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Yes. Ashish, I think that -- I don't think there's any big news with respect to what's happening to the subprime mix Capital One. I mean, how many years has it been that we\u2019ve been generally around the third? That number did rise during the growth surge of 2014 through 2016, that number rose, and I think it's headed back to little bit more normal levels. So on inside Capital One and the conversations we\u2019re having, we don't see a big mix conversation happening in every segment and sub-segment we look at the market and see what it has to give us. And there was a little bit more a few years ago and I think now it's probably more just to kind of normal mix. With respect to transactor versus revolver, that is not much about subprime mix. That is really most driven by the growth in heavy spenders and the success of our efforts to drive purchase volume. And when you look at that growth rate and for many years now it's been outstripping the growth rate of outstandings, it's a manifestation that the transactor component depending how you define it, that mix of transactor and basically spender inside our portfolio is growing over time. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s helpful. And then just regarding the window of opportunity and my understanding you\u2019ve start, sounded cautious and looking at the competitive environment there. But what are the metrics that you\u2019re watching for in particular? Is there anything like you called out a couple of them? So given that competitors have been burned in the second half of 2016 with aggressive promotions? Do you think the large issuers will be a lot more cautious this time around? Or will they take the benefit of the windfall? So just any more color on that front? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Yes. Well, I tend to simplistically look at the marketplace as the revolver marketplace and the spender marketplace. And they are two different marketplaces. Certainly, the most intense one competitively is the spender marketplace. And we have just seen sort of steady ratcheting up of rewards and other forms of giveaways, very striking what has happened over the last few years with respect to upfront bonuses, and also by the way that some of the co-brand products and the little bit of an arms race there with respect to some of their offerings, all of this has happen on a pretty gradually intensifying basis over the last several years. To your point though, I think it has moderated a bit. Certainly the early spender bonus has moderated a little bit. I sense a bit of, I mean, this is with the small B, but a bit of settling out with respect to the spender competitive marketplace. But it settling out at a very intense level and I think that I would guess from my years of experience in this thing, only the players that have really build a branded franchise based position in this marketplace are going to be able to continue to grow profitably and we are one of those and we continue to do like our chances. But we certainly watch very carefully that marketplace. And one thing that we are focused on is because the value of this franchise is primarily driven by how long your customers stay with you. Is nothing but expensive to get them and they tend to over the long term be an amazing franchises of low attrition and tremendous credit performance and heavy spending and all of that nice stuff. But -- so, we tend to be on the low side with respect to going after all the promotional near-term kind of stuff. It's a little -- makes it a harder way to make a living, but I think that we like the long-term performance with that philosophy. In the revolver marketplace what -- certainly the best news in the revolver marketplace has been the stability of pricing over many years. APRs have been stable and actually increasing a little bit over time. And if you \u2013 while it\u2019s hard to exactly get a really good metric on the industries APR in this marketplace, I would say, I think it has increased a little bit more than interest rates have. So relative to say that the middle of the OOs when things were going crazy, I think that's a good sign relative to the marketplace. To your question what we worry most about is just the amount of supply and how aggressive people are in expanding credit boxes and going out there. And while I think pricing has been stable. There was some aggressiveness in that revolver marketplace that we were uncomfortable with in 2016 in particular and somewhat in 2017, I think people have dialed back a little bit. I think things have settled out a little bit and that might be a good sign. So, all-in-all I've said this for many years relative to a lot of markets I've e seen, I think the credit card market is intensely competitive but really pretty darn rational. And I think it's \u2013 there\u2019s an opportunity to grow successfully, profitably and resiliently, and we believe that we see that opportunity in front of us. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Chris Donat : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to revisit from a little different angle the question of deposit pricing, and Rich I\u2019m wondering with some of the investments you've made in technology over the last few years, if you're in more of a place with deposit pricing where you were decades ago with the other side of the balance sheet on loan pricing and being better able to target or at leasing market on a more direct basis, that\u2019s competitive advantage that other traditional brick-and-mortar banks don't have. Anyway I'm just wondering where you think you stand, competitively on the technology related to deposit pricing? Richard Fairbank : So, I don't -- I wouldn't say that I think the big advantage that we hope to obtain is the technology for really micro-targeting deposit pricing. Although that certainly \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of investment in that across the industry. I think the technology that I am bullish about being very helpful to us is actually the consumer facing technology of online banking and being able to have a great online experience combined with and build on the shoulders of an infrastructure that we spent years investing in to modernize and integrate from our direct bank and our local bank to modernize and integrate and in a sense rebuild the full technology stack to be able to really credibly offer online banking backed by a thin physical distribution and be able to compete against some of the really great established players. So, my bullishness is really more about that technology than necessarily a real advantage in terms of a micro pricing at the margin. Chris Donat : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one question on your expectations for used vehicle pricing, you said you\u2019re looking for them to be down and that seems appropriately cautious and conservative. But do you think \u2013 were these expectations set before factoring in the tax act or does that not really factor into I expect these vehicle prices to play out this year? Richard Fairbank : We have not yet rolled any particular assumptions about attacks impact making its way into the used-car pricing. I think if you just look historically at used-car pricing, it is not a lot of science and amazing analysis behind. Honestly, if you just eyeball used-car pricing it just has been, it sat for a long long time at very high levels, and while cars I think are lasting longer and so on, I think this thing had only one way to go, and it has gone down. Interestingly, Manheim does not reflect this, but our own where we have a Capital One index our own index which is has a little bit more of an end, a mix of used cars then some I mean in older cars that certainly has gone down. It\u2019s been locally, it\u2019s been lately stable and even probably rising a bit over the last few months. But I think that the way I look at this from a underwriting point of view, it doesn\u2019t matter how high, how where used-car prices are. What really matters is where they end up relative to where they were when people underwrote them. And so when an industry is sitting near all-time highs, while Capital One puts in our own underwriting quite a significant decline in used-car pricing. My intuition is the industry just gets too comfortable with the recent history of high used-car prices. And so again, it\u2019s not about where you are, where you are whether they are high or low, it\u2019s just whether the where they are on underwriting versus going forward. And I think there is a way higher chance that they are going down from here than that they are going up and that that\u2019s concerning from an underwriting point of view. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Rich, you had mentioned that the prospects of your strong growth opportunities and it\u2019s been referenced a couple of times in the call that you\u2019ve had some fairly significant deceleration on the credit card and a little bit of deceleration in auto. Maybe and the fact that you think that the competitors could get a little more aggressive following seeing those big tax benefits. So maybe if you could just tell us where you think that growth, where we should be expecting that growth to come from? Richard Fairbank : Yes, so first of all your list is a compelling list of things to be concerned about. And I don\u2019t want, when I say that I\u2019m hopeful for know some enhanced growth opportunity, this is off the base of where we came in with a not counting Cabela\u2019s to 2% year-over-year growth in the card business. So it\u2019s a bit of a low bar of competition when we are talking about up or down from here. But not being flip and about that, what I would know on the positive side, let me start with the negative side. So the negative side is the potential, the potential impact of competitors getting more aggressive, but from this windfall and the empirically some of the same things that we seem competitively particularly last year, and also the fairly high levels of growth of credit, of indebtedness of revolving credit for example. On the positive side is, over the last number of quarters a little bit of a reduction in supply. You can feel people trimming in their underwriting a little bit. We also have the benefit of more and more months of watching vintage curves settle out. You just no matter how many years I\u2019ve been in this business, it you can, you can believe these things go up and settle out and someday they go down but it\u2019s comforting to see them move in the way that we would expect and so as we get more of our own experience watching these curves settle out and then retro analyzing on every micro segment and so on it tends to lend itself to a little bit more of a growth opportunity. But we\u2019ll have to see how this plays out. This is not a -- that I\u2019m not sitting here saying I really think there\u2019s a big dramatic growth play here. I just feel pretty good about the opportunity in card. I think if I could comment on auto, the experience over the last number of years has been in a business that\u2019s intensely -- it\u2019s, it\u2019s got amplified, the impacts of competition get amplified and auto because there is an auction, there is an auctioneer sitting in the middle of our lending. And so, the we have seen the value of some competitors backing off in the auto business, you\u2019ve seen such significant growth from Capital One. Lately, it\u2019s a little bit more competitive than before. I think if I pull way up and calibrate relative to all times in the cycle, I think the growth opportunity is still pretty good in the auto business, and the overall -- the industry dynamics for an industry that is so hypersensitive to supply I think are pretty good. Moshe on the commercial side, we really haven\u2019t talked much about that. I think probably for all players certainly Capital One that the latter part of the year, growth was kind of slow. I think overall though in the commercial space, the and I think that there is a lot of supply out there. I think investors have been pushed out on the risk curve a little bit to seek returns, and I think that the and the impact of nonbanks in the lending space is becoming more significant. So I think our view is pretty moderate there, but we\u2019ll have to see. Moshe Orenbuch : Just maybe a quick call upon on capital, your capital levels right now are kind of a \u2013 just actually just above where they were at the beginning of the CCAR cycle last year. And so how do we think when you said significant capital distributions in which we think about comparable amounts to what had been in the, in the plan for 2017. As we go for it and recognizing you should have more higher levels of earnings in... Richard Fairbank : No, Moshe when you think about capital distribution, I mentioned that we want to see our CET 1 kind of drift back to what we think of destination levels is as kind of in the mid-10ths. And so, in the near term I think some of the positive effects of tax reform are going to help us to get there, while still having room for growth, and for capital distribution. And then in overtime, we\u2019ll see exactly how earnings play out and how much competition we see, but if there\u2019s a windfall from tax reform that is enduring that certainly gives us more opportunity for growth and for capital distribution. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Good evening. Just another way to ask the vintage question. If I\u2019m looking at the domestic card charge-offs and the current charge-off rate ex-Cabela\u2019s of 536, that\u2019s up from the 464 last quarter. And I know the seasonality there, but can you tell us how much of that 70 basis point differential or a 70 basis point change was from the front book of -- front book growth math versus back book deterioration? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : John, there were -- there was I\u2019m not \u2013 not really going to precisely break those two things out, but that they were both factors in that. And the over the -- in 2017 the back book effect grew and the front book affect over progressive quarters declined consistent with our growth math. But both -- but both factors were meaningful in the year-over-year delta, but the bigger of the two was the growth math. John Pancari : Okay, all right that\u2019s helpful. Thanks, and then lastly, the on the auto originations that I heard, what you said about that it still represents an opportunity for you, the growth in the auto business but also flagging that it\u2019s still somewhat competitive, as we look at originations I know there are down 5% year-over-year. What\u2019s \u2013 how should we think about overall originations as you look at 2018, is it fair to assume that we are up low single digits? Richard Fairbank : Gosh, we are the company that has no sets, no growth targets for any of our businesses, because we believe so strongly that in a risk management business and a business in which underwriting isn\u2019t just an actuarial science, it\u2019s really driven by adverse selection and the nature of supply and demand at the margin we make predictions internally as we budget, but and if you just look at our prior behavior, in fact I\u2019ll take you back to that I think it was the last quarter of 2015 when we cautioned, we came in with a really big drop in originations and said that what we had been generally cautioning about really was kind of quite a bit a big deal competitively with respect to some bad practices and the nature of supply, so we had much lower volumes there. By the time we had fully gotten our investors to internalize our concerns we posted a very, it\u2019s almost like record originations and origination growth in the following couple of quarters. So I think that what I would, so what we do is we describe the conditions that we see in that marketplace, but as a company that doesn\u2019t set growth targets, we work incredibly hard to create growth opportunities, but at the end of the day we take what the market will give us. And as I said before, the auto business relative to something like the card business is amplified in the impact of competitive effects, and therefore we see the opportunity for as long as we can, we generally like this part of the auto site, marketplace where it is, but it is noteworthy that in the fourth quarter, we posted a lower origination then we have for some time now, and I think that\u2019s just because the competitive thing is in fact stepping up a little bit. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And our last question for the evening comes from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Ken Bruce : Thanks, good evening guys. My question relates to the guidance that the earnings growth will accelerate in 2018 and off the 7.74 benchmark. I mean most of us I think had expected that to occur anyway just with the with cold spring beginning to release of the earnings growth potential of the tax rate going from your high 20s to 19 should really put that on steroids. I\u2019m trying to kind of figure out if you are just being extremely cautious around what \u2013 what or conservative around kind of what that acceleration can be or if you are seeing anything that as you think about the competitive intensity and the potential for this to be competed away that it\u2019s coming sooner than later. I mean, I think that that would take place over some period of time. Most of your bank peers are trying to rebuild capital after the DTA write-downs and the like so, if you could just maybe kind of give us some thought as to kind of where your are most concerned about repricing [credit card and auto] loans lower or other kind of really aggressive marketing activity that could significantly undermine your earnings growth potential assumes to me as can be really good. Richard Fairbank : Well I mean as we \u2013 so first of all how we feel about our business and its prospects is very similar to where we were at the day before. And in fact last quarter when we were talking to you and so what happened this quarter will along came the tax reform bill. So are we -- so the first of all we are the same company with the same kind of feeling about our prospects that we had prior to the tax effect. And our point is, in the near-term the tax thing have to be I mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine that it couldn\u2019t be a an important good guy relative to financial performance for ourselves, and really everyone else. And all we are saying is, that we are very reluctant to get in the prediction business and in fact not only reluctant to get in the prediction of business, but my own experience from just doing this business for over two decades now is I have seen windfalls and shortfall that hit the industry over the next couple of years they have a striking way to make their place there that their way into the marketplace. So examples, I mentioned the example of the bankruptcy reform in 2005. There is the tax act of 1986, and I wasn\u2019t born yet so that was more reading a history book there, but from our little kind of retro study of that and not as experts, but that there was a lot of sort of making its way into the marketplace there. And then conversely, when I\u2019ve been struck over the years how when the times get tougher and tighter in their credit pressures and things like this, there are ways that their credit card business in particular has a way of offsetting that with respect to the overall metrics. So for example, how volatile the credit card charge-offs are, and it\u2019s a little bit of a scary exercise to take any P&L of a credit card business and then just project the wild volatility that can happen with respect to losses and then you say, well gosh if losses were that high and you just had all the same things that would be terrible or if losses got incredibly good, you would be printing money at a staggering kind of level. But the offsetting effects that happened in the marketplace have been striking to me in both directions over the years. So, I look at this and so my point is partly we certainly don\u2019t want to be in the guidance business about that number but you all can draw your own conclusions and we are not by the way, I want to make it clear, we are not going to try to be one that sets an arms race off at all with respect to this. This is more of a just a prediction that things have a way of going into the marketplace and that my caution to investors would be I wouldn\u2019t book this stuff before it, totally happen to be the biggest question is not whether it is when and the timing and to your point there is a good case to be made that this is a gradual thing it\u2019s not an immediate thing and therefore particularly in 2018, this I think stands to be quite a good guy. Ken Bruce : Thank you. And just lastly, and hopefully quickly the in terms of the increasing competitiveness in auto is are you seeing that in terms of expanding of credit box again, or are you seeing it in terms of pricing or something else? Richard Fairbank : No, I think it\u2019s a mild, it\u2019s little a locally mild thing. I, like we go running down the streets waving red flags when we see bad underwriting process and practices. We, we don\u2019t really have anything new to report there. I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything dramatic. I think what is happening is we\u2019ve had an unusually benign if you will period of competition in the 2016 and 2017 period. That I think we will look back at that and say, it normalized from there, and I think that it\u2019s just a natural thing. People move into those spaces a little bit more. Some of the folks that maybe had backed off a little bit, particularly one of them is stepping it up a bit and I think all this is natural, so it \u2013 I think it\u2019s much more likely this thing will normalize competitively than that it will be as good as it was for these last couple years for us. Jeff Norris : Thank you very much everyone for joining us on this conference call today. And thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great evening. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome, everybody to Capital One's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our first quarter 2018 results.

And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly Reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott Blackley : Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $2.62 per share in the first quarter. We had one adjusting item in the quarter, which was $19 million of restructuring costs. Net of this item earnings per share were $2.65. A slight outline in adjusting items can be found on Page 13 of the slide deck. Pre-provision GAAP earnings increased 3% on a linked quarter basis and 8% on a year-over-year basis to $3.3 billion. Provision for credit losses decreased 13% on a linked quarter basis and 16% year-over-year primarily driven by smaller allowance builds in our Domestic Card business. Let me take a moment to explain the movements in allowance across our businesses, which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. In our Domestic Card business, we built $59 million of allowance in the quarter reflecting seasonally adjusted growth and the moderating impacts of growth math. The allowance in our Consumer Banking segment increased $11 million driven by growth in our Auto business and net reserves in our Commercial Banking segment decreased $33 million primarily due to paydowns in an improved risk profile. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2%. We have refined our estimate of the impact of the new tax law and we now expect our 2018 corporate annual effective tax rate to be around 20%. Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin decreased 10 basis points from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by day count and an increase in rate paid for deposits, which was only partially offset by higher asset yields in mix. Net interest margin was up 5 basis points on a year-over-year basis resulting from a higher mix of card assets on the balance sheet. As of the end of the quarter, our net interest income was modestly liability sensitive to implied forwards and a flatter yield curve would create a modest headwind to earnings. Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.5%. Last quarter, I shared that we expected our CET 1 ratio which is our binding capital constraint to trend back towards the mid 10% range. Since then there have been several developments that have affected our capital requirements. These developments include a more severe 2018 CCAR assumptions that were provided by the Federal Reserve in its stress scenarios. More severe Federal Reserve CCAR loss models are coming for a card and subprime auto, and of course, the impacts of both of these developments are compounded by the associated incremental disallowed DTA resulting from the loss of the NOL carry back. Giving these developments, we now believe that our CET 1 ratio will trend up to around 11%. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 200 million of common stock and in light of our updated view of capital. We do not expect to use any of the remaining authorization for the 2017 CCAR approval window, which ends June 30, 2018. Importantly, this view does not incorporate any of the potential impacts from CECL implementation in 2020. With respect to CECL, we were pleased to see bank regulators acknowledge in their MPR that the initial challenges of CECL implementation, but they didn't go far enough. Our current capital regime was built around incurred loss allowance model and under CECL we will shift to a lifetime loss allowance, but we've seen no comments or shift in capital frameworks. We view the potential increase and allowance from CECL, as simply capital in another form and since the MPR doesn't allow for Tier 1 capital relief, it will all else equal simply cause banks to hold more capital. In addition, CECL has the potential to be very procyclical and we will discourage loan growth, especially in recessionary periods and will make financial statements less comparable and less useful. We will continue to advocate the bank regulators and the FASB to carefully consider all of the impacts of CECL. So with that, I'm going to be turning the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thank you, Scott. I'll begin on Slide 8 with our Credit Card business. We posted strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and pretax income driven by the performance of both our domestic and international Card businesses. Credit Card results also benefit from the absence of any additions to our U.K. PPI reserves in the quarter, which adversely impacted the first quarter of last year. On Slide 9, you can see the first quarter results for our Domestic Card business. As a reminder, Domestic Card results and metrics now include the impacts of the Cabela's portfolio, which are playing out as expected. Ending loan balances were up $7.4 billion or about 8% compared to the first quarter of last year. First quarter purchase volume increased 18% from the prior year. Revenue for the quarter increased 6% from the prior year. Revenue margin for the quarter was 15.9% down 36 basis points from the first quarter of 2017. Strong net interchange revenue partially offset the expected margin pressure from Cabela's. Non-interested expense increased 7% compared to the prior year quarter. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.26%, up 12 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.57% down 14 basis points from the prior year, both metrics include the benefit from adding the Cabela's portfolio. The competitive marketplace remains intense, but generally rational. Supply of card credit is on the high side, although it is settled out a bit. We continue to see good opportunities to grow card loans and purchase volumes with a watchful eye on the marketplace. Slide 10 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 1% compared to the prior year, while average loans were up about 2%. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up 3% versus the prior year with a 23 basis point increase in average deposit interest rate compared to the first quarter of 2017. We expect further increases in average deposit interest rate driven by higher market rates and increasing competition for deposits. The Auto business continues to grow. First quarter auto originations were strong and ending loans were up 10% year-over-year, competitive intensity in auto is increasing, but we still see attractive opportunities to grow. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased about 4% from the first quarter of last year driven by growth in auto loans and deposit. Non-interest expense for the quarter decreased 4% compared to the prior year quarter driven by our ongoing efforts to tightly manage cost and the exit of the mortgage origination business last quarter, partially offset by continuing growth in auto. Provision for credit losses was down from the first quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of lower auto charge-off rate and a smaller allowance build. In auto, we remain cautious about used car prices and our underwriting assumes that prices decline. As the cycle plays out, we continue to expect that the auto charge-off rate will increase gradually. Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. First quarter ending loan balances decreased about 2% year-over-year and average loans decreased 3%. Both trends were driven by our choice to pull back in several less attractive business segments in the second half of 2017. With many of these choices behind us, ending loan balances increased about 2% from the sequential quarter. First quarter revenue was roughly flat year-over-year as strong non-interest income in capital markets and agency offset the decline in average loans and the effect of the lower tax rate on tax equivalent yields. Excluding the net impacts of the new tax law, revenue would have grown about 4%. Non-interest expense was up 3% primarily as a result of technology investments and other business initiatives. Provision for credit losses was actually a benefit of $14 million in the quarter driven by lower charge-offs and a larger allowance release as compared to the first quarter of last year. The charge-off rate for the quarter improved to 11 basis points. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7%, down 40 basis points from the fourth quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.5%, up 10 basis points from the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we shared with you that we had moved the vast majority of our Taxi Medallion portfolio to held for sale, which drove most of our fourth quarter commercial provision expense. During the first quarter, we sold most of this portfolio and realized the small gain. We have just over $40 million in remaining Taxi Medallion loans and assets on the balance sheet, which are carried at a valuation comparable to the recently completed portfolio sale. In the first quarter, Capital One delivered year-over-year growth in loans, deposits, revenues, and pre-provision earnings. We tightly managed costs even as we continue to invest to grow and to drive our digital transformation. Total company ending loan balances grew 3% year-over-year and we still see opportunities to book attractive and resilient loans in our card, auto, and commercial banking businesses. We expect marketing in 2018 will be higher than 2017. First quarter efficiency ratio improve year-over-year as revenue growth outpaced the growth in non-interest expense, while efficiency ratio can vary in any given year. Over the long-term, we continue to believe that we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth in digital productivity gains. As always, marketing expense will continue to be driven by the opportunities and requirements of the competitive marketplace. We expect long-term improvements and total efficiency ratio will mostly come from improving operating efficiency ratio. We continue to expect a majority of the tax benefit will fall to the bottom line this year, while it's still early to have a definitive observations and conclusions, we continue to believe markets behave in predictable ways. A surge in tax benefits has a way of working its way into the marketplace through increasing competition, including higher levels of marketing and lower prices. Responding to these actions, we will likely consume a growing portion of the tax benefit over time. In addition, we will also continue to lean into our investment in talent, technology, innovation, brand, and growth. We are bullish about the long-term benefits of our investments. Taking all of this into account, we continue to expect that our current trajectory coupled with the new tax law will enable us to accelerate full-year 2018 EPS growth compared to full-year 2017 EPS growth, net of adjustment and assuming no substantial adverse change in the broader economic or credit cycles. Pulling up, we continue to build an enduringly great franchise with the scale, brand, capabilities, and infrastructure to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our industry and our society. Our digital and technology transformation is accelerating. We are growing new customer relationships and deepening engagement with new and existing customers, and we are strengthening our position to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value. Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Leanne, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Rich, I was hoping that you could, I mean you alluded to this in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about seeing opportunities for growth in a market that you kind of defined is still rational. Maybe if you could kind of flesh that out a little bit kind of where within the credit spectrum, what have you seen in terms of both the supply of credit and the ability to if your borrowers to support it in the market and how has that influenced to your thought process? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thanks Moshe. Good afternoon. So if I calibrate, so we had a big surge of growth in 2014 through 2016. And as you know, Moshe we are very sensitive about what is the supply demand situation in the marketplace being so cautious about oversupply. And we saw a window that we said at the time gave us I think an exceptional opportunity to grow and get the kind of performance that we wanted and we went all in on that. Starting in 2016 and sort of into 2017, we saw a big surge in industry supply. Well it actually started before that, but there was a big surge in the industry supply. In early 2016 we started making our cautionary sounds about look that will probably have ripple effects on some of the performance metrics in the business, the credit performance metrics in the business, and sharing off those performance changes. I mean that's nothing overly alarming to those performance changes we saw in our own and in industry metrics in 2016. And so we dialed back to more moderate growth rate. Dial back basically around the edges, across our revolver programs and you see the slower growth in 2016 and you can see growth has been pretty slow at this - to this quarter that we're reporting today. I think I would describe the generally things have kind of settled out in the environment not in a huge way, but just in a moderate way. You can see supply has little bit settled out even though supply is still on the high side, and clearly the supply, the growth of revolving credit is well above the growth of the economy et cetera. So certainly we'll call that one on the high side, but kind of settling out. If you look at industry practices, pricing and various things I think there is a rationality and a stability to things. Competition is fairly intense especially on the very high end of the marketplace. But I would call it kind of a settling out period. I think we see an opportunity for attractive growth in this environment, not like a big surge like before, but I think that we still feel optimistic about the ability to have appropriate attractive growth in this environment, not like a big surge like before. But I think that we still feel optimistic about the ability to have appropriate attractive growth in this environment. You talked about where across the credit spectrum that we see that would really say that across the areas that we tend to invest in, we see some attractive growth opportunities. We continue to be going very hard at the top of the marketplace has a very competitive there. I think that the people who will succeed and are succeeding there are those who invest for years in building a brand and sort of the benefits of staying power in that particular area, but we continue to like our results there and you can see we printed them some pretty good purchase volume growth metrics. In the revolver space, across the credit spectrum I think you know there is an opportunity, kind of medium size opportunity there. So we'll be very vigilant along the way as we read the market conditions and act appropriately, but I think that we do see some opportunity for growth. Moshe Orenbuch : And just the last part of that it was whether you can ever see anything in the kind of customer base from employment or income standpoint that would make you kind of more or less enthused? Richard Fairbank : Yes, I think for the consumer, things look pretty strong in the near-term. I think they're benefiting from job growth and wage increases maybe a bit from Tax Cuts. And so I think the consumer and the economy sort of in which the consumer is a big part is in the near-term in a pretty strong and stable place. Now when you look out a little bit farther, there are a number of things that are still considered can concerning like growing consumer indebtedness, growing the government deficits and a number of issues, but almost all the issues are a bit farther out. So all of that adds up to a view in our case that there is a. Kind of middle of the cycle field to where we are right now. I think that we have some attractive opportunities to grow, but one has to I think bring a very careful and wary eye to work every day because there are a number of factors out there that could get a lot worse from here. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. When I look at the monthly progression of the U.S. card credit metrics, they paint a pretty positive story, delinquencies are down year-over-year, the charge-off rate seem to be trending down year-over-year now. Could you maybe help us reconcile your expectations for the charge-off rate to be up this year given this phenomenon? Scott Blackley : Well, Sanjay, first I don't think we've given any guidance about the 2018 full-year charge-off rate. I think that we've historically been telling you that we expected that the increasing pressure year-over-year basis from growth math was moderating and that's what we've talked about. I mentioned that that is having a modest impact on the allowances we've seen that the income down. But Rich, I don't know if you want to make any other comments about that? Richard Fairbank : Well, maybe it's appropriate to kind of just seize the moment and just talk about growth math and where we are on that. If we kind of pull back over - our journey of the last several years, the reason we talked about growth math was to highlight the impacts of our outsized growth relative to the rest of the card industry. And that surge turned out to be from 2014 through 2016 and since then our growth has been moderate. If you combine our vintages of outsized growth, 2014, 2015 and 2016, their losses have stabilized and now actually started to improve. And our newer vintages 2017 and forward are in the early seasoning phase with increasing losses. And this is a natural way that seasoning works in the Card business. When you net these two effects, the result is the small tail of growth math we have spoken off, but pulling way up we're near the end of the growth math story, and from here we expect our credit will be impacted more by the economy, the competitive cycle, and other industry effects. And these factors are more likely upward than downward and they will - on our portfolio will ultimately be a blend of all of these effects, but I think the thing we wanted to point out is that the surge if you will from 2014, 2015, and 2016 those vintages actually have turned to the positive. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. I mean I guess just a follow-up on that. I mean do we think that now the charge-off rate could then come down for the year relative to last year? And then just one question on the CCAR comment, Scott. Could you maybe just talk about how the more onerous expectations affect you are ask this time around, I mean in terms of just dimensionalizing that? Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Sanjay, we're not - it's been our norm over the 20 some years we've been a public company, not to give specific credit guidance. And I think our view is since now we're kind of beyond the growth math story and our credit is going to be driven mostly by industry factors. We give you a little bit of a window into what's happening along the way with that thing I'll call that the surge over the three-year period. But I think we're now - it's probably less of a Capital One specific story and more about industry factors, but we will have a bit of the beneficial impact of the surge being a very gradual. All other things being equal, a very gradually beneficial and again, everything being precisely equal something that is over the rest of it life sort of having being a modest good guy as opposed to the \u201cbad guy\u201d it has been for several years as the losses have been so frontloaded. Scott Blackley : Sanjay, on the CCAR. So I obviously can't give you much information about our 2018 CCAR submission. I will kind of just pull up and first talk about the whitepaper that the Fed released on its modeling. We don't have any more information about how that's going to impact us than you do. We've made assumptions about that in terms of dimensioning the 11% that I've told you that we're going to be trending towards. So I'll just make a couple comments about what I think looking ahead for capital. I think that we're going to be trending up towards the 11%. I would think that we'll get there over the next 12 months or so for sure. I would think that when I look at our earnings capacity, I think that we have their earnings capacity to have support growth to support our capital trending up and for the opportunity for some continued capital distribution along the way. So we're looking at all components of that as part of our dynamic management of our capital levels. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next questioner from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : Yes. Good evening. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of your view on industry card loan growth. If you look around a lot of the issuers are tightening up underwriting on the edges, yet the consumer is in very good shape. Can you talk a little bit about the outlook there and also the competitive dynamic you've got the Fed continuing to raise rates? You've got corporate tax rates that have been cut, are you seeing any changes in the competitive behavior from some of the banks? Richard Fairbank : Right. Don, I'm not sure that the industry is pulling back as much as it's kind of settling out. It was clear that the growth in the Card business, the growth of supply was surging over the last couple of years. It seems to have settled out around 6%, subprime growth rate surged quite a bit higher than that and it's now come down, but it's still a little bit higher than the prime rate. So again, my characterization of that would be supply is on the high side, but kind of settling out relative to the pace it was going one in two years ago when we were raising some alarm bells. At the top of the market, there is tremendous competition at the top of the market, and the top competition shows up in rewards offerings that not only our card players actively putting some pretty aggressive things out there, but retailers are kind of jumping into the fray there's been a lot of competition on rewards themselves. Intense marketing associated with those and my expectation is that that will continue. I see nothing abating about that. You asked the question about the impact of taxes. Both intuitively and in any retro studying we have done when a windfall happens to come to companies. Intuitively and empirically, it seems those windfalls end up making their way into the marketplace. Now one of the frustrating things will be and I'll say it in advance now. We won't be able to measure it and we won't be able to ever attribute any particular thing to that in the same way when the windfall from bankruptcy reform that happened in the [indiscernible] ended up making its way. I would argument to a pretty unhealthy way into the Credit Card marketplace, again, who can attribute cost to all of these things, but the striking thing in the wake of that sort of the industry got a little bit overheated and competitive in some unnatural ways. But my points are even kind of larger than a card industry point, I think as a corporate America point, where the big windfall is my expectation over the course of say the first year, most of that I'd certainly speak for Capital One. When I look at our own actions, I think that this thing looks like it had to default to the bottom line, but I think my cautionary words to all of us is, I would expect in little ways here and little ways there this will make its way into the marketplace in the form of more investment, more spending, pricing in various ways such that it kind of gets competed away which is a good thing from a societal point of view and how in the end giving a break to corporations has a way of making it self broadly available into the marketplace. So although we won't be able to measure it, we are assuming over time in our own planning that the marketplace will get more competitive and those are my cautionary comments. And in the end, the one thing we'll know is we don't really be able to measure that effect. So if I pull way up though, I still a pretty bullish about the opportunity in the Credit Card business. I think it's a reasonably stable time in the industry. We know which direction in the credit cycle things are moving, but I think there's a window of opportunity to still have some good growth. Donald Fandetti : And just a quick clarification. If I look at your funding cost on securitized debt and senior and subordinate notes, it looks like they went up a lot the yield quarter-over-quarters, so anything to call out there was just sort of normal progression? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Most of our wholesale funding is actually swapped out to three-month LIBOR, so it's really reflective of kind of the great moves and we saw a little bit of disconnect in the three month LIBOR, which run through that for most of those items. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the impact of higher deposit costs and higher rates on funds transfer pricing. I realize it's a net - it's a zero sum between corporate in the consumer bank, but I am assuming that is rates rise, the bank would be more profitable at the expense of the corporate another one and just like to go through that a little bit? Richard Fairbank : I think as a really broad principle, I think you're right. I think that the - we transfer funding costs from the other segment into the retail bank and its rates rise that spreads going to be more beneficial. And so all things being equal, I think that's likely going to be true. Richard Shane : Scott and how often do you reprice that just so we understand think about the dynamic in a right way? Scott Blackley : Yes, we do that on more or less a monthly basis is the process that we follow. Richard Shane : Okay, great. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good evening, guys. So I just wanted to ask a follow-up to one of the questions that was asked earlier regarding credit note. We've obviously seen two straight months of improving charge-offs in delinquencies Rich? Do you talk about the 2014 through 2016 vintage - vintages are starting to have some gradual improvement. So given that we're now a couple months into the year with both losses and delinquency down on a year-over-year basis and seemingly we should have more tailwinds from this. Scott Blackley : I guess what would we need to see from - if I'm assuming the environment is going to be stable, what would we need to see for losses in delinquencies to actually start going up over the course of the year. I think the point that there's no full-year guidance, but I'm just trying to understand unless it there's a big change in the operating environment why would losses start to go up? Richard Fairbank : So I think small changes in the environment can very easily happen. They can come on little cat feet. I'll give you an example of just what happened in 2016. Now in 2016 we were just beginning to - we were in the last year of our growth surge, but we started raising alarm bells about some of the supply things we saw going on and sure enough when you look back and by the way at that time one can't really see things particularly on origination programs and things like that. But if you look back at the period where I would say the card industry worsened of it, starting in the second quarter of 2016 particularly on the origination side where the industry, vintages from that period started gapping out. There was a worsening there and then we also saw that over the 2016 and 2017 period that the good guy the back book had been for so many years we'd almost all forgotten, where the back book not only was stable, it actually was getting better and better that that moved to stable, and then actually for several quarters and you can see this is an industry phenomenon. It was Capital One and you can see it in the securitization trust for the industry, actually worsen. Now both that the origination effect that that we noticed in the second quarter of 2016 and this back book effect that went from good guide neutral to even a worsening that seems to have settled out a little bit, but those are things that that can happen very easily and while there are always can be economic effects that cause them. The thing that I most focus on those things can happen very easily by competitor actions in the marketplace extra supply, changes in underwriting at various things. So my only point is that this is why we're not really in the credit guidance business because what we want to do is be in the credit guidance business when we have unique things to talk about - about our portfolio that wouldn't just fall of the industry things. So look, I think the most important thing that I have to share with you is that our 2014 to 2016 surge has turned into a gradual good guy. So whatever thing that happens from there whether the industry gets worse or better or whatever, we will have that little benefit on our own portfolio and it may be beneficial relative to other card players. And put another way as we've talked about it is we're farther along in the later innings kind of growth math and some of the other players. So I think Capital One will carry that particular benefit whether losses go up or not for us in the industry I think is something we'll have to see. Ryan Nash : Got it. And I guess if I could ask one follow-up, Rich you've been spending heavy on tech for the past five years, but we still managed to see 330 basis points of efficiency improvement in the last two years. However, I think over half came from lower marketing and lower amortization. So as you continue to get more benefits from these analog cost saves and maybe we start to see some of the investments sun setting, could we actually start to see the savings that you're seeing coming through on the expense side accelerating and maybe we could see a little bit lower expense growth going forward? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : I think we have one growing benefit and one less benefit than we had on something like efficiency ratio relative to the last few years and not even counting by the way your point on amortization. But I think the benefit that will grow over time is the relative meter between the increased investment in technology, which has been going on for years and the meter of the savings that we get because we're investing in technology. And what I've been saying for a long time is Capital One was way out there from the beginning, saying well some banks are saying they're going to sell fund their tech investment. I want to make one thing clear, we're not self-funding this thing. It's going to cost more before it costs less. So we have continued to invest heavily in technology and we will continue to invest heavily in technology and there are many benefits that come from that. And cost to me isn't even at the top of the list and we're not doing it primarily for cost benefits. However, with respect to cost, there are two growing good guys to offset the continued investment in technology. One is tech savings on tech spend, so a bunch of that that we're spending a lot in technology and is starting to actually create some tech savings. The other thing is really helping to grow the meter of sort of one minus tech spend across the company. And this is a gift that will keep on giving over time. And so what I've always said is I'm not ready to predict whether it could be that tech spends will grow as far out as we can see because at some point we all become just tech companies that's all we are. But the thing that is clearly going on is our - that tech is starting to save on itself and one minus tech spend that the savings meter is starting to grow, and I think that's going to be a gift that gives for a bunch of years. Now the one thing that's not as helpful to us over the next few years relative to what we had as our efficiency ratio is pretty steadily marched down over the last few years is basically the growth rate of the company. We were able to have the - it was really nice to have a pretty rapid growth rate and just not grow cost as much. So we've got our work cut out for us more with more moderate growth rates that's going to be a bit harder work, but we believe that. And a very important way our investors will be paid and an important manifestation of the benefits of really transforming the company into a tech company that does banking instead of a bank that you like I think, so many in the industry bank that use this technology is that we should be able to have the benefit in the operating cost over time. In any particular year, we're not really into the near-term guidance on that. The only other thing that I wanted to say just about efficiency ratio and you may have noticed the distinction that I made that what we believe over the longer-term overall efficiency ratio will be a good guy over time. I think that marketing, we've already said we expect to increase marketing over time. We had earlier questions on this call about the very competitive card marketplace et cetera as we look around. We expect to continue to invest heavily in marketing. I think it's really important to the growth opportunities of the company and for the brand and ultimately where we need to go as a company. But even in spite of higher marketing spend, we are very hopeful for the continuing benefit of operating cost through technology savings to carry the day. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good afternoon. Richard Fairbank : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Couple questions. One, I just want to understand - make sure I understand what you said about the CET 1 ratio, the capital ratio. So I think you said that over the course of next three, four quarters you expect you can get it back - you can get it to around 11%. Do I take that to mean that from there you anticipate holding it at 11%? I just want make sure I understand the drivers behind why you feel the need to go there and how we should expect a trajectory and what kind of leverage you're planning on pulling to either maintain or to get there? Richard Fairbank : Hey, Betsy. Thanks for the question. So I did say that I would expect that we would get to around 11% over the next 12 months or so from here. I think that we've got the earnings power that's going to allow us to accrete to those levels and at the same time support growth and the potential for some capital distribution as well. As we think about kind of where we need to be, I think 11% is kind of where I see the company needing to be with our current mix of business. The one thing that is out there that we're going to need to keep a close eye on a CECL and it's kind of the way CECL and its implementation comes out. We're likely to at some point going to have to take and adjust that 11% for what we see and what we learn about kind of how CECL is going to be implemented in stress testing and the day one effect at CECL. So those are all the things that I think that I have to say on that topic. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Just because the timing doesn't have to do in part with what the CCAR test was like this quarter. Is it at all around Fed parallel run on Basel II? Is it a function of what your outlook is for credit losses, just trying to understand the timing of this currently around 11%? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Well the timing is mainly - I'd previously mentioned that that we thought we need to be around 10.5%, and since then we've gotten additional information from the Fed about them incorporating updated models in card and in subprime auto which are two big businesses for us. So we're trying to make sure that we don't get caught behind the April on any of those items. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Rich if I may, I'm just trying to sort of aggregate the responses to several other questions that have come before, so I can sort of understand where the real pivot points in the income statement exist. So is this a fair characterization, I mean what we're going to see is sustained, but relatively low growth a little bit of margin benefit as asset yields outpace changes in cost of funds and operating and provision benefits relative to the prior year as the primary drivers of EPS growth, is that basically correct? Scott Blackley : Hey, Eric, I think that when it comes to margin, I think that what I would say is, if you look at our sensitivities to further rate changes. We're basically neutral to imply forward. So I don't anticipate that you should expect a benefit with Capital One from further rate. In fact, we're slightly liability sensitive and so that that can be that's again - that's in a shock scenario. So we're slightly liability sensitive there and then I would also add that we are sensitive to the shape of the curve. So if we were to see a slightly flatter curve that also can create a headwind perhaps to net interest margin. And then I think when it comes to operating efficiency, as Rich just said that's something that we've given guidance that we believe over time that's a metric that we will see trend down. We've mentioned that we anticipate increasing our marketing spend versus 2017. And then on the growth side, I think I would just characterize that as we think that we've got a pretty good competitive environment to compete, and so we're not going to see kind of the same growth rates that we were able to kind of in the 2014, 2015, 2016. We think that there's an opportunity for us to have healthy and reasonable growth. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks and if I can just follow-up on one point. I was trying to calculate the marginal cost of deposits and it looks like the delta there in cost was about 33 basis points and Fed funds were up about 34 over the course of the quarter. Is that - is my math is in the ballpark? Scott Blackley : I think that you're in the ballpark in terms of total costs. Certainly, we had a number of - we talk a little bit about the wholesale funding going is being indexed to the short end of the curve three month LIBOR. So that picked up all of the change there. So basically a data one and then we also had some higher rates moving up in our commercial business as well as some of the more competitive aspects of savings in CDs. So those were all the things that contributed to that that move up in average deposit pricing. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Kenneth Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kenneth Bruce : Thank you and good evening. I'd like to ask a question on credit and look I understand you're trying to get out of giving any direct guidance and so I won't ask for that. But if we look back at the last couple years of growth and you pointed out that there was inflated growth continue through 2016. There is also a pretty significant shift in the mix of Capital One's business towards [sub 650 FICO], and that has come off pretty dramatically off - over the last few quarter. So is it fair to assume that as we look forward that slower growth in that subprime portfolio should begin to accelerate the - if you will the improvement or the downward pressure from there kind of reverse growth math over the next call it 18 months? Richard Fairbank : Ken, I probably - I mean mechanically what you say would be the way things would work at the subprime mix, goes down and we have seen the subprime mix has declined recently, I do want to say Cabela's is a pretty significant contributor to that impact. These are also numbers that are like rounded off to the nearest integer kind of thing and I wouldn't want you to take away that things have changed relative to the mix of Capital One business. I think things are very similar to how they've been for a long period of time most of our pull back around the edges was like you all are revolver business is in a way just trying to be cautious in the context and industry getting a little bit carried away. While continue into pretty intensely go after the top of the marketplace. So I think things are going to be pretty consistent from the mix point of view as a general observation, but that number will bounce around and Cabela's has brought it down relative to the highs from a couple of quarters ago. Kenneth Bruce : Great. And our math would support that just the growth that you had in 2016 in particular is going to actually start to give you some of downward pressure on loss rates into 2018, so we're bit more optimistic about that that maybe you, my follow-up question is on the\u2026? Richard Fairbank : Ken, answer, can I? The one thing I wouldn't take to the bank because I don't take it to our bank is the vintage, vintages in general I think the way to think about vintages is that for a couple of years there are very clearly sort of bad guys and then there's kind of a stabilization and then there's this kind of over the rest of its life all other things being equally very gradual kind of positive right. So one thing that I've always been struck by is each vintage has a different personality that where it actually peaks the exact timing of when they turn. So I wouldn't lean in too hard to any particular vintage and count on that being a big contributor. But all of that said, the physics - number one, when I've come out with this growth math term, I've said look I can't be precise about exact timing at magnitude of things, but it's sort of physics. The physics works as you're saying. I just wouldn't lean in too hard on any one vintage really being a significant contributor to this year's performance, particularly 2016, which is the youngest of the three that I talked about in the surge. Anyway, sorry go ahead I interrupted. Kenneth Bruce : Yes. No, caution noted. I guess that my follow-up is just if CECL is going to create this potential capital event, would do you think about changing the mix of business that you were willing to do based on the potential like a loan loss expectations that had to go into that math? Richard Fairbank : Yes and the one thing I would just say about CECL. I think CECL is going to have an impact on a number of different asset classes. I don't think this is just something to be worried about with whether it's card or auto for us. When I look at it's really going to have an impact on any type of asset that has a long life where you're going to have to extend your coverage from what's a one or two year coverage window to a life time window. I think with card, one of the challenges with card is because it's a revolving asset and with CECL you're setting an allowance based on the outstanding balance. We may see that card isn't the asset class that's most impacted by CECL. But I think that the biggest challenges for CECL that I see are if you're going in and out of a cycle, it's really going to be pro cyclical and it's going to really put a challenge for all banks, not just Capital One for all banks. I think it's going to disincentive wise loan growth in tough times. Sorry to carry on there, but I think those are - they're broader impact than just in Capital One. Scott Blackley : But Ken I actually want to follow-up on the strategic spirit of your question. If you pull up on frankly the Credit Card business in general, subprime cards in particular. The tax on them if you will over time is pretty striking the capital requirements that have continued to build the stress test, modeling about that business, because it's a higher loss business, the front loading and then with FAS 166/167 bringing all that into front loading, the impact of a rapid growth in the business then you bring the CECL effect. This is a lot of tax on the business. What is clear to us we have to make sure that that we are risk adjusted return in the business like this is robust and resilient to all of this. I'm hopeful over time that that a rational industry incorporates these things I mean these things should show up in the form of higher required returns, higher pricing for the risk and things like that. One thing it does do is scare off a lot of players who dabble in this space and so I think it's pretty clear that people are going to have to really - I think that that people are going to have to really be good at this in order to do it and be very successful. But I think it is worth taking note on how much the tax on really most consumer lending in general has gone up in the banking business and now look in the end as markets equilibrate over time, I feel that that in the nature of our potential competitive advantage is the same. But we can't get there by just going in and doing the same thing and making the same assumptions we've done that we used to do and we ourselves have to ask it to deliver even more given the tax on it. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our final question tonight comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research Group. Chris Brendler : Hi, thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I think just focus on the non-interest income in the Card business for a moment, I think you mentioned the strong net interchange growth, but I think you've had some FX in this one and before anything to call out in that strong double-digit growth, the interchange either on the interchange reward side that's driving that. And as well that the service line, service fees and that statement as well sort of speeds are up for the first time in a long time I think you can pulling back on some of those credit products other to a non-leading related fees in the Card business and looks like that may reflected as well if you just had any insights on those to be the great things? Richard Fairbank : Yes, why don't I just start up on service charge? The service charges when you're looking at that on the year-over-year basis just remember that last year, we had a UK PPI charge that was around 37 million that impacted Q1 2017. So that's impacting that period-over-period and I just also mentioned that as part of the new accounting standard that we adopted. We reclassified about $18 million of FX related fees that used to run at the contrary to the service and got moved down into the operating expenses and so that's impacting Q1, but not in any of the prior period. So that's - it's really just some of the mechanical things that are impacting that trend line as opposed to core business things. Chris on the interchange side, we - as you've seen for years really the growth in purchase volume has well outstripped the growth in interchange revenues. Second thing I think has been very striking and it's what's behind your question is this number bounces all over the place and it's almost in any one quarter and especially be looking at growth rates any one quarter not only does that quarter bounce, but we're comparing it to a year-ago quarter that had its own bouncing dynamics to it. So I think it's kind of structural in the marketplace that the interchange growth is less than the growth in purchase volume because of the growing competitiveness of the marketplace and the growing penetration of great rewards products to all the players including Capital One, broader customer bases. But I also pleased to see though that even in the tremendously intense interchange race that we are - I mean the rewards competition that we see that it is the case if you pull way up from this bouncing ball. You see that year-after-year Capital One's been posting pretty solid net interchange growth in the face of all of this competition and all the moves to extend into broader parts of our customer base, and I think that that's a manifestation of the fact that. While we're competing very intensely, we keep our pencils very sharp and to make sure that's a collective economics of what we're booking is something that can really reward us over time. And we continue to believe in the economics of this franchise, we're investing so heavily in this top of the market spender business. And I think that - while this is a particularly high quarter and I wouldn't take that one to the bank. I think that the fact that there is real interchange growth is real. Chris Brendler : Great. Thanks. If I could ask one follow-up on credits in a different way and so looking at the loss rate, looking at the provision expense and reserve building, subprime loans in the mix you mentioned is actually - they are actually down on a dollar basis, so it's includes the Cabela's as a fact. Subprime is gone negative, our delinquencies are negative, loss rates are improving, and growth is slow. Any reason why reserve building shouldn't continue to slow from here in the card business? Scott Blackley : Chris thanks for the question. Look, I would just say that when it comes to the reserve that's a really dynamic process. You know that a small changes in expectations, given that we've got $100 billion card portfolio, a 10 basis point move. There's a $100 million of allowance, and so I think that there are a number of forces. Rich talked about all the dynamics that will impact our overall loss rate. And those are really the things that I think we'll be looking for to drive the allowance going forward as well as just the amount of growth that we're putting on the balance sheet. Jeff Norris : That concludes our call and our Q&A session for this evening. Thank you very much for joining us on this conference call today. And thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, if you have further questions, the Investor Relations team will be here after the call. Have a great night.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome, everybody to Capital One's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2018 results. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott are going to walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and click on Quarterly Earnings Release. Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements.

And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly Reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC. And with that I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott? Scott Blackley : Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.9 billion or $3.71 per share in the second quarter. We had three adjusting items in the quarter, which are outlined on page 13 of tonight\u2019s slide deck. We had a $400 million gain from the previously announced sale of our mortgage portfolio which was recorded in our other category. There was a $49 million build in our UK payment protection insurance customer refund reserve and we had a $15 million charge for restructuring events related to our previously announced business divestitures. Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share were $3.22. In addition to the adjusting items, we had a non-recurring adjustment to a vendor agreement which reduced operating expenses in our card segment by around $75 million in the quarter. Pre-provision GAAP earnings increased 13% on a linked quarter basis and 15% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion. Provision for credit losses decreased 24% on a linked quarter basis and 29% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by allowance releases in our Domestic Card and Auto businesses. Let me take a moment to explain the movements in allowance across our businesses, which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Improving delinquencies and lower charge offs resulted in a $72 million allowance release in our Domestic Card business and a $77 million release in our Auto business. Also the impact of the home loan sale and the transfer of the remaining portfolio to held for sale resulted in allowance decrease of $54 million. We increased our commercial reserves by $41 million in the quarter as we increased our allowance coverage ratio. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.1%. Excluding discreet items and the impact of the UK PPI reserve build, the quarterly rate would have been 21.2%. We continue to expect our 2018 corporate annual effective tax rate to be around 20% before discreet items. Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin decreased 27 basis points on a linked quarter basis. About half this decrease is seasonality as card customers typically increased payments after tax season, which is only partially offset by having one more day in the quarter. The other half of the linked quarter decrease was largely driven by three factors, the contra revenue portion of the UK PPI reserve build, a temporary increase in our cash balance due to the mortgage portfolio sale and finally the accelerating cost of deposits, which we believe will be a continuing headwind going forward. Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%. We completed our full 2017 CCAR authorization purchasing 800 million or 8.4 million shares of common stock in the quarter. As previously announced, following the Federal Reserve\u2019s non-objection to our 2018 CCAR plan, our Board has authorized repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2019. And we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, which is subject to board approval. Our current view of our capital need remains at around 11% of CET 1. We believe that we have sufficient earnings power to support growth and capital distribution. As I mentioned last quarter, how the capital frameworks ultimately incorporate the effects of CECL may impact our longer term view of capital. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on Slide 8 with our Credit Card business. We posted strong year-over-year growth in pretax income driven by revenue growth and significant improvements in provision for credit loss. Credit Card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our Domestic Card business, which is shown on Slide 9. In the second quarter Domestic Card ending loan balances were up $7.8 billion or about 8% compared to the second quarter of last year. Average loans also grew about 8%. Second quarter purchase volume increased 17% from the prior year quarter. Revenue for the quarter increased 3% from the prior year. Growth in average loans was partially offset by a decline in revenue margin. Revenue margin for the quarter was 15.9%, down 74 basis points from the second quarter of 2017, largely driven by the expected margin pressure from adding the Cabela\u2019s portfolio. Non-interest expense for the quarter was down about 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating expense in the quarter benefited from about $75 million in non-recurring items that Scott discussed. Improving credit trends were a significant driver of second quarter Domestic Card results. The charge off rate for the quarter was 4.72%, down 39 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.32%, down 31 basis points from the prior year. We\u2019re now on the good side of growth math. Credit performance on the loans booked during our growth surge in 2014, 2015 and 2016 has now turned and is improving year-over-year. This improvement is a good guy for overall Domestic Card credit. Pulling up the competitive marketplace remains intense, but generally rational. Supply of card credit is on the high side, although it continues to settle out a bit and our growth initiatives are gaining traction. We see increasing opportunity to grow card loans. Slide 10 summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the quarter we completed the sale of substantially all of our Home Loans portfolio and we summarized selected impacts to segment results in the commentary section on Slide 10. As you can see on Slide 10, ending loans decreased about 22% compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was more than offset by the Home Loans portfolio sale. The Auto business continues to grow with ending loans up 8% year-over-year. Competitive intensity in auto is increasing, but we still see attractive opportunities to grow. Ending deposits were up 4% versus the prior year with a 29 basis point increase in average deposit interest rate compared to the second quarter of 2017. We expect further increases in average deposit interest rate driven by higher market rates and increasing competition for deposits as well as changing product mix as our national banking strategy continues to gain traction. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased about 1% from the second quarter of last year with growth in auto loans and deposit offset by the Home Loans portfolio sale. Non-interest expense for the quarter decreased 9% compared to the prior year quarter driven by the exit of the mortgage business, the benefits of prior branch rationalization and our ongoing efforts to tightly manage cost. Provision for credit losses was down from the second quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of strong credit performance in our Auto business. The Auto charge off rate improved compared to the prior year quarter. Recall that second quarter charge-off rate last year was elevated by changes in how we recognize bankruptcy related charge-offs. Adjusting for these impact, the auto charge-off rate still improved modestly year-over-year in the second quarter. And as Scott discussed favorable credit trends drove an allowance release. Over the longer term we continue to expect that the auto charge-off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out. Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances were flat year-over-year and average loans decreased 2%. Both trends were driven by our choice to pull back in several less attractive business segments in the second half of 2017. With many of these choices behind us, ending loan balances increased about 3% from the sequential quarter. Ending deposits were down 6% from the prior year driven by increasing price competition. Second quarter revenue was up 1% year-over-year as strong non-interest income in capital markets and agency offset the decline in average loans and the effect of the lower tax rate on tax equivalent yields. Non-interest expense was up 7% primarily as a result of technology investments and other business initiatives. Provision for credit losses was $34 million in the quarter down 76% from the second quarter of 2017 driven by lower charge-offs. The charge-off rate for the quarter was essentially zero. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.1%. The criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.3%. In the second quarter Capital One delivered year-over-year growth in loans, deposits, revenues and pre-provision earnings. We tightly managed costs even as we continued to invest to grow and drive and to drive our digital transformation. We saw credit improvement across our businesses and growth math established itself as a good guy for overall Domestic Card credit trends. We continue to see opportunities to book attractive and resilient loans in our card, auto and commercial banking businesses and to grow deposits in our consumer banking business. We continue to expect marketing in 2018 will be higher than 2017 with essentially all of the increase coming in the second half of the year. And we continue to work hard to drive operating efficiency as we transform our technology infrastructure and change the way we work. After two years of significant improvement, we expect 2018 operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments, will be roughly flat compared to 2017. While efficiency ratio can vary in any given year, over the long-term, we continue to believe we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gain. We expect long-term improvements in efficiency ratio will mostly come from improving operating efficiency ratio. Pulling up, we continue to build an enduringly great franchise with the scale, brand, capabilities, and infrastructure to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our industry and our society. Our digital and technology transformation is accelerating and we\u2019re strengthening our position to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value. Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Leanne, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ken Bruce : Thank you, good evening. My question really relates to the growth that you see in the US credit card business. You kind of suggested that you\u2019re seeing opportunities to grow again. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s in the sense in the prime area and the subprime area, could you give us any sense as to what that product mix will look like going forward obviously you had a shift in the quarter. Scott Blackley : Right, Ken, first of all let me just comment on the mix shift in the quarter. So our asset mix percent subprime is 32% down 4 percentage points year-over-year. And that\u2019s basically close to our historical portfolio mix of about a third plus or minus. An important part of that reduction is the addition of the Cabela\u2019s portfolio which is kind of a heavily prime oriented portfolio. Also our credit lines have been a little bit lower the last couple of years. So but that is - our strategy remains the same. And so and that\u2019s also as I turn now to your question about where is the growth opportunity, we see the growth opportunity across the spectrum of where we play. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any important strategic change here we just I think as you know we always talk about the marketplace and we try to give a calibration of where we see opportunity. And we see the growth picture looking a little bit more positive now that\u2019s partly in the context that Capital One\u2019s growth has been pretty modest over the last year and even the last quarter or two we\u2019ve said as we look out actually we see a more positive picture and I would again say that. So we like what we see in the performance of recent vintages, we see promise in our innovation pipeline and we\u2019ve already said we expect marketing levels to be higher, so I think we see an enhanced growth opportunity over time. Ken Bruce : Thanks. And just there\u2019s been some speculation about Capital One\u2019s involvement with the Wal-Mart private label card and the co-brand. Can you and I understand you\u2019re not going to comment specifically on any particular transaction but can you lay out for us what would be one of the, what would be a classic retail partnership for Capital One? What makes it work specifically for Capital One? Richard Fairbank : So as you know the card partnerships business Ken is an [auction] [ph] based business. So in that way that we believe and we said for a long time. We\u2019re not out to go just be the very biggest of course we love to get growth opportunities when they emerge but it\u2019s certainly all about fit and discipline frankly in the context of the auction process. So to your question what do we look for we look for a strong partner fit in a world where a lot of companies out there certainly a lot of retailers and overall companies in America are struggling in the context of the rapidly changing environment we look for a strong partner with strong brands and a cultural alignment and a commitment to the card program, as an avenue for growth. We look for a partner that\u2019s motivated for the right reasons. If you look at the spectrum of card partnerships out there and it\u2019s essentially the partners behind those card partnerships. On one end of a continuum are the partners who view the card program as the central element for building a franchise and deepening customer relationships, the other end of the continuum is partners who sort of view the card program as a profit center, and we have consistently kind of tried to focus on the former side of the spectrum because not only is that where we think the better opportunity lies also the value that we have to add to what we can bring to the table in the context of a lot of our digital capabilities and underwriting and marketing would be consistent with those players who really are looking to card partnerships as a means to grow and really build a franchise. And however important card partnerships were in the past I think we should all understand they\u2019re more important in the emerging digital world just because of the centrality of how payments play and in the digital e-commerce environment relative to in the physical environment. The final thing that we look for is an economic deal that\u2019s attractive and especially in light of the good growth opportunities that we see. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying for years about the partnership opportunity I think the key thing is that we have felt and expressed so many times is it really needs to be a story of selectivity and discipline and that\u2019s a window into how we view those things. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. I saw that you put the impact of what the home loan business did for the - it was in the consumer bank for Q2 but can you talk a little bit about any balance sheet restructuring that you might be doing and things that might as you go through the second half of the year and things that could continue to help improve net interest income or net interest margin as a result of that or other actions that you can take? Scott Blackley : Hey Moshe, thanks for the question. With the sale so we sold around $16.8 billion of mortgages in the quarter. We\u2019ve reinvested a significant portion of that, around $9 billion went right into our investment portfolio and so that that was to really preserve liquidity associated with that. We used the rest of that to reduce our overall funding requirements. So we more or less already worked through all of the balance sheet dynamics of that and if you think about what that might mean to net interest margin on the one hand we\u2019ve gotten those home loans out of the book but we added the AFS securities actually we put them in to help maturity so we\u2019ve added those into the portfolio. So we do see a little bit of a pickup overall in terms of the margin but it\u2019s going to be pretty modest given the fact that we reinvested a substantial portion. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. The follow-up is talking - Rich you talked a lot about kind of you continue technological investments and the importance of payments. Could you talk a little bit about how any tools that you think you might have with respect to that could be brought to bear in the partnership area with respect to that the technology investments that you\u2019ve made payments? Richard Fairbank : Well there are I think are - so there\u2019s kind of two approaches to a partnership business. One can build a lot of custom technology associated with any particular partner or on the other hand one can build general capabilities that would be very compatible with partners who are really looking to build a franchise. And the way our tech transformation has happened by design which is really about building foundational technology and sort of working up the technology stack to create a lot of digital capabilities and flexibility within our card business that is a very natural thing to bring into the partnership business. So our philosophy is more create a way that we can help our partners ride on our technology path as opposed to go create a new technology path and one partner at a time. And that\u2019s really just about and what I\u2019m struck by I think at the end of the day, many companies, most companies in businesses in and around what we do have a set of capabilities that they need that are on a shared path of the very kind of thing that we\u2019re building. So as we\u2019ve said over the years that one of the benefits of our tech investment should be our ability to be a better partner out there. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We will take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good evening, guys. Maybe I\u2019ll start with credit so which we\u2019ve clearly seen growth math transition from a headwind to a tailwind. If I look you provision $6 billion annualized run rate year-to-date, if I look at the next year consensus assuming something in the $7 billion plus $7.5 billion plus range. I was just wondering given that growth math has transitioned to as you referred to the good guy. Can you just tough but the puts and takes on credit and given the backdrop how should we think about provisioning given that losses in almost every business are now down on the year-over-year business? Scott Blackley : So I think the way to think about it. At times I kind of have a joke in the past say over the last year that we\u2019re almost ready to retire growth math and then I kind of said actually that that\u2019s kind of all that misses an important nuance about how growth math works. And our earnings power is created in a business with high upfront costs and course the way growth math works is that when there\u2019s a surge of growth losses accelerate early on in the cost of those and then things finally settle out and then all other things being equal. There is a very gradual if not dramatic but a very gradual kind of good guy out there in terms of a gradual decline in charges for as long as that vintage is around all other things being equal. And so this is why we kind of adopted the language here that credit for that growth surge of 2014 through 2016 has turned to be a gradual good guy. So I think the way to think about credit and the credit outlook for Capital One is to think of you\u2019ve got the growth math which is kind of turned to be a good guy and then of course credits going to be impacted by the competitive cycle and other industry effects and by the economy. And with respect to that, the card industry as enjoyed a pretty long period of benign performance and we\u2019ve seen losses kind of gradually pickup as people\u2019s growth rates have gone up et cetera. But I think given where we are in the economic and the competitive cycle, I think it\u2019s very reasonable to expect that card industry losses probably have an upward tilt over time. And so you got the card industry effect and then in and to whatever one\u2019s assumption about the card industry in fact I would just overlay the sort of good guy of growth math with Capital One and that how to think about that\u2019s basically how we think about our current outlook. Ryan Nash : Got it and if I could ask one follow-up, if you just talk strategically about what you\u2019re doing in the deposit business and you talked about the potential for a changing product mix. Can you expand on that and what you think it will mean for the deposit business overtime? Scott Blackley : So we have talked for really for years about building a national banking strategy. Let me just comment on that for a moment and then talk just a little bit about mix. So as you know in a Capital One is really quite an anomalous institution relative to institutions that are anywhere near our size in the sense that we are not really even though they were the size of the biggest regional banks Capital One is national and just about everything that we do and especially our consumer business is where scale really matters the most. Information scale, brand scale operating scale, customers scale I think digital really increases the importance of scale in frankly, in different ways. But so in banking, we\u2019re we have a local bank in about 20% of the nation and a national direct bank in the other 80%. So while I think the history of banking is to the history of the quest of banks to build national banks is through buying other banks. We are more organically building our national bank and basically trying to go do it by not building how banking works today but in a sense trying to go where banking is going within physical distribution in key metropolitan areas and for us a full suite of products at the forefront of digital capabilities and a brand with a digital lean to it. So I think this is a natural for Capital One because we can leverage our national customer base investments in technology and transformation and digital transformation and our national brand. So this is been a strategy that been playing out gradually over time for Capital One. Let me now turn to the mix point, that the we launched our what we call 360, Capital One 360 money market account a couple of years ago and that competitive with the large national direct banks and we have seen solid growth in this product and also and we expect to continue to lean into our national banking strategy and so I think the mix of in a sense the National Bank component relative to the local banking component. I think the mix will you already see it happening inside Capital One. I think the mix change will continue that\u2019s more of a capital one point but then along the way of course we also have just what\u2019s happening in general with the competitive environment with the rates. So a combination of the natural thing that\u2019s going on with the rates and the fact that we or our organically growing a National Bank these are factors that will lead to both the gradual mix change but what it will sum up to is say increasing cost of deposits is a very natural byproduct of the marketplace and our strategy. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Had a question on CCAR and obviously with a lot more onerous this time around and it\u2019s going to get onerous more onerous all as equal. With all the discussions of the portfolio deals out there, was anything else but capital return asked in this past a mission and I guess Scott as you\u2019re looking ahead and talk it through CECL. Had there been any progress made on discussions with regulators? Scott Blackley : Yeah. Sanjay, thanks for the question. So when I look at what happened in CCAR really the decrease in the netter [ph] year-over-year in CCAR was really driven by three primary things. The first thing is that and this was an overwhelming driver. We really saw that the impact of tax reform was a significant component of the increase in losses that we had in CCAR and that that caused the decline in our netter. And we think that was primarily driven by the Federal Reserve\u2019s modeling of deferred tax assets and that with the Tax Act there was a lots of an NOLs and it looks like that in the pulling corporate it out into their modeling of deferred tax asset so that was a significant component of the decrease. And then yes we had a more severe scenario and as you know and as we\u2019ve talked about there were some adjustments to model that impacted us card and some prime auto which had an effect as well but the biggest of those things being the effect of the change in deferred tax assets. I would also just mentioned that in our modeling we did not include the noted that include the impact of our mortgage sale that was done after the submission and we were not able to incorporate that because you can only incorporate itself that have concluded in your CCAR model so that kind of gives you a sense of the puts and takes what happened in CCAR. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, just a follow-up question on the credit quality, Rich, obviously being on the good side of growth math. When we think about how it manifests itself to the charge-off rate going forward over like the short to intermediate term. Is it fair to assume that that small tail that you had of growth math is now completely out of the charge-off rate and then as you alluded to the mix get an improving towards prime and super prime. Will that be an additional tailwind to the credit metrics? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Okay. With respect to the small tail of growth math, yes I\u2019m actually glad you asked that question because definitionally what the small tail of growth math meant was as the surge \u2013 as the impact of the growth surge settles out and starts to turn the small tail math a slight up a modest uptick in charge-offs related to the surge in growth. That is actually now a good guy so it\u2019s got the other sign it\u2019s modest on the other side but thank you for that clarification opportunity there. With respect to mix, the mix the subprime mix which dropped several hundred basis points in the quarter. That was I really would not view that is any important change that\u2019s going to play out and in the future in the sense I mean the Cabela\u2019s effect is an enduring one so that we should all internalize that. But as I said earlier, we are our strategies pretty much the same across the credit spectrum that we have had we think the growth opportunities will be that we see opportunities across the spectrum and we our bullishness about being able to improve growth there be it off a fairly low level at the moment but the optimism that we have is really one that kind of spans the spectrum of what we do and so I think you should look more for consistency there. So I just to come back here CECL question we\u2019ve submitted a response to the Fed NPR on the CECL. I know there\u2019s been a variety of an industry discussion going around about how CECL might impact capital and how the capital regime might be adjusted will this happen see how the Fed takes all that feedback and what they may do from here. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Rich, just one question on the auto space, it seemed over the past few quarters the competitive intensity may have decreased a little bit with the exit of one significant new and used bank player but recently that players indicated that they\u2019re coming back to the market. Are you seeing any change in competitive conditions in that lending math? Richard Fairbank : Eric, we are seeing a change if there is let me try to just kind of in formally just kind of across the last several years. Try to calibrate this thing because the auto business I\u2019ve said many times, the auto business is hypersensitive to competition even more so than the card business because there\u2019s a dealer standing in the middle of every transaction and the dealer when the dealers see a particular lender who is more aggressive or has a loser underwriting or whatever there is a big movement that way and they try to drive others there as well. So this is an important question that you\u2019re asking. Years ago, so in the wake of the great recession with the retreat of a whole bunch of players we had kind of once in a life time competitive situation. And then we said, look it\u2019s only going to get more competitive for there and things gradually became more competitive over the years still there was significant opportunity there. It\u2019s sometime of around 2015 as I recall 14, 15 time period we started flagging, we were concerned about competitive practices it was competitive things partly a supply issue and a practices thing. But we saw supply increasing but we saw some competitive practices and we raised some alarm bells about that and Scott maybe help me with the timing here but I think sometime near that last quarter of 2015, we actually had a pretty significant decrease in origination volume around there related to this competitive intensity and the practices. A couple of quarters after that so I think now we\u2019re into sort of the middle of 2016 we saw that some of that, the competitive practices started I think competitors were pulling back a little bit from that and then we saw another player start pulling back significantly so from let\u2019s call it a good part of 2016 and pretty much all of 2017 there was again this is sort of in the middle of the competitive cycle or even competitive that the economic cycle is moving well along this anomaly that the card business had less than you would expect competition either to be the auto business excuse me, thank you, Jeff. What we are seeing in the context of that is more competition returning a little bit more frequency with respect to practices that were not fans of but I the way I would describe it is this is returning more to the way things were a couple of years before this. We still see good growth opportunities but it is very clear that the usual window that we enjoyed for about a year and a half, we should not expect that to be there and we what is our expectation is things will return to a more normal competitive environment and it will move along in the cycle as things do. But we still see good growth opportunities but we know which direction this thing is moving. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you. And if I may just one quick follow-up on NIM, Scott do I understand that it seems that this current level of card 6.7 is sort of the run rate level from here, but it seems like given the mix of asset growth and the deposit or just funding beta phenomenon that biased continues to be to the downside. Is that a fair characterization? Scott Blackley : I think that you\u2019ve got to kind of unpack all the things that are running through now. First of all, with respect to rates we\u2019ve been talking about this for a while but we\u2019re effectively neutral to rates and so I wouldn\u2019t expect that if rates follow implied forwards, you shouldn\u2019t see a lot of movement for us against that type of a change. And then I thought I said in my talking points about half the decline looking back on the prior quarter was a seasonal pattern and you historically seen NIM kind of drop down in Q2 and then climb back from there and that is really associated with the timing of some tax, seasonal payments that come in and that\u2019s offset a little bit by some day count. And then in the quarter, the other half of kind of what was going on there were really three factors, one was the contour of a new Porsche in the UK PPR reserve, obviously that\u2019s a quarter only impact we had the additional cash that we carried because of the sale of the mortgage that\u2019s also a quarterly impact that wouldn\u2019t continue and then we talked about the accelerating cost of deposits which we do think will continue to be a headwind. So when you kind they work your way through that there\u2019s really the one factor thing that we think is going to be a continuing headwind in is going to be the cost to deposits but we\u2019ll also see kind of puts and takes mix on the business and what the balance sheet ultimately looks like so that\u2019s kind of the recipe that I would describe in terms of where you should think about him going from here. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Donald Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : Hi, Rich. Two part private label question. One, have you made any executive changes in that area and then number two a little bit more complex. If you could talk about sort of how you weigh let\u2019s say doing a large private label deal with alternatively just doing more general purpose cards and other parts of your business because you look at private label they do tend to skew lower on credit the pricing obviously is pretty competitive you have CECL a tougher fact on cards and lastly they do tend to be very high touch where you can sometimes need a hundred people site at the retailer and so there\u2019s arguably execution risk et cetera and how do you look at that over the return so good or is it more of a longer term scale type thing that you\u2019d be considering as well? Richard Fairbank : So I think in the so we talked often about the partnership business and the card partnership business and it\u2019s a very natural sibling to having a branded business. We have tended to lean harder into going out to win general purpose programs generally than private label just only because there is just one whole not just synergy more with our own credit card business and we really like the opportunities to build customer relationships where they\u2019re we\u2019re doing everything we can to increase sales with the partner but also leveraging the opportunities to get out of store or out of partner sales which in a number of partners can be a very significant thing as well. So general purpose cards I think have some structural advantages over the private label. But it\u2019s all part of the sibling businesses that exist right next to what we do that\u2019s why we\u2019re in both of them and we evaluate one opportunity at a time. Donald Fandetti : Okay. And I don\u2019t know if they were able to come. Okay. If you were able to comment on any staffing changes or maybe you can\u2019t really talk about that? Richard Fairbank : We don\u2019t talk about staffing issues on call. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Richard Shane with JP Morgan. Richard Shane : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And I want to follow-up on something that Scott mentioned. Scott, you talked about essentially $75 million expense true up related to a vendor obviously I really can\u2019t mean that vendor. But if you could give us a sense of the nature of that relationship in any implications in terms of the business going forward? Scott Blackley : Yeah, Rick. Thanks for the question. You can imagine that for a company of our size we have a number of large vendor relationships and so during the quarter we concluded the negotiation that resulted in some adjustments to the outer arrangement and we had some release of a accruals. And so that\u2019s a onetime thing that they came and went and as we mentioned that hit our card segment so you know where to put that. Richard Shane : Got it. I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s perhaps related to credit reporting or storing in particular? Scott Blackley : Well. I\u2019m going to have to let you continue to gas because I\u2019m obviously not going to comment on specific vendors or areas that \u2013 that\u2019s not something that I think makes sense for us. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Napoli with William Blair. Robert Napoli : Thank you. I appreciate it. Rich, it is to be muttered with your views or on the health of the consumer from a spending perspective is that a slight deceleration in your spend growth I think across the industry slightly deceleration. Are you seeing the any more conservative consumer at all and just your views on where we are in the economic cycle would be interesting? Richard Fairbank : Yeah. I think pulling way up the economy certainly looks strong over the short term and I think consumers are benefiting from job growth, wage increases and tax cuts. And tax cuts have both had some benefit on take home pay for taxpayers but of course through the large corporate and business tax cuts I think will increasingly make their way through hiring and investment by companies. Now, so all of that is just all sort of things that stimulate. I think beyond that we\u2019ve been watching most closely things like debt growth and competitive intensity which impact consumer credit over time and we've seen some pullback in that growth recently although it\u2019s still the growth of revolving debt growing at 5.3%, the growth of non-mortgage debt so that\u2019s been lending [ph], auto lending and installment lending is down a bit that growth is down a bit also but it\u2019s at 4.6%. So what is clear is that the total indebtedness of consumers is growing. So I think just as we look at it over the near term you\u2019ve got a number of planets sort of aligning in a good way that sort of pulling up on the economy beyond that beyond the near term there longer term issues like in addition to the consumer indebtedness growing government deficits, trade issues and sort of the big sort of gradual demographic shifts that are that are going on. So we operate with a view that this benign economy which by the way is heading toward record levels for how long it\u2019s been since the last recession. We should understand and embrace it for what it is but not mistake that for things that are structural because I think a number of the structural elements probably operate in the other direction. Robert Napoli : And then I guess on the spend trends I mean a slight are you seeing, there seem to be a slight the deceleration I mean it\u2019s like hard but I mean are you seeing any change in spend? Is there any that have to do with the shift of Easter maybe? Richard Fairbank : We had quite a bit of growth going on and our consumer spending and I think that probably more result of Capital One specific things that are going on I would there is no near term sort of development on the spending side that we would note but I think we should all be cautious consumers of the consumers behavior lately as we make our business decision. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Wharton with JP Morgan. Steven Wharton : Good evening. I just wanted to follow-up one more time on the NIM. So you said that you expect that that happened, the decline sequentially would do the seasonality which I understand. But then you also mentioned that the impact of the contra revenue portion of the UK PPI reserve also impacted the NIM. Does that go away in 3Q and how much for that? Scott Blackley : Yeah. So the way that UK PPI works you book some of it has a return of revenue and so it actually comes in as a reduction of revenue or contra revenue which will impact just the quarter and that was roughly sized in the 3 basis point range. Steven Wharton : And then you also mentioned the sale of the mortgages themselves but then you said you\u2019d reinvested the proceeds of securities. So is that to imply then that the impacted to the NIM sequentially from the whole mortgage and security thing that that\u2019s pretty much in the run rate. Is there\u2019s not going to be a change sequentially from here? Scott Blackley : That\u2019s correct. And so we did hold some higher cash during the quarter as we work through putting that to work which was again another drag to NIM and it was roughly about the same size as the UK PPI either. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good evening. First question on capital you indicated that for your CCAR submission that was before the mortgage sale had been finalized so now that you\u2019re at 11% where you need to be and you\u2019re creating capital obviously with earnings. Would you consider going in for either de minims or a top up request for a capital return later this year? Scott Blackley : Well Betsy we those are certainly options that are available to us and what I would just say is as we\u2019ve done in the past. We\u2019re going to look at all of our options all the levers that we have to deploy capital whether that\u2019s capitalizing growth distributed to shareholders and we definitely recognize that that\u2019s a really important way for us to drive value for our shareholders so we\u2019ll be we\u2019ll be looking at all of our options going forward. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks and then Rich you mentioned earlier the subprime obviously having fallen in the quarter. How much of that was your own actions verses your customers that try to increasing given the improvement in the economy obviously we get a positive cycle drift in a strong economy and that that the other part of the question here is does it give you room to then we invest in that customer\u2019s side going forward or are your new loans that you are originating more likely to be above 660. Can you just some color there? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Yeah that I would doubt that if I could drift over any short period of time would be a very big factor I haven\u2019t specifically looked at that but I wouldn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t place too much on that. That we don\u2019t operate with a precise the subprime mix target, it is striking for how many years we have been around one third. So whether this number was that 32% or 35%, I don\u2019t think would have much impact on our pursuit of opportunities to us much I mean if it\u2019s the mix get way different than normal. Obviously we always watch it but I think the main thing is what is the nature of the competitive environment the nature of the consumer and probably most importantly the results of all the tests that we\u2019ve done and the vintages and we put it all together to just to calibrate what is the opportunity that we see and in my point is been Capital One is spend posting some pretty modest numbers on the lower end of the league tables for a number of quarters. For a variety of reasons but part of it probably was as we\u2019ve talked about term pulling in around the edges on some of the choices and things like that. I just think if we look at the opportunity we see some increased opportunity off of that lower base and that opportunity is across from is really across the spectrum all the way to the very top of the market. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Christopher Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neil. Christopher Donat : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask one of your auto lending side of the business and about the mix of it because with the prospect of tariffs on imported new vehicles I\u2019m just wondering what percentage of your business is used at this point? Richard Fairbank : Chris, we have not we don\u2019t give out that that number. However, certainly relative to a number of auto lenders, our mix is more toward the use side because we do not have a big partnership with a captive, a captive auto finance partnership that for some of the banks out there can lead to very significant volumes of new loans. So we\u2019re really more taking the mix of business that exists in the non-sub vented big part of the marketplace, but relative to the overall US marketplace that is shifted more toward the used car side. So with respect to your particular point, we probably have less exposure than some others might. Christopher Donat : Okay. That\u2019s helpful for me. Helped me understand the risk. Richard Fairbank : Yeah. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our final question tonight comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research. Chris Brendler : Hi. Thanks, good evening. Thanks, Rich excuse me and I just wanted to ask on the US consumer credit card business interchange growth lagged spending growth by a little bit, but still pretty solid low double digits. Can you comment at all about the rewards environment and how it\u2019s affecting your numbers and how you feel about the competitive intensity of the US card business especially among trends actors and your success there? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Yeah, Chris. The rewards let\u2019s talk of this call it the heavy spender business is a very competitive business. And it\u2019s been very competitive for really for a long time. But marketing levels are intense the competition in reward the I think the most notable thing over let\u2019s say the last say five years was the step up in rewards competition products and that kind of thing in the sort of 18 months to two years ago time period. And also not just for the banks but also at the same time Co-brand offerings. I think all of that continues to be intense I would describe it more as stable recently at an intense level. Upfront bonuses continue to be aggressive although they have also seemed to stabilize and are down of the real high they went to over a year ago. So I think this is a business where in order to succeed one has to there\u2019s a lot more than throwing products out there this is really I think a company needs to and there are a small number of players who would fit this description I think committed to what it takes to be in this business and build the sustain levels of brand equities over time to committed to the same levels of marketing that is required there and the investments from digital to high level servicing and everything else. So for many years we have been kind of all in on this business. We believe that it continues to be a good opportunity you\u2019ve seen capital one really for many years posting quite good growth numbers and I think into the teeth of a very competitive but fairly stable marketplace we see continuing positive opportunities to grow this business and to build a franchise which can be very profitable over the longer term and very resilient and be the cornerstone of a brand franchise that we are building. Chris Brendler : You think that brand is actually helping you gain market share without be as aggressive rewards or even investing in this brand for decades now and I would think that you\u2019re actually getting some benefit, some market share gains from the power of your brand. Richard Fairbank : I think brands a very important part of this thing. I don\u2019t think a company I don\u2019t think a bank can just win this game by just product offerings, it\u2019s too easy for people to match product offerings this there\u2019s so much more and there\u2019s great product offerings now all over the place. So I think it\u2019s really about a comprehensive all in strategy it\u2019s all about franchise and it\u2019s all about brand and customer experience and the key point I would leave with you is we have literally leaned into this business with a tremendous amount of priority and investment and focus for a whole bunch of years and I think through all the kinds of up and down in the competitive marketplace I think you\u2019ve seen some pretty consistency in the growth numbers that we\u2019ve been the organic growth numbers we\u2019ve been able to post in this business and we\u2019re optimistic for our prospects overtime. Jeff Norris : Thank you for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. The Investor relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Thanks for joining us. Have a great evening. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome, everybody to Capital One's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our third quarter 2018 results. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott are going to walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and click on Quarterly Earnings Release. Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion in the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials.

And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly Reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC. And with that I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott? Scott Blackley : Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.5 billion or $2.99 per share in the third quarter. We had two adjusting items in the quarter, which are outlined on page 13 of tonight's slide deck. We had a $141 million net gain on the sale of an exited business which was $0.22 per share. We had a build in our legal reserves of $170 million or $0.35 per share related to our ongoing AML investigations from various regulatory and legal enforcement agencies. Part of this build is to pay for $100 million civil monetary penalty, which has been imposed by the OCC as part of the 2015 AML Consent Order. As is often the case, our 2015 order had a placeholder for civil monetary penalties. This fine represents the next step in our resolution of this matter with the OCC. We have made significant progress against the terms of the order. The remainder of the legal reserve build is related to residual AML investigation risk. As other agencies besides the OCC continue to investigate AML issues relating primarily to our former check cashing business, we will provide updates of these investigations in our quarterly filings. These adjusting items were recorded in our other category. Net of these adjusting items, earnings were $3.12 per share. In addition to these adjusting items, we had one notable item in the quarter which was an impairment charge of $200 million or $0.32 per share related to investment portfolio repositioning to optimize capital and capture increased coupon to benefit future earnings. Provision for credit losses were down at 1% on a linked-quarter basis and down 31% year-over-year primarily driven by allowance for leases in our domestic card and auto businesses. Let me take a moment to explain the movements in allowance across our businesses which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Improving credit results resulted in $144 million allowance release in our domestic card business and a $75 million release in our auto business. We increased our commercial reserves by $33 million in the quarter as we increased our allowance coverage ratio. Lastly, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9%. We now expect our 2018 corporate annual effective tax rate to be around 22% before discrete items. This increase is based on our higher income from gains related to business exits and increases in non-deductible expenses from the legal reserves that I discussed earlier. Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin increased 35 basis points on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonality, day count, and the absence of the non-recurring items that we experienced in the second quarter of 2018. Net interest margin decreased 7 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by increasing deposit costs. We continue to believe that increasing deposit costs will be a headwind in NIM going forward. Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 11.2%. In the third quarter, we purchased approximately 5.8 million common shares, where $570 million of our $1.2 billion 2018 CCAR share repurchase authorization. We continue to view our capital need based on existing regulations to be around 11% of CET1. We believe we have sufficient earnings power to support growth and capital distribution. And as I mentioned last quarter, how the capital frameworks and CCAR ultimately incorporate the effects of CECL as well as the calculation in the CECL itself may impact our view on our capital requirements. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rich. Rich Fairbank : Thanks Scott. I'll begin on Slide 8 with our credit card business. We posted strong year-over-year strong in pretax income driven by revenue growth and significant improvement in provision for credit losses. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic credit card business which is shown on Slide 9. Before turning to third quarter results, I'll briefly discuss our new long-term partnership to be the exclusive issuer of Walmart private label and co-brand credit cards which we announced early in the quarter. Walmart is America's largest retailer and we have a shared vision of how a card partnership can be a central part of a winning retail and e-commerce strategy. There is great leverage from payments innovation, digital capabilities, data and analytics to deepen relationships, drive digital adoption, and create exceptional customer experience. In addition to our agreement to be Walmart's new partner, we're also in the process of discussing the potential acquisition of the existing portfolio of Walmart credit card receivables. As you'd expect there will be a range of potential outcomes until this process runs its course. For now, all of our guidance and forward-looking statements exclude the potential impact of Walmart. Pulling up, we like the economics of the deal and we believe that our relationship with Walmart will generate significant value for years to come. In the third quarter, domestic card ending loan balances were up $1.6 billion or about 2% compared to the third quarter of last year. Average loans grew about 7%, the Cabela's portfolio acquisition which was completed just before the end of the third quarter of 2017 drove the larger increase in average loans. Third quarter purchase volume increased 16% from the prior -year quarter. Excluding Cabela's, purchase volume growth was about 10%. Revenue increased 5% from the prior year quarter. Growth in average loans was partially offset by a decline in revenue margin. Revenue margin was 16.3%, down 42 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. The expected margin pressure from adding the Cabela's portfolio was partially offset by favorable margin impacts from strong credit. Non-interest expense was up about 8% compared to the prior year quarter largely as a result of higher marketing. Improving credit trends continued to be a significant driver of domestic card results in the third quarter. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.35%, down 29 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.80%, down 14 basis points from the prior year. Credit performance on the loans booked during our growth surge in 2014, 2015, and 2016 is improving year-over-year and is driving most of the year-over-year improvement in the overall domestic card charge off rate, that's why I've said that growth math has turned into a good guy. Pulling up, the competitive marketplace remains intense but generally rational. Supply of card credit is on the high side although it continues to settle out a bit. Against that backdrop, our domestic card business continues to gain momentum. We're booking double-digit purchase volume growth. We're seeing traction in our innovation pipeline. Our investments in marketing are driving strong growth in new account originations and improving credit continues to drive strong income and returns. Slide 10 summarizes third quarter results for our consumer banking business both ending loans and average loans decreased about 21% compared to the prior year quarter driven by the home loans portfolio sale in the second quarter. The auto business continues to grow with ending loans up 6% year-over-year. Competitive intensity in auto continues to increase but we still see attractive opportunities to grow. Ending deposits in the consumer bank were up 6% versus the prior year with a 38 basis point increase in average deposit interest rate compared to the third quarter of 2017. We expect further increases in average deposit interest rates driven by higher interest rates and increasing competition for deposits as well as changing product mix as our national banking growth strategy continues to gain traction. Consumer banking revenue decreased about 3% from the third quarter of last year. The revenue reduction from the home loans portfolio sale was partially offset by growth in auto loans and retail deposits. Non-interest expense decreased 7% from the prior year quarter driven by the exit of the home loans business and lower branch infrastructure costs. Provision for credit losses was down from the third quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of strong credit performance in our auto business. The auto charge off rate improved compared to the prior year quarter and stronger than expected auction value drove an allowance release. Over the longer term, we continue to expect that the auto charge off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out. Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 2% year-over-year and average loans were roughly flat. Both trends were driven by our choice to pull back in several less attractive business segments in the second half of 2017. With many of these choices behind us linked quarter growth was stronger with ending loans up about 2% and average loans up about 3%. Commercial bank ending deposits were down 7% from the prior year. Several commercial deposit customers are rotating out of deposits and into higher yielding investments into rising interest rate environment. Third quarter revenue was down 1% year-over-year driven by the effect of the lower tax rate on tax equivalent yield. Non-interest expense was up 4% from the prior year quarter primarily as the result of technology investments and other business initiatives. Provision for credit losses was down 14% from the third quarter of 2017 driven by lower charge-offs. The charge off rate for the quarter was 0.16%. The commercial bank credit sized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.2%. The credit sized non-performing loan rate was 0.4%. While the credit performance of our commercial banking business remains strong increasing competition from non-banks continues to drive less favorable lending terms in the market place. We're keeping a watchful eye on market conditions and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices. In the third quarter Capital One continued to drive solid results as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation and we saw another quarter of credit improvement across our businesses. Looking ahead, we continue to see good opportunities for account originations in our credit card and auto businesses. As you've seen in the marketplace we launched a new card product and we're rolling out our national banking marketing. As a result, we expect fourth quarter marketing expense to be elevated well above the historical seasonal patterns that we typically see between Q3 and Q4. We continue to work hard to drive operating efficiency as we transform our technology infrastructure and change the way we work. After two years of significant improvement we continue to expect full year 2018 operating efficiency ratio will be roughly flat compared to 2017 net of adjustments, but with the investment portfolio repositioning. Scott discussed at the beginning of tonight's call it will be tight. While the efficiency ratio can vary in any given year, over the long-term we believe we'll be able to achieve gradual and efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains. We expect long-term improvements in total efficiency ratio will mostly come from improving operating efficiency ratio. Pulling up we continue to build an enduringly great franchise with the scale, brand, capabilities and infrastructure to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our industry and our society. Our digital and technology transformation is accelerating and is powering our ability to grow new customer relationships and deepen engagement with new and existing customers. We're well positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value. Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Leanne, please start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Rich, just to clarify on the Walmart portfolio, if you were to get just a fantastic price, are you saying you would buy it meaning that there is nothing structurally that would cause you not to, want to own it, it's more of just economics like any other deals. Is that fair, and I know you can't say a lot about it? Rich Fairbank : Don, we understand this portfolio for us to agree to buy the back book, it needs to be at a price and at terms attractive to us, which will be determined through the negotiations over the next quarter or two. Don Fandetti : Got it and then just sort of. Rich Fairbank : There's nothing beyond that. Don Fandetti : Got it, and then obviously the multiple in the stock is in the sort of high sevens, low eights, and the market is telling us that the cycle is turning, yet if you just looked at your numbers, it would suggest the opposite. Could you talk a little bit about where you think we are in the cycle and are you preparing for sort of a weaker credit environment? Rich Fairbank : It's a great question, Don, because in so many ways, one can't help, but we struck by just how good the economy at this point is, and in some ways, it almost feels too good to be true, and so \u2013 and that's not a credit card comment. A lot of times on these calls, I'll make comments about the card industry, about card supply, about the consumer. We can talk about those things and, maybe I will in a moment, but you know I think the thing that sort of most catches our attention is, just how many sort of planets have aligned to make this environment so positive right now, but we can't forget the longer term issues out there, the implications of rising interest rates, growing government deficits, trade related issues, and also cumulatively some of the effects that's been going on with consumer indebtedness even though sort of the supply issues out there have gotten a little bit better in recent couple of quarters. So what we are doing is given the sort of dichotomy, we feel about the environment here, we're taking a little bit of a dichotomous strategy. So we feel really good about the growth opportunities in the card business to originates accounts, we've got a lot of successful programs going on as I mentioned on the marketing side where we of course have seasonally high marketing, but and we're doing some rollouts of sort of, new product rollouts, national banking, and so on, but we're leaning into growth opportunities, and what we're doing, the dichotomous compensating thing that we're doing is being even more cautious on credit lines because it's really not the growth of accounts that creates exposure, the exposure comes obviously really by definition by the extension of lines and the build of balances. So, we've been talking caution for really probably two, 2.5 years at this point relative to credit lines, but within the last year or so, we've even kind of further dialed back on initial lines and on some of the line increase things we're doing, not because of anything that we see in our own portfolio but really more out of this just kind of intuitive concern about the marketplace. Our philosophy is, let's continue to build the -- capitalize on the window to generate accounts because if you don't - they're not forever available, you need to capture them in the window, but then be extra careful about the extension of line. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Scott, I wanted to make sure I understood the impairment charges on the investment portfolio on its go forward impacts. I think I heard you say it's going to benefit earnings going forward. Could you elaborate on that, and just I want to make sure it's in the other segment in other, I guess non-interest income, right? Scott Blackley : Yes, so in terms of the impact, you've got it right, it's in non-interest income and it does impact the other segment. Basically, this was a securities rotation, Sanjay. So in Q3, we identified around $3 billion of agency MBS that was in AFS and had a mark of around $200 million loss that was sitting in AOCI. As you know, that impacts our capital position and it creates a deferred tax asset for us. In Q3, we identified that we had the intent to sell those securities and that caused us to move the mark out of AOCI and into earnings, so that's kind of what happened and why we recognized the $200 million. On a go forward basis in Q4, we've been selling those securities and reinvesting them in current coupon agency MBS. That improves the capital efficiency of those securities, and it is going to increase the yield on that $3 billion by around 200 basis points. So, on a go-forward basis, we would expect to see that improve our net interest margin by just a few basis points. And now, I just also mentioned that during the period that we held those after we put them, we identified this is available for sale. We saw rates move a little bit, and so in Q4, we\u2019ll probably have a bit more of a mark on those before we're able to sell the entire portfolio, so that's kind of the picture there. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay and then second question, Rich. You mentioned that the digital transformation is accelerating and it's helping your growth. Can you provide some specific anecdotes? I guess is Walmart one of them and maybe just how you feel your mode is relative to your peers. Rich Fairbank : Let's pull way up on the digital transformation. I think this is the most important thing, it's the thing every company needs to be spending more time talking about maybe anything other than just risk management itself given that we're in the banking business. But it is very clear that, banking is going to be totally transformed and everything about how a bank works, as it is experienced from the outside and how it works on the inside, are going to need to change in order to in the end deliver real-time, intelligent, digital customer experiences. So years ago, we declared a bold destination to basically build a technology company that does banking rather than a bank that uses technology and so really starting at the bottom of the technology stack and working up we have been all on this transformation for years and as a lot of work one does on the down deep in the technology stack it's not something investors can see, it's not something the outside world can see. Frankly it feels like that a lot of costs, it can feel like a lot of cost and not necessarily a lot of benefits. But what we're struck by is, everything that we want to accomplish on the technology side, on the - inspect the customers, product - customer experience, product innovation, leveraging machine learning, some international banking aspirations. They all have the same shared path of transformation that they have needed and being really many years now into this transformation we can feel, everywhere we look inside the company this - the benefit is accelerating because each transformation of one thing sort of helped the next. So the question we're often asked is, that's great and everything but how can we see it on the outside and it is - so where does it manifest itself. Walmart is certainly a specific example of that, there are probably a lot of factors that went into why Walmart made the selection that it did, but I certainly believe that the shared transformation journey we reach in our investment in payments and digital capabilities was a very important part of that decision. We also see it in the customer experience that by all the metrics that we look at, Net Promoter Scores, some of the external rankings that you see out there. Our customer experience has been dramatically improving. J.D. Power each year does a ranking of the best mobile banking apps as an example in 2017 Capital One was number one in that ranking, just came out again few weeks ago, Capital One is number one in that ranking again. Now we don't - our company doesn't rise and fall based on some ranking out there but these are sort of manifestation of things. I would direct you to look at things like our CreditWise tool. There are lot of folks out there giving credit scoring, information, CreditWise is a tool that allows customers to really deeply understand and monitor their credit scores and it's really a gateway and will be a growing gateway into whole set of experiences that can help people use credit wisely. If you look at our auto finance business Capital One couple of years ago launched the Auto Navigator product that allows car buyers to independently compare cars, search national inventories, negotiate prices and here's the most unique thing which I think is in fact unique, get pre-approved for financing and this is for basically in a nanosecond for any automobile on any lot in America, now that real-time machine learning driven kind of capability you can't bolt that on this - you can't build on the side of a bank. That product stands on the shoulders of years of technology work that's been involved in attracting world class talent, transforming how software engineering is done, rebuilding our technology infrastructure, transforming our data environment, going to the cloud, transforming how we work and going all in on machine learning. So what happens is, these things any one of these sort of shows up and it's interesting and maybe one looks at it and says, well maybe that's different from another product that's out there. But what I'm struck by Sanjay and I'm not surprised by it because I believe this is really the payoff that will accelerate here, is that going all in on this transformation the benefits one doesn't have to pick one benefit versus another because on the other side of this transformation is the opportunity to be way faster than the market, offer way better product, have way better risk management, along the credit dimensions, fraud, cyber security, that's all shared path, same thing better operating controls in a world where the regulatory requirements and frankly the expectation is on banks to deliver well controlled environment in a complex industry is very, very high. Better economics and all of this in service of the most important thing which is, real-time personalized experience. This is for our customers, not just an app but integrated right into their lives. So that's the journey that we're on the - we see - the manifestation of these benefits on many dimensions but it will show up more as it will pop up in different ways for our investors. But the final thing I want to say is that, is the efficiency benefits that come from this. Now when one embarks on this journey the efficiency benefits are not immediate. Even though one of the most obvious benefits of technology investment is the ability to get more efficient. What's striking though is, it's not like one invests for a couple of years and then suddenly stops investing. We're investing in digital, we will continue to invest in digital. We will always invest in digital until probably one day we'll look around and a 100% of everything that we do is basically digital. But along the way while technology investment has continued to be significant. We see more, the sort of meter of the cost benefits that come from this meter continues to increase and it shows up in, a lot of saving on legacy technology itself and the ability to really change the direction of the cost of the analog channels and operations in the company. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So Rich, I was hoping we could start with loan growth. Marketing expense was up a lot in the third quarter as you've been flagging and you're guiding to the fact that it's going to be up a lot again in the fourth quarter and I was just wondering, are you seeing the window for growth reopening, I know that you don't set growth targets, but what do you think this means for this increasing up marketing spend will mean for the improvement in loan growth overtime. Thank you. Rich Fairbank : So I don't see this, this is not a wind the size of sort of the window that we saw in 2014, 2015, 2016 when we had way outsized growth. What we're seeing is just a lot of traction in terms of generating new accounts obviously, you see the purchase volume numbers, but for a lot of reasons probably many of them related to some of the digital innovations that we have done and some of the things happening on the customer side, we're seeing very nice traction in new account origination and so we're leaning into that. We've already talked about the marketing that goes along with some of these growth initiatives. So the only thing I again want to stress is that, the loan growth is going to be more of a function of what we about credit lines. It's not entirely I mean because that we originate has a credit line on it. And so I don't want to overstate this point, but how we dial the knob of credit lines which will be primarily driven by how we feel, from a line of scrimmage call point of view about the card market place and the economy, that will be the biggest driver of the loan growth. What we're excited about is the ability to generate a lot of accounts, they represent sort of stored opportunity that can be harnessed when we open up those lines at a later point. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then Scott, you highlighted $170 million reserve build for $100 million the fine for the OCC related to AML. Can you maybe just remind us where you are with the remediation and what additional investments will need to be made to inevitably get out of the consent orders? Thanks. Scott Blackley : Ryan, so on the Consent Order we've been working on that since 2015. I think we've made substantial progress. I think the bulk of the work that we needed to do has been accomplished and so I don't think that we have a large cost headwind in front of us and we're hopeful to see that thing gets resolved here sooner than later. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Rich, I wanted to follow-up on one of the points you made earlier. On one hand, it seems from the outside looking in, like we're at a pointless cycle where your underwriting standards are leading your growth in auto and card to continue to gradually slow, as we've been seeing for like the last 16 to 18 months in both card and auto. But you talked about leaning into growth opportunities which seems a little bit inconsistent with what we see in the data and so I was just hoping that you could help us reconcile the difference between what appears to be showing up in the data versus the point you made about leaning into the growth and then maybe give us a sense of whether we can expect to see a stabilization in growth at some point. Rich Fairbank : Sorry, what are you pointing at in particular that says everything would indicate the other direction? Can you just? Bill Carcache : No, I'm sorry. I was just pointing out, if we look at the year-over-year growth in card and the year-over-year growth in auto, that year-over-year growth is, it's still positive. It's just been decelerating from the peak of you know 16 to 18 months ago. So just wondering if you could comment on that versus [indiscernible] point about leaning into the growth. Rich Fairbank : So let me talk about card and auto because they're slightly different stories. Let me start with auto. The auto industry over the last I don't know, probably two years has had anomalous situation where even though we're moving along in the credit cycle, the supply and demand situation kind of changed due to the pull back of one or maybe two significant players in the business. So Capital One really leaned into that growth opportunity and ever since we've been leaning into that, we've said overtime that opportunity will regress back to something more normal, but we like the opportunity but let us all remember that where we are in the cycle, let's remember used car prices have been high for so long, we fear the industry forgot about where they are at some point. The only way it's got to be down on some of that stuff. And so, but a lot of the auto growth has been driven by some positive competitive dynamics in the business, those still exists they're not as big as they used to be and so our growth is slowing but it is still there we've got some technology benefits in that space. I think we still feel good about the opportunity, but it's not nothing that would jump be a some big change from the trajectory that we're on. On the card side, the card industry I've been struck by the stability in the card industry kind of let me just back and sort of describe things that have gone on. I think there was a significant window for growth few years ago, we capitalized on that. Everybody in the industry saw us, supply shooting up, we saw some of the - in the second quarter of 2016 vintage curves across the whole industry starting gapping out and we and a number of other players, all identified this and it was a bit of shot across the bow [ph] to the card industry that don't get to ahead of yourself and I think the industry took the caution to heart little bit. In the meantime the very competitive marketplace, the pursuit of heavy spenders, all the rewards, products, intensity and all of that kind of reached the peak a couple of years ago and it's kind of settled out. so what I see is, a stable and a very competitive but stable [audio gap] and I think relative to what I've seen in 20 some years of having this company a relatively smart industry if you will about the choices they're making such that the card industry continues to offer growth opportunities, not incredibly big growth opportunities but it offers growth opportunities for a number of players in the business who are pursuing their individual strategies. The point I was making is, the particular strategies that we're pursuing, the particular opportunities that we see in the card business are something that we're leaning into, but it's more about account origination and you should not expect that to lead to some big outsized growth of loans because we're simultaneously pulling back out of an abundance of caution on the credit line side. So it's sort of inside Capital One it feels like we're really leaning into a growth opportunity, for you as investors it probably won't feel as much like that, but that sort of gives you some color on how could I simultaneously sit here in these earnings calls and being saying wow, I see the marketplace got some pretty good opportunities, we're leaning into the growth and then we're posting some numbers that are kind of the low end of the league tables of industry growth. So I think that's the context. Thank you. Bill Carcache : That's super helpful. Rich. Thank you, if I may as a follow-up. Could you just quickly just elaborate on the competition that you're seeing from non-banks that you mentioned earlier and that's it. Thank you. Rich Fairbank : You're talking about on the commercial side. Bill Carcache : Yes. Rich Fairbank : So I kind of go back to, I start with a little bit of - this is a way oversimplified thing, but if you go back and look at recessions there might be, a lot of truth to this particular oversimplified little maxim, which says after a big recession happens look at which things did the best and be highly sceptical about their performance in the next recession and maybe the inverse is true for those. So what I was struck by in the last recession how well C&I lending did for example in general and then we looked and within the banking space, we looked at for so many banks out of the thousands of banks that are out there, they continue to lose the opportunity to generate consumer side of the business, generate growth there because it is so scale driven and so much of the business is being taken over by a few national players and so, so many banks have been painted into a little bit to a corner of limited asset growth opportunities but certainly seeing good opportunities on the C&I side and so that's kind of I've always felt that - put that in your little cautionary thing. Additionally what we've seen of course now with the US economy and the years of aggressive monetary policy and accompanying low interest rates, low inflation. Investors have been pushed out on the risk curve to seek higher returns. And this has caused as you know a wide range of assets from equities to credit securities to rise in price. And as these assets prices have continued to rise and yields have continued to fall, we just see investors still searching for other ways to continue generating returns. Sponsors are paying higher multiples for companies, they're using more debt to finance them. It's striking and I looked through the chart the other day that just said the percent of deals that involve weakened assumptions if you will, sort of in the marketplace. There's more aggressive assumptions being used, so even when people are looking at things like EBITDA. The way the EBITDA assumptions are being made, there is weakness all around the edges there. Non-banks unhampered by regulation are accepting more aggressive structures in an attempt to provide their investors return. And this just increase competition has its way of sort of virally spreading out in the marketplace and that has caused lenders to accept lower yields and to give on terms. Now as a general observation on banks, I think banks have been the pillar of strength and generally of trying to stay very disciplined. But I don't think you can put a wall around these different parts of the marketplace and so we see things on the banking side that would be in the same direction if not the magnitude. So what are we doing about this, so one thing we're watching and obsessing about it, but we like pretty much every other bank that we heard on the call, they're calling for the need to stay disciplined in this case specifically what we've done is, to identify the sectors that are particularly vulnerable to these kinds of trends or have structural reasons that maybe less resilient and we have reduced exposure in those sectors and the fact if you look at last number of quarters probably in the last six quarters, maybe Capital One's loan growth has been pretty [indiscernible] on the commercial side which is really a lot of that been driven by the dialing back and reducing exposures in all of the areas that we identify as having a concern. So I think as a cross calibration across all the market places that we serve at Capital One. I think the C&I, the commercial lending marketplace particularly on the C&I side is probably one that looks further along in the economic cycle, more subject to the classic ways that lenders talk themselves into you know it's going to be okay, but when I calibrate I feel quite a bit better about the lending conditions that are going on the consumer side. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Just a couple of follow ups. First Rich, just going back to Walmart for a moment, my understanding was that historically buying non-prime assets was very anathema [ph] to Capital One. So I guess I'm wondering what about this particular portfolio or perhaps the relationship with Walmart itself makes it more compelling to do so. Rich Fairbank : Well we don't view this deal when we talk about this deal, we don't call it this is a portfolio, this is a whole conversation about a portfolio acquisition. This is a conversation about a partnership with a company that has an unbelievable franchise and is all in on really one of the on an extraordinary transformation in an industry that is having an extraordinary revolution in it, that parenthetically all of us in banking should go to school on; on how that industry is evolving. So we start with Walmart themselves as a partner and the benefits of that relationship. A company with a very strong franchise. They're motivated for the right reason about their card program we've seen a lot of partnership deals out there, where the big objective function is, how can the retailer just maximize profits from the credit card. So Walmart is so focused on leveraging this to build and grow their franchise and drive their digital transformation and finally and the partnership agreement really aligns out economic and strategic interest and that's really important to us because we've seen a lot of things out there, where it might be nice to go sign a contract. But the two parties have very different objective functions just by virtue of the way the contract is structured and we've been vocal about that, as we've gone around in the industry in terms of what we talk about that we want and we think it's best for the partner. So that leaves us then back to the back book or the existing portfolio. When you look at partnership deals with a couple of exceptions in the industry it is typically the case that back books follow front books, when a retailer switches issuers. There is obviously a lot of benefits from a customer experience and data perspective, but it's not always the back book follow front books and at Capital One we've had circumstances where we've done a successful front book deal without taking the back book and so now finally to your question. We see the business logic to have the back book come along with the front book have it all end in one partner, there's a lot of business logic. To us, it is a about price and terms and you know I think you're right Eric, you followed us for a lot of years, we've been very kind of vocal about some of the portfolios that are out there for sale in the marketplace. In general there are lot of things that we've passed on and for us to, we will agree to acquire this at pricing terms that are attractive to us and which help us mitigate the issues that we've often been concerned about portfolios out there in the marketplace. Eric Wasserstrom : Great, thank you for that and then just one quick follow-up on the net interest margin. I was just trying to understand the very significant expansion in NIM with the go forward expectation of compression cause it seems like many of that dynamics that might drive that compression going forward, were also evident in this recent period. So I'm just trying to understand like what's causing this change in cadent. Scott Blackley : Eric let me just go back and talk about the quarter and what happened with NIM in the quarter. So on a quarter-over-quarter basis, net interest margin increased by 35 basis points which is really driven by three factors. First of all recall that last quarter I called out several items that were impacting the second quarter that we didn't expect would go forward. We had the UK PPI reserve build, we had an excess cash position that we had as a consequence of exiting some of our home loans business and then we had the seasonal impact of card yield and balances being lower as customers typically increase payments after the tax season in the second quarter. So all those things we expected to not recur in the second quarter or in the third quarter and we saw that actually came to fruition. And then the other part that I would say is, is that in the third quarter we had a full quarter of having no home loans portfolio in our loan book and so that brought forward some higher yield and then finally this quarter, we actually had an extra day to earn income, so that was a positive. Now those were all kind of things that moved that drove the performance of the linked quarters positively. I will say that there continue to be a small headwind on a linked quarter basis from deposit cost and that's the one thing that I would expect to continue to a headwind going forward. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Rich, you talked a bit and I know you said not to over rely on it. But talked a little bit about the lower credit lines that you've been offering and can you talk a little bit about how do you balance the risk of kind of adverse selection and how you think about then trying to grow in this environment, is it that more of the growth is going to be in partnerships. I mean, how should we think about it given that focus? Rich Fairbank : Well Moshe, we are gosh we have many, many years of testing and analysis around that. It's a very sophisticated question, you're asking because a lot of times attempts to mitigate risk can actually cause risk because of the big role of it, as you say selection, be it positive selection or adverse selection plays and ultimately the credit performance. This isn't just an actuarial science that repeats itself all of the time. so we - but there are many positions on the dial on the Moshe and so there initial credit lines but then there's also just the frequency and size of credit line increases and the circumstances under which one granted and I think that we do view there's a quite range over customer relationships in terms of when we sort of monetize the opportunity for greater credit extension, but I don't want to paint a picture of starvation lines that cause people to say that this doesn't have utility to me, these are all within what we see as a sweet spot within the continuum of choices that one can make, there's a sweet spot and we're just dialed down within that sweet spot relative to some other times that we have made choices on the higher end of that sweet spot. The striking thing is, there's just so many balances affected by that choice. For example, this is a thing that you look around the card industry and it's probably true even at the moment, but look at the card industry over the years. So often the greatest loan growth is coming to the companies who in that particular year are dialing up their line increase programs. And so often I think all of us have the mindset that marketing programs are going on and that there must be a one-to-one correspondent marketing programs between marketing programs and accounts being booked and therefore loans. So we're just - this enables us Moshe to lean in and go really go for the growth opportunities we see without feeling we have to hold back so much and to overlay the caution that we feel is pretty prudent at the same time. Does that make sense? Moshe Orenbuch : Yes, it does and just kind of follow-up on the questions around Walmart. Could you just talk for a moment about the different approaches you might take to both Walmart relationship and the rest of your portfolio depending on whether you do or do not buy the portfolio from Walmart? Rich Fairbank : Sorry the different approach is, we might take relative to what. Moshe Orenbuch : Well I mean, obviously it would increase the size of your portfolio 10% or so and - I mean are there any things that you would do differently in terms of your core growth, if you found out you weren't buying that portfolio or if you found out that you were. Rich Fairbank : Our core growth in one minus Walmart. Moshe Orenbuch : Yes. Rich Fairbank : Our core growth. It wouldn't have any impact on the growth elsewhere because I really want to pull up again. We don't have any growth targets at Capital One. We never set growth targets and I think all the folks who are running different parts of our lending businesses are all out there trying to figure out what is the nature of the opportunity they see and the risk that they see and this is why, Capital One so often business-by-business is either at the top of the leading tables or the bottom of the league tables in terms of growth. Within individual parts of business the same thing is true. I mentioned earlier in commercial, I smiled when I looked at the chart of the growth rate of the different segments of commercial that had and they were in red or green based on what direction they were going and they were pretty darn big numbers in both direction just reflecting differing degrees of choices in individual businesses. Walmart won't have any impact on the growth choices that we have elsewhere and whether or not we get the existing portfolio because all across our card business we're leaning into capture all the growth opportunities that we see and we like our opportunities. The only thing about Walmart is, just understand that it's going to be a while before we finally start the Walmart relationship from a new account origination point of view, there's a whole bunch of work that has to be done to get ready for this, to get this thing off the ground and so on. So I think the really powerful opportunity for Walmart is not something that going to be very near term thing, but it's really the opportunity to take not just a pretty big company but a Fortune 1 company of which there are only one of those and really work together to build an opportunity that can really enhance their franchise and accelerate their digital transformation. Scott Blackley : Moshe, just one other thing that I would mention before we move on there. One of the things that would be impacted, if we didn't move forward in getting the Walmart portfolio would be our capital position and so between now and when we might acquire that, you may see us accreting capital above our 11% capital needs in the event that we weren't in a position to move forward in acquiring that portfolio and as Rich talked about, we may see that go all the way into Q1 of 2019. I think it's unlikely that we would be able to do anything with capital distribution plans until CCAR 2019, so we would end up probably going into that with a higher capital level, than we otherwise would. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rich Shane with J. P. Morgan. Rich Shane : When we look at the digital investment and we look at the growth of low loan balance accounts. One conclusion that could be drawn is that you were skewing towards a deliberating this towards a younger demographic. Is that one of the passives what we see going on here? Rich Fairbank : Rich, I've not looked at data recently to be sure of the answer to that question. I do believe at times when I have looked over the years at our demographic mix relative to others. I have been struck at the younger lean that we have in the business and I believe a number of choices we're making are probably enhancing that, those include the pretty much all of the variations of the things we're doing on the digital side in the card business some of the marketing that we're doing and the challenger marketing probably a little younger leaning some of the marketing stuff that we're doing, the new overlay of the national banking side of this, where as we go out to build a national banking franchise, we're on the checking account side, by definition going to be attracting people that probably aren't going to be highly focused on physical distribution on the branch on the corner. What we have I think, our opportunity on the banking side will be particularly on checking attractive to the lower, the younger demographic. But let me say there's a flipside to this, which is we're offering some, our marketing is also focusing on hey [ph], by the way Capital One has great opportunities in our savings products and unlike a lot of products out there where there's a teaser rate and then suddenly, now you see it, now you don't. We have very strong sustainably good rates and that is particularly attractive frankly to the older demographics. So I think we've got something for everyone hopefully here. And final thing I would say to is, a lot of our emphasis on that travel rewards a lot of the heavy spender focus we've had at Capital One just ends up being going where the real spending is, which tends to be older. Rich Shane : Okay, so if my hypothesis in part is right, that there is an element of this putting plastic in the walls of like younger demo with the idea that you can build a relationship overtime. And you're offering them low credit limits to that and as you've touched upon turning up the credit limit as a very easy and successful way to accelerate loan growth. What do you think the timeframe to do that is, is it a year or is it five years, when you look at the customer? And again put this in the context of inability to market to college students the way that you could a generation ago. Rich Fairbank : So I want to make a comment about, my comment about credit limits is no strategy change for Capital One it's nothing new that I'm saying about credit limits. We've had this strategy for 20 years in terms of every year we make a discrete decision about how much we're originating new accounts and a discrete decision about how much we're building the credit lines and how much exposure that we want to have. So I don't want anyone to go try to figure out the \u201cnew strategy of Capital One\u201d. It's really more to point out the higher than usual at this very moment, separation between growth metrics of purchase volume and the metrics we see on new account origination versus the loan growth which for the earlier question kind of doesn't look like it's keeping up with the other numbers or my words as we're talking here. I think that Capital One from its founding days has been very focused on creating long-term shareholder value. Everything is in the context of net present value. Everything good I've ever seen has paying first and gained second. In fact, I've learned to almost run from opportunities that I've gained first and paying second because I've learnt that, we as an industry can't control ourselves when that is the case. But from the really founding of the company which took a lot of years, the building of all the long-term data on credit performance from which we would understand how things, where we could extend loans and where we wouldn't, the move to transform the balance sheet of the company out of concern for capital market funding reliance and therefore the deep move in the banking, the digital transformation that we're many years into which I talked about earlier and another one is, the national banking strategy that we're talking about here. What we're focused on doing a building a franchise that will endure and generate tremendous shareholder value overtime and some of things we've been talking about today are just examples of that. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our final question this evening comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Okay, so just a couple of follow ups here. One, I just wanted to understand Scott when you mentioned that you might be holding onto to a little bit more capital in the event that you would buy the back book. Could you give us a sense as to whether or not that's going to impact 4Q share buybacks or not? And then Rich, I wanted to understand from you what is it about the digital offering that you have that Walmart was so interested in because you did mention about together really delivering a much more enhanced digital experience for Walmart customer? So wanted to understand what you're bringing to the table there and if this is something that could not only make more efficient this relationship but other part of label relationships that you have. Scott Blackley : Betsy, why don't I start there. I think we have ample earnings power and a starting capital position today, where we're going to be able to support our current $1.2 billion capital plan as well as start to accrete capital for the Walmart transaction should that be something that we end up negotiating a successful agreement to acquire. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. And then Rich on the question regarding the offering that you have on digital side with Walmart. Rich Fairbank : Yes, I'm reluctant to use the word offering. I think it's really more the capabilities and possibly really the similarity of the journeys between the two. Now I don't want to speak for Walmart, they really need to speak for themselves. I think their initial press release which talked quite a bit about the technology, thing would be a place to look. But I've really my conversation I don't want to speak for them although I'm very impressed by a number of things they're doing and all in their technology journey. I think for card partnerships for so long the card partnership industry has been especially when you talk about retailers because then there is airlines and other things too. If we just talk about retailers I think the car partnerships have a lot of the partnerships have been focused on how can we just get more cards in people's hands, how can we there are a lot of players who make quite a bit of money - retailers who make quite a bit of money on their card partnerships. There are retailers who make most of their money on their card partnerships and in some cases more than their entire retailing business. The digital revolution and the e-commerce revolution and the payments revolution has actually brought credit cards into a more central role in the future of how retailing is going to work because on the - for example in the store the card that is used is just the tail on the dog. In e-commerce sometimes it is the dog. The friction associated with how payments work, how people get customers credentials, into a relationship is a different thing. Then you also another aspect of the digital revolution is the tremendous opportunity to build deep customer relationships through data and of course that again, the credit card is right at the vortex of that hole journey. So it turns out it's really hard to bolt payments and data capabilities and transactional and customer experience capabilities onto an existing legacy retailer or an existing credit card company. To be able to break the friction and open up a much, a very large opportunity in digitally driven commerce, be it either in e-commerce or physical retail requires being well down a path of transformation and when both the retailer is and the credit card company, the ability to be able to create customer experiences together, is something that is really hard to, if one of those two partners is not on that journey and it just, I think in this particular case. I think and I'll speak for myself, Walmart can speak for themselves. I'm thinking I'm struck by the nature of the opportunities when two companies in very different industries are struck by the size of the opportunity and the transformation that's necessary to get there. Jeff Norris : Well thank you very much everybody for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your interest in Capital One. Remember Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Thanks and have a good night. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome, everybody to Capital One's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2018 results. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and click on Quarterly Earnings Release. Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion in the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly Reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC. And now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott? Scott Blackley : Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $2.48 per share in the fourth quarter. We had three adjusting items in the quarter, which are outlined on page 13 of tonight's slide deck. We had $284 million or $0.60 per share income tax benefit as a result of the resolution of the tax item, this was recorded in our other category. We had a $74 million or $0.12 per share net gains on the sale of exited business, this was also recorded in our other category and finally we had a build of $50 million or $0.11 per share related to the UK PPI Reserve. This was recorded in our Credit Card segment. Net of these adjusting items earnings were at $1.87 per share in the fourth quarter. Let me take a moment to walk you through this quarter's results. Linked quarter pre-provision earnings on a GAAP basis decreased 10% to $2.9 billion with revenues up 1% and non-interest expenses up 10%. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily driven by higher marketing. Operating expenses were up 1% linked quarter as the absence of $170 million legal reserve we booked in the third quarter was more than offset by normal seasonal spending and $110 million of expenses related to a contract renegotiation and UK PPI. The provision for credit losses was up 29% on a linked quarter basis primarily driven by seasonally higher charge offs and the impact of smaller allowance build after an allowance release last quarter. Across all of our business growth drove modest allowance builds in the quarter. Allowance movements across our businesses are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin decreased five basis points on a linked quarter basis and seven basis points year-over-year primarily driven by higher rates on interest bearing liabilities and balance sheet mix changes. As we've talked about for some time, we continue to believe that increasing deposit cost will be a headwind to our net interest margin going forward. Turning to Slide 5, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 11.2%. In the fourth quarter, we purchased 6.9 million common shares for $630 million which completes our 2018 CCAR authorization of $1.2 billion. We continue to view our capital need to be around 11% CET 1 based on current regulations. We believe we have sufficient capital on earnings power to support growth, our Walmart portfolio acquisition the phased in impact of adopting [indiscernible] on January 2020 as well as the potential for a meaningful capital distribution in the 2019 CCAR window. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich. Rich Fairbank : Thanks, Scott. Before turning to fourth quarter results I'll share a brief update on our Walmart partnership. Walmart is America's largest retailer and we have a shared vision of how a card partnership can be a central part of a winning retail and ecommerce strategy. Last quarter, we announced our agreement to be the exclusive issuer of Walmart co-branded and private label credit cards. Tonight we're announcing that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the existing portfolio of Walmart co-branded and private label credit card receivables at an attractive price and terms. At closing we expect the portfolio will consist of approximately $9 billion of receivables. And we expect to launch the new originations program and onboard the acquired portfolio late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2019. Since we first announced the new relationship with Walmart, we've consistently said, we'd be happy to acquire the existing portfolio but only at the right price and terms. The portfolio has high credit losses, but we expect that the purchase price and customized revenue and loss sharing agreements will achieve resilient and attractive economics that make this a compelling acquisitions. For the acquired portfolio our share of credit losses is fixed at a low percentage throughout the partnership. In contrast, our share of revenue steps up after one year, after the step up our share of revenue is about three times our share of credit losses. In our financial results, we will recognize only our net share of the revenues and credit losses. We expect the impact of on boarding the portfolio will be a modest benefit to the charge off rate of our domestic card business. The new originations program also has revenue and loss sharing terms. The revenue and loss sharing percentages on the new origination program are different than the percentages on the acquired portfolio reflecting the fact that we will drive the underwriting that generates the new originations. In 2019, we expect to incur about $225 million in one-time expenses to launch the new originations programs and integrate the acquired portfolio. These expenses include technology investments and one-time costs associated with hiring and training operational staff and managing the surge of activities related to the conversion and launch. We expect these costs to ramp up over the course of 2019 will break them out as they're incurred throughout the year. When we onboard the portfolio we expect to build allowance only for our net share of the expected credit losses under the terms of our agreement with Walmart. We currently estimate a day one allowance build of approximately $120 million. The actual allowance build will depend upon the loan balances, credit performance and outlook as of the closing date. Pulling up, we're eager to work with Walmart to leverage payments innovation, digital capabilities and data and analytics to deepen relationships, drive digital adoption and create exceptional customer experience. We expect that the overall Walmart partnership including the acquired portfolio and the new originations programs and inclusive of the launch and integration cost. We'll have returns and resilience in line with our domestic credit card business. Slide 8 summarizes fourth quarter results for our credit card business. Fourth quarter pre-tax income was down modestly from the prior year as higher non-interest expense was partially offset by revenue growth and lower provision for credit losses. Looking at the full year we posted strong growth in pre-tax income driven by revenue growth and significant improvement in provision for credit losses. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of domestic card business which is shown on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter domestic card ending loan balances were up $2.1 billion or about 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Average loans also grew about 2%, fourth quarter purchase volume increased 11% from the prior year quarter. Revenue increased 2% from the prior year quarter in line with average loans, revenue margin continues to be relatively stable at 16.0%. Non-interest expense was up about 18% compared to the prior year quarter driven by higher marketing. Our marketing investments are driving strong growth in new accounts and purchase volume. Loan growth is well below new account growth as we remain cautious on credit lines at this point in the cycle. We expect our strength and originations to give us optionality for future loan growth. Credit trends continue to be a driver of domestic card results in the fourth quarter. The charge off rate for the quarter was 4.64% down 44 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.04% up three basis points from the prior year. Credit performance is pretty benign but we should always keep in mind that we're fairly deep in the cycle. Pulling up the competitive market place remains intense but generally rational. Supply of credit card continues to settle out a bit. Against that backdrop our domestic card business continues to gain momentum, we're booking double-digit purchase volume growth, we're seeing traction in digital and product innovation and our investments in marketing are driving strong growth in new accounts. Slide 10 summarizes fourth quarter results for our consumer banking business which delivered 17% year-over-year increase in pre-tax income in the fourth quarter. Both ending loans and average loans decrease about 21% compared to the prior year quarter driven by the home loans portfolio sale earlier in the year. Ending loans in our auto business were up 4% year-over-year. Auto originations declined and loan growth decelerated as competitive intensity in auto increased. Ending deposits in the consumer bank were up 7% versus the prior year with a 41 basis points increase in average deposit interest rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Our strongest deposit growth is in Capital One 360 Money Market accounts powered by our national banking growth strategy. Rising interest rates, increasing competition and changing product mix have put upward pressure on deposit rates. Looking ahead, we expect further increases in average deposit interest rate as product mix shift continues. We expect increasing competition for deposits will also put upward pressure on deposit rates. Consumer banking revenue increased about 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. Growth in auto loans and retail deposits was partially offset by the revenue reduction from the home loans portfolio sale. Non-interest expense was flat compared to the prior year quarter. Provision for credit losses was down from the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of strong credit performance in our auto business. The auto charge offs rate improved compared to the prior year quarter and we had a modest allowance build that was smaller than the build in the fourth quarter of 2017. Better than expected auction values continue to support strong auto credit. Over the longer term, we continue to expect that the auto charge off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out. Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. In the fourth quarter pre-tax income was up 12% year-over-year. Fourth quarter ending loan balances were up 9% year-over-year that overstates the underlying growth rate as the timing of pay downs impacted the growth in ending loans. Recalled it last year, we experienced an unusually high level of pay downs just before the year end. The absence of this effect at the end of 2018 moves to the year-over-year growth rate calculation. Average loans are a better indicator of commercial bank growth trajectory. Growth in average loans was 4% year-over-year. Linked quarter growth was more modest with both ending loans and average loans up about 2%. Commercial bank ending deposits were down 13% from the prior year. Commercial deposit customers continue to rotate out of deposits and into higher yielding investments in the rising interest rate environment. Fourth quarter revenue was down 9% year-over-year primarily driven by the effect of the lower tax rate on tax equivalent yield. Non-interest expense was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. Provision for credit losses was significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by lower charge offs. The charge off rate for the quarter was 0.1%. The Commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 2.6%. The criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.4%. While the credit performance of our commercial banking business remains strong increasing competition from non-banks continues to drive less favorable lending terms in the marketplace. We're keeping a watchful eye on market conditions and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices. In the fourth quarter Capital One posted solid results as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation. For full year 2018, we delivered 41% growth in earnings per share net of adjustments. Our domestic card business continues to gain momentum. Growth in new account originations and purchase volumes is very strong. Profitability for the full year is at record levels and we reach an agreement to acquire the Walmart co-branded and private label card portfolio at an attractive price and terms. Our national banking strategy continues to gain traction. And our commercial business continues to deliver solid results. We continue to drive for operating efficiency as we transform our technology infrastructure and change the way we work. Full year operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments was 45.2% for 2018. From here we expect full year operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to improve modestly in 2019 excluding the one-time Walmart launch and integration expenses. While efficiency ratio can vary in any given year, over the long-term we believe we will be able to achieve continued gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains. Pulling up, we continue to build an enduringly great franchise with the scale, brand capabilities and infrastructure to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our industry and our society. Our digital and technology transformation is accelerating and it's powering our ability to grow new customer relationships and deepen engagement with new and existing customers. We are well positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value. And now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions. Jeff Norris Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Leanne, please start the Q& A Operator : [Operator Instructions] and our first question tonight comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Couple questions on Walmart. I was wondering Scott if you could talk about the impact to the Rev margin I heard your comments on the allowance and then, can you help us better understand $100 million allowance build on $9 billion of loans. Did you buy the loans below par and is there a mark that's unusually high percent? I understand there's also a sharing and that all makes sense. Just trying to drill down a little bit more on that. Scott Blackley : Yes, thanks Don. Let me just kind of walk through a couple of those questions. So first of all in terms of the allowance build I'll start there. The allowance build is really reflective of the loss share. I'm not going to give you any specifics about the price that we paid in those terms other than to tell you that, we would expect that in the portfolio acquisition accounting that we have to do, that we'll have a minimal amount of intangibles or premiums or discounts and that's going to translate to, no impact on future earnings there. When shifting to your other questions on revenue margin. You're right that because of the revenue sharing that we have and the fact that we're only going to record the portfolio of the revenue that is attributable to Capital One that will have an impact on revenue margin as we get closer to that transaction we'll give you more details about the impacts of both margin and on our loss rate. Don Fandetti : Okay and then just to follow-up Scott. It sounds like you're going to make some strategic hires around those portfolio. This is a pretty large transaction I mean do you have critical mass, like is there execution risk for such a large transaction and are you comfortable with that risk. Scott Blackley : Yes, Don we've been planning for that. We are a card company. This is right in the sweet spot of what we do, so this is really bringing on people into the organization to make sure that we're ready to both integrate the acquired portfolio and also launch the new partnership, so we'll work on that. It's a business that we know well, so while this is a significant undertaking for us to ramp up and get ready. I'm confident that we'll be able to manage that risk. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Just a couple of questions. The first is, some of the non-interest income lines looked a little bit different than maybe the consensus was expecting. Not so much interchanged but some of the fee lines, was there anything unusual in this quarter's that occurred in with respect to fee income? Scott Blackley : Yes just a couple of things. So in fee income one, part of the UK PPI is actually a reversal of income that runs through that service charge line item and so that was a component of the quarter-over-quarter decrease. The other components of that are really just a bunch of small individual puts and takes that all kind of went one direction and so I don't think, really are things that you should be concerned about impacting the run rate. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thank you. And then just on the auto credit performance and obviously Rich, I just heard your commentary about that. But with respect to the sequential change which showed a bit of deterioration in delinquencies and such, is there anything occurring there beyond the typical seasonal trend that we should be aware of? Rich Fairbank : No, we don't see anything that would be outside of the norm. I do want to point out, if you look back. You'll see that changes in delinquency rates in the auto business have not been that strongly correlated to changes in credit performance and delinquencies can change for a number of reasons not directly tied to a customer's ability to pay. Such as late fees, call intensities, other servicing strategies just a bunch of things that go on. I will point out though, that the - as we look at the auto industry the ratio of delinquency rates to charge offs has kind of risen overtime and it's just something that we should all keep an eye on and I don't think there is any unusual effect at Capital One, but as we - it's just something that we should all I think keep an eye on, along with things like auction prices which is probably at the top of our list of the factor that has been such a good guy for such a long period of time but of course at some point could go the other way. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ken Bruce : My first question, I'll start with marketing. You called out that you're going to increase spending significantly in the fourth quarter and you did. I guess when we look at the significant year-over-year investment could you maybe elaborate as to what you're expecting to get for that increase in marketing, is this purely accounts or would you expect the transaction volume to increase from where it is currently? Rich Fairbank : So in marketing, first of all let me just kind of pull way up, marketing rose a lot $327 million quarter-over-quarter which is higher than typical seasonal increases as we continue to see strong opportunities for card originations, we launched a new card product and we rolled out our National Bank marketing. So one thing let me just, let me turn to the bank because I know your question is a card one, but part of the marketing number is on the bank side, so let me just start there. Every bank needs to figure out how to fund their company as they grow many kind of if you pull way back to it via acquisitions, as you know ours is an organic strategy that capitalizes on our strength and we've heard for years kind of been taking our two banks that we have one direct bank and one local bank and basically building one integrated bank which is integration across technology, product, the customer experience. There is a lot that goes into that and we've sort of spent years doing it. So what's noteworthy about this year and a milestone for us is, that we reached the stage of sort of integration of these businesses that we're able to launch national marketing of our very digitally leaning bank and so that's and that's a strategy that we will continue at Capital One. It just happened to be launched in the latter part of this year. Now a significant part of the increase in marketing was on the card side and we on the card side, if you - think a little bit about spenders and revolvers, on the spender side and of course quite a bit of our marketing is directly oriented at heavy spenders. We have for years been building a heavy spend business that it's all about good products, the customer experience and brand and we have seen increasing traction in that business and the ability to originate very compelling accounts that have wonderful enduring, long-term low risk annuities. And so we see a lot of traction there and we capitalize on this window that we see with respect to that business and you can see the purchase volume growth, the interchanged growth and noteworthy. This is achieved at stable margin and in that part of that business all at the same time, we're having rising returns. So that is very much happening just as we speak. The sort of delayed gratification part of the conversation is more on the revolver side, where again how the economics of that business works it's really driven by balances. Balances are driven by the choice on credit line. We see a very good opportunity and great traction in terms of originating accounts, but we continue to be cautious at this part of the cycle with respect to the extension of credit line and so in that sense it is little bit more about building option value. But the thing I want to stress, the way to build long-term growth in a business like this is, you got to do with accounts one can't just endlessly give credit line increases to one's own customers and so this phase for us is very much on the revolver side about building accounts and we're storing up some value, some option value relative to loan growth as the opportunity presents itself. But the key thing is, the accounts don't wait for us, so we want to capitalize on that when we can, while it's not. I don't want to overstate the point, that in a sense the credit opportunity is something where we can more chose the timing and so pulling way up, as I kind I've been indicating in the last couple of quarters we see a very nice opportunity in the card business and we wanted to step in and capitalize on that. Ken Bruce : Okay well understand. Thanks for the detail on that. Just a clarifying point, in terms of the $9 billion that you're acquiring from Walmart and congratulations on getting that signed. Is that going to be the entire existing portfolio or is that - just run off somewhere where I think it was close to $10 billion last [indiscernible] reported on it, so are there current carve outs or is that the whole thing and you're just going to deal with the pricing and the loan loss sharing just in terms of dealing with the poor performers. Rich Fairbank : Yes, Ken that represents our estimate of the accounts that are still going to be in place when we get to the purchase date out at the end of Q3, early Q4 of next year and I would expect as we do a normal acquisitions that we would acquire current accounts as well as then delinquent accounts. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Can you hear me? Rich Fairbank : Yes. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions. Just one on the Walmart portfolio how do you think about managing that book from here and is there anything you can share with us with regard to expectations for growth or credit quality or cross sell if you could give us a sense as to what your plans are for that going forward? Thank you. Rich Fairbank : Betsy, I don't think we have any unique things to say about how we would grow that book. The key thing about a partnership like this is to have a successful program we're going to need attractive products that both organization work hard to market effectively, a great customer experience and really great underwriting and we have a spent a lot of time with Walmart sort of thinking about how we can leverage their amazing size, and scale, and leadership and access to customers along with our position as a technology leader within the financial services marketplace and our underwriting and some of the combined marketing skills that we both have. So but right now that's kind of more on the drawing board and we're excited about the opportunity but a lot of it will boil down to execution. Betsy Graseck : Okay and then just to follow up, it has to do with. Just expenses in run rate business. I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit around professional fees. It looked like that might have been up a little bit in the quarter and maybe you could give us some census to whether or not that's something that's likely to persist here or was there some unique activity in 4Q that drove that off. Rich Fairbank : Yes, Betsy. Let me walk through that so, if you look at total non-interest expense that was up, as I talked about my talking points on a year-over-year basis principally driven by marketing. If I exclude marketing and just get to operating expenses there we saw a pretty modest increase of about 1% year-over-year, on a linked quarter basis. The thing to remember is that, last quarter in Q3 we had $170 million legal build so if I backed that out of Q3 I had about $200 million increase in operating expenses. Now let me break out kind of how that happened. About $110 million as I mentioned in my talking points where one-time expenses that were related either to a contract renegotiation or UK PPI and then the remainder is normal seasonal ramp that we see this time of year as we do things like engage professional service providers to help us prepare for CCAR real personal example, but also to do other things in the business. That's kind of a normal season's pattern for us. So once you take out those one-time things, I think that gets you to what you would normally expect to see in Q4. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Just want to follow-up on the Walmart questions. I guess when we think about EPS growth next year, how should we think about one, obviously investments you have to make with Walmart, do we exclude those for the purposes of thinking of EPS growth and then secondly, is the marketing expense run rate given you guys had a pretty elevated run rate today and then, maybe also just on capital return. Scott you mentioned you guys can return a decent amount of capital I just want to understand the capital required for the portfolio acquisition. Thanks. Scott Blackley : Yes, why don't I start in terms of the capital and then I'll turn it back over to Rich. So on the capital the acquisition of the acquired portfolio is going to cost us roughly 30 basis points of capital and because we've already completed our CCAR authorization for 2018 over the next several quarters we're already 11.2% [ph] finishing 2018. For the next two quarters we don't have an opportunity to do any capital distributions beyond our normal dividend. So we're likely to accrete capital that puts us in an excellent position to fund that the acquisition of portfolio what the existing capital and then, be ready to adopt CECL at the end of the year, so that's a little bit of the capital trajectory and as I think about the opportunity for capital distribution as I mentioned we're starting at 11.2% [ph] we're going to be accreting. I think we've got their earnings capacity to absorb the organic growth that we see fund the Walmart transaction, get ready for CECL and still have the potential for a meaningful capital distribution. Sanjay Sakhrani : And then on the EPS growth. Scott Blackley : Rich, do you want to jump into the other questions? Rich Fairbank : Well, sorry so on marketing, was that a Walmart marketing question or overall? Sanjay Sakhrani : Overall. How we used to think about EPS growth, you guys obviously had a great year this year, but how should we think about forward. Rich Fairbank : So on the marketing side, we will - I think most importantly the levels of future marketing are going to be based on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace. The bank marketing I referred to that's going to be less opportunistic one quarter to the next, that's just more of the way that we're going to build our really fund the company and build our national banking business. But so we're going to continue to invest in marketing and brand but it will still be a call to see the opportunity in the marketplace when we get there. So I think we continue to be very bullish about the opportunity at Capital One in creating value this year was a very strong year of earnings growth, we're not giving specific EPS guidance next year, but I think we continue to be very bullish about the business and the opportunity that is growing and the - as we look down the road, the opportunity to overtime get the benefits to the Walmart portfolio where you can see that it's really in the third year from now, where we really get up to the full run rate of that, the benefits as we get there of getting to some very key milestones on the tech transformation side, so these are all things that you know align our future. And for well both of those specifically there are certain investments that are going on right now in pursuit of that, but I think the opportunity that we see down the road is very attractive particularly. Scott Blackley : And Sanjay just to come back to your questions on the one-time cost that we talked about Walmart. I certainly believe that those were costs that aren't indicative of the run rate of the business and the company's ability to deliver efficiency that's the reason that we've called those out and that will continue to isolate those for you next year. Jeff Norris : Next question please. And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Can you give us any sense as to the assumption for revenue growth and the target for an efficiency ratio that is kind of shows modest improvement I guess given the very, very significant amounts that you had in this second half of 2018 and how that would be reflective, if you had somewhat worse revenue performance and I do have a follow-up. Rich Fairbank : Moshe, we don't have a specific disclosure about revenue growth. I've kind of I think laid out some of the elements that are creating an opportunity particularly for revenue growth overtime obviously the stored value with respect to for to the very strong account originations right now and the stepwise good guy that's going to come from Walmart those are particularly two revenue pieces that are been in the delayed gratification category. Moshe Orenbuch : So it would generally be I guess it will be nice to see a little more matching of that, a little more matching of that spending with that, with the returns from that. But I guess to maybe from a philosophical standpoint when you think about the Walmart portfolio are their objectives and yours primarily to provide credit to those customers, is it a transaction vehicle for online spending? Is it a co-brand type of arrangement? Like how do you think about the way you're going to be executing on that program in terms of the front book and the new accounts you're soliciting. Rich Fairbank : Moshe that's a very good question. Right now the Walmart portfolio is one that is pretty revolver oriented. It's got high credit losses and I think that we and Walmart have aspiration to build a pretty different business. In the first word, I would put out there is the word digital. So to have this partnership be right at the vortex of the growth opportunity that Walmart is putting at the top of their entire strategic priority transforming themselves not only technologically but particularly to be a really big player, in the online retailing space and the partnership is certainly, we have that at the top of the list on this. So technology is going to be incredibly important driving digital activation and activity and there's I think quite a bit of market aspiration and if you look actually at Walmart's customer base there is a lot of that market - people there and a lot of opportunity. Now the key is to turn that opportunity into real digital buying power and that's what Walmart is focused on and I think we're going to be there to help on that, along in the way credit is also a very important thing obviously and I think that our experience from the very top pretty much across the credit spectrum I think is one thing that was in appeal on the Walmart side for having us as a partner, but that will be very critical part of that as well, but it is certainly our hope to pivot the sort of center of gravity of this partnership and expand the opportunity and move it more up market. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research Group. Chris Brendler : Another question in the card business, but not about Walmart. I understand there's a lot of good signs and then results of this evening with the strong purchase volume growth and making sense your optimism about the account growth, but I thought we're going to see a little better loan growth as we head into fourth quarter and [indiscernible] stuck at 2% doesn't feel like a Capital One type number because given although you're reporting to marketing what feels to be a good spot competitively, it can be outside perspective. So how do you feel about loan growth and maybe just your conservatism online granting at this point, as you're holding that back and also does the fact the CARD Act made it difficult to change rates on the fly sort of limiting your ability to extend balance growth at the point. Thanks. Rich Fairbank : Chris, sorry. What was your CARD Act question one more time? Chris Brendler : Just the fact that you can't change rates, [indiscernible] delinquents the protection we had last recession where you could raise rates across the board and maybe that's sort of limiting your ability to get a little more aggressive online granting just given we're around the cycle. Rich Fairbank : Let me go back to start with Moshe's very hard felt [indiscernible]. It would be nice to see more matching of spending and return way. Isn't that the, that would be my wish for this business and in fact over the years the matching has become even more not align as with FAS 166/167 the mass of allowance builds, growth mass a lot of things in this business get pretty disaligned now a lot of it is inherent in the actual mechanics of how accounting and the business works. This particular alignment we're talking about here is, now some of it is inherent in the sense that whenever one spends a lot of money on marketing to generate accounts, accounts don't make any money. So the only things that bring instant revenue are going to create that alignment and things like big balance transfers. It's really basically things that bring a lot of balances in, that's what creates that alignment. One of things we've done overtime it's funny I haven't dusted off this phrase for a couple of years now, but you will remember Chris for years we were saying, we were running down high balance revolvers and we've continued to, now we're more in equilibrium with respect to that, but there are a lot of things that in the good times make a lot of money and I put high balance revolvers at the top, number one on that list. The issue is the resilience of that particular segment. So we just ask because of who we are at Capital One we've focused tremendously on resilience and we over the years have really driven down the proportion of our book that's high balance revolvers, now the - and to the specific issue today it's a pretty much $0.01 answer as to why the account growth and the loan growth are not connected and that is our choice on credit line. And while the CARD Act makes probably the stakes, not probably the CARD Act makes the stakes even higher to make sure that one's underwriting decisions are right the first time. We believe, we spend a lot of our energy looking at the competitive marketplace, looking at the credit cycle and then trying to make our choices accordingly and a lot of times we zig, while others zag and it's not an accident, it's actually a causal relationship because a lot of where opportunity lies and where risk exists is the flipside of what competitors are doing. So on this particular case and I really want to stress, we're capitalizing on the opportunities the marketplace presents and the success that we're seeing in our individual programs in the card business, to lean into that and capitalize on the growth opportunity. While our credit numbers are great and you can see the same numbers that we see, we're deep into the credit cycle and nobody knows when this thing is going to turn, but we believe that the prudent thing to do is have our foot on the gas of account originations and our foot a little bit on the break with respect to credit line extension. But it just turns out that method of driving if you will creates a really asymmetrical timing in numbers and cause a bunch of people to scratch their heads and wonder what we're doing, all I can say is that's probably a manifestation of the way we think and way we have thought over all these years. This particular disconnect of break and accelerator is among the highest examples of that, that I can remember in our history. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rich Shane with JP Morgan. Rich Shane : I just want to circle back on marketing. It was running for the first three quarters of the year up 11% or 12%. Fourth quarter it was up 80% year-over-year. I'm just curios if you can help us with some sort of guidance and what the cadence should be through 2019 and just as my follow-up, how quickly do you dial this up and dial this back? Rich Fairbank : So there's three different things that were going on that all came together in this particular quarter. There are really four things that came together in this kind of record quarter of marketing, one is seasonality that is seasonally very high anyway and we should always keep that in mind. We've talked about the national banking that's more of - that's not going to be an episodic line of scrimmage thing that's more of just, what we're going to do to build the business. On the card side, we also had in the fourth quarter the launch of one of our products. [Technical difficulty]. Jeff Norris : Is the call still active? Operator : Yes, you're still live. Jeff Norris : So we need the next question please. Operator : And we'll move to our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : I had a two part one. First do you guys have a sense for Walmart's commitment to promoting the new Walmart Capital One store card both on its website and in its stores and then secondly, do you think Walmart's commitment to promoting the new credit card is necessary to prevent the pool of applicants from skewing to a higher risk level. The reason I asked is because we've heard that Walmart's philosophy going back to towning has been not to promote credit to its customers and the result over the years was that, those who applied for credit with Walmart tended to be riskier credit seeking customers and I just want to hear your thoughts on those two questions? Rich Fairbank : Bill, I think you're going to mostly have to find that answer and let me Walmart speak for themselves on that. Let me say though I want to absolutely echo one of the comments that you made. Their commitment is absolutely necessary for this deal to be successful and it was an important consideration for us, as we entertained doing this partnership. So I think we've been impressed with Walmart's intent relative to this thing. This is going to be all about execution and I think third parties are committed to making this thing be very successful. Bill Carcache : Appreciate that. Thanks for the comments Rich. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Just looking Q3 to Q4 the yield on the loan book was pretty flat, it had various components of liabilities also modest increase in cost. Number one, is there anything seasonal to think about there. And number two, given those trends and your comments on kind of pressures on deposit costs, what do we think about NIM over the near term next one, two, three quarters. Scott Blackley : Thanks for the question, John. On net interest margin let me just kind of walk through some things that I think you might want to think about, so one just to remind you that NIM does tend to very seasonally and you'll see that quarter-to-quarter factors like seasonality and day count can make NIM up and down across each of those quarters. Looking forward we do think that, we've talked about deposits cost is being one aspect that could up, pressure on NIM and be a headwind. There's always puts and takes though in net interest margin, balance sheet mix is always a factor depending on the pace of growth of the different asset classes that can actually be a tailwind for NIM. And I would say just in terms of rates as we've told folks for a while now we are fairly neutral to implied forwards. So I don't expect that there is much risk that would benefit for us in terms of where rates can go from here and then finally I would just say like most banks a steeper yield curve would be favorable for the net interest margin, that fit gives you a little bit of the sense of where I could see that going. Jeff Norris : Next question please. I'm sorry John, did you had a follow-up? John Hecht : I was going to ask, is there anything specific to call out in Q4? You did mention some seasonal factors but was there anything in Q4 specifically? Scott Blackley : No. John Hecht : Got it. Thanks very much. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Regarding the loss share on new originations. I know you mentioned different terms than the loss share that you agreed upon on the back book. How should we think about the assumed loss experience on new originations and how that should impact your what shows up on your, hits your P&L? Could that loss ratio come in above 4.5% level where you're operating at legacy Capital One or and could it near the 10% back book for legacy Walmart? Thanks. Scott Blackley : So, well first of all we we're hopeful of being able to generate a book overall with credit losses that are in a different place than where the current book is. But because of the loss share whatever that loss number is, our loss number that we will experience will be fair amount lower than that because of the loss share so I think the overall front book and back book the overall Walmart portfolio is going to be very likely to be a positive contributor. I mean to the charge off of the company. John Pancari : Okay and then separately the loss share and revenue share terms, does that, does that last for the life of the acquired loans and as well as the duration of new originations. Scott Blackley : Yes these loss sharing percentages are for the life of this deal. We have one set of percentages for the back book and the only little wrinkle there is, the revenue share goes up to its destination in the second year and remains there for the life of the agreement, the loss share is throughout the same, is where it is for the whole partnership. On the front book, right out of the blocks we'll have a specific loss share and a specific revenue share that remained for the entirety of the partnership.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome everybody to Capital One's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our first quarter 2019 results. Scott Blackley : Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned 1.4 billion or $2.86 per share in the first quarter. Net of adjusting items earnings per share were $2.90. The only adjusting items we had in the quarter was 25 million of launch in integration costs associated with our Walmart partnership. Slide 13 outlines the financial impacts of this adjusting item. Pre-provision GAAP earnings increased 18% on a linked quarter basis and 2% year-over-year to 3.4 billion. Revenue of 7.1 billion was 1% higher than Q4 '18 and 3% higher than a year ago. Relative to the prior quarter non-interest expense was down 11%, largely from a lack of Q4 seasonal spending. Compared to the prior year, non-interest expense was higher by 3% driven by increased marketing spend as operating expenses remained flat. Provision for credit losses increased 3% on a linked quarter basis driven by an allowance build in the quarter. Charge-offs were relatively flat as there were a modestly offsetting seasonal changes in our auto and domestic card businesses. On a year-over-year, basis provision cost were higher by 1%, driven by a larger allowance build in the quarter, partially offset by lower charge-offs in our domestic card business. Let me take a moment to explain the quarterly movements in allowance across our businesses, which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Reserves in our commercial business increased by 55 million, driven by the establishment of reserves related to a few specific credits and loan growth. Our credit cards business saw an allowance increase of 25 million, driven by a build in international card, partially offset by a small release in domestic card. In our consumer business, there was a build of 14 million driven by growth and portfolio mix in our auto business. Richard Fairbank : Thank you, Scott, and good evening. Slide 8 summarizes first quarter results for our credit card business. First quarter pretax income was up 7% from the prior year, as the positive impact of revenue growth and lower provision for credit losses were partially offset by higher non-interest expense. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business, which is shown on Slide 9. In the first quarter, domestic card ending loan balances were up $2.5 billion or about 3% compared to the first quarter of last year. Average loans grew about 2%. Revenue increased 4% from the first quarter of 2018, driven by purchase volume growth and loan growth. Revenue margin increased 21 basis points to 16.15% for the quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 6% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating expenses increased as we began to ramp up operational capabilities for a smooth Walmart conversion and launch later this year. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts that may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Leanne, let's start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Rich, just to follow up on the marketing commentary, you, in last quarter you signaled that you are focusing on acquiring accounts but keeping lines low in anticipation of maybe some potential change in the credit environment, but would give you the flexibility to increase lines at a future date. Is that still the strategy? Or is there any change to that approach? Richard Fairbank : Eric, we are being cautious online. Let me tell you about how that works. It means that we want to see more validation before extending more line. And in fact, with every passing month, we are seeing increasing validation in the performance of recent vintages, and this augurs well for more line extensions over time. Eric Wasserstrom : Great, and maybe just to follow up on that. We've seen some information of data that points to some weakening in credit in kind of mid-FICO modestly better than median income cohorts. Are you seeing anything like that? Or just more broadly, are you seeing any particular subpopulations where there is evidence of deteriorating asset quality? Richard Fairbank : Eric, a thing that we noticed and we've seen this, we're kind of on the lookout for it but we have now with the benefit of hindsight seen some degradation of performance of consumers for a given FICO growth. This isn't a Capital One thing in fact it isn't even an industry origination thing. This is really a, we can see that all the way just sort of looking at bureau data. And the reason that we sort of hypothesized this is, well, let me say our hypothesis for this modest effect, but I think it is important to note is that given the how long derogatory data stays on the credit bureaus, the derogatory data from the great recession has over the last few years been rolling off. And so, our hypothesis has been and one of the reasons for our own conservatism has been, we may be looking at data that are might do not paying for full picture of a consumers sort of credit history. So, we've been on the lookout for that. We have seen the effect certain by FICO score. Different people did have a different hypothesis for the effects. Now, in terms of what we do we, we built comprehensive credit models that are far beyond sort of just a snapshot of bureau score. And so I think we feel very good about our credit the recent vintages the performance of fact, my comments earlier about validation with respect to our performance, making us more comfortable with some line increases values, indicative of that same point. But they are part of the context for our caution has been not only sort of how deeply are in the FICO, but also this is a time period when they of less information than there once was on the bureau and we all need to be careful consumers of that information as we make our credit decisions. Operator : And will take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Appreciate the color on the cloud migration and the cost reductions from closing the data centers. I guess two questions on that. One, Rich, can you just talk about what competitive advantage it gives you from moving to the cloud and sort of the functionality there? And then secondly, on the 42% in 2021, is it fair to assume that there could be an expansion that's more greater than normal in the future because you have got leverage off that maybe Scott could you address that? Richard Fairbank : So, we've talked for years about the benefits of going to the cloud and I think there are many benefits, and ironically the costs are not really at the top of the list. Our, what we hypothesis and we are finding is that, things are faster. The scalability is much greater the kind of it takes to provision. A hardware and software environment is much faster. The ability to scale up and down basically on demand, the ability to tap in to the world's innovation that, that is going on in that segment and also benefit in security and reliability. And along the way there economic benefits as well. So, it's a pretty compelling case. The bigger issue and the issue that all American corporations faced is not G on paper is, are there a lot of benefits from going to cloud? The big question is how on earth are we going to get there from here? And that requires confronting really for most companies, decades and decades of you know heritage in terms of who they are, the talent, the infrastructure, the way the Company works, culture and you know it is -- the big issue is the journey. And therefore, the big news for Capital One is that we're announcing that, we have line of sight to the completion of that journey. That's not the completion of our entire tech transformation in the sense. We will probably always be in a tech transformation because the world is in one, but it's a very important milestone for Capital One to arrive at this destination, but it's really a story of journey. And that is you know, that's what American companies are really going to have to confront each of them in their own way as they decide what they want to be when they grow up from a technology point of view. With respect to 42% just explain your question again when you said will that expand. Sanjay Sakhrani : Yes, I guess, is there more leverage ability off that 42% because you are moving to the cloud and you're not as physical data center intensive. Richard Fairbank : No, I think the very full year run rate benefit of getting out of the straddle and being fully on the cloud are reflected in the 42 number. I think from there we have always said, basically, the more we transform comprehensively into a digital company, the more benefits that can accrue over time in terms of the economics of the business. With respect to the, I think the number reflects the full benefit of getting out of the data centers and being in one environment and not two. I think the longer journey of Capital One is going to continue to be one where we drive, continue to drive our customers to digital and drive our company to digital and the many benefits that I cited one of which is economics you know should continue to manifest themselves. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Scott, you'd mentioned that the targeted capital return would be meaningfully higher in 2019. Can you elaborate a little bit on that in terms of your priorities, buybacks, dividends, and if you can maybe sort of better quantify where that payout ratio target might go? Scott Blackley : Yes, Don, thanks for the question. We're closing out Q1 at around 11.9% the easy one. So, we're in a position where we're above our 11% capital need and I would expect that we're' going to accrete more capital in Q2, because as you may recall, we've already completed our 2018 CCAR share repurchase program. So, you know, I would -- we're not going to be in a position of distributing more capital before we get fed approval on our 2019 plan. I'm not going to comment on CCAR at this point. I just don\u2019t want to get ahead of the fed release, so I'm not going to give you any more details about that. I'll just say in general and I'm going to reiterate some of the points. I made in my talking points, but we are in a really good position. I believe to fund organic growth to fund the Walmart acquisition. We got the first phase of CECL coming in 2020, which were going to need to support new capital. And then taking all those things and looking at the earnings power that we have and our capital position today, I feel pretty good that we're going to be able to have a distribution, a capital distribution that is quite higher than what we had last year in our CCAR plan. Don Fandetti : Lastly, it looks like the delinquency rate on a year-over-year basis, domestic cards is sort of creeping up a little bit each month. Can you talk a little about your expectations going forward? Scott Blackley : Yes, so, Don, our -- let me start with our credit losses. Our losses are still improving on a year-over-year basis, while as you point out our delinquencies were about 4% higher than the year-ago quarter. There are some idiosyncratic drivers of that increase. For example, we change loss recognition timing for the Cabela's portfolio to align with Capital One practices back in October of 2018. This had only a slight effect to our overall credit metrics but it impacts the year-over-year delinquency comparison by a few percentage points, interestingly. First quarter may also have some effects from government shutdowns, including delays to some tax refund payments, which contribute to the seasonal movements in our credit metrics this time of year. So, I wouldn't read too much into delinquencies in this slightly noisy quarter. Pulling up our unique growth math dynamics have been the dominant driver of our credit performance for some time. First, driving our credit losses up and then down and growth math continues to be a good guy. Of course, our credit is also impacted by the economy. The competitive cycle our growth choices and other industry effects. So, we would expect a little normalization in terms of overall current industry performance overtime. So, going forward, we will have a couple of offsetting drivers of current credit, growth math that will continue to be a good guy and industry normalization that will likely fall in the other direction. Operator : And will take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Rich, on the 42% efficiency target, I mean, clearly that has two sides to the equation in terms of expenses and revenues. So, can you maybe size for us how big the cost component of that is, just given the fact that the revenue environment could end up being different better or worse relative to what you're expecting and as of today? And then I guess, secondly, given that marketing historically somewhere between 600 and 800 basis points of efficiency. Is it safe to say that we'll be looking at an efficiency ratio below 50% over time? Richard Fairbank : So, Ryan, we don't. What we try to do in doing this 42, I mean, we can always create point estimates. The one thing we know about point estimates in our business, and by the way our investors have all experienced this. Point estimates, that only think you know is they're not going to be exactly bad with respect to a particular metric like revenue. So what we did is go through a metric of outcomes of different revenue thinking through, you know what, how the costs associated with different revenue outcomes. And you know, sort of the way we think of it is, if you if you take away the what I'm calling good guys that are coming in 2021, our story really is, and this was kind of in our guidance, our general guidance we've been giving over the last couple of years. That the combination of revenue growth and continuing to drive on the cost of digital productivity gain general side, that will drive gradual improvement in operating efficiency. So, the other primary point we're making here is on top of what we think is a gradual improvement that will come from all the things that we do on the revenue and cost side. We're pointing out a few specific good guys that happen to align themselves around the full year 2021. And those good guys are of course the exit of our data centers by the end of 2020, which should drive significant savings beginning in 2021. Some technology innovation that will enable some specific, some efficiency gains, and then the benefits from the Walmart partnership, now that also line lines up around 2021 because of the revenue sharing structure that we, in our deal with Walmart and as you recall, the revenue sharing is less over the first year of the deal. And then it steps up to the full revenue share thereafter, so there's kind of a coincidence of where several things sort of align themselves around 2021. So, if I pull way up to your question, well, you know, we don't know -- we will see where the revenue and all the metrics you know that drives operating efficiency where they go over time. I just think a lot of planets align and a lot of things that are we sometimes use the word baking in the oven, things that are really in the works, where we are able to do something it's a little out of character for Capital One to give such a specific number several years out in the future. But that would be the context behind that, Ryan. Jeff Norris : Next question. Richard Fairbank : Oh, he asked the question on the marketing side. So, I'm not -- we're not giving a specific number with respect to total efficiency ratio and that is because marketing of course is very driven by the contact that we find ourselves in overtime and the opportunity to really generate great business when we get there. And that's not a thing that were going to guide ourselves to several years out in the future, but I think our other point was that the significant it's a bit the operating efficiency improvements to 42, we expect that this improvement will drive significant improvement in total efficiency ratio by 2021 as well. Operator : And will take our next question from Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Chris Brendler : So, I just had a question on card business, really nice acceleration with non-net interest income this quarter up to 13%, if anything you call out there. And then related, it looks like subprime mix on the card business ticked up at tiny bit, not make a big deal out of it. Just want to know if it's more macros or is there a decision on the underwriting side? Scott Blackley : Yes, Chris, this is Scott. A couple of things there, so one on interchange, Rich, mentioned that we had an adjustment to our rewards liability. That was about $51 million and so just some context there. Every quarter, we update our estimates of the cost of honoring our card rewards. And that estimate always considers changes in consumer redemption patterns and then any updates that happen in terms of terms and conditions. So, we usually see some level adjustment here every quarter or sometimes it's an increase, sometimes it's a decrease. This quarter was $51 million, the least. Chris Brendler : And then on the service fee side, there, is it coming down quite a bit still? Is that conscious decision? Scott Blackley : On the service fees, a few things there, on a year-over-year basis, a couple things; one, there were a few small ticket one-time or benefits in Q1 '18. And then on an ongoing basis, we have exited a number of the subscale businesses that impact that line item as well. So you know, I think that most of that is in the Q1 2018 number, but not in the 2019 number. So, I would say that the 353 million of service charge and fee income for Q1 is a pretty clean quarter. Richard Fairbank : Chris, with respect to subprime mix, our subprime asset mix of 34% is flat year-over-year and sort of in line with our historical portfolio mix of around one third, plus or minus. It is up lightly quarter over quarter in line with seasonal trends and all these numbers there's always rounding so these are integers. So, I think the takeaway that you really should have is there's not a lot of news with respect to the subprime mix. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Rick Shane : Rich, I think impulsively when you're talking about account growth. You're bifurcating between heavy spenders and traditional revolvers. Our assumption is that for the heavy spenders that you'd have to be pretty competitive in terms of line limit. Is that the right way to be thinking about it? And if that's the case when you look at the traditional revolvers do you think that most of the accounts that you have added do have the potential to grow the line limits over time. Richard Fairbank : Yes. So, I'm glad you asked that question because there on many dimensions the heavy spender side of the business is so different from the revolver side of the business, but certainly one of them is credit line. So, let me start with heavy spenders. We, our lines are very competitive, very comparable to the leading players at the top of the market on the spender side. So, there's not a low line strategy with respect to heavy spenders. On the revolver side, we have always been very conservative probably relative to industry practices with respect to our credit line and you know, looking for more validation over time. I think we raised the bar with respect to validation recently and that's why we've been talking more caution on credit lines. Now let me talk now about the surge of growth that we've had along, that come complements to the surge of marketing that we have had. This is growth that is across the credit spectrum. It's actually, more up market shifted than usual, and that's kind of to my point earlier, we're especially getting traction at the top of the market. And the way that you know all of those accounts will play out is very consistent with how spender business you know is booked. It's expensive to book, it's a great annuity, it grows over time, etc. The, still because of the you know the whole portfolio of what we're booking, there's lots of revolver business in there and it's all, pretty much all business that we are looking to build lines with. And as we are getting the validation, that's what we are doing. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Two questions just starting off, one the cloud. I've heard that the cloud can help deliver much more efficient marketing programs and drive much better efficiency in the marketing itself. So, I'm just wondering, if you are experience in that as well and is that something that we could either expect to drive better revenue for marketing dollar invested with use of this tool what potentially, even we talked a little bit earlier about driving down the budget, but that's a TBD kind of question. So I am just wondering, if you're seeing that same kind of marketing efficiency improvement that other are? Richard Fairbank : So, when you say marketing efficiency improvements that others are, I think there are a lot of folks not leveraging the cloud at the moment and maybe they're enjoying marketing efficiency improvements too. I think there is a lot of things going on in the world of marketing and there is quite an impact that's coming from the major tech companies, who are driving a lot of the digital marketing channels and the choices they made to in the walled garden of their information, how much they either provide turnkey services for other banks or for other companies or provide data to facilitate companies on choice. But I think the whole world is getting more and more efficient with respect to digital marketing. Here is one of that, but I mentioned earlier that it is kind of easy to write down on a piece of paper for what you've love to do with technology and the whole problem is how do you get there from here, and marketing is a classic example. We know the world is exploding in terms of data, big data and the ability to leverage more and more information to not only make better decisions, but to make them more customized on a micro really down to this segment of one. The elephant in the room is, how you mobilize massive big data in real-time, and I think for most American companies it's given enough time they can do a lot with data. The challenge of when big data meets real-time that's where modern technology really separates itself from classical technology. So marketing is on the list of one of the many things that we -- are driving improvements and look forward to driving more improvements with overtime, but I don't want to set an expectation that you'll as we fully go in the cloud, you will suddenly see a huge improvement in our marketing efficiency because frankly with most of the marketing that we're doing -- we're basically in the cloud with respect to the marketing that were doing, so that's a journey that has been ongoing and we look forward to more progress. Betsy Graseck : Okay, and then just separately on Walmart, where you talked about products that you'll be launching when that comes over on the consumer side. I'm wondering, is there anything are you working with or planning on doing with them on the business side in B2B or the supplier side of their business model? or is it going to be solely on consumer? Just help us understand if there's, how broad that relationship could be? Richard Fairbank : Betsy, at this point our relationship with Walmart is consumer credit card. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : And regards to some of the marketing spend that happened, ramped up quite a bit in the fourth quarter, would have expected a little bit better you know growth metrics here in the first quarter versus what we've seen last year. Could you just talk about what your expectation is for growth, and I believe some of your comments about some of the up market customers that you're starting to traction with, as we move through the next couple of quarters? Richard Fairbank : So, Kevin, the one thing that I've said for probably those who have been following Capital One for many, many, many years, I've said all along, changes in marketing levels don't expect them to in coincident periods or even in immediately adjacent periods show dramatic effect on, especially on metrics like loans. So let me just talk a little bit about what's happening with respect to Capital One. So, the reason that we have -- we don't spend money in marketing just to spend it, one of the comments that I made in the earlier remarks is. You can't buy your way to you know lots of growth just by spending money and especially at the top of the marketplace with spenders. This is all about earning it and for years we have been putting in place, we've been very committed to building a spender business and investing in the customer experience, the digital experience, the products and the brand to be in a position where along all of those dimensions we're seeing tremendous progress. And what sort of has happened in recent quarters is the alignment of a lot of progress on this with our spender business and traction with customers and our brand with non customers, combined with an actual opportunity that we see in the marketplace. So, on the spender side of the business, you see a lot of our marketing is directed at the spender side of the business and we've had really tremendous traction there as I mentioned, and how that shows up is in significant growth of new accounts and those accounts are annuities that have great economics over time and the spenders ramp their purchases really literally for years. It doesn't move the loan growth needle a lot just by the basic numbers and how many heavy spenders there are and the fact that that -- it's a basically it's a numbers things. So the loan growth is dominated by what happens on the revolver side of the business. And let me comment about that other than the capability, which always exists for any bank to do line increases and I would often called that a coiled spring and it's a great opportunity for companies to take advantage of it when they want if that's that the ultimate way to really drive growth is through new account origination. That's the prerequisite for loan and revenue growth on the revolver side. As these customers mature, we gradually increase credit lines which translate into loan and revenue growth, and we -- my point has been that we've had really strong account growth. We are getting with every passing month more validation on the credit performance of advantages and all of this puts us in a position to capitalize on the to turn the account growth into loan growth and revenue growth overtime. Operator : And will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Rich, I was struck by the commentary about deposits cost growth and growth of online deposits and maybe if you could talk a little bit about the strategy there because getting more online deposits with higher cost including margins, isn\u2019t really in that itself a strategy. What's the plan there? How does that benefit the Company and shareholders? Richard Fairbank : The first order for any company is or for any bank is, they need to fund the Company. And of course that, well, like there is a lot of different ways to fund the Company. Capital One is in that I love the position that Capital One is in where are our strongest and biggest funding sources on the consumer side, because that's where I think through recessions and if you look at how the fed rate various types of deposit. If you look at the opportunity to have resilient funding and pricing overtime at the top of my list is consumer deposit. So building a -- we already are a national bank in our asset businesses, and we were a local bank in our funding businesses, and then we acquired our national direct bank. So building out a national bank is fundamentally a central to the success of Capital One. Now the way most banks overtime, I think envisioned how they are going to grow their deposit businesses and they do it through acquisition. That's not -- acquisitions of other banks. While we have that bank acquisitions in the past and they've been an important part of the strategic and funding migration of our company from a model line specialty finance company. Our future is going to be driven by organic growth of this national bank, and that's different from what most you know players have done. Now one way to grow deposits is to get on the lead tables and have the highest price and that certainly you know, there's nothing wrong with doing that. Over time what we're trying to do Moshe in a world where there all of banking is centered around one of two poles either people have a branch on every corner with quite low rate deposits or they have a direct bank and are paying you know at the high-end for deposits and our goal is not only to build a national bank but to work backwards from where retail banking is going to go, which I believe is towards thin physical distribution and great digital capabilities and you know attractive products for consumers. So we're basically trying to figure out know where the market is going to go and just go build that. How will that manifest itself for Capital One and for our financials? Again, very importantly, the funding of the Company but over time increasingly building our company as a franchise, much of it through cross sell through our own very large customer base and to not face the hotter money that's available out there. But in fact really build long-term relationships and end up as really a the one bank that is really a hybrid of the direct bank on one side and the branch in every corner bank on the other side. And we've seen a lot of traction early on with this. But what we're flagging to investors is, there are a number of reasons that we expect our deposit cost to go up. In the competition most banks are saying that anyway, but in our particular case, the, you know, the mixed effects of this journey and the sort of natural things that happened on the way to building this hybrid bank will be accompanied by higher average deposit costs. Moshe Orenbuch : And what are the products that you think you'd be able to sell the banks, you know the online bank customers? Richard Fairbank : Basically, Moshe, we between what is available, so first of all let's talk about capabilities for a second. One of the great challenges for a bank is while here. Most of the world is concluded in I find people that are not close to banking, of course, assuming well of course banks are to be digital, they'll probably be entirely digital. I've come to really respect the importance of them and power of some physical presence. But to challenge that any bank that does have a branch on every corner needs to confront, if you're going to build a deposit franchise is how to -- it is having a full suite of banking capabilities, that you can actually pull-off online or on your phone as opposed to having some of them. And so, we have taken the whole set of activities that can be done in banking, and the vast majority of virtually all of have been hand sloped by the importance, we have put these online and many of them but not all of them on mobile because we don't want to clutter mobile like a NASCAR uniform with every possible banking feature. But on little cat feet overtime, we have really built out a full banking capability that you don't need to have the local physical distribution now we're going to have some physical distribution and we are just locating that physical distribution in iconic locations. So, it has particular region salience, but with this strategy, we hope to capture some of the best of both worlds from the world of direct banking and of local banking. But what is just taken in the years that we've taken prior to rolling out our national bank has been of course taking the various tech platforms from the banks that we bought, putting them all together and putting their capability on the cloud and integrated and on the cloud building a -- and now building out a broad-based banking capabilities digitally, building a great and now J.D. Power award-winning for two years in a row banking capability, online banking capability, and importantly also Moshe a credible consistency in our retail banking experience locally. The other thing that we have done is been on the leading end of our branch rationalization, which is very important to the overall economics of this has been physical presence model. Operator : And our final question tonight comes from Chris Donet with Sandler O' Neil. Chris Donet : Just wanted to follow up on the that data center migration and think about the journey you've been on starting six years ago and then taking another couple years to get the end. I'm just curious, if you whatever, you had to do it over again. Do you think you could have shortened with that path? Because it seems to me this might be a competitive advantage that anyone else out there is going to have to keep, it's a decade process roughly. Just want to know what you're thoughts, if you could have done it in less time or if that's just how long it takes to redo to like which you talked earlier about the systems and personnel and infrastructure? Richard Fairbank : Chris, so, we're -- one thing I said is that, well, I denominated our journey in two -- I denominated it in two ways. One is the recent journey which is the six years. We completed six years. We're in our seventh for this technology transformation. Importantly, it stands on the shoulders of Capital One itself and the heritage of what we've built with the talent model, the whole information-based strategy, the data, the analytics, the technology, that went into the whole founding of the Company and sort of who we are. So what is striking and I appreciate your question is that. On those shoulders, this journey we're already six years in and we're looking ahead to getting, you know, out of our data centers two years you know essentially eight years after beginning the tech transformation at Capital One, which is a bit of an advantaged starting place. I think there are lots of things we learned along the way, but I think if we did it over the journey is really, would be the same because it's a journey that is, it's a talent journey, it's a transforming how software is built. It's a journey that requires confronting the way that we work and this would be true for any American company that takes this on. Confronting, how the Company works, how people work both on the tech side and you know and across the Company. We have, you know, to take on the entangled infrastructure that exists at large banks, including our own, is a very, very daunting task and to you know set out to rebuild that not from the top of the tech stack but really from the bottom. That is a tough undertaking and it is. I don't think the path could be much shorter than what we've done. But that's why I say the real news isn't the destination, the news is the journey. And we know we have been all in on this journey and we're in year seven now. And by the way, the last thing I would say is, well, we wouldn't change too much. The one thing that we absolutely would choose to do, is to do this, because we are absolutely compelled by the opportunity here. And we can feel the accelerating progress on just about every dimension, if you were inside this company, you could feel acceleration on what's happening with the customer experience. What's happening in risk management, what's happening with the dynamism of the Company, the speed to market the products, how customers are feeling about Capital One, the pace of digital adoption by our customers. The momentum around transforming how sort of the operations work, the success in partnerships, I think are tech transformation was central to winning the Walmart deal. And our momentum in the sense of possibility in building a national bank, and finally, the economic, the acceleration of sort of economic opportunities that we have talked about on this call. A - Jeff Norris : Thanks everyone for joining us on this conference call today. Thank you for your interest in Capital One. Remember, Investor Relations teams would be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great night. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome everybody to Capital One's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2019 results. Scott Blackley : Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with slide three. Capital One earned $1.6 billion or $3.24 per share in the second quarter. Net of adjusting items earnings per share were $3.37. Adjusting items in the quarter included $54 million of launch and integration costs associated with our Walmart partnership, and $28 million of restructuring charges associated with the exit of certain investing businesses.  Slide 13 of our earnings presentation outlines the financial impact of these costs. In addition to these adjusting items, we sold several small partnership portfolios in the quarter, totaling approximately $1 billion of outstandings, which resulted in a pre-tax impact of $128 million or $0.21 per share, and included a gain on sale of $49 million and an allowance release of $68 million. This collection of partnerships generated about $160 million in annual revenue. Relative to a year ago, adjusted pre-provision earnings declined 1% with revenue growing 4% offset by non-interest expense growing 9%, which was driven by higher marketing expense in the absence of a non-recurring adjustment to a vendor agreement this time last year. Provision for credit losses increased 5% driven by a modest increase in charge-offs, coupled with a smaller allowance release in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Let me take a moment to discuss the quarterly movements in our allowance for each of our businesses, which are detailed in table eight of the earnings supplement. Richard Fairbank : Thank you, Scott. Slide eight summarizes second quarter results for our credit card business. Pre-tax income was relatively flat compared to the second quarter of 2018. Year-over-year, growth in loans and purchase volume drove higher revenue, which was offset by higher non-interest expense. Credit Card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business, which is shown on slide nine. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. Remember as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. And if you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be here and available after the call. Leanne, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you.  And we will take our first question fromSanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. First question is on the interest rate environment and the broader market expectations of rate cuts. Scott, could you just talk about how we should think about the NIM trajectory in that backdrop. I know Rich spoke to the pressure from higher deposit funding costs. But just how you guys expect to manage through that? Scott Blackley : Thanks, Sanjay. So as a reminder, I think we have said this many times that we really don't seek to bet on interest rate movements and we try to maintain a pretty neutral rate position relative to implied forwards. So from here I would say that a flatter or inverted yield curve is going to be a modest headwind to our NIM, on flip side of that a steeper yield curve is going to be a modest tailwind. As you know, the yield curve flattened in Q2 and long-term swap rates are now down to around 2% and at that level of long-term rates. The flatter yield curve has created probably a few basis points of headwind to NIM in our full year 2019 net interest margin. So that's a little bit of where I see the interest rates impacting us. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And then my follow-up question on that partnership loss, was it a matter of misalignment between yourselves and the partner or is it sort of a reflection of a more heightened competitive environment? And maybe Rich, you can just speak to the broader competitive environment while you are at it? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : So I don\u2019t think there is any big significance to read into this. What I would say is with our digital transformation and where we are going in our card business, we are focusing more on partners that are industry leaders and scale players and we continue to be very excited about the card partnership business. And of course with Walmart coming on, we have a lot of momentum. We are continuing to build capabilities that differentiate Capital One from other players at auction, so that we can build a growingly valuable partnership business both for ourselves and for the partners who team with us to build their franchise. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Good evening. Rich, could you talk a little bit about the auto business. Looks like the yields moved up and I know some of the peers that have been reporting recently that are big players in auto lending are talking about rates on new originations being higher than the current portfolio and having arguably some pricing power. Can you talk a bit about that? Richard Fairbank : I don't think we're struck by any significant movement in pricing power. I think we're at a pretty good place competitively in the marketplace. As you've watched our business and the conversation we have on all of these calls where we\u2019ll really see a bigger opportunity and there will be pretty sizable growth in originations, then the competition comes in either in magnitude and or in some of their practices and we kind of pull back a little bit. I think we're in a fairly balanced place right now, I'm not struck by a change in the margin opportunity, but if you -- but just sort of the feel of the marketplace, I think there is a -- there is some growth opportunity. And I think the other thing that we're struck by in Capital One's case at least is the strength of the some of the credit results that we have been seeing. And we're pleased by that. Don Fandetti : Okay. And just real quick follow-up, the Fed looks like they're going to cut rates do you think that'll have any impact on the card business from a focus on revolver versus transactors. I know that when rates moved up, you did see some change in behavior. Scott Blackley : I don't think -- are you talking about a change in behavior in our customers, or in terms of the focus that we have in our\u2026 Don Fandetti : Yes, just a change in the focus on revolvers versus transactors. I know when rates moved up there was a little bit of a shift over to revolvers. I didn't know if you thought there would any change from that perspective. Scott Blackley : Yeah. Over the whole range of interest rates that we've -- the range of interest rates we've had for the last significant number of years, I don't think it's led to real pivots by us relative to transactors or revolvers. I think we are very -- as you know, we're leaning into the opportunity at the high end of the marketplace where we're getting a lot of momentum with the franchise that we're building and these are long-term stable, very low attrition, very valuable annuities and we're capitalizing on that opportunity. And sometimes in our conversations, we talk more about that. But meanwhile on little cat feed, if you will, we continue to just keep plowing ahead very consistently on the revolver side of the business. And frankly, the growth of -- the continued really strong performance in new originations is not only a top of the market phenomenon, and we continue to have strength across our -- across the transactor and revolver side of the business and this gives rise to growth opportunities as we -- on the revolver side as we grow the -- as customers grow their balances and as we extend higher lines over time. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Rick Shane : Guys, thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Hey, Rich, you spoke about the traction in the spender market. I am curious, given the strength in labor and wage growth and frankly low gas prices, how you feel about the middle income consumer? And is that an opportunity that perhaps you should have leaned into a little bit harder over the last year? And will you -- is that something -- is it appropriate to lean in now? Richard Fairbank : Yes, I think that our -- we've had a very consistent strategy for an extended period for a long time relative to the revolver part of the marketplace, which is, one where in this extended recovery is one that I think continues to post strong credit results. We, if I pull up about, what we -- how things have varied in the last few years. So, we had a significant growth surge in 2014 through 2016. And we all watch a lot of the metrics that Capital One changed significantly. We saw that -- we saw signs of - some signs of concern in the industry vintage curves, gapping out a bit in 2016. And our own results were consistent with what we saw in the industry. We pulled back on originations and certainly launched a more conservative approach toward credit lines.  Since then, Rick, we have seen -- we\u2019re very pleased with the vintage results that we have seen in 2017, what it looks like 2018. So, there is certainly a strength there that that we note, and it is that that is leading us to open up a little bit more gradually on the credit line side, which is a contributor to the gradually increasing loan growth. But along the way, we have continued to really go for the opportunity in growing new accounts. It's been the sort of the -- our lever of -- the lever that we have dialed is how significantly to open the credit lines, and how quickly to move them. The actual origination machine has stayed at a sort of wide open over that period of time, and we're getting particularly strong results in the last 12 months in that. Rick Shane : Got it. Yes look, I understand hindsight. 2020 and it's easy for my seat to say that and objectively we thought the growth surge that you guys experienced in 2014 and 2015 was a big catalyst. It is interesting to sort of think about it moving forward as well. Richard Fairbank : Yes, the other thing Rick is there, I think if you stand back and look on an absolute like-for-like normalized basis, while 2016 had -- we saw the most impact across the industry in terms of things gaping out. On an actual like-for-like basis originations keep normalizing a little bit and exact on a like-for-like basis, the credit losses are a little bit higher. Now capital we are very pleased with our vintage, the vintages of our originations and the choices we made on line increases. With part of that strength comes from the dialing back around the edges that we've had. And the other thing I want to say is that it's not lost on us. We just -- we, America just broke the record for the longest sustained recovery. We are deep into the cycle. And so our biggest focus is on underwriting for resilience. And -- but in the meantime, we're really pleased with the strength of the originations and we continue to unleash some of that in terms of loan growth on the credit line side. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. I just wanted to circle back on the provision explanation for a moment, if I could. I was just looking at the past several quarters worth of the credit loss and provision coverage history. And the losses have gone up at a very moderate pace, a few basis points over the past five, six quarter. But looks like the coverage has come in a bit with this release in this period and just hoping you could give us a little more color on what drove that change in forward expectation in light of that very moderate decline in asset quality over the same timeframe? Scott Blackley : Well, a couple of things. So in my comments, I mentioned that we've seen very stable credit performance and then an economy that just has continued to really roll forward and it's just a combination of those things honestly as you know in our portfolio, given its size, small moves there can generate $100 million release. So you think about the release in card a good portion of that was related to the sale of the several of the small partnerships that we talked about and the remainder was just driven by the ongoing strength of credit and the economy. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And if I can just follow-up on that point, does that imply some sort of -- I mean, the ongoing strength. I guess I'm trying to understand whether that ongoing strength implies to you that you think credit losses will improve from here or just continue at this sustained pace of small incremental deterioration. Richard Fairbank : So our viewpoint that is that credit performance that we see is basically flattish and there are number of kind of small effects, offsetting effects, different things that are idiosyncratic about the drivers that make variation off of flat, but on a seasonally adjusted basis things look pretty flattish for us. As we look at other metrics like delinquency flow rates they look strong, they look stable. We of course do have some continued benefits from growth in that being a good guy quietly in the background and I think overlaid on top of all of that that\u2019s probably underlying a little bit of normalization in the current business. And I think in our case there kind of these moderate effects are offsetting pretty much to a draw. So I think things are pretty stable and of course we always have to remind ourselves where we are in the cycle. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And we will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. I was wondering you mentioned I think for the first time you talked about the growth rate of your branded card portfolio at 4.7% and what had that thing growing at an you alluded to the process that you\u2019ve talked about a few times in terms of kind of seasoning the accounts a little longer before increasing their credit line and maybe if you could, just talk a little more about because we\u2019re kind of approaching about a year since you started adding those accounts. And so is it reasonable to assume that that 4.7% would be accelerating from here? Scott Blackley : So we pointed out the branded metric because partly there has been some things that have been modestly affecting the metrics in the other direction on the partnership side and also of course a lot of the marketing we\u2019re spending, the franchise we\u2019re building that directly is in service of the branded card business that we\u2019re building. So you can see -- well basically while we are not giving historical metrics on those things that that branded card metric is also picking up and it is the primary area that is getting the benefit of the significant surge on account originations. So I think with every passing quarter we\u2019re opening up a little bit more on the credit lines, and hopefully we\u2019ll continue to have strong account originations. And the combination of those two can be a good guy for the growth in our branded card business. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Could you -- I mean, was that number 100 basis points lower if you went back six months? Scott Blackley : Yes, I don't -- we're not going to give the retro numbers, but it has tended to be stronger than the one minus is the branded card in recent periods. And it is growing nicely. Richard Fairbank : Yes, Moshe, I believe, last quarter week gave the metric on the call at just a little over four. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it, okay. Thanks. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Good evening, guys. Rich, the industry was able to significantly lag on the way up on deposit pricing, but you've had a lot of banks building out all sorts of digital deposit taking capability. So outside of the negative mix shift that Scott talked about, what are your thoughts on banks like Capital One and the industry's ability to reduce deposit pricing on the way down? And I have a follow-up question. Richard Fairbank : I think it is a great question. I'm not going to often I\u2019ll stick my neck out and make predictions. I think here there's certainly an industrial logic for it. We've seen a few of the direct players, three of the big kind of nine direct players have made a move downward, which is noteworthy. And I think the choices that are made by each company is going to be very much dependent on their particular situation, what is their need for deposit growth and what other kinds of pressures are they facing. But I certainly -- I've always thought it's ironic that people talk about deposit betas as if beta is the number that's the same size on the way up and the way down and a lot of people model things with a number called the deposit beta, but the first thing most intuitively is the betas have to be different on the way up and the way down. And they're going to probably be different for direct players than they will be for regular players. But I'm heartened Ryan by some of the dynamic moves that we're seeing in the marketplace. But I'm not ready to predict that players will have much movement downward, I think it's going to be harder for -- well certainly the biggest banks don't have anywhere to go because they really didn't chase the rates up regional banks maybe are kind of in between relative to the direct banks and the big banks. But we'll have to monitor this closely. And your question is a good one. Ryan Nash : If I could ask just one follow-up, so the stock is trading just above 1.15 times tangible book value for a company that's putting up a high-teens return on equity. What do you think the market is missing about the resilience of the business model or the efficiency opportunity, from the digital transformation over the next couple of years? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Well, thank you, Ryan. I think that Capital One is in a very great place in terms of the opportunities that we see, headline by the digital opportunity. And it is very clear inside our company and you're starting to see some manifestations externally that our tech progress is accelerating and the benefits, which extend across a lot of different aspects of the business from speed to market to product quality, customer experience, risk management, operational effectiveness, growth, efficiency, there's a lot of different aspects of it and it's not all going to manifest itself in a big bang, but we feel we can see traction accelerating in many places. Now, how that translates into valuation, is very much probably related to also how investors feel about a consumer stock and a consumer lending stock at this time in the cycle as well. So, with respect to that side of the business, Ryan, we -- the number one thing that drives our underwriting is not reaching for growth opportunities. It's a focus on resilience. And I think this served us very well on the last recession we underwrite as if a recession is upon us. And, I, very much like the resilience of the business that we're booking but I think investors still carry concerns about that. And I think that affects valuation. But if you see a bounce in my step, if you see some -- here the energy in the sort of spit flying passion with which I described this thing. I've been building this company for -- this is the 25th anniversary this year of our IPO in 1994. And I must say that the period we're in reminds me in many ways of the early days of Capital One with the just some really nice opportunities to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and to make a real impact on customers and build a franchise. And how that makes its way into valuation is one thing well I'll have to look at. But the thing that we focus, most importantly is on getting it to make its way into the metrics of earnings and growth and returns themselves. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kevin St. Pierre with KSP Research. Kevin St. Pierre: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Rich, I believe you had mentioned that the majority of the deposit growth was coming through the Capital One 360 products. Some of the other large banks have incorporated mobile and digital slides into their presentations where they give us statistics on mobile users and transaction. I was wondering, if there are some successes, some numbers that you could share with us, both on the mobile front and the Capital One cafes, and even some numbers behind the Capital One 360 products? Richard Fairbank : Kevin, we -- there's a lot of traction in all the metrics that you mentioned, we haven't -- I think for a certain competitive reasons have not chosen necessarily to lay all of that out. But directionally the growth in mobile users. The metrics, I've seen at Capital One at the top of the league tables in terms of growth rate of mobile users and dangerously close to the top of the league table in terms of total mobile users, which growth rate and magnitude if they're both at the top that augurs pretty well.  So on the 360 side, of course, there's -- what's sort of unique about Capital One is that we really have sort of two different banks. We're a combination of a local bank and a direct bank. And we've built overtime a strategy that's more of instead of running around with two businesses, it's more of a fusion of the two. That said, our metrics continue to be sort of a blend of the performance of the two. But what we're really excited about is the power that comes from building a single phase and a single brand and a single franchise that tries to combine the best of what local banking has, but -- and the best of what a more pure digital bank would have. And we are very pleased with the early results. And we continue to be bullish about the opportunity there. Kevin St. Pierre: Just following up on that, and maybe also following up on Ryan's question and commentary. I think, if you are at the top of the league tables in terms of mobile users mobile growth, and you could potentially show us that, I'd respectfully say that that might solve a little bit of the valuation issue if you can show that you are slugging it out with the big boys punching above your weight on the mobile digital front, I think that could only help.  Just a quick follow-up, maybe if you could speak to the preparations for on-boarding, Walmart, both in terms of servicing -- preparing for servicing the customers, as well as any changes you're planning to the structure of the product. Richard Fairbank : So, we remain excited and on track, with respect to the launch of the Walmart partnership, and the conversion of the back book, both of which are slated for late third quarter, early fourth quarter. We are working closely with both Walmart and synchrony in this complex conversion, both are being good partners in this conversion. With respect to products and marketing plans, we're going to -- we have nothing to announce on that. But as you can imagine, we're working very hard. And we look forward to our launch date. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Two questions, one a little more of a modeling question. But I just wanted to confirm the portfolios that you sold was that at the end of the quarter? I'm just wondering and I think Scott, you mentioned $160 million of annual revenues associated with the portfolio. And is that in -- is that out of the 2Q run rate, or do we start that from 3Q and maybe you could give us a sense of the expense ratio we should align with that? Scott Blackley : Yes, that was at the end of the quarter. So that run rate is going to start in Q3. And in terms of efficiency, I don't expect that it's going to have any meaningful impact to the overall efficiency ratio. Betsy Graseck : Okay, so same efficiency, okay. And then just wanted to hear what your thoughts were with regard to some of the new competitors that are going to be coming in, I mean we've got Goldman and Apple that are planning on launching a car in the next couple of months. And they've been very vocal about looking to go with a low cost to the consumer solution, no fee and low interest rate. I mean, we'll see what those rates look like when it gets launched, because clearly it's a marketing pitch right now, we don't have any data to back that up. But that's the plan. So Rich, I was just wondering how you think about that type of new entrant coming in? And, if there was anybody other than Apple, maybe -- or I don't know, maybe it doesn't matter that it's Apple, but just wondering how you think about that? And you mentioned earlier, how you're really underwriting as if a recession is upon us at all points, which makes a lot of sense, and it serves you well, I'm just wondering, do you think that there's any challenge or risk that that could get up ended in a new competitor coming into the market like this? Richard Fairbank : Yes, Betsy, it certainly gets our attention when pretty much anything that -- let me start with Apple, anything that Apple does, gets our attention, because they and the other big four consumer tech companies are whether they say it or not are certainly focused on the -- by the way, they don't want to become banks. They are plenty happy, I think to led banks be banks, they're interested in really controlling the front end of banking, which is really the customer interface, the customer experience, that's where the eyeballs are, that's where the interaction is, that's where the data is. And that's where -- that's the less regulated side of the business as well. So that certainly, as a general point, always has our attention. And I think the tech companies bring a lot of natural assets to the table and they're certainly have good technology. It also gets their attention and players like Goldman Sachs, build a consumer business. Because I think Goldman's a great company and they starting from scratch building a consumer business. I think have done a nice job with what they've done. So I think I don't have any predictions to make about this, I think, it's nicely put together with nice marketing. And, I would expect Apple and Goldman to be successful with what they're doing.  As far as we're concerned, we continue to go all in transforming our company from a tech point of view. And that puts us in a position to have great digital customer experience. And I'm very bullish about our opportunity, even as others step up their offerings and their competition. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jeffries. John Hecht : Afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Can you guys spoke about being somewhat neutral from a rate environment perspective in terms of the NIM. But then you did highlight that your deposits might reflect a headwind for the remainder of the year. I wonder, can you give us, I guess, some color around what type of NIM pressure that might reflect and the cadence of that? Scott Blackley : Yes, John, we've been signaling that deposit mix and at least during the period where we were seeing rates rise, even some of the deposit rates were putting some pressure on NIM. As you can look at our kind of the movement of our NIM quarter over quarter over quarter for a while, you can see that it's been drifting down just a little bit each quarter. And so that's a little -- just to give you a sense of the trajectory there. I think that, these aren't really significant headwinds, but it's just a pretty much a consistent few basis points every single quarter that we're seeing as pressure. John Hecht : Okay. And then, just to -- I guess a follow up, tied to that is, how do we think of -- you had a pretty big growth in deposits during the quarter? How do we think about the overall deposit strategy? What's kind of the maximum in terms of the composition of deposits you'd want for liabilities? And how much mix do we -- should we expect in the 360 product? Scott Blackley : When you think about deposits, we have a relatively high ratio of loan to deposits. So we would love to be able to continue to grow our deposit base. We tried to make sure that we have access to all of the wholesale funding channels that we can. We also take advantage of commercial deposits where they are appropriate for our liquidity profile. So, when it comes to just where we hope to be on our direct bank deposits and our local bank deposits, and we think that's an opportunity for us to continue to grow. We think we're really well positioned with the products and the digital tools that we have out there in the market. And so, I would expect that we'll be able to continue to see growth in that area of funding of the bank. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And our final question this evening comes from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Good evening. On the -- on your operating efficiency ratio expectation to reach 42% by 2021. I know that excludes marketing spend, can you talk about over that period how you think about the trajectory of marketing spend just given the competitive dynamics in the business? Or I guess another way to ask it, you expect that improvement to 42% to improve the total efficiency ratio for the company. Maybe can you give us an idea the magnitude of improvement in the total ratio that you expect? Scott Blackley : Yeah, John. The reason that we gave our long term guidance on operating efficiency ratio and not total -- I mean, we did give one on total efficiency ratio, but it was less specific than the operating efficiency ratio is because the operating efficiency ratio is there are a lot of dynamics happening in our business. And in our quest to keep driving down operating efficiency ratios that these effects are, colloquially put baking in the oven. And, what's happening with Walmart and the move to the full revenue share at the end of 2020, for example, that there's an economic change that happens. And also, that's when we're going to be fully kind of in ramping on the front book of Walmart as well. Then we've got the data center exit, and the timing of that continues to be relatively certain. And we can see the economics that, by the way, don't just happen automatically the economic benefits, but with tremendous efforts to make sure that they happen, we can see that baking in the oven. And there is some other technology innovation, that is in the works that collectively happened to line up around that time period. And given that we have been spending a bunch of money on technology, our investors have had a lot of questions about technology, and one of the many benefits of the tech transformation is the opportunity to really significantly improve operating efficiency. We shingled ourselves to that. The marketing is not something that we would lay out our shingle about what it's going to be wanting two and three years from now, that's very much going to be based on what we see in the market at that time. And the opportunities we have to build a franchise, how much traction that we are having in the upper end of the marketplace where a lot of the marketing is directly focused. And -- but we also didn't want to just exclude that from the conversation because obviously to investors in the end, total efficiency is the thing that drives the bottom line. And that's why even with the kind of range of outcomes that can have on the marketing side, our point was that we think total efficiency ratio can significantly improve by 2021. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thank you. Scott Blackley :  Thank you. Jeff Norris : Well, thank you everyone for joining us on our conference call today and thank you for your interest in Capital One. Remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great night. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome everybody to Capital One\u2019s 100th quarterly earnings call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the internet, please log on to Capital One\u2019s website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our third quarter 2019 results. Scott Blackley : Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll begin tonight with slide three. Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $2.69 per share in the third quarter. Net of adjusting items, our EPS in the quarter was $3.32. We had three adjusting items in the quarter, which are outlined on slide 13 of our earnings presentation. There was $212 million or $0.45 per share build in our UK Payment Protection Insurance customer refund reserve in our Credit Card segment, driven by higher-than-expected complaints volume. About $140 of this build was recognized as contra revenue, split across evenly between net and noninterest income, and $72 million was recognized in operating expenses. The UK regulators previously established a deadline to file PPI complaints, which was August 29, 2019. We received a significantly elevated volume of complaints in the months leading up to the complaint deadline. We are now in the process of determining the eligibility and compensation related to the total complaints. Next, we had $84 million or $0.14 per share of launch and related integration costs associated with our Walmart partnership in our Domestic Card segment. We continue to expect approximately $225 million of cumulative launch costs with the residual occurring in the fourth quarter. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Scott. I\u2019ll begin on slide eight, which summarizes third quarter results for our credit card business. Pretax income for the quarter was $969 million, including the $212 million UK PPI reserve build that\u2019s Scott discussed. Beyond the PPI impact, Credit Card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our Domestic Card business, which is shown on slide nine. Domestic Card ending loan balances increased by $3.1 billion, or about 3%, compared to the third quarter of last year. Average loans were also up 3%. The growth of Branded Card loans, which exclude private label and co-Branded Cards, continued to accelerate. In the third quarter, Branded Card loans grew 5.7% from the prior year quarter. We posted another quarter of strong purchase volume growth as we continue to grow our heavy spender franchise. Year-over-year, Domestic Card purchase volume growth was 11%. Normalized for two additional processing days in the third quarter of 2019, year-over-year purchase volume growth was about 9%. Net interchange revenue for the total Company grew 11%. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourselves to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Leanne, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you.  And our first question today will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Scott, I was hoping to get a little bit more clarity on the NIM expectations going forward. I heard you said you were sort of rate neutral as rates are going down. But, then, you\u2019ve got like the move to 360 and then Walmart. So, as we think through future rate cuts and obviously these moving factors, could you just give us some dimensions on how to think about the NIM migration? And then, I\u2019ll ask my second one upfront. Rich, I know Scott talked about this at a conference, but I just wanted to get your perspective on the cyber security incident. I know there\u2019s been some questions on the cloud migration as a result of it. And I was just wondering if you could just give us your updated views? Thanks. Scott Blackley : All right, Sanjay. Well, I\u2019ll start off on NIM. So, as I think about where NIM might be headed, I got a few thoughts for you. The first is that we\u2019ve seen deposit rates and mix that have been creating the headwind -- those have been creating the headwind to NIM, since really late last year. Now, those deposits are a great source of stable funding for the Bank, and we\u2019re really happy to have them. More recently though, we\u2019ve been seeing some easing in NIM headwinds from rates and even a bit on mix. So, on the liability side, while we\u2019ve seen some headwinds, starting to see some signs that those are abating a little bit. And then, on the asset side, Walmart is modestly positive to NIM. Card and auto are growing at attractive rates. And so, on the asset side, we\u2019re certainly seeing some momentum on that end. And then, when you talk about just rates in general, as you mentioned, we have a modest near-term exposure to movements in implied forwards. So, in the near-term, I think that rates aren\u2019t going to be a big driver. So, when I pull up and I look at all the different forces that are impacting NIM from both directions, it doesn\u2019t look to me that any of them are particularly outsized compared to the others. Richard Fairbank : Sanjay, with respect to the public cloud, and then the cyber incident, while the event occurred in the cloud, the vulnerability that led to our breach is not specific to the cloud, and could have happened in on-premises data center environment. We remain absolutely committed to our digital strategy and our technology transformation, and the public cloud is an essential element of that strategy. I mean, the benefits of the cloud are pretty comprehensive, including agility, innovation, resiliency, security and cost benefits. And in fact, we believe our tech transformation and our move to the cloud in particular, provided some important benefits in this cyber situation. For example, as part of the cloud journey, we were able to tokenize critical data at scale. Also, the cloud was essential to our being able to quickly diagnose and respond to the incident. So, naturally as -- with an event like this, we\u2019re pouring a lot of energy into make sure we get all the learnings and harnessing the energy from an experience like that to really further strengthen cybersecurity and our capabilities broadly across the board. But, we are reminded even through this event of the benefits and power of the public cloud. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : So, I guess, Scott, I was sort of hoping you could expand a little bit on the deposit pressures that you saw abating on the Consumer Bank, I think they were still kind of going up in the third quarter, albeit, I guess, at lower rate than in Q2. But, like, what areas you\u2019re seeing and what might we see in the balance of the year and into early 2020? Scott Blackley : Moshe, well, we\u2019ve seen -- when I look at the competitive landscape, we\u2019ve seen a number of competitors who\u2019ve been lowering rates, we\u2019ve had some of our products with lowering rates. And so, we\u2019re starting to see deposits being more responsive to rates going down. And with that we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a reduction to the headwinds that we have been experiencing on NIM. Moshe Orenbuch : Got you. Just as a follow-up, Rich, you highlighted the acceleration on the credit card balance front. Maybe just kind of give us a little more color there. Obviously the consumer -- this has still kind of continued to grow, but how are you seeing that in terms of balancing growth and risk? Richard Fairbank : Yes. So, in our Branded Card business, we separated that out just because that number was quite a bit different from the overall kind of Domestic Card number, but it\u2019s a reflection of the continued traction that we\u2019re getting across the board. And I think, it\u2019s -- the continuing success we\u2019re having in marketing, the traction we\u2019re having at the top of the marketplace in our spender business, but also we continue to have traction really across the board. That traction is coming from continued strong origination of accounts but also continuing to lean in a little bit more each quarter on the credit line just as we continue to validate by looking in the -- at the performance of recent vintages and continue with an eye on the economy. All of that is contributing to some acceleration on the Branded Card growth. With respect to the consumer, how do we feel about that? I think, the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer is in pretty good shape. Consumers are obviously benefiting from strong labor market, rising wages, and last year\u2019s tax cuts, all of which are driving up disposable incomes. The savings rate is solid, the rate of borrowing is reasonable, debt servicing burdens are stable and well below the levels that we saw before the great recession. Retail sales growth is down a bit from a year ago but still solid. When we look inside our portfolio, we see that delinquencies and charge-off rates are low, payment rates are -- continue to sort of gradually rise. And that is sort of the flip side of or another manifestation of credit strength and the confidence and strength of the consumer. One metric we watch as a leading indicator is the proportion of customers who are paying only the minimum payment on their cards and over the past year, that metric has been stable to slightly improving. Now, of course, the consumer is a resident in our broader economy and not only the U.S. but the world economy, and implications of things like growing government deficit, trade related issues, and the intense political environment are something we certainly keep an eye on. There is also pockets within lending that we are watching, such as installment loans. Installment loans are growing at 15%, and some lenders are not reporting to the credit bureaus. So, I\u2019m not sure that we actually know the size of that number, but we know it\u2019s pretty bank, and that can have -- we\u2019re not in the installment loan business, but we can be affected by those things, so. And most importantly, it\u2019s not loss on us, we\u2019re deep into the economic cycle, and we underwrite with the focus on resilience. And if you pull way up what that means is, while still being very obsessive about those, about the risks out there, we continue to see an opportunity to grow our business, we see stability in the consumer and on the credit side, and that augurs well for continued opportunity in card. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the outlook comments that you gave you around the back book Walmart portfolio and wanted to understand how you are thinking about the K rate of $8.1 billion, over how many years we should expect that to take? And then, the second thing was, I know you gave a lot of color on the NCS delinquencies and the revenue margin. How do you see that trajecting in that 13, 14 months because you have difference set up, right, economically with Walmart than the first 12 to 13 months and month 13 on, maybe you could go through your broader outlook as well. Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Okay. So, Betsy, the Walmart -- all of our guidance about how the metrics were going to be affected is, I want to stress, as you indicated, it\u2019s about the portfolio that we bought from Walmart. We of course also are originating business with Walmart, but that\u2019s much more of a kind of business as usual thing, and the impact on the metrics will be much more in the business as usual category. This portfolio stands out for a number of reasons. I mean, it\u2019s all at one moment; it arrives on our balance sheet. So, we want to deflate what happens with the metrics. This is also a portfolio with a significant loss share as well as a revenue share, and it has some pretty striking impacts on some of the metrics that we outlined. It is a portfolio that historically has had a -- the runoff rate, the attrition rate starts with the pretty high charge-off rate that we talk about in that. And then, of course there is natural attrition as well. So, we are inheriting a portfolio that runs off reasonably quickly, if you isolate it from new originations, which we are here with this guidance. The one thing that makes it kind of hard to predict how fast the attrition will go is that this value proposition, including 5% on walmart.com, 2% off on everything bought in the store, this is a significant improvement in the value proposition relative to what the customers had before. And we are giving that to all existing customers of this portfolio. So, hopefully that will help on the nutrition side. We don\u2019t have any data on that. But, what we wanted to stress is that the impact on our metrics will happen all at once, like we talked about. And then, we should we should all assume a run-off, a gradual run-off of that driven especially by the fairly high charge-off rate. The only other event of note is the step-up in the revenue share that happens with respect to this portfolio starting in October of 2020. So, that\u2019s a single event, and we will be the beneficiary of a higher revenue share, same loss year, but a higher revenue share and that will continue over the life of the portfolio. That\u2019s why we gave our guidance in a series of steps. The only other thing that I wanted to just savor, the delinquency -- I know everybody looks with -- understandably with a magnifying glass at delinquency and credit -- and charge-off numbers, and it\u2019s really important to us that we were able to talk about the differential impacts that come from that back book. The charge-off numbers will be net charge-off numbers because we are reporting only the charge-offs for our loss share portion of the total charge-offs. The delinquencies, we -- this on our balance sheet, so, we have the entire -- the delinquencies, we will report in their entirety, even though an important portion of the losses will be taken by Walmart. So, that\u2019s why particularly on the delinquency side, there will be some striking impacts that we wanted to flag. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Just one quick clarification and then I have a real question. Just on the PPI, given the August deadline has now passed, is this the end of the builder or could this -- could you see incremental building into the fourth quarter? Scott Blackley : So, as I outlined in my prepared remarks, the deadline was, as you mentioned, August 29, 2019, and we\u2019ve now passed that PPI deadline. So, we now know the total volume of complaints that we can receive. What we\u2019re doing right now is going through all those complaints and trying to determine which of them are valid complaints and what the appropriate level of compensation is on those complaints. That process, given the elevated level of claims that we incurred, is going to take around six months to complete. The reserve that we built on in this quarter, we included an estimate of how many of those claims we thought would be valid and the portion of compensation that we would have to pay. We did that based on kind of our history of what we\u2019ve seen. It stands to reason that when you have a spike in claims right before a deadline, you may not have as many claims that are valid as you\u2019ve seen over a long history. But, we didn\u2019t take that into account. So, we feel, at this point, well-reserved for everything we know, and we\u2019re not going to be getting any claims. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you. And then, my real question is about the marketing spend. It was about a year ago that, Rich, you signaled that you\u2019re entering this investment cycle. And, I would just love to get an update on how you\u2019re feeling about the efficacy of that spend at this point and sort of what the short to medium term outlook might be as we look to the New Year? Richard Fairbank : Eric, it continues to be a very positive story for us. We -- in card, the marketing is strengthening our heavy spender franchise, it\u2019s driving strong growth in new accounts, purchase volume, net interchange revenue, and now increasingly loans as well. On the bank side, the increased marketing is really basically the tip of the spear of our organically building a national bank. And that\u2019s fueling deposit growth and also moving a lot of the sort of metrics associated with cafes and our brand on the national banking side. In fact, speaking of brand, this is one of the big beneficiaries overall of the marketing that we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re seeing a lot of traction across the Company and our brand metrics in hard to move brand equities that really are critical to building a franchise. So, we continue to be enthusiastic as we have been for a number of months. One thing that\u2019s just a little different versus a year ago, we had such a big step up because we were launching a couple of new programs. But, we don\u2019t have that at this very moment, new launches, but except of course, Walmart here. But we continue to be bullish. And in fact, now that I mentioned Walmart, we will be sharing with Walmart a pretty active and positive campaign associated with this card. And, again, we will be underwriting a portion of that. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Question on CECL. It\u2019s interesting with all the talk about the impacts over the last year. So, really the increase isn\u2019t too bad for you, not that dissimilar actually from Amex. And I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the offsets, I guess, maybe on your commercial side of your portfolio? And then, Scott, is it fair to say there\u2019s only a pretty modest impact downward biased in terms of the impact to GAAP 2020 CECL and without CECL? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Let me just start off kind of talking about the longer term impacts of CECL. So, obviously, CECL creates a onetime reduction in our capital ratios that adoption, and it\u2019s permanently increasing the amount of capital that we\u2019ll hold against those losses. In terms of future allowance builds, I think, in times of slow and stable growth, a stable economic outlook, I\u2019d expect that CECL is going to look fairly similar to what we see with allowance moves today. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll see a lot of violence then. However, I think when you see periods of accelerated growth, significant changes in the economic outlook, I feel confident that we\u2019re going to see amplified allowance moves and increased provision volatility. So, when I pull up, I think, it\u2019s completely appropriate just to mention that CECL is not going to change the way that we approach our businesses and how we conduct the business of lending. I kind of look back at the fact that, we don\u2019t yet know how the Fed will incorporate CECL and the CCAR, that\u2019s still a few years away. Ultimately that could impact capital levels for us and for all banks. And the other thing I\u2019d say is, as we\u2019ve been saying, I think in periods of stress, in a deep recession, I continue to be worried that CECL will make it more difficult for the banking industry to lend, when you have to record lifetime expected losses before you get to report any of the related revenue. And so, you know I\u2019m anxious about that. And then, Don, to your other question about the puts and takes, it\u2019s really difficult to unpack other banks\u2019 CECL disclosures. I don\u2019t really have good insights to what\u2019s driving their CECL numbers. I can tell you that our 30% to 40% estimate of the increase in allowance and adoption represents our balance sheet mix, the business practices that we follow and the accounting policy elections that we\u2019ve made. And in order of magnitude, on the initial adoption of CECL from lowest to highest, commercial is the lowest, card is the second, and then auto is third. And that\u2019s in terms of magnitude of the allowance build from lowest to highest. Don Fandetti : Okay. And then, one last on shifting to auto, how are origination yields? Are they holding up pretty well? It looks like yields are coming in obviously still above the portfolio yield. And have you seen any shift in competition? It looks like your subprime mix continues to go up a tiny bit in auto. Richard Fairbank : Yes. So, the auto -- the competitive environment is -- continues to be -- it\u2019s pretty intense, but it still offers I think quite a bit of opportunity. Let me talk about the parts of the marketplace. In subprime auto, we\u2019ve seen a rapid growth actually of small independent lenders, although they are more focused on deep subprime, high-loss business. We also see some increased competition from some lenders who had previously pulled back. And we remain vigilant on that, but definitely the subprime opportunity is there. In near-prime, the competition from some who had pulled back in the past, certainly has intensified quite a bit. We still see opportunity, but it\u2019s definitely intense, the competition there. And in the prime market, we have seen some reversal in the trend of increasing market share of credit unions, although the market continues to be competitive. When we look at margins in general, the margins have -- are actually pretty healthy, and even a little healthier in prime than they have been in some past periods. So, we continue to see a growth opportunity. I would just also say that while we don\u2019t have any way to quantify this, I think, we have been benefited by the technology investments that we have made in the business. Investments on the underwriting side, the sort of real time -- creating real time underwriting and real time pricing capabilities that are enabled by our cloud strategy and our overall technology transformation, in product design, in sort of things to help dealers and things to make our operation be just so much more effective in real time. And all of these are things we\u2019ve worked hard to create. I think, they\u2019re very beneficial. They don\u2019t transcend the competitive and cycle conditions that will still dominate our metrics. But, I think underneath it all, there\u2019s a growing strength that we have in the auto business and just one of the many benefits that is growing related to our tech transformation. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : And our next question will come from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Rick Shane : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was actually a little worried I wouldn\u2019t get to participate on the 100th call. Congratulations. It\u2019s really quite an achievement. Just one clarification. Scott, you\u2019ve talked about the CECL reserve, and I just want to make sure that we all understand that in the context of the Walmart acquisition. Should we think of that 30% to 40% increase not as versus September 30th but a day zero to day one change? Richard Fairbank : Yes. You should think of that as our estimate for the January 1, 2020 adoption, which would include all of the assets that are on balance sheet as of that date. So, Walmart would be included in that as with all of the other assets at that point. Rick Shane : Okay. Most of the companies we follow talked about in the context of September 30th. I just wanted to make sure, given the sizable acquisition, we\u2019re thinking about that in the right way. That\u2019s it for me\u2026 Richard Fairbank : We\u2019ve tried to make an estimate for the total impact of the Company, given kind of where we are and where we would expect to be. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : And our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffrey. Kevin Barker : Just to follow up on some of the comments around NIM, and some of your -- the explanation you gave going forward use. Could you help understand where you see the trajectory of the securities portfolio, especially with a little bit of stabilization at 10-year that we\u2019ve seen recently? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Just a few thoughts there. So, NIM in the quarter was pretty modestly impacted by the fact that we were holding some additional cash on Walmart in preparation for acquiring the Walmart portfolio. So, we will be -- as we go ahead and have executed that will be replacing that with the higher yielding assets of the Walmart portfolio. So, that\u2019s going to be a net positive in terms of the trajectory of NIM. In terms of the securities portfolio, it\u2019s been trending down a little bit which is mainly a liquidity assessment terms of what we need for liquidity in that portfolio. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a significant change to NIM in terms of what we see coming out of that portfolio. Kevin Barker : Okay. Was there any outsized amount of premium amortization this quarter? And, could you give us an idea of where your new money yields are on the securities portfolio? Richard Fairbank : I don\u2019t think that in terms of -- I don\u2019t think, there\u2019s really anything meaningful in any of those areas for me to share with you in terms of the impact on the quarter, going forward. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Hogan with William Blair. Brian Hogan : Thank you. My first question is actually on the growth of your employee base. So, it\u2019s been accelerating, and it was up 9.5% year-over-year. And I guess, I mean, in conjunction with your shift to technology and focus on that digital transformation. So, I guess, why the significant growth in personnel, what are they doing? What are your investments in that? Scott Blackley : Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Scott. I think the thing that\u2019s probably most impactful right now on headcount is that we\u2019re ramping up for the Walmart launch and integration. We started doing that a couple quarters ago. That\u2019s really been the largest growth in headcount most recently. And as you mentioned that our technology investments in work there have been over time than adding to total headcount. But, I think just in general, the growth of the Company and Walmart have been a major factor as well. Brian Hogan : Should we expect that to level off that, right? Scott Blackley : Well, in terms of the Walmart personnel, that\u2019s a group that we have brought on to deal with that account. So, I would expect that we wouldn\u2019t have further increases in headcount associated with Walmart, and then the rest of kind of the trajectory there is going to be driven by normal business activity. Richard Fairbank : Brian, but to your point, the 42 by 21, a 1aenabler of that. And in fact, without this, we wouldn\u2019t be same 42 by 21. A central enabler of this is the benefits that have come from our heavy all-in tech transformation where we are approaching the end of the seventh year of our tech transformation. And, for much of that transformation, it costs more before it costs less. And we continue to invest and we will invest on a continuing basis. Because, I think increasingly, technology is what a sort of tech company does. But that said, our confidence to shingle ourselves as far in advances did to some pretty bold efficiency ratio target is powered by efficiencies that come from the tech investments and cost saving -- on the cost saving opportunities from changing how we work, driving customers to digital, driving really the company to digital, driving down technology costs themselves as we move away from a lot of expensive proprietary technology as we consolidate our technology, reduce a lot of duplication and really moved to just a better way of operating. So, just wanted to mention that. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : And our next question will be from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran : Hi. I mean, you\u2019ve addressed a lot already. I mean, maybe -- I guess, I\u2019m only struck by people are always focused on your overall tone on this conference calls. And if I just kind of go down the things that matter, I mean, since like you are feeling a little better about some of the leading indicators on credit, a little better online size increases and thus branded card growth, little less worries on the interest rates, still confident on the OpEx. And maybe I\u2019m over-reading it, but it felt like maybe the excess capital position was becoming a little bit clearer, less uncertainty there. I mean, is it fair, if someone just asks, was Capital One more or less positive? I mean, it sounds like you are a little bit more positive on all the key fronts. Is that a fair assessment or are there some negatives that maybe I\u2019m leaving out? Richard Fairbank : Brian, I think, I was writing it down as you were doing it, going over credit, and yes, the line increases. I mean, again, we\u2019re still in the overall motive of cautious where we\u2019re in the economy, but line increases, check. I would add continuing bullishness about the marketing and the success, the traction in the card business overall. Interest rates, now again, on interest rates, it\u2019s hard to be bullish on that. But, we are -- relative to the some of the seismic impacts that have happened in interest rates, I think the combination of how the market\u2019s responding and the tools that we have in our portfolio to adapt, I think, we have increasing bullishness about that. Operating expenses, if you pull up the kind of -- our point was that we got delta curve ball that wasn\u2019t in our plans, when we announced the 42x21. I remember the meeting when we first -- somebody brought in, well, this is going to be the impact, the sort of gross impact of this on what could be with respect to revenues on interest rates. And after we caught our breath, we continued to just work incredibly hard and the traction on operating expenses and all matters around the efficiency ratio continues to be positive such that despite the interest rate move, we are continuing to reaffirm our guidance of the capital. There is a strong excess capital thing position there. And the other one I would add on the list is the continued -- you can feel it inside the Company. It\u2019s hard for the outside world to see this, partly because we don\u2019t always proclaim some of the things that are proprietary that we\u2019re doing. But, the tech transformation that started at the bottom of the technology stack, a place that is the hardest work, shows the least immediate payoff. And in fact if you selectively transform yourself in the bottom of the technology stack, it doesn\u2019t really do much for you. But I\u2019ve said over the years, and in the end, I know really the proof ultimately is in the pudding and what investors see. But, what I want to say is it\u2019s a very the unusual thing that Capital One has done by so heavily starting at the bottom of the tech stack and working up. I think, most companies when they do the tech transformation start at the top of the tech stack, meaning innovating on the part of the technology that is customer or associate facing. And it\u2019s very natural thing to do because that\u2019s by definition the only thing that people can see and that\u2019s where competitors put pressure, customers are clamoring, et cetera. But, we have been transforming from the bottom of the technology stack. But as we continue to move up the tech stack, more and more will be visible over time, the benefits will become greater, the agility greater and the opportunity to create great things at the top of the tech stack, the ability to transform how we work, the ability to make some significant differentiated capabilities on the risk management side, and ultimately to create a great customer experience and better and better economics. That is what we\u2019ve been driving for, for years. And I think we continue to have a bullishness about that. So, what\u2019s the yikers is along the way is just a lot of work. There are a lot of things that happen on the way to work but this is we continue to feel an increase in momentum on these things that are long time in the making, but I think, they are at the heart of winning in the very different place where the world is going. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : And our final question this evening comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Chris Donat : I just want to ask about the pricing strategy for Capital One 360 in an environment where you have seen some of the large,, call them cyber deposit gatherers decrease their rates. How do you feel about strategy in terms of both, competitors and in terms of Fed funds and other benchmarks as far as -- what factors really determine where you set that deposit rate? Richard Fairbank : Well, Chris, it would be a fairly straightforward thing. I wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019d never use the word easy but it would be a fairly straightforward thing to build a direct bank that goes to the top of bank rate monitor and builds deposits that way. And what -- that\u2019s not the business that we have wanted to build. And the term I always use is we want to build a franchise. And that\u2019s a much higher calling. And, there\u2019s a lot that goes into that. But, one of the benefits over time of building a franchise is one doesn\u2019t have to chase rates at the top of the marketplace, but rather is providing really good deals for people who believe in the Company and where we can have enduring relationships. And that\u2019s what this has been about. So, with every passing year, we partly measure our success by how far we\u2019re able to distance ourselves from just the very -- the players who are just absolutely chasing race at the top of the rate table. And that\u2019s not only an economic benefit, but it actually really helps in terms of the kind of customers that we\u2019re attracting, the selection dynamics that are critical in terms of the longevity of the deposits themselves. So, we have -- so that sort of the already the state of mind and where we have been. As now a new thing comes along which is the bottom falls out of the interest rate marketplace. We have noticed a number of players on the direct space moved. We also lowered our price at the end of the quarter. And we will continue to watch the marketplace. But we certainly -- our strategy is not to chase the hot money. Our strategy is really to provide great deals to consumers and have the streamlined economics and the digital model to support that. And that\u2019s what we will continue to do. And that -- I think it will serve us well through this part of the cycle and I think over the longer term. Jeff Norris : Well, that concludes our question-and-answer period and our call for this evening. Thank you for joining us on this conference call today and for your continuing interest in Capital One. As a reminder, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening, if you have further questions. Thanks, everyone. Have a great evening. End of Q&A: Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Thank you. This conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Rob and welcome everyone to Capital One\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the internet, please log on to Capital One\u2019s website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2019 results. Scott Blackley : Thanks, Jeff. I will begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $5.5 billion or $11.05 per diluted common share in 2019. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were $12.09 for 2019. In the fourth quarter, net income was $1.2 billion or $2.25 per share. Net of adjusting items, our EPS in the quarter was $2.49 per share. We had three adjusting items in the quarter which are outlined on Slide 14 of our earnings presentation. First, we had a $48 million or $0.08 per share expense of launch and integration costs associated with our Walmart partnership. This brings the full year total expense to $211 million and concludes the one-time expenses related to the Walmart partnership launch. Additionally, we had an allowance reserve build for the acquired Walmart portfolio of $84 million or $0.13 per share. The reserve build as well as the launch and integration costs are recorded in our domestic card business. Lastly, we had $23 million of charges related to the cyber incident that we announced at the end of July. These charges were partially offset by an insurance reimbursement receivable of $7 million resulting in a net impact of $16 million or $0.03 per share. We continue to expect a portion of these charges in insurance recoveries will extend beyond 2019. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Scott. I will begin on Slide 9 which summarizes fourth quarter results for our credit card business. The credit card business delivered solid results with stable credit and strong growth in loans, purchase volume and revenue. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business, which is shown on Slide 10. Domestic card ending loan balances increased by $11.3 billion or 10.5% year-over-year driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio and strong growth of branded cards partially offset by our choice to exit several small partnership portfolios in the second quarter. Branded card loans, which exclude all private label and co-branded cards, grew 5.7% from the prior year quarter. Domestic card average loans for the quarter were up 9.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. We posted another strong quarter of purchase volume growth as we continued to grow our heavy spender franchise. Year-over-year, domestic card purchase volume growth was 10.7%. Net interchange revenue for the total company grew 9.2%. Revenue increased 7.2% from the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by the growth in average loans. Revenue margin declined 31 basis points. More than 100% of the decline was driven by the revenue sharing agreement on the acquired Walmart portfolio. Not-interest expense was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. Domestic card credit remains strong and stable. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.32%, a 32 basis point improvement year-over-year driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio. Because the delinquency rate is not affected by the loss-sharing agreement, the addition of the Walmart portfolio put upward pressure on the fourth quarter 30 plus delinquency rate. Despite this upward pressure, the 30 plus delinquency rate improved 11 basis points from the end of the prior year quarter to 3.93%. Pulling up, our domestic card business continued to deliver strong results with top line growth and strong and stable credit. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourselves to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any additional follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Matt, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you.  Your first question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good evening guys. Richard Fairbank : Good evening, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Hey, Rich. Maybe just to start off a question for Scott, so thank you for the moving pieces on CECL across the different products, I guess, now that Day 1 is behind us, any color you can give us regarding the Day 2 impact? And maybe can you just talk about it across each of the different portfolio? And I have one follow-up. Scott Blackley : Yes. Sure. Well, when I think about Day 2, I am going to start off by just saying we gave segment level multiples and I think they are a good foundation for you to use those multiples and apply them to what you would have been estimating under the prior regime for allowance builds in 2020. So I think that\u2019s in general a good place to start in terms of thinking about Day 2. I think that the multiple that we have talked about could change gradually if performance \u2013 the portfolio performance or the portfolio mix really changes in the future, but I think those are going to be changes that happen over time. So the transition multiples are probably a good place to start. Ryan Nash : Got it. And Rich, maybe just a question on both operating and overall efficiency, so you made nice progress in 2019 despite a handful of headwinds, I guess what are the biggest rate factors that could impact reaching 42 or is it the fact that everything is coming offline in the fourth quarter that you have such a high degree of confidence? And then I guess second just given where we are in the cycle, you talked about marketing being up moderately this year, is there some area where you could see it accelerating or would you expect it to remain in and around these levels plus or minus like you articulated in your outlook? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : So, Ryan, let\u2019s talk about the operating efficiency ratio. We are, like a year into when we set this guidance and it was certainly a stepping out of character for Capital One to be so specific of so many years out. And as we have talked all along the way, there are several things that have driven our confidence. There are certain things that are, could call the math is a little bit understating the sort of incredible work associated with doing it, but in a sense, getting out of the data centers is something that with the extraordinary achievement of doing it, we have, I think a very good handle on what the cost of what\u2019s straddling those environments have been and what the benefit of just being all in on the cloud is. The math of the Walmart step up that is what it is, that\u2019s contractual. And so I think that\u2019s a very reliable thing. Another thing that aids the continued improvement here and the larger improvement in 2021 is the increased traction that we expect in our businesses that we can in fact see unfolding and that we expect to continue. Obviously, that has uncertainty around it like any estimated future businesses performance and growth, but a lot of that is sort of in the works. It can be affected by changes in the marketplace, changes in the economy, changes in choices that we make, but this is the product of the bunch of work that we have been doing, the success of our marketing and account origination in prior years which we have spent lot of time talking about and some of the technology innovation that has been going on. So, we feel good about that. Obviously, that has uncertainty to it. And the other element in the uncertainty equation is what happens to operating cost of 1 minus the data center exit and all the associated cost of straddling that will be eliminated. And there can always be risk to cost estimates, but we have spent \u2013 we have worked very hard and this is not like a new thing, we worked hard for years driving \u2013 gradually driving down the efficiency ratio and being very disciplined on operating cost. We do have some growing benefit that comes on the technology side here with respect to technology cost savings and collectively, when we put all that together, well as always there is uncertainty in this. Here we are, we had our bold shingle that we hung out a year ago. Here we are a year into it and we feel as good as we did at the time that we launched it. And I am pretty struck by in a world where so many things change how \u2013 what we had in mind is continuing to unfold and that\u2019s because it\u2019s the product of the lot of work for a long period of time. With respect to marketing, the first thing I want to say is we don\u2019t give precise in most years, in many ways, we don\u2019t even give marketing guidance at all. And what I would say about marketing is in the impression I want to leave you with is we continue to feel very good about our marketing investments. We \u2013 in card, marketing is strengthening our heavy spender franchise driving strong new account originations, growth in purchase volume, net interchange revenue, loans on the bank side, the increased marketing is fueling deposit growth along with cafe and brand awareness. We are seeing a lot of traction just overall in our brand metrics and brand equities that are critical to building a franchise. And also we are a company that doesn\u2019t have 6,000 branches we are a company that actually isn\u2019t at the top of the lead table in terms of co-brand partnerships and a lot of things. So, we have to build our business the old fashioned way kind of one customer at the time and our marketing machine is a key part of that. So, what I would leave you with is we continue to feel very good about the marketing. We got a new addition here in terms of the full year of the Walmart marketing. And so that\u2019s going to be yet another factor that pulls up the numbers there. There is always \u2013 we will always make our final determinations based on the opportunities and necessities that we see in the marketplace, but I wanted to just give you that general window into how we are feeling about the marketing. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the Day 2 CECL impact, Scott. When you look at the Street consensus provisions out there and I am just looking at our own, we are assuming 6%ish loan growth flat charge-offs and we have the provision up 20%. I mean, does that look commensurate to sort of what you are articulating or is this something else? Scott Blackley : Sanjay, why don\u2019t I just step back and give you little bit of a picture of what\u2019s going to happen with CECL? So, just to go back and ground out how CECL is going to work. Allowance movements under CECL are really driven by the same factors that drove the allowance under the prior regime. So, you start off with loan balances at the end of the period, you have got expected future losses and recoveries on balances and then we have qualitative factors that are not captured in our modeling and we have those on top. Of those three factors, it\u2019s really the second one that changes under CECL and because we are now going to be holding an allowance for the expected lifetime losses. And importantly we are also going to be having the lifetime recoveries and that\u2019s \u2013 I will come to that in just a minute as to why that\u2019s such an important factor. So that\u2019s the biggest step change under CECL. So, let me kind of just put this together for you and tell you how we are going to do it. We start with a 12-month loss outlook which we forecast. We then extend that into a lifetime forecast and when we do that we assume a gradual reversion of losses to historical averages after that first year. And then we overlay that with future recoveries and future recoveries are a big offset to our CECL allowance. Prior to CECL we offset our allowance with expected recoveries for only the next 12 months. With CECL, we will be offsetting our allowance with all estimated future recoveries. And relatively speaking, recoveries have a larger offsetting impact under CECL than they did under the prior allowance regime, because we tend to see a longer tail of recoveries on our charge-offs. So, net of all of that, I think you are going to see a 1.42 multiple on our allowance in our domestic card business at the point of transition, 1.49 multiple for our auto business. And as I mentioned in my first answer, I think those are relatively stable. Your question about, well, how might this look in periods of stability and in periods of growth, let me just kind of answer that real quick. In periods of stability, you are really just going to have take that multiple and apply it to whatever allowance build that you are thinking about and that includes moderate growth and a stable economy. There is a couple of things that could cause that implied CECL multiple to vary over time. And let me give you a couple of examples. So the first is that as you know and we have talked about CECL pulls forward the allowance expense associated with new lending. And so all else equal, our implied CECL multiple would probably go up in periods of higher growth. And just to give you a bit of sensitivity there, during our growth surge in 2014 and 2015, the implied multiple during that period if we had lived under CECL would have been higher perhaps in the 1.6 range. So just to give you a sense like there is a lot of things that could move around that if we just kind of took hindsight and applied kind of where we see things we can see the multiple going up into that range. On the flipside of that in periods of high recoveries, you could actually see the multiple go down. So in periods immediately after a downturn where there is higher \u2013 we have got this big portfolio of recoveries, those might actually start to be a bigger factor and push the ultimate multiple down. So I know that was a bit of a long answer, but hopefully that gives you a sense of kind of the moving pieces of how CECL is going to work Day 2. Sanjay Sakhrani : Alright. Thank you. I have one follow-up. Just on the Walmart portfolio, I know it was known to have a lower tender share penetration. I was wondering if that\u2019s a big growth opportunity in 2020 and a contributor to card growth. And then just a clarification on the marketing expense outlook for 2020, would this year\u2019s growth be moderately higher sort of that \u2013 was that a good comparison in terms of the growth rate? Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Could you repeat the second question, Sanjay, your clarification question? Sanjay Sakhrani : Yes. On the marketing expense growth, you mentioned moderately higher, I was just wondering if 2019\u2019s growth rate would be commensurate with moderately higher in terms of like mid single-digits growth? Scott Blackley : Okay. So I think what we have this year is a continuation of the momentum that we had last year. And I want to say also to my response to Ryan Nash\u2019s opening question that one of the important drivers of 42% is the continuing traction in the business and marketing is a very important element of that. And in fact \u2013 so a way to think about it is we start with an opportunity in a sense a growing opportunity on the marketing side consistent with what we are seeing overlay that with Walmart which is a new thing. And those two things together is what is driving our guidance of a moderate increase in marketing. Rich, do you want to talk about this question on the growth opportunity from \u2013 growth opportunity in the Walmart portfolio? Yes, let me say it\u2019s certainly an honor and an opportunity to partner with not only the world\u2019s largest retailer actually the world\u2019s largest company, Fortune 1 company and to launch a digital first card program. So for Capital One, the opportunity divides itself into a back book where we have converted the old Synchrony back book and we have told you a lot about the size and the general parameters associated with that. And then there will over time be a growing front book that will be the originations that we do under this new partnership. We are not going to be specifically guiding to that front book, because in many ways this will have a lot of similarity to many of the front book things that we do at Capital One. Certainly, the size of the Walmart and at this point, relative to other partnerships the penetration levels of the credit card relationships, there is certainly upside there and I think Walmart certainly believes that and so do we. But we are in the very early stages of this, but I think we are very pleased with the way our two companies are partnering here. Jeff Norris : Thanks. Next question please. Operator : And your next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. You referred to a 5.7% growth in the branded cards that I think was the same number that you referenced in the third quarter, so roughly the same level as growth. Could you just talk a little bit about what the kind of the outlook is? I mean, because that does exclude Walmart, so talk a little bit about whether that branded growth is going to be accelerating or decelerating and the impact maybe on overall growth from Walmart? And I do have a follow-up. Richard Fairbank : Yes, Moshe, so first of all, the front book of \u2013 since it starts at zero the front book by definition will be a growing book. I also want to point out the back book of Walmart with the loss rate that it has is a runoff portfolio that\u2019s running off at a pretty sizable clip relative to portfolios otherwise that we have. So, there are going to be two forces going in opposite directions there and we will have to see how that plays out, but we are certainly very happy to have that partnership. The outlook, look I think we continue to feel good about the growth opportunities in the card business, but I think it\u2019s more a continuation of the story that we have been talking about before in terms of we are benefited by a number of years of strong account origination. We have been over time increasing credit lines as we have validated each successive vintage. It\u2019s coming in as good as it is and in fact if anything, the recent vintages are outperforming in a good way by a bit some of the earlier vintage. So all that is good that gives us the confidence to continue to drive the originations and also the continuing confidence on the credit line side. This is all in the context of an economy that\u2019s already the longest in length in recorded history here between recessions. So with a cautious eye at the environment, the things that we have been talking about for a number of quarters are continuing to find traction and then very important element of that is the success of the marketing. So, that\u2019s why we feel good about the growth opportunity. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. And just as a follow-up, little bit of housekeeping, non-interest income outside of interchange revenue and service fees kind of that other line was up very nicely both from the third quarter and a year ago. Was that primarily just the change in the absence of the PPI charge or are there other factors as well? Scott Blackley : Moshe, can you just \u2013 which specific line item are you looking at? Moshe Orenbuch : What you guys have called kind of other income, it was up like 55%, 60% of Q3 and 90% or so from a year ago, but I believe both of those had the PPI charges in them? Scott Blackley : Yes. So, a few things that impact that line item, so other non-interest income really is driven by oftentimes marks on, on a variety of different situations. So, the first is we actually have some compensation-related assets that we mark and we take the benefit of those marks runs through this line item in revenue and there is an offsetting expense that runs through and elevates FCNB. So in the period with the run-up in the market, there was a pretty healthy amount of mark on compensation. The other thing that runs through there we do occasionally have partner payments that are coming in under the contracts. Those can run through there and be a bit lumpy. I think that the level that you are seeing in Q4 is a bit elevated to what I would expect on a run-rate basis. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good evening. Richard Fairbank : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Just switching gears a little bit talking about NIM, I know that NIM went up nicely in the quarter, which I think you had a comment in your prepared remarks around how lower rates are little bit of a headwind. So I just wanted to square those two things and understand how you are thinking about the outlook for NIM, you had a nice decline in the deposit costs, maybe if you could speak to that a little bit? Scott Blackley : Betsy, as I mentioned last quarter, we have been talking for a number of quarters about headwinds from deposit mix and deposit pricing and we have started to see those abate a little bit last quarter. When I look at NIM this quarter, I mentioned that there were two primary factors that drove NIM up on a linked quarter basis. One of those was asset mix which was the larger of the two factors that I described. The other factor was seasonal loan growth. So we are seeing a bit of that traction in there. The deposit pricing is embedded in that as well as things like accelerated amortization on the premiums that we have, some of the securities, all of that\u2019s embedded in there. So overall, I think that when it comes to the impact of deposit pricing our betas have been relatively low since the declining rate cycle started that maybe an opportunity. Rich mentioned the types of factors that would drive where deposit pricing goes. So I think we will have to see where that moves to, but at this point, I don\u2019t really see any outsized impactors whether positively or negative on our net interest margin. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then so mix really driving the buzz on that, when I think about the CECL outlook here and I know you have already talked about Day 2 quite a bit, I just wanted to see if you could give us some color around the commercial banking increase in your Day 1. I ask just because some of the other folks we look at had declines in commercial. So I want to understand what was driving a little bit of a different outcome for you? Scott Blackley : It is so hard for me to judge what others are doing on their estimates. It depends on the life, a variety of factors. So, I can\u2019t even hazard a guess when it comes to commercial just because the portfolios are pretty different. So, I really honestly don\u2019t have an answer to you on that one. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And your next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think we would all agree that a $100 loan balance on January 1 after the holidays would have a different repaying behavior than a $100 loan balance on May 1 after tax refunds are distributed. I realize from a CECL perspective you are supposed to take lifetime loss assumptions on both. But I am trying to understand how does the practical difference in terms of that near-term repayment behavior impact your lifetime loss reserve? And said slightly differently, is 5% growth in December the same as 5% growth in June? Scott Blackley : Rick, I would just say that seasonal growth and transactors we look at those, we look at the likelihood of revolving we use historical empirical data about how quickly those get paid down. They don\u2019t tend to have large lifetime allowances and in general I would say those aren\u2019t really a factor that\u2019s driving the multiples that we disclosed. Rick Shane : Got it. So as a follow-up to that, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to see that same seasonality, because you are able to factor in, in the short-term the repayment behaviors? Scott Blackley : Yes, broadly speaking, all else equal, I think that\u2019s true. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And your next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Yes, Rich, there has been a lot of talk in the banking and payments industry about B2B and Capital One is a top three small business card issuer. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic there and what your thoughts are in terms of growth and is that growing faster than your consumer business? Richard Fairbank : So our small business, we don\u2019t break that out separately. As we are in the consumer side, one of the top players in the lead table in that particular space AmEx is way north of the rest of us unlike the shorter distance between competitors on the consumer side, but that business is a business that is a simple extrapolation \u2013 a simple transfer of a consumer approach or a lift and shift of a commercial approach ends up being a suboptimal thing. And the traction and success we have gotten in the small business space comes from really working backwards from the customer and the customer needs over a very, very long period of time. And so a lot of the underlying dynamics are the same in that business in terms of the shift in payments, the reduction in cash and checks and so on. But what I would leave you with is like our some of the other investments we have made at Capital One, this is many years kind of in the making and we are continuing to generate successful growth there. The one thing I would say is that on both the consumer side and certainly the small business and the commercial side, the change that is going on in payments is breathtaking. I think it\u2019s really at the vortex of technology change in all of banking and that\u2019s partly because the digitization of transactions is a very natural place to go, but it\u2019s also one of the places that is not regulated or it\u2019s very lightly regulated. And furthermore it is the place where many tech companies who really don\u2019t want to be carrying around bank holding company badges and things like that focused on how they can try to win on the front end of banking and leave a lot of the back end of banking to the banks. So I am excited by the opportunity on the business side as well as the consumer side, but I\u2019m certainly struck by the breathtaking rate of change. And I think for every player in the business, there is a real imperative to come up with a strategy and work backwards from where the world is going instead of forward from where we are. Jeff Norris : Do you have a follow-up, Don? Don Fandetti : Nope, I am all set. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just not looking for guidance, but just thinking conceptually long-term, it would seem logical that you could do more digital customer aggregation with the digital bank in place. Was that \u2013 is it fair to think that customer acquisition costs, the costs tied to physical mailings and so forth may be more efficient going forward? Richard Fairbank : Wait, I want to make sure, John, could you explain a little bit more of your question again? John Hecht : It\u2019s just you guys have invested a lot more to digital banking platform and it\u2019s clear to us that as a user of your website you can do more online. And so the question is given that your consumers can do more online, are there cross-selling opportunities, are there other opportunities to reduce your customer acquisition costs for a specific product? Richard Fairbank : Yes. So from the \u2013 interestingly from the founding notion of this company, one of the founding notions was that marketing is going to be reinvented by the technology and information revolution. And so, way back with old fashion direct mail, we set out to build the business and we also didn\u2019t have \u2013 it was by being very small, we didn\u2019t have much of a cross-sell opportunity. So much of the heritage of the company for a long period of time was focused on the origination of business. And one of the great prizes that awaited us over time was to have a scale franchise and there are two parts to that. One is to really be large, but the other is to be a franchise. And if you overlay the whole digital revolution on that, I want to redouble your point that I think the opportunity that awaits the companies who bring three things to the table is extraordinary. One is the table stake is you really need to be large and however important scale was in the past, it is more important everyday and I believe it was very important in the past. The second thing that one needs to bring to the table is great digital capability and that\u2019s not just in terms of nice apps and that kind of thing, but also the information based capabilities which increasingly are very benefited by real-time big data and the use of machine learning. So there is a great opportunity there. That\u2019s the second leg of the stool if you will, but I really, really, what we believe at the outset and what we certainly live every day is there is a third leg of the stool and that is that you have to have a loyal customer franchise. Just having eyeballs lying around just having a large customer base, it\u2019s nice, but the nonlinear things that happen when there is a deep and loyal franchise is a great thing. If you look at the essence of Capital One strategy over all of these years, we started with nothing and have spent years and years in the quest for scale. Secondly, we have started with an information-based strategy many years ago and really \u2013 and that was again pre-Internet and all of that, but where we have come over time the whole tech transformation driving toward great digital capability and real-time machine learning big data capability. And then finally and maybe of all of them this is the hardest one to build is really building that loyal customer franchise, which is all about a great customer experience, products that people can rely on, a customer relationship that to tell your friends about and ultimately a brand that stands out. And I appreciate your question because that has been three legs of the strategy for many, many years and I think the growing traction that we are having on a lot of fronts, including on the financial side is a product of that opportunity. And I think there is a lot more upside from here. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : And your next question will come from Brian Hogan with William Blair. Brian Hogan : Good afternoon. Thanks. First question is on the competition and your views on the Applecart and the potential pressure could come from that large competitor in there, growth has been pretty dramatic in the first year or so? And then a follow-up on that is actually potential competition from like the challenger banks like Chime and Varo, N26 and others. Are you seeing any customer losses from those? Richard Fairbank : Right. So, Brian your question is about competition. Our focus is really more on the sort of the tech side and the new innovation as opposed to just the \u2013 let me start with just a comment about competition in general in the card business and then let me pivot to some specific things. The credit card business, I think has \u2013 I think back to the founding of Capital One is I would say that Capital One is a very young company to most \u2013 compared to most of our bank competitors. They have been around for over 100 years. In Capital One\u2019s case, it\u2019s not an accident that we started with credit cards, because we had a belief way back then that credit cards structurally had a number of advantages that would allow them to have very good earnings power and also be absolutely at the tip of the spear of where the whole tech revolution and information revolution were taking it. It is funny over 25 years into this journey I am finding a lot of the same observations that we had before. And I think the credit card as a business is kind of standing out in these times relative to the earnings power of the business like this as well as some of the growth opportunities that it has. That said that insight is not lost on our competitors and this is a very competitive business. But because of the scale of the requirements in the business, it is \u2013 it\u2019s a very consolidated business and I think most of the competition revolves around the top 10 players in the business. And I think the competition is intense, but I think it\u2019s fundamentally rational. But the intent shows up in marketing intensity, rewards, offers, pricing and various things, but if we pull way up and I cross-calibrate to other parts of banking in which we play, this feels like we have the area with the highest opportunity and the most kind of rationale marketplace at the moment. Let me pivot to the tech marketplace. Often we are asked by investors about fin-techs and what about this startup and that startup and of course we keep an eye on that. I think the sort of elephant in the room is the gigantic tech companies and the sort of opportunities that they have. And so we have always had a lot of respect for that and frankly, our tech transformation is motivated in many ways by trying to emulate and learn from some of the best practices of those companies. It certainly has our attention. When Apple launches the Applecart, I think it was a really, really well done marketing campaign, which is universally what we have observed from Apple for many, many years. And we will keep an eye on that, but I would say that, that now adds to the list of impressive competitors and impressive offerings that we are up against. If we pivot to the challenger banks that are out there, so I am going to switch more to the deposit and banking side of the business, there are some really striking numbers that have been posted by companies that are trying to establish themselves in banking. We know from having spent a lot of years doing this and right now having a national banking strategy and you see us on television, it is a really hard thing to dislodge business from the established banks with great scale and local presence and so that all of us are working very hard on that. I have been struck by the numbers of account origination that are coming out of some of the challenger\u2019s banks. The biggest question I have and I don\u2019t know the answer is it\u2019s just the question I have is how much activity level and true sustaining traction do they have. I am not saying they don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s something that is an important place to look, but we are inspired by some of the innovation our competitors are doing and it\u2019s a reminder to all of us that if we really lean into a tech innovation, there is an opportunity to chip away at the extraordinary position that a few of the biggest banks in the U.S. have. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Your final question on the evening will come from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Perfect. Thank you for fitting me in. Rich, in your commentary, you alluded to the fact that competition in the auto space intensified to some extent, can you just give us a little more insight on what you are referring to in what ways that manifested? And then I have one quick unrelated follow-up. Richard Fairbank : Yes. So, the auto business has a relatively small number of very large players and I have often said, Eric that competition in auto is even more impactful than in the short-term than competition in card only because on the auto side you have a dealer in the middle of an auction. And when the dealer sees something from a particular lender, like a loser credit policy or a different pricing, the dealer can drive a significant amount of business in a way that just doesn\u2019t happen in the one-to-one marketing that happens on the card side. So, it\u2019s why almost every conversation that we have about auto and every time we celebrate a particular growth that we have, we always caution how big that factor is and how much that factor can create adverse selection if people are loosening their credit policies. So what we do is we invest heavily in technology in this business and we are absolutely every quarter we are out there to get whatever opportunity we can have consistent with our own standards and with a very, very watchful eye on the competition. In the last \u2013 over the last few years, there was a pullback of a couple of competitors that we took advantage of. Both of them have certainly returned and are pretty aggressive players in the space. And what we would describe to you is that the competition is increasing in the auto space. It\u2019s nothing to wave red flags about, but it\u2019s generally increasing and it\u2019s a little bit unusual that at the same time we are saying competition is increasing that we are also saying our originations and even our book of business overall actually increasing. That is something that maybe a little bit anomalous. There is also something hard for us to tease out is the growing traction that we are getting by the very heavy investment we have in technology in the auto business that\u2019s in terms of underwriting real time big data driven underwriting the creation of products for customers and dealers in this space that are very sophisticated tech-driven products that actually have real-time mass scoring of any car anywhere across the nation and the continued success that we have had in building deep dealer relationships. So, it\u2019s a particularly kind of good quarter for Capital One, but I think the impression I would leave you is the competitive meter is rising and we will have to keep an eye on that. And the other very important thing that is probably the most important thing that we all should keep in mind in this business is that the auto business has been credit performance in the \u2013 I am speaking of the industry now has been benign for a long period of time. And at the top of the list is why that is so is what has happened, what is going on with used car prices, which have been stayed at a relatively high level for a long period of time. This is a collateral driven business. I also think when you have businesses where the collateral values have been high for a long period of time, one have to \u2013 we have to ask ourselves what collateral assumptions \u2013 collateral value assumptions are underwriters making across the industry. I will tell you what we do and we assume they are going down. I can\u2019t speak for the whole industry, but I just want to put a caution that we have had good times for a long time in that business and collateral values have been an unusually strong ally and one forever. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you for that. And my very quick follow-up, Scott, is just on the tax rate it looks like it came in around 19% or so in this quarter. How should \u2013 was there anything special in this period, some true-ups or something and how should we think about the appropriate rate going forward? Scott Blackley : Yes. Let me comment on more of the full year tax rate, because that\u2019s what I would point you to the full year tax rate was about 19.5%. I would say that\u2019s a reasonable baseline. It\u2019s going to be plus or minus from there depending on the income levels evolutions in our credit, the businesses that generate tax credits, but nothing particularly large. We did have some discretes in the quarter which drove down the quarterly rate, but 19.5% is a good starting point for how you should think about the future. Jeff Norris : Thanks, Scott and thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your interest in Capital One. Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer some follow-up questions that you might have. Have a great evening everybody. Operator : Once again, that does conclude our call for today.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Matt, and welcome, everyone, to Capital One's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live on the Internet. Something that's not quite as usual in a time of social distancing, we're each webcasting from our own home, so please be patient with us if there's an occasional awkward pause or dog barking. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. Before we get into first quarter results, I'll begin tonight with an overview of COVID-19 and its impact. In roughly the last two weeks of the first quarter, the world changed abruptly as the spread of COVID-19 accelerated. Like all of you, we're watching with empathy and gratitude as people and communities take extraordinary action, care for the sick, support first responders and slow the transmission of the virus. At Capital One, we're focused on the well-being of our associates, our customers and the communities we serve, and we've fully mobilized to do our part to make an immediate positive impact. Enabled by our technology transformation, about 80% of our associates and 98% of our non-branch associates smoothly transitioned to remote working arrangements and are now securely and productively working from home. For our associates who must be at Capital One location, we've taken steps to improve social distancing, adopted flexible attendance and leave policies and increased hourly pay. For our customers, we're offering a range of forbearance options and taking steps to make it easier for banking customers to access their money while social distancing. Scott Blackley : Thanks, Rich. Capital One lost $1.3 billion or $3.10 per share in the first quarter. Net of adjusting items, our EPS loss in the quarter was $3.02, driven by a $3.6 billion allowance build. Turning to Slide 4, I'll cover the allowance in more detail. The adoption of CECL increased our allowance by $2.8 billion, as of January 1, 2020, in line with previously communicated expectations. Our first quarter allowance build of $3.6 billion consists of $2.2 billion in card, approximately $600 million in auto and approximately $700 million in commercial. We modeled several economic scenarios and then we added some judgmental overlays in determining our allowance. The most heavily weighted of these economic scenarios included a sharp increase to a peak unemployment during Q2 2020 of 9.5%, followed by an improvement into 2021. I would encourage you not to get too focused on the headline unemployment rate because it was just one of the many variables impacting our allowance. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Scott. This quarter, there is an obvious recurring theme in each of our businesses and for the company. First quarter results reflect two distinct time periods : January 1st through mid-March before COVID-19 impacts took hold; and the last two weeks of the quarter when COVID-19 drove sharp changes in many metrics and trends. Pre-COVID-19 results generally show solid momentum and strong performance on growth, credit and efficiency that have put Capital One in a strong position. Post-COVID-19 trends show a clear inflection, but there's too much uncertainty to simply extrapolate recent trends. With that context, I'll pick up on slide 10, which summarizes first quarter results for our credit card business. Pre-provision results were solid in the first quarter, with continued year-over-year growth in loans and purchase volumes. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business, which is shown on Slide 11. Domestic card ending loan balances increased 8.4% year-over-year, driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio. The emergence of COVID-19 impacts late in the quarter caused a deceleration in the growth of ending loan balance. First quarter average loans grew 11% year-over-year. First quarter purchase volume was up 8% from the first quarter of 2019, with strong growth through most of the quarter partially offset by sharp declines near the end of the quarter. By the end of the first quarter, weekly purchase volume was running at a year-over-year decline of about 30%. Consistent with industry trends, our largest declines were in travel and entertainment, restaurants and discretionary retail. These category decreases were partially offset by an increase in spending at supermarkets and discount stores. Through April 17, weekly purchase volume continues to be down about 30% year-over-year. Revenue increased 2% year-over-year. Growth in average loans was offset by lower revenue margin. The revenue margin declined 129 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any additional follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available to answer them. Matt, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you.  The first question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Good evening. Thanks for taking the call and hope everybody is safe there. Rich, I guess I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the card business as we go through the next couple of years, in particular, how to integrate the new Walmart portfolio and relationship into the business that you've got and what it means for growth in that portfolio with that customer set? Richard Fairbank : So, Betsy, good evening. The Walmart integration has really happened. And so we have a wonderful working partnership with Walmart, really exceptional. And they -- I've been struck by how much they appreciate the importance of the card in their business and in their future digital business opportunity. And so we've been optimistic for what this partnership can be. At the moment, financially, the partnership is dominated by the economics of the back book portfolio that we acquired and that's fully integrated and that's performing as expected. And we have been working very hard with Walmart to put in place the elements and the channels and the opportunities for originations. COVID-19 coming along is a bit of a challenge in the middle of this, and so probably that business will, like all of our businesses, probably be subject to some of the demand impacts and changes that I mentioned relative to what typically happens in a downturn. But we're still very focused on moving forward with them. And what I'm struck by also is the -- we take the very same perspectives on how to manage credit in this environment, where to find the opportunities. And so we'll be continuing to move forward. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, just wanted to turn to the outlook for the reserve you went through very detailed segment by segment, which is very much appreciated. Wanted to understand, how you think about that reserve as we -- as the next couple of quarters unfold. I realize the 9.5% peak unemployment is 2Q 2020, but that you put the qualitative overlays on. So how much more unemployment do you feel like you've baked into the current reserve level just so we can get a sense as to when we see the numbers come out, how we should be flexing future reserve builds, if any? Scott Blackley : Hey, Betsy, thanks for the question. I think that the -- I would start off by saying the reserve -- when we topped up the reserve at the end of the quarter, we actually didn't go and do another model run. We just did an overlay. So I can't get too precise in saying like, 'Hey, here's a specific number that I would tie to our reserve in terms of unemployment level.' And just in general, in terms of how to think about the reserve going forward, I would just say that, that may not be quite as simple as just taking the headline unemployment and tying that to the size of the allowance. I just was talking about the fact that we did do this late add to the reserve based on some of the worsening economic forecasts we had. And then the second thing I would just say is that we've got -- I think we're just going to see a lot more data in the next 90 days before we have to close the books again. And thinking about kind of the path of the country's response on the virus, how the consumer is going to react to all the stimulus, and we'll actually also have some credit data by the time we close the books next quarter, which, of course, we're going to use all those things to refine our allowance estimate. So at this point, I'd really like to see that data before I speculate on where the allowance might be added. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Thank you. So Scott, thanks for the color on the reserve build. I mean, if I look at your allowance, my personal view is that you guys took a more conservative approach, so we appreciate that. I think some of the card issuers may have a bigger reserve build next quarter. But Rich, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about loan growth and what your plans are in cards. I know, if I go back to the credit crisis, your loan growth declined significantly. And can you just provide some thoughts on stimulus in terms of what the offset might be and how we could think about that? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Thanks, Don. So the first thing that I think is striking -- well, from my experience across several downturns and then thinking about how to interpret this downturn, of course, we haven't seen anything as precipitous as this particular one. But a couple of things tend to naturally happen in cards. The lower purchase volume, obviously, very striking, particularly in this downturn at this point, but lower demand for credit, lower requests for credit line increases, and I want to pause on that because I think there is a intuitive logic people would think, well, wait a minute. When customers feel the strain of a downturn, surely, a lot of them have to be beating a path to try to get more credit. And what I've seen in the past and what we're already seeing here is that consumer behavior tends to be in general one of battening down the hatches a bit, being more conservative, increasing their savings if they have an opportunity to do that, sometimes paying down debt. Now, obviously, there's a huge gradient across customers. But I just wanted to say that our expectation and what we're seeing in a matter of weeks is something that is left on the demand side, and I think -- I would guess that during the period when consumers feel a lot of uncertainty, I think that at least for that period of time that demand will be less. It's also really quite plausible that as things settle out on the other side, consumers will still carry that cautiousness with them. We saw some of that after the Great Recession that there were some behavioral changes in that particular case. Then I want to overlay on top of that what we're doing at Capital One. We're making here very, very early and into the, sort of, free fall period of the economy. We're making choices that are right out of our playbook in downturns and certainly, I think, make a lot of sense of this downturn, tightening our extension of new credit to avoid the heightened risk of adverse selection. And then we're also pulling back on near-term marketing in response to the decreased opportunity at this very moment for quality growth. And, of course, the decreased marketing has a bit of a -- that will itself flow into a little bit on the growth side. So the combination of these natural trends and our actions put downward pressure on loan balances. Now, I really want to stress that this is a moment in time and this is how the market's reacting, the consumer is reacting and the choices we're making at this moment in time. We have really structured our business and our playbooks to be always testing and looking for inflection points and to see where the opportunities can come and we will pounce on them when they do. One other thing, I want to say is, it's not like there's going to be a single inflection point and then suddenly sort of the -- the sun is going to come out. The way opportunities will emerge, will be probably really quite sloped by product area. We found, across business lines, the sort of inflection point varied by many, many months in our business. And then it will vary by segment, probably by geography. So right now, it's the time to be cautious. And -- but we're very, very closely monitoring where opportunities and -- where and when opportunities will present themselves. Jeff Norris : Do you have a follow-up Don? Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Hope you guys are doing well. Rich, you talked about pulling back on marketing, and obviously, that wasn't as evident in the first quarter. But when we think about magnitude that you could pull back on marketing and even other expenses, could you just walk us through how you're thinking about it over the course of the period that we're going to experience this weakness as a result of COVID-19? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Let me talk about the -- let me start with the marketing first. So right now, we're pulling back in a number of areas to avoid the heightened risk of adverse selection. So these areas include some pullbacks in digital and online origination channels, direct mail; on the advertising side, certain product-oriented national advertising. At the same -- we're continuing to originate through some channels. We are -- but we're also continuing to invest in our brand, although the overall brand investment is down, and we are at full levels of marketing on our national banking side. In fact, the whole -- most of the things that are going on, the incredible importance of digital banking experiences the -- just about all of the trends are sort of consistent with an acceleration and the kind of things, we\u2019ve been looking towards consumer behavior relative to our national bank. So we\u2019re -- saw a green light on that one. So and again, I am talking moment in time and these things are lines of coming calls like I have always said, so this is not -- these are not predictions of sustained set of choices we\u2019re making. I am just sharing with you the choices that we are making in this particular phase of this downturn. So relative to expenses overall and we have wonderful momentum in our company, and in our businesses and in our tax transformation. So the very immediate choices are more around choices of credit risk in the margin, the marketing that we're doing, we are tightening up on hiring and tightly managing operating expenses as we continue to monitor the trajectory and character of this downturn. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And I appreciate slide 16, which goes through some of the commercial oil and gas portfolio exposures. But I don't know, Scott, if you could just help us think through the sensitivities around this, because we're hearing all sorts of stuff happening with the price of oil. Maybe if you could help us think about how that sort of translates into this. And also, there were lots of news articles about hedging and derivative contracts and how it affects you. Maybe you could just clear the air on that as well. Thank you. Scott Blackley : Sure. Thanks, Sanjay. So just starting off on E&P. On -- or excuse me, the energy business. So that business you see in the slides is really predominantly an exploration and production business. And when we did the allowance, we based a lot of the allowance on where the revenue stream that those producers are going to have, which is basically the forward oil prices. And even with this near -- the short-term disruption, that was all about spot prices and not so much about the longer-term prices. So I wouldn't get too worried about kind of that short-term disruption in the market. Overall, when I look at that industry and where we are and what is going on with just the incredible reduction in the use of oil and gas, I would just say this. When we set this reserve up, the significant portion of it, we added some non-specific reserves, these aren't reserves associated with specific names that are struggling. We did a pretty healthy amount of qualitative reserves, just based on the risk of a number of these names just continuing to struggle. So I feel pretty good about the level that we put in there in spite of everything that we've seen in the last several weeks. And then moving on to your other questions about kind of what is going on with the commodities. So Capital One has a business which does some commodities trading on behalf of our customers. And our net exposure to commodity price risk is de minimis. We did ask the CFTC for a temporary relief from being designated as a major swap participant, which is the lowest level in that regulatory hierarchy. And we did that mainly because there could be some -- the price volatility could move some of our positions into levels that would trigger that registration. And we really do appreciate the speed that the CFTC granted relief for us and against not having to necessarily register. However, because the request was really broadly misunderstood in the marketplace, we did notify the CFTC that we're not going to rely on that waiver, and we're going to go ahead and register if derivative volumes reach the threshold that would require us to register. I just have a couple of other comments there. So, one, our commercial bank does not engage in speculative derivative trading. Since 2015, we've provided, as I said, commodity price hedges as a service to our oil and gas customers. And then when we do these trades, we basically have back-to-back trades. We enter into a trade with our customer and we enter into an offsetting trade with Wall Street, and so we're really sitting here in a very low-risk position. And I would just say, at the moment, there's no outstanding margin calls. We reduced our risk exposure to commodities essentially to zero. And you can look in our 10-Ks and Qs and see that this is normal hedging activities. And if there's any updates there on that, we'll point that out there. But hopefully, that clears the air there. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me okay there? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay, great. Thanks. So, also on a credit question. As we think about the reserve adequacy in the card segment, if you -- I know that you indicated that it's, I think, only reserving for the proportion of the COVID-19 programs in what you actually bear the risk. But is the loss content in those programs significantly different than it is in your overall portfolio such that it will significantly skew that ratio in some way? Scott Blackley : I think that Eric, the thing I would just say there, so one, the loss sharing in those arrangements, we only recognize in our allowance and in our charge-offs our portion of the loss, and some of these loss sharing arrangements, we've talked about that the Walmart loss sharing arrangement includes significant loss sharing. And so as a consequence, we -- it really does decrease the amount of coverage that is necessary required to cover our portion of those losses. So, while the book itself may have losses that are appropriately reflective of the types of customers that are in there, we end up having a much smaller portion of losses that we recognize and our coverage levels are appropriately lower given that relationship. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay, great. Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, maybe to reframe some of the questions that had been posed. I mean, I think one of the things that the investment community is struggling with is that subsequent to the close of the quarter, I think saw economic conditions and expectations have continued to deteriorate. And so in that context, again, like how should we think directionally about the adequacy of reserves across the different products? Is there a greater likelihood of needing to do another true-up under the position, forward-looking economic expectations? Or do you feel like you had a lot -- a good enough look into April trends such that the first quarter's provision really compensated a lot of that already? Scott Blackley : Well, we did -- I mentioned this, we did make some adjustments to our modeled reserve as we closed the books in the first week of April. I really want to just emphasize that I -- we have certainly seen some scenarios, particularly economic scenarios that are more severe than what we modeled. But on the other hand, we've seen more stimulus that's been brought to bear since then as well. And I said this earlier, but I really think that we -- it is very hard for us to predict where this -- the allowance might be headed. There's such an important relationship of government stimulus and hardship programs that really are going to work to help offset some of the economic challenges that we're seeing right now. And I just -- I don't have a good sense about the allowance going to be bigger or smaller. I really just want to see a little bit more data before we have a lean in either direction. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Can everyone here me? Richard Fairbank : Yes, we can Ryan. Ryan Nash : Hey, good evening, everyone. So maybe one question and a follow-up for me. So Rich, if you look, the stock's trading at a $30 discount to tangible capital since this pandemic began on concerns that this could obviously end up eating into the capital base of the company. When I look, your 12% CET1 is amongst the highest in the industry even after building significant reserves. So when you just think about -- I know it's hard to predict at this time, but when you think about the different range of outcomes, combined with the fact that you're halting buybacks, the balance sheet sounds like it's going to be shrinking, how do you think about capital and capital progression in this kind of environment? Richard Fairbank : Well, Ryan, I think we entered this downturn, I think about the choices that we have made over the years and coming from the sort of risk management philosophy that deepened in the way this company is founded and even a number of choices that were made over the last few years, and I think we enter this downturn in a really good position. And Ryan, would it be useful possibly to the aperture of your question and sort of compare -- do a little bit of a calibration about going through the Great Recession and calibrate to how I feel about this time around? Not that we can predict this downturn, but in other words though, just thoughts about that experience and comparing some of the resilience dynamics, would that be helpful in -- my question? Ryan Nash : Well, my follow-up question was actually going to be, and I think everybody is kind of alluding to this on this call, the fact that as we see unemployment reach certain levels, there's an underlying assumption that losses are going to rise to similar amounts. So I actually think it would be helpful for you to compare and contrast this to the financial crisis. What's different? And what are the factors, whether it's the card Act or anything else that's changed across the industry that you think will make those relationships no longer hold? Richard Fairbank : Yes. So knowing, of course, that this particular downturn is so early, nobody knows how prolonged this will be, how severe it will be, what the recovery will look like, or how much government support and forbearance there will be and how it mitigates the economic effects. So with those caveats, let me talk a little bit about the marketplace as we entered the downturn, some of the things on both sides of the ledger at -- in terms of resilience levers and opportunities and then -- so let me start with the marketplace. Let me start with the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer is in much better shape than at the outset of the Great Recession. Consumer debt levels are lower on a per capita basis. Payment obligations are lower still, supported by low interest rates. The savings rate over the past few years is double what it was before the Great Recession. And we're not dealing with a structural problem in the economy like the housing sector pre-Great Recession that had to work itself out over multiple years before we could see a sustained recovery. In corporate markets, as we've mentioned in earnings calls over the last few years, there are some mounting, kind of, competitive challenges, including higher debt levels, lower interest coverage, weaker covenants, all of which feel weaker than before the Great Recession. On the other hand, the banks have been a smaller part of this trend and increasing leverage, with capital markets and non-banks taking an increasing share of this growth. At Capital One, we weathered the Great Recession very well and demonstrated the resilience of our business model. Today, we have a stronger capital position and a stronger liquidity position than we had going into the last crisis. And let me comment briefly about each of our major lending businesses. There are some offsetting factors that impact the resilience of our card business relative to the last downturn. The Card Act has leveled the playing field but it has negatively impacted resilience by banning the repricing of existing balances. And changes to accounting rules now dramatically amplify the volatility of allowance, although this doesn't change the underlying resilience of our lending portfolios. And, of course, there, we're talking about both FAS 166, 167 and CECL. And our returns, while still very strong are somewhat lower than they were prior to the Great Recession. We have changed the mix of our portfolio, reducing our exposure to high balance revolvers and significantly growing our spender business at the top of the market and building a stronger customer franchise across the portfolio. And we built loss sharing into most of our partnership deals, which improves our resilience. In the auto business, we have lower charge-offs, higher returns, a strong franchise built one deep dealer relationship at a time and a more resilient strategy. Our commercial business did exceptionally well in the Great Recession, but was aided by a business mix and a geography that did not get severely impacted during the downturn. Our commercial portfolio was still in a developing stage in '08. It looks pretty different today. We've exited or reduced exposure to several less resilient segments like small ticket commercial mortgages and equipment finance. We've invested in building specialty businesses to generate better risk-adjusted returns. And we've increased noncredit revenues significantly. But we think the overall commercial sector is in worse shape as companies have taken on more debt and increased leverage. And the creditor protections have gotten weaker and borrowers have used more aggressive add-backs to inflate earnings. Now again, that's not mostly a description of what's happened to bank lending, but really to lending in the broader marketplace, which, of course, impacts banks as well. Of course, no two downturns are the same and we get to look at the Great Recession in hindsight, and that's of course, 2020. At this point, we know very little about how the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impacts will play out. We know, of course, that the onset was more abrupt and that the initial worsening is likely to be steeper, faster and deeper. We also know that the downturn is being met with a more rapid and much bigger fiscal -- particularly, fiscal and monetary intervention, the largest fiscal intervention we've seen since the Great Depression. We know that forbearance is available to customers on a much greater scale than it was last time around. So our strategy in the face of the current challenges and uncertainties is to aggressively manage credit and resilience from a decision-making point of view because downside risks can be nonlinear. We take a very cautious approach at this very moment, while the economy is descending. Also though, while very proactively positioning for opportunities that may emerge on the other side of this, and that's why we've said we're tightening our extension of new credit with a real eye toward the probably high adverse selection that would be -- is prevailing out there and pulling back on near-term marketing, tightly managing expenses and being really ready to be responsive as this downturn evolves and knowing that we need to evaluate that on a segment-by-segment basis across our business. So pulling way up, Ryan, we feel really good about the choices that we made over the years. We feel very good across liquidity capital and credit resilience choices as we entered the downturn. With the tech transformation, we've been able to have a company that can move very quickly. And I feel very good about where we are. It's hard to predict exactly what will happen here. But I think the choice is I wouldn't change just about any -- I really wouldn't change any of the choices. Knowing where we are now, I would not change the choices we made leading up to this and I really like our chances. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Maybe Rich or Scott, could you give us just a little bit of a little more detail about the specific forbearance programs that you have in card and auto? In particular, how long they might last and what the take-up has been in terms of -- has it peaked? Can you talk a little bit about that in a little more detail? Rich Fairbank : Yes, Moshe. So for card customers who enroll, we are allowing them to just give one payment with no late fee on a month-to-month basis. Interest continues to accrue. And as of April 17, as we said, 1% of active accounts have received assistance, representing 2% of balances. For auto, customers can skip one to two payments with initial interest continuing to accrue and payments added to the end of the loan. And I want to comment there. When I say things are monthly or every two months, this is not like that's their only chance, but we wanted to give ourselves more flexibility to evaluate the situation, knowing how fast things are changing. But it's certainly likely that customers who are on a monthly program will be extended if the opportunity calls for that. And as we've said before, as of April 17, 9% of customers have received assistance, representing 11% of balances. It's striking as we look between auto and card how much higher the requests are on the auto side. And I think that while it's striking, I don't think it's necessarily surprising. We have found, in fact, across our businesses if a -- you can see visually that the size of the payment amount is a key driver of the number of requests that we get. And of course, auto payments are typically much higher than credit card minimum payments. And the other reason, of course, is that in auto, the stakes are higher for the customer. They're very motivated to make sure that they can keep their car. Moshe Orenbuch : Got you. And as a follow-up, maybe could you just talk a little bit about -- you talked about the things you're doing to tighten in the card business. Any changes that you would either think about making or see within the industry with respect to competitiveness of rewards and the kind of products you might see as we -- the next several quarters as we kind of put -- one hopes come out of this process. Richard Fairbank : Well, I think we -- the rewards marketplace was very competitive in terms of offers and early spend bonus and things like that, but it kind of settled out into an equilibrium. With purchase volumes down and probably for most card issuers, some tightening up in this very moment. I don't think we would -- I think that I would expect the competitiveness to be, in terms of products and product offers, to be probably stable. The intensity of the competition is probably going to lighten up just probably because people are going to cut back on marketing. And certain of the products, when you think about it, for the reward industry and for Capital One, are oriented towards the things that people aren't able to do right now; travel, entertainment, dining, and a lot of things like that. So, I think that this will be a period where I think issuers will be focused on meeting the needs of their customers and be planning for opportunities when things change. And opportunities can emerge much sooner than the entire economy recovering. Again, as I said, this is a segment by segment and situation by situation kind of thing. So, we're already working to figure out where opportunities, individual opportunities can be there, possibly even that have become bigger opportunities because of the situation the world is in. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Good evening. We've seen other banks this quarter generally set their reserves at levels sufficient to cover about 50% on average of cumulative losses contemplated in their severely adverse scenarios under DFAST. Can you share any thoughts on why you guys might differ on this metric? Scott Blackley : Yes, Bill, thanks for the question. So, obviously, there are different scenarios, that's a starting point. I won't go into all of the differences there. But just kind of a few points as you think about, if you're calibrating us against others. The first is that when you think about our allowance versus the way the Fed models DFAST, one of the issues that impacts that comparison is that the Fed uses industry average recovery rates. And as I mentioned last quarter, our practice is to work recoveries, which results in a longer tail, and that's really important under CECL because in CECL, you take the undiscounted recoveries as an allowance offset. So our CECL recoveries, I believe, are going to be quite a bit higher versus the Fed and their industry average recovery rates. The second point I would make is that when these partnerships that we talked about that have loss sharing arrangements, that meaningfully reduces the losses that are attributable to Capital One. And we only have to allow for our portion of those losses in our allowance and in our provision. And so that is how we do our resilience and modeling processes. While we don't have visibility into the Fed modeling approaches, I don't think that the Fed necessarily gives us credit in DFAST for that offset because they've historically not collected all the data necessary to make those adjustments. So just a couple of factors that you should consider in terms of how we sit relative to others. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Good afternoon. Thank you taking my questions. First one is, I'm just -- I'm trying to think through how stimulus might be different this time. I mean, if you think about it, there was some information put out in the Wall Street Journal today that for a lower income worker stimulus, to the extent they have unemployment, either is a pay increase for a period of time for them, whereas for a prime consumer undergoing unemployment and receiving benefits of the CARES Act, it's still a substantial decrease in compensation for a while. How do you guys think through that in terms of relative performance in your non-prime book versus your prime book this go around? Richard Fairbank : John, the -- I think the -- what's striking about the fiscal stimulus here, where there are many things probably striking to all of us about it. But when we've gone back and specifically calibrated to the Great Recession, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I was struck by the fact that the benefits for those who get like unemployment benefits, the unemployment benefits are higher. It's across the -- across a range of relevant incomes, the entire line is higher and the eligibility is significantly higher. So those two things are -- it's hard to quantify how much of an impact that will be because no one can quantify how much of an impact it was the last time. But intuitively, I think that effect can have quite a bit of impact in a good way on people's ability to weather their individual storms and make it to the other side. With respect to subprime versus prime, the first thing I always say is, I think if I showed you the -- by income, if I -- prime or you take, prime and subprime, you've got at the top of the market, there tends to be some very high income folks. But I think you would be surprised that there's not as much slope as one might think relative to things like income on -- across our business as you move along the credit spectrum. There is some slope, but not all that much. All of that said, though, the fact that I think the government is working hard to create a safety net for people who don't necessarily have all of the buffers some people might have in life and the fact that that net is extending wider and broader -- or deeper, I think that that will -- should have a pretty positive benefit for consumers and their ability to, among other things, pay their bills and their credit card bills. And I do want to say that while it's only a small number of days of data, we could see in our payment rate, some -- a spike-up around the time -- those individual checks were coming in. So that could be a short-term thing, but that would be confirmatory of the intuition that we would have. John Hecht : Okay, that's very helpful color. And then a separate question is tied to the stay-at-home situation or have you seen any different types of behavioral action, given the  digital bank\u2026 Jeff Norris : Hey, John, I'm sorry. John, I'm sorry to interrupt you. You're breaking up. We can't understand the question. Can you\u2026 John Hecht : You guys hear me now? Jeff Norris : It's better. John Hecht : Okay. The question, as we've been on  type of environment for a while, have you seen any behavioral change with respect to interaction with your consumer bank? And -- pretty heavily in that opportunity. Jeff Norris : John, I'm so sorry. Let's try one more time and then we might have to move on. But\u2026 Richard Fairbank : Well, John, were you saying -- given that we've invested heavily on our consumer bank in terms of the digital side of the business, are we seeing anything particular there? Would that be close to the question that you have? John Hecht : Yes, particularly given that we're stay-at-home situation and you're going to have a greater opportunity to interact with the digital -- over the digital channel. Richard Fairbank : Well, an interesting thing is, we are probably in the best position in America to have a calibration about -- because we not only have a digital bank, we also have a branch-based bank in some of our geographies as well, and so we certainly can see the calibration. There is -- look, the first thing I would say is there certainly are a core of customers who still need and want to -- well, they very much want to use the bank, and we've been able to keep most of our branches open by -- like 75% of them by having drive-through and some glass windows for some social separation. So we've certainly seen a continued volume there. But if I pull up, I think that this moment is some people say they predict, gosh, people will have very different behaviors on the other side of this moment. I'll make a different prediction. I think this is going to be an accelerant to the behaviors that we were all, as a society, heading for anyway. And the advantage, I think, that the banks who have really driven their customers to digital and built the capabilities that can help a customer pretty much do everything digitally, It was always where the world's going, but I think it's just an acceleration of -- the bell curve shifted in terms of, I think, the number of folks. This is me talking more intuitively than empirically. But this is why I said earlier when I talked about, we're going to keep our foot on the gas with respect to the marketing and the investment in our national banking strategy because, of course, what that is -- as I've often called it, we're trying to build the bank of the future. And I think that years in the evolution of America and consumer behavior possibly just got compressed here. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Rick Shane : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Two questions. First, in the past, you talked about a 25 basis point benefit from the loss sharing in the Walmart agreement throughout 2020. I'm wondering if there's any cap on that or how much we could expect that to flex as charge-offs rise related to COVID-19? Richard Blackley : Hey Rick, how are you. Look, as you think about Walmart, we did talk about a 25 basis point impact to delinquencies and on an ongoing basis, about that same level going forward. And I think that there's -- yes, we could absolutely see variability in the impact of that to the total, just given movements in the loss rates of either part of that calculation. I would anticipate them to be relatively small because the loss sharing is so significant with Walmart, but it's -- it could move up a bit and still not really impact our overall loss rate all that much. But there's not a cap in the contract, if by chance, you were asking that, so this loss share is on a percentage basis and it will stay that way. Rick Shane : Okay, great. And then, Rich for you, look, you're a serious student of human behavior. And I'm curious what you have seen in terms of consumer behavior so far that has surprised you the most. Rich Fairbank : I'm not sure anything has been surprising, I'm certainly struck by. Here's the thing that's interesting about this particular downturn. Almost all other downturns -- most other downturns have the following characteristics. They kind of happen on little cat feet and then things start picking up, but it's a slow kind of descent into that. And the other thing is, so often, there are structural problems. This is an economy point, but structural problems in market that sort of bleed to that. And then the resolution of it needs to fix those structural problems on the way to fixing all the other problems that come from it. So I think what's so extraordinary about this is the just swiftness of this thing and the fact that it's really the entire world going through this and the sort of vertical descent from an economy point of view, that happened so quickly. So things that I'm struck by on the consumer behavior side, I have been really struck at the early behaviors that I see that are consistent with the model that we have believed -- in fact, let me back up for a second and say, there's a saying that I used to -- that I've said for years, is that consumers are a lot more rational than the institutions who serve them, including the financial institution who's served them often over the years. I have always been struck over the years, despite all the things that are written and speculated about consumers, just how rational they are. And so I was struck during the Great Recession at their rationality. There was some irrationality before the Great Recession. This time around, the consumer was in a solid, very balanced shape going into this downturn. And the little things that I have seen, behaviors on the savings side, on our bank side, behaviors on the payment side, the purchase volume side, even on the delinquency side of things, and what I see is a rational consumer and I think that what we all should think about as we calibrate to any other recession. This is a downturn that came to the whole world right at once and it's a downturn without a bad guy. That's the other part of this thing. And so what's the implications of a downturn without a bad guy is it's a lot easier politically to mobilize solutions. For consumers, that's a political and economic point, but I think that is going to be a good guy in this downturn and its resilience. The other thing -- the other final thing I'll say about human behavior or the behavior that we've certainly seen, I am amazed, I'll talk about our company. This is really a point about consumers; it's a point about people. I am amazed how productive people are, and we just did an associate, it's an all associate survey and engagement and morale is still at very high levels. People are all in, they're engaged, and the productivity is extraordinary from people working from home. It doesn't mean that everybody, when the world opens up, everybody is going to just stay home. But I think that back to my earlier point, I think there's a compression in years in the learnings and the behaviors associated with digital. And I think every company's going to walk away from this experience struck by the extraordinary productivity that -- or certainly most companies or certainly ones that are digitally in a good position by what just happened on the productivity side and that is some learnings for all of us there. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And our final question will come from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran : I know the call's gone long, but just on the OpEx, totally understand pulling the target, given how much flux there is. But on the core effort of moving to the cloud and retiring the data centers, is any part of that core expense dollar effort and timing changed? Or is it more just revenues in flux, maybe some call center volumes and stuff like that? Has the data center strategy changed at all, I guess, is the crux of the question? Richard Fairbank : No, not a single bit. I mean, we are incredibly well served by our move to the cloud, the ability to scale up for some extraordinary things that have happened, so many things. So, the cloud strategy, the technology transformation, everything about it, we felt this experience is validating. With respect to the data center exit itself; we are on the very same timing of later this year. I mean, we are already fully in the cloud. So, what -- but the data centers are still open because there is -- you think once you get out, well, then you just -- you're done but there is a period of much of a year to actually do all the wind down activities associated with the data center. So, we're 100% in the cloud, and the wind down is going right on schedule and we're talking later this year and the associated economic benefit of those moves. Jeff Norris : Okay. Well, I think that wraps it up for this evening. Thank you for staying with us. Thank you for joining us on the conference call today, and thank you for your interest in Capital One. The Investor Relations team will be available later this evening to answer any further questions. Have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our call for today.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Capital One Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period . Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Matt, and I'd like to also welcome everyone to Capital One's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live on the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log onto Capital One's Web site, capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2020 results. Scott Blackley : Thanks, Jeff. Capital One recorded a net loss for the second quarter of $918 million or $2.21 per diluted common share, primarily driven by $2.7 billion allowance build, reflecting the economic downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusting items impacted operating expenses during the quarter and totaled $276 million or $0.60 a share, including the provision for legal matters, as well as costs related to our cyber incident. Net of these adjusting items, our EPS was a loss of $1.61 per share. Turning to Slide 4, I'll cover the allowance in more detail. The second quarter allowance build of $2.7 billion consists of $1.7 billion in card, $668 million in auto and $330 million in commercial. Our allowance is based primarily on an economic forecast derived from the consensus of third-party economists. That forecast includes unemployment in the second quarter of 16.9%, falling to 11.5% at the end of 2020 and gradually improving over the course of 2021 and at 8.1%. Of course, our strong credit performance so far shows that the normal relationship between unemployment and consumer credit has been significantly altered by lending hardship programs and especially by government stimulus, including direct consumer support through the CARES Act. Looking ahead, in our allowance we've assumed no such benefit from further stimulus beyond the residual benefits of the existing legislation, which starts running out after July. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on Slide 10, which summarizes second quarter results for our credit card business. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic drove second quarter results across all of our business segments. In our credit card business, loan balances, purchase volume and revenue, declined year over year. And as Scott just discussed, we posted a significant allowance build. Credit card segment results are a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Domestic card ending loan balances shrink by $3.6 billion or 3% year-over-year, while average loans declined 1%. Excluding the impact of the Walmart portfolio acquisition, ending loans shrink by around 10% year-over-year while average loans were down about 8%. Purchase volume for the quarter declined 15.5% compared to the prior year quarter. Looking at weekly trends, the year-over-year decline in purchase volume was down 32% in the second week of April and has since rebounded. Over the last three weeks ended July 17, the year-over-year decline has averaged just 3%. Total company net interchange revenue for the second quarter was down about 18% year-over-year. The declines in loan balances and purchase volume are a result of several factors; the broader effects of the pandemic, consumers behaving rationally in response to the COVID economic shutdown and our choices to pull back in marketing and tightened underwritings. As they've done in prior downturns, consumers are pulling in their spending and paying down balances. This cautious behavior is an important driver of both declining volumes and our strong credit performance. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As always as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question with a single follow up. If you have any follow up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Matt, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you . Our first question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions, just first off I wanted to understand a little bit about the folks who had enrolled but are no longer enrolled. You have those nice charts on auto and the domestic card. And I wanted to understand the folks that have rolled off. What has their payment history been like and what are you anticipating over the next quarter from them? Richard Fairbank : So, Betsy, the no longer enrolled population includes all customers who have either made a payment, or completed a billing cycle following the forbearance period and have not re-enrolled. As such, it is mostly customers who have resumed regular payment patterns but also includes a much smaller group of customers who have not resumed paying us and are advancing in or toward delinquency. You get visibility to customers in that situation through our normal delinquency reporting. Betsy Graseck : And so my follow-up is the delinquencies look really good this quarter, and we see it every month obviously, when you give us update on the managed data. So, I guess I'm wondering, why you think there's that disconnect? And given the 11% reserve ratio you already have set aside against card and the low level of delinquencies you have. Do you see much in the way of reserve build in 3Q versus 2Q? Scott Blackley : Betsy, why don't we work backwards and I'll go to your question on the allowance. With the allowance from here, it's really going to depend on some of the major drivers of our reserve build in the quarter. I talked about those being our economic scenario and our approach to stimulus. And I feel like those have both a conservative bias when I look at them at this point. So, I would say that I feel very good about the allowance that we've got today given what we've seen since the end of the quarter. But in the future, I think it's going to come down to if the economic outlook and forecasts get worse then that would lead to an allowance build. And then on the other side of that, all else being equal, if we did see more stimulus that would be a positive to the allowance and we could see an offset to the potential effects of the economic scenario that we built the allowance on this quarter. So, I don't have a specific guide for you as to whether we think it's going to be going up or down. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of what may drive it in the future. Operator : Next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So, maybe first from the dividend. So looks like the capacity to keep the dividend was higher for 3Q. So I guess, are you factoring in the income test staying in place beyond this quarter and do you expect to maintain the dividend beyond this quarter? And then I guess second, if you did maintain the $0.10, it does seem like there's a pretty sizable bounce back in earnings for the back half of the year. So, can you maybe just clarify what's been baked in. And just lastly, how quickly do you think you could reinstate the dividend? Thanks. And I have a follow up. Richard Fairbank : Thanks Ryan, and that was about four questions built into one, but let me give a couple of thoughts. So on the $0.10 dividend, I think if you did the math, which is based off of net income, technically I think we could pay about $0.13 dividend this quarter. We rounded down to a dime and of course that's subject to you know our Board approving that at some point in the future. And in terms of looking forward with Q4 at this point, I honestly don't know how the fed rules are going to play out into the fourth quarter. We don't know how that income limitation test is going to work if they're going to continue it on, you know that they've instituted a fall stress test for all of the 33 banks in CCAR. So, I'm not going to give a guide on where the dividend is going to be next quarter. We're committed to continuing to have a dividend. I appreciate how important that is to a number of our owners. And then I would just say with respect to earnings, you know we do have a net loss for the three cumulative quarters ended Q2, I think that we would need to make over $1.1 billion next quarter in order to pay dividends, whether or not that's going to happen. And I think it\u2019s going to be really largely driven on what happens with the allowance, and I just talked about some of the drivers there. So, I don't mean to not be specific as to whether or not we're going to pay it. But I would just leave you with, we are committed to doing the best we can to make sure that we preserve the dividend. Ryan Nash : Got it. And I'll try to be briefer in my second one. So, I guess, Rich, you know if you think about it. You have a bird's eye view of the most impacted verticals, consumer via card and auto, commercial including oil and gas and some high impacted commercial real estate. Could you rank order for us to just talk about your concerns in each of the asset classes where you're feeling better or worse relative to three months ago? And then second you talked about forbearing helping in the near term. Can you just maybe help us understand how to think about that historical relationship between unemployment and losses? Because it seems like you're reserving for a lot of historical relationships coming to fruition. But clearly, we could see benefits from the forbearance, helping customers make payments as you\u2019ve showed in the slide. Richard Fairbank : So on a little comparison here. Let me start with how the various parts of our business, the industries we're in entered the downturn. Our consumer business is the industries we felt that were particularly healthy, the card business I'd put at the top of the list in terms of a rational industry conservative underwriting by the players there. And the consumer was also, given how long in the tooth the downturn was, the consumer was still acting very rationally as well. So, all of those things are very different from the great recession and how we entered it, the industry entered that one. The auto business I'd give it pretty high marks going in for similar reasons and pretty strong consumer in a competitive environment that always kind of amplified and volatized, if you will, by dealer being an intermediary in the middle but pretty rational. We were concerned much more about the commercial business, because of practices, credit practices and behaviors, underwriting behaviors that we saw mostly outside of the banking industry in the institutional marketplace, but which it\u2019s hard to avoid having that impact, the commercial banking part of the business as well. So, since then to me the thing that I'm most struck by is how strong yet again the consumers steps up and the rationality of the consumer I\u2019m so struck by. The pulling back on purchases, savings rates going way up, payment rates, which also are kind of a hidden factor in slowing down growth, the flip side of good credit, those behaviors have just been very apparent across our consumer lending businesses. And I've always throughout my three decades of doing this, building this company, been very struck by how rational the consumer is and we see that there. The huge sort of elephant in the room on the consumer side and it's an elephant on the commercial side, as well as what happens to government stimulus. And I just think a lot of things have lined up that have softened the impact for consumers, even really those who have been unemployed. And so, we are seeing this great paradox of extraordinary credit performance in the middle of the worst economy metrics in our lifetimes. So, I think that's a hard one to prognosticate where it goes from here but I give really high marks to the strength of the consumer and I see solid continuing underwriting behavior by competitors in that marketplace. Commercial is really a blend of so many different marketplaces. And so while we have a lot of -- there's a lot of healthy industries we're in and where do we look with concern at the top of our list is energy, which is already taking it on the chin before the downturn, and is now struggling now even more so with what's happening to oil prices. The places that, other places of course in commercial real estate hotel, we have very small exposure there that's not a good area. We're pleased that we dialed back a lot on our retail CRE exposure. So, we feel quite good there. We have an eye out on the multifamily side just for the, what happens with the forbearance programs. For example, in New York, we're coming to the end of the 90-day moratorium on evictions and the increased unemployment pay. So, I think there's uncertainty there. So, it's a tale of a lot of different cities and commercial. But if I pull way up, I'm just -- every month as we go through the downturn with strong credit performance that's one more month of progress and it limits, it lessens the extent of the downside and the rest of the pandemic. But we've got the big wild card as we referred to, you see it reflected in our allowance build. And therefore, we're managing in a very dichotomous situation here that is quite extraordinary to experience. Operator : Next question will come from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. Rick Shane : I'm really struck by the difference between the utilization of the customer assistance programs on the auto side and the card side. Is that a reflection in the current environment of the utility of the credit card versus the utility of card, or is it a function of the amortizing nature of auto loans versus the minimum payment ability on a card? Richard Fairbank : I think it is, there are several things going on. And you see this effect to Capital One and you can also see it across the industry. There's just naturally a lot more ambient demand or forbearance programs in the auto business than there is in cards. By the way, you could also add mortgage into that comment that there's a lot of demand there. So, one fundamental reason is that auto payments are typically much higher than card minimum payment. And so, they're just more likely to be beyond the reach of a given customer whose income is disrupted. And within both businesses, not just as we compare across the two businesses but within both businesses, we've seen a strong correlation between demand for forbearance programs and the size of the payment due. The second reason I think also in that auto the stakes are higher for the customer and they're very motivated to make sure that they can keep the car. So, we're not surprised by these differences. One thing that I think is just a point, an investor point here is that because a relatively small number of our card customers have in fact raised their hand to obtain to programs, and so many of them are already getting out of this. I think you're able to have a really clear, pretty darn clear window into the credit performance of Capital One, even inclusive of the forbearance programs. It's a little harder to, because the auto forbearance numbers are larger, it's not quite as clear in terms of where the credit numbers overtime will go, even though we are certainly very bullish about how well the program is performing. But I think what I kind of feel investors, they're little bit throwing their hands up and say in a period of with all this forbearance going on in individual companies, how are we able to read the credit metrics. I think, there is a high level of clarity on the card side in particular at the moment. Rick Shane : And that actually segues perfectly into my follow up, which is that when we look then at the reserve or the allowance levels for each of the products, the implied loss frequency on card is substantially higher. Is the way to think of the longer this persists there is more embedded risk in the card portfolio? Richard Fairbank : Well, I think that the loss rates on card are higher, because it's a unsecured product. Rick, I also think that when it comes to the auto business, we have fairly high levels of recovery on the collateral there. And then in the reserving that we've done this particular quarter in auto, a portion of that was actually driven by the growth that we saw there. So, I think they're just different asset classes with different characteristics and certainly the average card book has higher losses than what we see in our auto book. Operator : The next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess I have a two part question or two questions on preprovision earnings. Scott, maybe you could just outline how you see the NIM and revenue unfolding over the course of the year, and maybe any other mitigation efforts you might have? And then secondly, as far as loan growth is concerned, Rich talked about the improving trends in purchase volume. You've also had some of the other auto finance players talking about OEM production increasing and that might lead to no dealer inventory to sell and loan growth. Could you just talk about broadly sort of loan growth as it unfolds over the rest of the year? Scott Blackley : So Sanjay, I'll start off on some thoughts around NIM. And you know, it certainly feels like NIM is kind of at the low end of where I would expect it should be for our company. And there's a few factors driving that, which I talked about in my comments and talking points. But if you think about where that might be going in the future, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we're working really hard to continue to deploy more of our cash into higher yielding investments, whether that's the investment portfolio where I think we can put some work there, offsetting wholesale funding, maturities, those are some examples. But candidly given the current rate environment where we are in this downturn, I would anticipate that cash levels are going to remain high until we start to see some stabilization there. So, we'll try to make some progress but I don't think we'll be able to really change that dramatically. On the asset mix effects, certainly the decreasing card this quarter was a big headwind on our net interest margin. I think depending on what happens with our opportunities in the market, where we feel comfortable continuing to step in, those will be major drivers of what happens to NIM going forward. And then on the deposit side, I think the benchmark rates have fallen more than what we've seen in our pricing. And as Rich talked about in his talking points, some of our pricing actions happened late in the quarter. So, we'll see the full benefit of those coming through next quarter, which should be a tailwind for NIM. I also think that we're starting to see datas accelerating across the industry and I think there's probably more opportunities for continuing to price down deposits at this point in the cycle. So, that's kind of where I see NIM going from here. On loan growth outlook, I think that that that is a bit of a question mark about how this pandemic plays out and where we see opportunities. We've obviously found that there's some great opportunities in auto in ways that we feel comfortable with our origination strategy and what we're seeing in there. With respect to card, there's certainly pockets where we think we can continue to acquire new accounts. And we'll have to see how payment rates play out, because that's a major driver in what happens with outstandings. We've seen great credit, part of that is high payment rates. The flip side of that is that that has a tendency to drive down outstanding. So, on low growth, I think that we're a little bit kind of looking at what is available in the market is going to drive our behavior. And it\u2019s a time now to be to be cautious but we also are always looking for opportunities to take advantage of spots where we see the market available to us. Operator : And our next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : I know there's some concern around economic weakness in the south and southwest more recently. Have you seen anything that would suggest there's some pressure? And also the forbearance and cards, looks like it maybe have ticked up a little bit. Just curious if that's continuing to hold steady? Scott Blackley : So Don, we have not seen any big geographical effects. We certainly are on the lookout for them. I think the government stimulus and the forbearance that's generally going on in the industry has sort of moderated credit issues broadly across all the geographies. With respect to forbearance, there's a reasonable amount of variation by state in a way that's intuitive given the differential impact of the virus so far. So for example, in our card business, Florida, New Jersey, New York, certainly, earlier on have been states with some of the highest enrollment rate. So, the forbearance thing it matches intuition pretty closely. Richard Fairbank : Don, just one more comment on your question about regional differences. A lot of the information that we're looking at tends to be backward looking. And so as this pandemic is evolving, we haven't seen anything specific with the south or the southwest just yet, that may be because we're looking at backward facing data and there may be more coming. Don Fandetti : And then I guess, you'd mentioned there's no additional stimulus built into your reserve build. The $600 extra average weekly unemployment is pretty material. Would you agree that that could have a material impact on your charge-offs if that were not extended? Richard Fairbank : Well, that's a big part of why our allowance builds have been the size that they are is that we had certainly seen that there has been an effective income replacement with a lot of the unemployment benefits that you talked about, as well as just other direct-to-consumer stimulus. And to the extent that that unemployment isn't offset with other programs or even forbearance, our allowance is built on a premise that that would translate into higher losses at some point in the future. Operator : Next question will comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Rich or Scott, my question is about the loss curve. My own model is showing an very unusual shape which is as, it\u2019s pretty flat to the third quarter and stairs up higher in the fourth as some of the deferral actions have been. And then set functions higher again in the second quarter of next year when the deferral on the assumption that some of those deferred cash flows are going to service other kinds of debt. Could you just give me a sense of about your own view of the loss curve looks like and whether it looks unusual relative to\u2026 Jeff Norris : Eric? Excuse me, Eric. I'm so sorry. We're having a great deal of difficulty understanding you. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. Can you hear me better now? Jeff Norris : It's still a little muddled. I'm so sorry. Eric Wasserstrom : Is it any better now? That's much better. Jeff Norris : Okay. Sorry about that. My question was just about your expectations for the shape of the loss curve, whether in fact it still looks like a curve or more like a step function at different levels of forbearance, whether it's your own or whether it's things like GSE forbearance, which may influence how other asset classes perform. Richard Fairbank : Eric, one of the challenges that we faced in our allowances this exact point that you're bringing up. We've got a delinquency inventory that has incredibly low delinquency embedded in it right now and an unemployment forecast that's suggesting that that's got to normalize at some point. How that's going to workout I think is going to really depend on what happens with stimulus. If we do see some of this stimulus just suddenly drop-off, I think we will see some clip function around that starting to translate into delinquencies. Whether or not how forbearance impacts that, I'm sure that there will be some tempering with forbearance that will continue on in those periods. But I would anticipate that the lack of stimulus would be the major driver in terms of where loss curves would look like here in overtime if those benefits weigh off. Eric Wasserstrom : And then my follow-up is just on OpEx. Rich, obviously good to hear about the reinstation of the, the reinstatement of the efficiency target. But has there been any change or incremental actions or anything incremental to the prior target that you're looking at given the current circumstances? Richard Fairbank : So, Eric, there are natural forces in a sharp downturn like this that pressure the revenue trajectory. Certainly, with the purchase volume declines the demand for card loans drop and interest rates fall. So, we certainly, the pressure is certainly coming on the revenue side. So, in terms of what we're doing, the actions that we're taking, we talked about we're tightening our extension of new credit. We\u2019re pulling back on marketing. And these things naturally put pressure on loan growth. So, kind of to your point. So what we're, first of all on the revenue side, we, it's not a binary thing to us that where there\u2019s a downturn so therefore, one hunkers down. We have a lot of experience over all these years living through downturns. We have to us, all of our choices are very, very segment and micro segments specific. So there's going to be a real gradient with respect to how we lean into those opportunities in this environment. But I don't want to leave the impression that we're just totally in hunker down mode until the pandemic end. But what we have done is we kind of started the downturn with a pretty broad pullback as the world was kind of in physical free fall. And then we have really carefully assessed by segment what are we getting as, what kind of information we have that can help us predict how consumers are going to do in this particular pandemic? What are we seeing with respect to adverse selection, or in few cases maybe even some paradoxical positive selection that you sometimes see in a downturn like this. So, our energy is particularly focused on the response, the differential response we're doing during the pandemic and leveraging the information we have, including the ability to get a bunch of information in real time, because of our tech transformation in order to find some good revenue opportunities. On the expense, side we have really tightened up on hiring. For example, that's a very natural thing to do and we have done that. We are meeting very frequently, just working on overall how can we manage our expenses really tightly. And this is all in the context where we still importantly making the necessary investments to manage the pandemic response. We don't want to certainly cut back on that. We still expect to benefit from the exit of the data centers. Later this year, all of that is unaffected by the pandemic. And of course, in terms of the total efficiency ratio, the reduction in marketing is a good guy for total efficiency ratio. So, when we look at what it was that drove us to target to 42% annual operating efficiency ratio. All of those same factors and the things happening with our business model and the success in technology and all of that, all of that is still entirely intact with respect to the business model. This is all about timing at this point. And so, we've pulled back on the timing of our commitment to that target. But the energy and what led us to achieve the kind of success we have on the efficiency side, what led us to achieve the tech success and all the things that had gotten us where we are on the credit side, all of that energy is we're all in on that. Operator : Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : I guess Scott or Rich, could you talk a little bit about when you think about the level of reserves going forward. You talked a lot about, Scott talked a lot about stimulus a couple of times. But assuming that that's going to be one item that when you think about changes, is it going to be changes in unemployment? Or how much can the consumer behavior that you've seen that's a positive impact your kind of expectation for how much reserves are needed? Or is it just going to be based on that employment level? Scott Blackley : Well, I think Moshe, thus far, a lot of the consumer behavior is driving what we're seeing in terms of credit performance. So that's a huge part of it some of that stimulus but I think some of it is just disciplined behavior by consumers and by a lot of our competitors in the industry. As I think about going forward, I do think that as I talked about earlier. I think stimulus is going to be a major driver of what happens with the reserve. But I do believe that the consumer had that experience from the financial crisis. A lot of wisdom that has been learned there. And we've seen a lot of discipline in that regard. So, I'm not sure that as I think about where the allowances going while unemployment is going to be a major driver, I think that some of the other factors that we've talked about and Rich mentioned several of them in his talking points, are going to be important offsets there in terms of what might happen in terms of good relationship between unemployment and the credit losses as we go forward. Moshe Orenbuch : And following up on the previous question about marketing, I mean, it's kind of pretty stark if you think about. You probably have, I don't know, north of a 60% decline in credit card marketing in the quarter and you've got volumes actually up double digits in auto. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the two markets that kind of make that the right way to go right now? And what would make you want to start marketing again more activity in the card space? Richard Fairbank : So Moshe, let me just talk a little bit about auto and then move to credit card. So, we actually in both card and auto, our first response was to tighten underwriting and we have had a tighter credit box in both of the businesses. There are number of things happening in the auto business that sort of are causing better high-quality volume to come Capital One's way even with the tighter credit box. And so, we're scrutinizing very, very carefully with everything about what we see in this volume and the early performance. But, I wouldn't underestimate the importance of the digital capabilities that we have that have been helpful during the pandemic. But we'll have to see what competition does overtime. And we're going to again really, really carefully scrutinize what comes in. There's also in the auto side particularly in certain segments of the business ability to have a lot more information in real time, which can allow one to have more clarity on the customer's condition, situation and with better guess then on how they may perform. So on the card side, typically in underwriting there is less information available in unsecured loan of course. And we\u2019re even at a time where the reliability of credit bureau information is likely less over this period of time, just because of certain things about companies not reporting on forbearance during this period of time. So, that also make things a little bit more challenging. Now the flip side of that, Moshe, for us where we have been, we always talk about the origination lever and the credit line lever are two separate decisions. And we've always said that the real, for a lot of our business, the real exposure comes on the credit line side, not really the origination side. So, we have been more leaning in on the origination side and the conservatism has particularly come with respect to credit lines. And as you know from having watched us manage that through time, we're trying to continue to build the potential energy as carried by the originating new accounts, hold back for the time being on the credit line and then trying to get as much information as we can on each customer and watching very carefully their situation, pick -- over time really open up on the credit lines. But the loan growth will come more on the credit line side and that is a level and a dial that we're going to be managing along the way during the downturn. So, the net effect of all of that is something that ends up with, you know, at this point higher volumes in card. And then the final point I want to make is the relationship of course between marketing and all this, because you know dial backs in marketing tend to therefore generate lower volume. So, what early on in the downturn like most of the other players, we dialed back in marketing. What we are doing is like everything is not a one size fits all, but it's going to be a sloped level of marketing by channel, by segment, by product. But we're hopeful that we can generate some good origination results over time by a very sloped differential customized effort on the marketing side. Operator : Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Richard, pretty high level question and you touched on some of the components of the answer it is, but I figure I'd still ask it anyway. So, you've managed this business through variety of different downturns and pullbacks, and recognizing that this one is much different than and they all are different I suppose. At this point of the downturn, how do you see yourself as prioritizing different objectives, and what kind of opportunities might come out of that if you compare and contrast this one to the last few downturns? Richard Fairbank : I think a few things about this downturn that are different. Again, I think on the consumer side, significantly more healthy consumer and marketplace going into this one then the last one. So the last one had to work its way through so many kind of structural problems on the way to getting to the other side of the downturn. It made the last great recession that was tough. So, it\u2019s a cleaner situation on the consumer side of the business. The really striking thing about this downturn is how immediate it was. You look back to the great recession. I mean, lots of the indicators were there in \u201807, but this was a rolling downturn that took a lot of months and even sort of measured in years to play out. In this one, I'm so struck by the fact that everybody sort goes down the elevator at the same time. We're talking about consumers, we're talking about companies who serve them, banks and the government. I think, so because of the vertical drop down the elevator where it's not clear what floor it\u2019s going to stop at you saw such a conservative response by consumers that that's the flip side. So that's bad for volumes but really good for my credit health and savings and all the aspects of that. That is really striking in comparison to any downturn I've seen before. Because of the vertical drop, you've also seen companies really you know mobilize in very rational ways and pull back much more quickly than they did in the downturn and that leads to a healthier situation as well. And then I think the vertical drop allowed the political environment to coalesce around significant stimulus programs that would be so difficult if this were rolling 18 months to really get into this then. So that to me is what is so unique about this. And so, now it's led to this really extraordinary kind of paradoxical situation where the actual performance of the customers. And I'm especially talking about the consumer business, the performance is so strong but the economic numbers are so bad. A lot of, how these things play out is really going to be driven by choices that happen on the government side or perhaps the collective forbearance choices that will be made by the banking industry and beyond. But another thing that I think is important, Jeff, as a mental thought here is think about a metaphor a downturn tends to have. Worsening is like big mountain and things go way up and then they come down. With every month of solid performance by the consumer in a sense, we're burrowing a tunnel through the mountain. And every month that passes as you get through the mountain in some sense, all other things being equal, it can serve to limit some of the downside that can come in even as there's a fairly rapid ascent if some of the stimulus, for example, is removed. But in all of this what I find this very energizing times from a business point of view to look for where are the risks, where are the differential opportunities, how can we capitalize on the ability to do real time underwriting and leverage a lot of data and that data is a pay off of our tech transformation and leverage three decades of experience, but also really understand what is unique about this downturn. And I think, we are -- that's what we're spending so much energy doing right now. And I think across our businesses, there's going to be a very sloped kind of amount of growth or shrinkage depending on the unique opportunity. Operator : And our final question of the evening will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : Strange times indeed, most of the questions on credit. But I guess, Rich, I think just one thing. And I tend to agree with your comment that the longer this goes the less risk I think on the consumer side. And do you think that the stimulus and the consumer reaction has essentially covered some of the charge-offs that would have occurred, that they will not occur because of the stimulus funds that were available? And then said it seems that some people think that companies such as yours don't make any adjustments to the underwriting side. But what percentage of your current borrowers in the credit card business are unemployed? And when you're making underwriting new loans, I would assume that new loans don't go to people who are unemployed. You don't extend credit lines to those that are generally unemployed. But do you also carry that further and look by industry and say, well, Delta Airlines is about to lay-off half of their workforce, we probably should be more conservative with airline employees. And so just some thoughts on whether you think those charge-offs are permanently removed, because of stimulus potentially. And then just some comments on the underwriting. How many of your current borrowers are unemployed and how you have changed underwriting? Richard Fairbank : So, I don't think we have a rigorous measure of how many of our current borrowers are unemployed. But since we have a big chunk of America, I think that our borrowing base is reflective of America. And there are a lot of people that are in different degrees of unemployment right now. And so, even as there's such great credit performance right now, what we're  about is kind of looking beyond that to a number of the things that, you've talked about how to underwrite with as much information as we can and as wisely as we can. Past performance is not necessarily such a great predictor of future performance at a time like this. But we call our whole strategy at Capital One the information-based strategy. This is a time where data really matters. And so, we're putting a lot of energy into that very thing, along the lines of a lot of things that you're talking about. So, marshalling as much information as we can, leveraging the capabilities Capital One has built to having data is one thing, getting data and leveraging it in real time is another thing. And that's one of the things that we've been focused on with respect to our technology transformation. And then finally, how does one also in a world where you can't be assertive on the underwriting side, how do we put other mitigating protections in, in the structure of how we build our products. And the low line credit, the low line strategy that Capital One particularly is beneficial at a time like this. Originating with lower lines and saying we'll waiting for awhile on the line increase side of things. But we will continue to originate the account subject to the tighter credit box we talked about. On the auto side, we have invested very heavily in real time information-based underwriting. And like I said earlier, the amount of data available in the auto underwriting process in real time compared with card is a whole level higher. I mean, it\u2019s partly an industry point and partly some of the particular places that we've gone at Capital One. And so, I think that with some of the clarity that we're able to see particularly well there, we can make some good choices but also we're able to put in more structures, more protections, stronger pricing, into the underwriting that's a very important thing in addition to just the prediction of the underlying risk of the consumer themselves. Bob Napoli : Great, appreciate your answers and have good evening. Richard Fairbank : Thanks very much, Bob. Jeff Norris : I'd like to thank all of you for joining us on this conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, investors relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a good night, everyone. Operator : That does conclude our call for today.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much Keith, and welcome everybody to Capital One's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live on the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log onto Capital One's Web site, capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2020 results. Scott Blackley : Thanks Jeff and good afternoon everyone. I'll start on slide three of today's presentation where you can see Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.06 per diluted common share in the third quarter. Included in EPS for the quarter were three adjusting items which are outlined on the slide. Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share in the quarter was $5.05 per share. In addition to the adjusting items, we had a couple notable items in the quarter. We recorded a gain of $470 million or $0.79 per share related to an equity stake in Snowflake, which recently priced its initial public offering. We also recorded a $327 million or $0.54 per share allowance release associated with moving a partnership card portfolio to held-for-sale. Turning to slide four I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. Excluding the held-for-sale transfer, we released $390 million of allowance for the total company in the third quarter, mostly driven by a small balance sheet. In our allowance, we continue to assume no benefits from further government stimulus beyond any residual impacts of prior legislation in a correspondingly severe economic outlook with targeted qualitative factors for specific areas of uncertainty. We assume we end this year at a 9.7% unemployment rate, improving to around 8% by the end of 2021. Turning to slide five, you can see that allowance coverage levels were essentially flat as allowance releases were commensurate with contractions in our card and commercial loan portfolios. Our consumer banking coverage ratio declined modestly to 4% from 4.3%, mostly driven by a release in our auto finance allowance, which was driven by updated auction price assumptions. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Scott, and I'll begin on Slide 10, which summarizes results for our credit card business. Year-over-year, credit card loan balances, purchase volume, and revenue declined in the third quarter driven by the impacts of the pandemic. The biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses, which improved significantly compared to both the prior year and linked quarters. Credit card segment results are a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Consumer behavior was a key driver of domestic card results in the third quarter. In the current environment, consumers continue to behave cautiously spending less, saving more, and paying down debts. These behaviors are amplified by the cumulative effects of stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry. We're seeing the effects of cautious consumer behavior across several key business\u2019 results, including pressure on spending and higher payments rates resulting in declining loan balances. But this cautious behavior is also a key driver of the most impactful domestic card headline in the quarter, strikingly strong credit results. We posted exceptional credit performance in the third quarter, especially in the context of the pandemic. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.64% a 48 basis point improvement year-over-year, and an 89 basis point improvement from the sequential quarter. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.21%, a 150 basis points better than the prior year. The linked quarter improvement in the delinquency rate was 53 basis points, even though the typical seasonal pattern is a 50 - excuse me a 40 basis points increase. In addition to positive impacts from cautious consumers, stimulus, and widespread forbearance, our credit performance is benefiting from resilience choices we made before the downturn began, including our avoiding of high balance revolvers and caution on credit lines. Our own domestic card forbearance is not a significant driver of credit performance, because enrollment is low. We've provided updated information on domestic card forbearance on Appendix Slide 17. Purchase volume is rebounding from the sharp declines early in the pandemic. Third quarter purchase volume was down just 1% from the prior year quarter. That compares to a year-over-year decline of about 15% in the second quarter and about 30% in the first weeks of the pandemic. By late September and through the first half of October, year-over-year purchase volume growth was modestly positive. Despite the rebound, purchase volume growth is still down compared to the double-digit growth we were seeing before the pandemic. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts you may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session has ended, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Keith, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you.  We'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. I guess I have a question on the net interest margin trajectory going forward, Scott. I know you talked about some contributors that caused the sequential degradation and the dependency for some items in the future. But looking ahead, if we assume a stable macro, could you maybe just dimensionalize some of the upside levers you have? I know there's a step up in the Walmart share, you have the funding costs coming through, the lower funding costs and lower liquidity potentially, could just talk about those, Scott? Scott Blackley : Sure. Good afternoon, Sanjay. So, with respect to NIM, I think that the current margin is towards the low end of where I would expect to see NIM given our balance sheet mix. And if I just look at kind of the factors right now, cash is elevated, but deposit growth has slowed in Q3. In Q4, we're going to get the full quarter benefit of the deposit pricing actions that we took in Q3, and then auto growth is positive to NIM. So, I look at just those factors and there those are all positives. When you talk about longer term, more stimulus is the potential there is that that might drive more savings, which would be a headwind to NIM if we received more cash in the form of deposits. But, on the other hand, that's going to be a positive to our credit performance, and that seems like a good trade to make. So overall, at this point, feeling like we're towards the lows on NIM, and there are a number of factors that would go in a positive direction if everything in the economy kind of went stable from here forward. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. And I guess talking about the economy. Your reserve rates were stable as not sort of declined a tad. Could you just talk about how do you see that unfolding, assuming things don't change materially in the macro situation? And maybe, Rich, you could chime in on some of the things that you're worried about or not on the macro side because you mentioned credit quality looks strikingly strong. Thanks. Scott Blackley : Why don't I start on the allowance and then Rich you can jump on the back end of that question? So when I look at the allowance, there's a couple important considerations. One is that we build our allowance to exclude the potentially positive effects of stimulus beyond what's already in place, and we've assumed some further worsening in the economy. Second, our delinquency inventories are at really, really low level, so we're starting at a place where, it's going to take a while for losses to actually manifest. So, I feel really comfortable with our coverage levels where they are today. And, if we just look at going forward, more stimulus could be a significant positive factor to allowance. And the economy is another wild card, if it worsens beyond our current assumptions and we didn't get stimulus in that case. In that case, we might be looking at the potential for reserve additions, but in an economy that goes kind of sideways or doesn't worsen much or if we get stimulus, I think there's some upside in the allowance. Richard Fairbank : Sanjay, just a comment about the consumer, this is the biggest disconnect that I certainly have experienced in my three decades of building Capital One, between what we see in the economy itself and the actual performance of the consumer, especially from a credit point of view. Now, some things that I think always happen in a downturn, and that is consumers tend to get more conservative, so they tend to pull back, spend less, save more. So in some ways, why would what we see here be any different from the past? And look, I still put a high degree of uncertainty around things, so I'm going to give you some views, but don't use this as like a prediction of what the consumer is going to do in the rest of this downturn. But I do think the consumer being in better shape going into this crisis starts kind of on the plus ledger for the consumer. Debt levels were lower, payment obligations lower still supported by the low interest rates. The savings rate over the past few years was, I think, around double what it was before the great recession. And so, the consumer entered in a stronger situation. Then what happened is, unlike most other downturns, and certainly unlike the Great Recession, which took a lot of months to sort of build its momentum, this thing kind of came all of a sudden. And the world went into free fall, sort of as I often say, we all went down the elevator together at the same time; consumers did, companies did, and the government did. And so that I think the reaction by the consumers was more striking and more conservative than has happened in the past. So, they're spending less, saving more, paying down debt. And I think it's amplified relative to the past. Then overlay on top of this of course, that the swift and unprecedented government stimulus, and the widespread forbearance programs across the banking industry were both much greater and much swifter than occurred in the past. And so, the cumulative impact to consumer balance sheets of lower wages, offsetting government support and lower spending is -- some of these effects by their conservatism and some of the benefits that they were granted by external parties has added up to a positive net consumer sort of savings effect of over a $1 trillion or about $10,000 per household. And obviously, the impact across individual consumers and households is highly variable. But we now have the expiration of the expanded unemployment benefit, that's a blow to many millions of unemployed Americans. I think what we're dealing with is a cumulation of benefits that the consumer has had during this downturn, such that when suddenly the stimulus was kind of shut off, we didn't see our credit metrics suddenly skyrocket to work force places. I think the consumer is working through some of that cumulative that has built up, but I think that we still have to look at -- we're talking about electrifying economic numbers, awful lot of job losses, now a lot more of them being more permanent, and the government stimulus at this point not having been renewed, so I think it's just a matter of time before this thing could reverse itself in a significant way. And you see everything I say, I just want to say relative to a metaphor I've been using when I talk to investors is, every month that their favorable credit trends were sort of burrowing a longer tunnel underneath the huge economic worsening mountain such that even as potentially things revert to significantly worse place for the consumer, I think we've reduced the cumulative losses through the downturn rather than just delaying the impact. So those are some thoughts Sanjay on what we're seeing. It's certainly not something collectively that I've observed before. But - and no one should look at this and feel, okay I give up. I'll speak for myself, we certainly - we feel really good about performance we're seeing, but we feel quite cautious about what could happen. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good evening. Scott Blackley : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I wanted to dig in a little bit on the auto results. I know that you mentioned you have very strong auto results both on the loan side as well as on the credit side. First question here is just around the used car prices, they're clearly up a lot of about 15% year-on-year. And I guess just wanted to understand how much that piece of the equation impacted your net charge-off and your NIM around auto. And what you're assuming for used car prices going forward from here? Richard Fairbank : Okay, Betsy there's been unprecedented volatility in auction prices since the start of the pandemic. At the start of the pandemic, we saw a sudden collapse in auction prices as stay at home orders basically froze markets, and auction houses rushed to move online. By the end of the second quarter, we saw auction prices rebound to pre-COVID levels. And as the stay at home orders were lifted, consumer demand experienced sort of V shaped recovery in the auto space and supply remain constrained by leap delays and the decision of most lenders to suspend repossession. At the start of the third quarter, there was a massive amount of uncertainty around the stability of these trends, particularly whether consumer demand would remain strong with the expiration of stimulus and whether it would be enough to offset projected increases in supply. But as it turned out, through the third quarter, consumer demand remained incredibly strong, resulting in supply constraints that drove up auction prices as dealers struggled to maintain inventory levels. Over the last couple of weeks, we've seen the industry start to work through these supply constraints, with auction prices declining slightly, and dealer inventory starting to recover toward the pre-COVID levels. So going forward, we would expect auction prices to normalize over the next several months, as the industry fully works through these supply issues. We're underwriting to an assumption that they're going to be significantly adverse from there, just because of the - just to be cautious and because of the extreme volatility. To your question about how important was this in the results? It was one of the factors. So for example, in the credit results, there really were three auto - so why was auto credit so good beyond what we're seeing in cards that we've talked about? There are three auto specific effects. One is, our COVID loan extension programs having a more meaningful impact on our credit metrics than it is in card, because the program's got a more, bigger proportion of customers in it and because we extended relief to the impacted customers in later stage of delinquency. And then we've got the used car auction prices, which basically reached all-time highs in Q3. And we've also seen somewhat higher auto recoveries from the catch up from our temporary suspension of repossessions earlier in the downturn. So, it's definitely sort of a bunch of planets aligning in the auto space, driving performance that is extraordinary in some sense, and certainly on the credit side much of the things I talked about are more temporary in nature. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay no, that's super helpful. Thanks for all that color Rich. The follow up question I have. Just have to do with what you're seeing with regard to the accounts that are exiting forbearance in the various products sets that you have? Some other folks, this earnings cycle have been suggesting that accounts exiting forbearance or exiting with a higher rate of delinquencies I'm wondering if you are seeing the same thing and could you put a number on what that difference is between accounts that were in forbearance and aren't? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Yeah, so by the way, I would put - with let's say, you told me a downturn of any kind was coming. And we installed a forbearance program. I would with 100% confidence say, customers who enter a forbearance program and exited will have higher delinquencies than those who never did. Only because it's a, you take a population and you now create a filter, and this is an important filter, did you raise your hand and say, I'd like some of that forbearance? Is it versus one minus that group? It would be extremely rare for that group not to have higher delinquencies. Interestingly, probably the biggest driver of the delinquency number is it like what or what percentage of them are when they leave and that they stay current? So probably the biggest driver of that is how wide the funnel was in the first place, by which the company was inviting customers to come in and take the forbearance. The wider the funnel, the more likely regular, very low risk customers sort of took advantage of the program. So, in our business, let me just look this up here. If we look at the customers in our card business, we look at the customers who no longer enrolled, who are no longer enrolled, but were previously, 88% of them are current. In auto it is 86%. And the other thing, again, I just want to say I'm not sure how much information content there is in that only because one has filtered a population. The most telling thing would be the overall delinquencies that you see on our portfolio because all these customers who have entered forbearance are basically part of the delinquency metrics that you observe. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Good evening, guys. Richard Fairbank : Hi Nash. Ryan Nash : Rich, you noted that we could see a significant ramp in marketing in 4Q. Can you maybe just clarify what the expectations are in terms of the quarter-over-quarter increase? And second, just more broadly speaking, when competition is historically pulled back, you've used it as an opportunity when you've seen a window to accelerate growth. And I was just wondering if you could just talk about your approach to increasing marketing spend at this point. And are things still too uncertain for you to do that? Do you have any sort of visibility at this point? Or is it more just seasonal in nature, and we should expect it to remain low as another issue or talked about this morning? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Yes. So this our saying that marketing to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third is not a declaration that we see all the light at the end of the tunnel, we're all in, you're right at Capital One we sometimes dig while others dig. We also sometimes dig while others dig, and it's all a situational kind of thing. The primary, the reason that we're kind of leaning into this marketing guidance relative to the next quarter is more just how low it is now, not to look at that and say that, at that low level, it's going to sustain itself. So, let me just give you a little more context here. We pulled back in certain channels early in the crisis in response to the decrease opportunity for quality growth. And just given the unprecedented uncertainty early on, we've since re-entered most channels. And it's interesting, while marketing was flat overall in the company, within card marketing increased through the quarter. Again, it was mostly just coming off such a very low level. And so, what we are saying is you have the seasonal ramp that always happens in the fourth quarter as Capital One. And then on top of that, because even though our marketing was flat within the quarter company wide, within card it was quite slow. And so we're really saying just the full seasonal - the full quarter effect and that will also pull the numbers of fair amount higher. So, it's really more a pulling-up from weight being so low as opposed to a statement of a big transformation and how much marketing and growth we're going after here. Ryan Nash : But in your prepared remarks, you talked about capital return being an important part of the picture for shareholders. When we look to capital ratios are at 13 and once we get through the next few quarters should be at least 13.5% or over 20% of your market cap in excess. Now, I know we still have a handful of things that we need to get through. The Fed stress test, but it seems like if we had the minimum from the SCB of 10.1 and your internal target of 11, it seems like you have the potential to get pretty aggressive on returning capital. So if you maybe just talk about the capital priorities, and how quickly do you think you can manage the capital down once we have clarity on where the economy is headed? Thanks. Scott Blackley : Yes, thanks Ryan. Well, as you know all the large banks are going through CCAR 2.0 right now, and as I mentioned, we're going to get through that process and get our feedback before we make any adjustments to our capital situation. I think that as we talked about with stress capital buffer, with the buffer for us under that framework, where the total capital required under that framework is 10.1, we want to operate in most environments with a buffer above that, so, probably over 11%. I think that what I'm hoping is that we'll start to see the Fed move away from the current level of restrictions, and that in the first quarter, they will migrate to the stress capital buffer framework, which should allow us to manage our capital distributions both dividends and share repurchases on a much more dynamic basis. And as we talked about and we mentioned in our comments, we do appreciate that this is an important component of shareholder return. And so, we're looking to get back into the business of having an appropriate amount of capital and making sure the shareholders are receiving distributions. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon. Rich, you in response to Sanjay's question touched on something that I think is really interesting. You mentioned divergence between labor markets and credit markets and credit performance. And you hypothesized whether or not what we've seen is a delay in credit events, or we're actually going to see moderation from all of the policy initiatives. And you alluded to the fact that you think it's the latter. I want to make - I want to understand, in part, what drives that view? And then I want to turn the question to Scott and ask, where's the reserve or the allowance in that context? Are you still more reserved in the delay scenario at this point? Richard Fairbank : Hey Rick, I want to make sure that I articulate for a second your two circulate for a second, your two scenarios, the delay scenario describe what you're saying that is. That would be, it's going to get as bad as ever. It's just delayed in getting there. And the moderation\u2026 Rick Shane : Got it. Richard Fairbank : Yeah. So yeah, I'll let Scott talk about the allowance just sort of is, there have been - well, certainly right now, there is a divergence between the two is extraordinary. I do think that - and the most common thing everybody's talking about is government stimulus. And I believe that is an important effect. I wouldn't underestimate the collective impact of forbearance across the banking industry as well and again to some extent in rents and other things. But between the strength because the consumer entered the downturn and the various things that are providing some relief, it is clearly disconnecting the relationship that we would otherwise see between unemployment and the consumer's financial health and credit performance. So, I think it is very plausible that this sort of bank account if you will of cumulatively some good things that the consumer has had available is something that is finite and very plausibly can't last for an extended period of time. I think it still buffers for a short period of time, but if we don't see stimulus, and if the economy continues to really be hurting. I have trouble envisioning how the consumer doesn't end up getting in a worse place from here. But I did - my points are I think that timing of that can still be buffered by the accumulated benefits. And then my other point is that I think burrowing through the tunnel, I picture a big mountain which is the bad economy and going up and then going down on the other side. Burrowing through the tunnel and even then, if the consumer has to rejoin that bad mountain, if you will, it's a strange metaphor. I think that some of the worst aspects of that downturn will have been averted by virtue of every month that passes. What I want to do is give it to Scott to comment on how we've handled the allowance. Scott Blackley : Yeah, thanks, Rich. Rick, so if you think about what we have to do in the allowance, we're starting with delinquency levels that are not connected to the level of unemployment that we're seeing. And so one of the things that we have to do in the allowances is to take those delinquency levels and over time, kind of get them to link up with unemployment levels. One of the reasons that we are thinking that's happening is that some of the stimulus actually comes in, in a form where it's replacing income. And so even though you've got elevated level of unemployment, you basically are you have a consumer who's, who may be unemployed, counting in the unemployed, calculations, but it's receiving benefits that allowing them to stay current as if they were fully employed. So as we start to see stimulus unfold here, the real question that we face in the allowance is just how long is that income replacement going to continue? And what does that mean to the total loss content? So those are the kinds of issues that we would face with the allowance? Rick Shane : Got it. That's very helpful and Rich, I do appreciate the metaphor as well. Thank you, guys. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolf Research. Bill Carcache : Thanks, good evening. Rich, can you discuss the competitive landscape as you think about the potential threats on one hand from the neo-bank sort of the times of the world that operate exclusively online without traditional branch networks in this sort of post COVID environment? And on the other hand, the Buy now pay later is like the corners and after pays. How do you see their presence impacting the competitive environment in the card business, say, over the next two to five years? And is there any potential benefit to deploying some of your excess capital into M&A and one of those areas or those sort of capabilities, things that you think you can build on their own? Richard Fairbank : So well, Bill, it's certainly quite fascinating and striking to see what's happening on both the banking side and the lending side with respect to these new competitors. Let me talk about the Buy now pay later phenomenon. There has been a point of sale lending forever basically. And it's always been there as another form of financing. And it's interesting in many ways the credit card became the disrupter in point of sale lending. I never forget when early on in the Capital One journey, I ran into this guy who said, you ruined my business. I'm so sorry. How did we ruin your business? And he said, I ran a furniture store. I made my money on financing and the credit card has kind of put me out of business. And so the credit card has been an incredible efficient tool in a world where point of sale financing has continued. And there's logical reasons they both would coexist. I think it's really striking what has happened recently, with respect to the Buy now pay later, which there's a couple of striking things going on that are not, haven't been a part of the historical context. One is just the technology, the ease of the whole thing. And with a single click, you can kind of Buy now pay later that has been one aspect of this. And the other is that, merchants are paying the lenders at this point the way the marketplace works. Merchants paying the lenders which has allowed this to be a pretty financially attractive business for some of these neo-players and has helped keep that industry unassailable. A lot of times you have to race to the bottom in terms of how high the short-term pricing gets etcetera. So, this is something that's growing rapidly. And I think that it's something that we are looking carefully at and watching and trying to assess where that market is going. We wonder how sustainable the revenue model of that is, with respect to the merchant subsidies in a more competitive marketplace. So, we'll have to keep an eye on that. But I think, this is another example of how digital technology and the real time instant solutions is where the entire world is going. The history of banking is to deliver solutions on a batch basis to consumers. And I think this is another example of how real time solutions are here. And all banks, if they don't increasingly figure out how to leverage data in real time and bring instant customized solutions to consumers may find themselves in a bad place. Then you got the whole banking side of the marketplace, the chimes, and some of the other players that I think has also have created a disruptive model. We tend to root for their success, because we are also a disruptor in this marketplace. And the more collectively all of us can get at the - make progress against the highly inertial entrenched behavior of Americans to always bank with their branch bank. The more we can chip away collectively with that, I think the more opportunity there is for all of us digital players, Capital One included, but we're certainly inspired by some of the things that we see by some of the neo-banks. Bill Carcache : That's super helpful, Rich, thank you. If I can squeeze in another quick one on auto, can you discuss how your mix of new versus used originations has evolved? And whether there's any particular area that you've been leaning into more heavily? Richard Fairbank : There's not - well, there's been a lot of used, of course, just some of the market conditions that have led to a lot of used car buying. So, I don't have in front of me data with respect to that, but the used car opportunity is a sweet spot for most banks, because the captive lenders can do subsidize their new car purchases. So, the majority of our entire business is used, and the more the used car market thrives the better it is for Capital One. I think the bigger effect that's going on that we're struck by, in addition to just have all that sort of the tide of auto has risen for all the boats, for all the players, and it's just a kind of a strikingly sort of good time in the industry and technically, we should all know in the middle of the master pandemic, so we got to be very careful. But kind of little captive, the traction that we're seeing with our digital strategy is particularly we're seeing in auto, because of the very physical nature of how the product is brought. And this is an example of where the pandemic is accelerating things that would happen anyway. But in the auto space, the more they accelerate the sort of direct side not necessarily the pure direct where no one ever goes to a dealership, but the semi-direct or the hybrid direct and thing that just involves faster, more digital solutions. That plays into the hand of Capital One because we've invested four years in real time, automated solutions and being able to underwrite any car in America on any lot in less than a second, and to be able to provide that information to consumers before they go into a dealership and also lessen the amount of hard work and waiting once you get it. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Well Rich, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your commercial real estate portfolio and also given the stress, are there any opportunistic opportunities that you see coming to market? Richard Fairbank : So, our commercial real estate is $30 billion across a range of property types. Relative to most banks, their overall portfolio is more concentrated in multifamily, which we view as more resilient while it's underweight in more volatile sectors like hotel, retail, office and construction. So in the multifamily space, we have $18 billion in exposure in multifamily. About $13 billion is on balance sheet and about $5 billion in agency low share. And of that, of the $13 billion we have on balance sheet, about half of our exposures in the New York metropolitan area. And, as you know Don, there are real borrower challenges in the market with low rent collections and addiction moratoriums. So, our focus and the significant majority of our portfolio is in rent regulated in Class B properties which have been historically more resilient in recessions. So the big increase in credit sized performing loans was in the multifamily portfolio. We feel really good about the LTV, the low LTVs that we have backing this book. But it certainly has our attention that New York's got a number of challenges on the real estate side. And so, we'll very carefully monitor how this plays out. But we feel collectively very good about our overall real estate portfolio and the choices that drove us to where we are. Don Fandetti : Okay, thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Hey, thanks. Richard, with the front end of the questions you talked a little bit about some of the differences between this and the Great Recession. I guess another one would be the banks and card issuers themselves are actually in a better position than they were at that point. And I'm just wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about how you think that impacts the competitive opportunity and what you're willing to talk about, what Cap One's plans are with respect to that? Richard Fairbank : Yeah. It's a really insightful comment that you make Moshe because, one of the things that we know that happened in the Great Recession is the consumer was more levered up. But you also had in the banking industry, both banks and non-banks were not providing products that were not nearly as well underwritten. That often had complicated features with them, and there was just a lot of disequilibrium to sort out. And that really compounded the consumers journey through the downturn that their own condition and also working through some of the things the most extreme, of course, motion was the mortgage products and all the issues there. So, and what happened is a lot of the bad lending practices, I say bad from a credit risk point of view, and also certain consumer practices got driven out in the Great Recession. And on the other side of it was a very rational, high performing credit card marketplace. And I've said for years on the other side of the Great Recession, I think this is a strikingly rational marketplace. I find it more rational than the other lending marketplaces in which we compete. And each of the players there sort of has carved out a particular niche in there, they're doing well. So I see Moshe a very rational behavior, even right now in the pandemic. Fortunately everybody pulled back. But first of all, you start with card players have something happening to them that basically is pretty unique across lending products. And that is that our portfolios are shrinking pretty dramatically. Here commercial in general, people drawing out online increased the volumes. So, I think that we card players are struck by, Oh, my goodness, just with the less spending and all this conservative behavior by consumers, we've been going backwards pretty rapidly, pretty much all of us have. And but I think that, that is the flip side of what comes from the strikingly sound and conservative behavior of our consumers. So, where did the industry go for from here? I think the industry has pulled back. And I think all of us, in our own way, are trying to figure out, no one's going to fully step on the back gas, no one is all the way pulled back. And I think for everyone, it is how to find the selective opportunity, where you can continue to lean into this thing and book business and it's going to be resilient, even if things get a whole lot worse. And some of them have tried true strategies motion we've had for many years, our conservatism on credit lines, the avoidances, high balance revolvers, and so on. Our strategy has been so resilience focus, I think that, for us the opportunity to continue to book accounts be very conservative on credit lines, build up the potential energies but continue to be being careful on credit lines, book to protect, grow the potential energy and delay the release to some extent into a kinetic energy to a lot of live growth until we see more clarity on where this economy is going. So, that's how we're continuing to lean in, even in the context of this for the electrifying economy. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks, Richard. And maybe a follow-up question for Scott. I noticed that revenue suppression had improved fairly significantly. I guess that works relative to actual delinquencies and maybe could you talk a little bit about how that's going to look going forward? Scott Blackley : Yes, you're right. The suppression is a shorter coverage period than allowance. It really only goes through the point of charge-off and when you've got a low delinquencies, that's improved. So, as long as we see stability in our delinquency levels, that would stay at about the levels where it is now. We started to see them. Delinquencies worsened, that would increase the amount of suppression. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And our final question this evening will come from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Brian Foran : Hi. Pretty much everything has been asked, like it's a done marketing. So I guess the normal seasonal increase would be maybe $100 million, $150 million, maybe $150 million, $175 million actually. A normal level would be maybe more of $500 million or $600 million. So are there any - I know you're not going to give a point estimate, but are there any guardrails which you could give maybe that we think is more like a normal seasonal increase to below $400 million so we thinking more like a normal seasonal level to the mid 500 millions in terms of gotten something depend fully on marketing for the fourth quarter? Scott Blackley : Brian, we're probably going to leave our guidance where it is, but the main thing we wanted people to just know that it's been unusually low at this point and don't get too used to the unusually low level. And so that's why it's the double effect that we're calling for the double effect of the normal significant seasonal increase that we have in the fourth quarter around things like our sponsorships and a lot of things that happened late in the year, as well as the continuation of what happened late in the quarter looking at the marketing levels and card. A phenomenon that was not visible in the aggregated credit numbers because it just turned out by coincidence, some of the marketing elsewhere in the company around retail, which had really been sort of higher right out of the gate with all the deposit inflows that we've had, we pulled back somewhat on the retail. Brian Foran : Fair enough. Looking then to forbearance in 2009 when you did you load market and that got into a normalized earnings model. So fair to remind people that you still . Richard Fairbank : Okay, well, Brian, thank you. Jeff Norris : Thanks, Brian, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on tonight's conference call. Thank you for your interest in Capital One. And remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great night. Richard Fairbank : Thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much Keith and welcome everybody to Capital One's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the internet, please log onto Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2020 results. Scott Blackley : Thanks Jeff and good afternoon everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter Capital One earned $2.6 billion or $5.35 per common share. For the full year Capital One earned $2.7 billion or $5.18 per share. Included in EPS for the quarter were two small adjusting items which were outlined on the slide. Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share for the quarter was $5.29. Full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $5.79. In addition to the adjusting items in the quarter, we recorded an equity investment gain of $60 million or $0.10 per share related to our equity stake in Snowflake. For the full year the investment gain was $535 million or around $0.89 per share. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the fourth quarter, we released $593 million of allowance primarily in our card business. Economic assumptions underlying our allowance included unemployment of around 8% at the end of 2021 and the impacts of the $900 billion stimulus package passed in December. The release was driven by the strong credit performance we have observed and by the new stimulus bills. In our allowance we continue to assume that the relationship between economic metrics and credit quickly reverts to historic norm and we've added significant additional qualitative factors for COVID related uncertainty. In our commercial business, we charged off certain energy loans and released allowance for the specific reserves that were previously established for those loans. Rich Fairbank : Thanks Scott. As I think everyone on this call knows Scott shared with me in November that he would be leaving Capital One to join a tech startup, while he will be here through March 15. This will be Scott's last earnings call. I'm going to take a moment and thank you Scott for giving so much of your life to Capital One over this past decade including the last five years as our CFO. You've built strong relationships with our shareholders and across the investment community and you've always brought their external perspectives through our work inside of Capital One. You've been a key advisor and partner for me and for the board and a strong leader in our company. I'm particularly grateful for the legacy you've built. Transforming finance technology, strengthening processes and controls, building a great team of talented leaders including your successor Andrew Young. We will miss you and I'm sure you will continue to do great things. With that, let me turn to our domestic card business. Exceptional credit performance was the biggest driver of domestic card financial results in the quarter. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter 2.69%, a 163 basis points improvements year-over-year and a 95 basis point improvement from the sequential quarter. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.42%, a 151 basis points better than the prior year. The delinquency rate was up 21 basis points from the linked quarter consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $1.1 billion year-over-year driven by the allowance released that Scott discussed and lower charge-offs. Several factors are driving continued credit strength. Consumers are behaving cautiously spending less, saving more and paying down debt. These behaviors have been amplified by the accumulative effect of unusually large government stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry. Our own longstanding resilience choices put us in a strong position going into the pandemic and our strategic investments in digital technology and transformation are paying off in enhanced capabilities and underwriting better powering our performance and response to the pandemic. Strikingly strong consumer credit has persisted throughout 2020 even after the expiration of several parts of the CARES Act. Uncertainty about future credit trends remains high especially in the context of an evolving pandemic that is difficult to predict. As Scott discussed that uncertainty informs our allowance for credit loss. Jeff Norris : Thanks Rich. Scott let me add my personal thanks for all the coaching and leadership. It's been a pleasure to work with you over the years and I wish all the success as you go forward. And now we'll start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts, who may wish to ask a question. Please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up question. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session. The Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Keith, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you.  we'll take our first question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Scott, congratulations and Andrew I think when you look back Scott leaving you with $15.5 billion reserve is probably the best gift he could give you. I wanted to talk a little bit about that, when we look versus day one, the reserve is now up $5 billion. I'm curious when we look at the current credit metrics. What do you think that scenarios would have to be to actually really utilize that reserve over the lifetime? Scott Blackley : Rick, well thanks for your kind words and I appreciate both Rich and Jeff saying such nice things. It's been honestly just a privilege to be at this company and its certainly tough place to leave. But let me return to your question. In terms of the allowance, you're right that when you look at our coverage levels versus our current level of losses and delinquencies there's a big gap and I would just point out that, that is because right now our allowance is built to absorb a very wide range of outcomes which gives sense, which is sensible given kind of the circumstance that we're in at the moment and so I think that the biggest driver where the allowance might go and what might drive releases is frankly just certainty and narrowing down the range of possible outcomes. I think could come from things like macroeconomic factors like unemployment or pandemic specific variables like broader rollouts of the vaccines, reduced restrictions on people's movements and activities and things like that. So to me it feels like that certainty is more likely to happen overtime versus the step function so I think we'll see the allowance kind of play out in measured ways overtime. Rick Shane : Got it, okay. Thank you and we're looking forward to seeing you in the Bay Area. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Congratulations Scott. I guess I have a question on marketing expense and efficiency ratio target that you guys outlined some time ago. When we look at the marketing expense, it seems like run rate wise we're back to 2019 levels on a quarterly basis. Can you guys actually exceed that going forward is there's opportunity in the market size? And then as far as the efficiency ratios concerned, I mean how long before we can get back to the 52% target that you had outlined, Rich? Rich Fairbank : Sanjay, good evening. We're not making specific guidance about marketing as you know this is while there are certain things that are sort of mostly fixed about our marketing expenditures, a lot of it is based on real-time assessment of prospects for resilient growth in the competitive marketplace. But let me just kind of pull up and talk about our journey this year with respect to marketing. we pulled back early in the crisis but since increased marketing spend as you saw in Q4 and as expected the increase from Q3 was meaningfully higher than typical seasonal patterns. Right now, we are seeing opportunities to invest. We continue to invest in our brand, in our national banking strategy and in our card businesses we're leaning in where we see signs of strength and we feel pretty good about origination opportunities and these are enhanced by our tech transformation as well. So we're keeping a very watchful eye on the marketplace, but we do see opportunities and we're investing in them. And with respect to efficiency, we still believe that we're on the path to achieve the efficiency targets that we have talked about in prior years driven by growth and digital productivity gains and really enabled by our tech transformation. The pandemic has really impacted the timing of when we get particularly on revenue growth. Now we feel good about our current revenue trajectory and we're still on the same efficiency journey. But how the pandemic and the recession will play out remains uncertain and how the growth opportunity unfolds and also the sort of the great credit paradox with the strength of credit also comes the high payment rates which certainly it's a great thing for the overall financial performance of the company that's another thing that holds back the growth. So we're leaning into really in the growth opportunities but and we're on the same kind of heading to the same destinations we talked about before. But we're not giving guidance about the timing. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Carcache with Wolf Research. Bill Carcache : Let me add my congratulations. Scott, I wanted to ask about the buyback authorization. Is it reasonable to expect that you seem to be as aggressive as possible and executed on it such that you continue to do the form up by the end of 2021 assuming a favorable backdrop where the fed withdraws payout restrictions? And then within that, how are you guys thinking about the regulatory capital impacted the CECL  for day one and two under the CARES Act. Scott Blackley : Thanks for the question Bill. With respect to the share buyback program I think the most important thing I just want to underscore is that, the $7.5 billion that was authorized by the board really underscores our commitment to returning excess capital to the shareholders and I think that we're certainly excited to start that journey. As we think about capital deployment, the hierarchy there is first capital to growth opportunities and then share buybacks and dividends to follow and I would just point out in our past practice you can see that we manage share buybacks dynamically and we take into account market conditions, relative value, our holistic view on where we are in our capital position. In the first quarter we'll be limited $500 million I mentioned that based on the fed rules, after that the pacing of the share repurchase are really going to be guided by the factors I just talked about and by any regulatory guidelines that we might see. I'll just say that, we find our current valuation compelling and with over $8 billion of excess capital, we're really looking forward to getting started on the program. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll go next to John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Rich, you embarked on your digital banking transformation several years ago and at that point of time the attempt was to scale a traditional bank and using a digital platform where you could do lot more for your customers and really with simple side fashion over digital channels that digital banking I think has changed with the development of companies like  and some of the fintech companies kind of getting into call center banking offerings with digital wallets with no asset. I'm wondering, does that - the development of migration of digital banking overall, does that effect how you see investments going forward to Capital One? Rich Fairbank : Well everything that we see John I think reinforces our conviction about the strategy that we have and the journey that we're on and the destination we're so energetically pursuing. First of all, talk about the pandemic. I don't think the pandemic changed much about the destination of banking but it changed the timing of that because it accelerated the digital journey and one thing that's been so striking about banking products and even banking products relative to credit card products is the stickiness and the inertia inherent in the customer relationships that have existed sometimes for many decades and so one of the challenges for any digital bank is, how do you go after that inertia and create something compelling enough to cause people to switch and so it's really nice being on in a sense the right side of history because we can see the direction things go. What I'm struck by is the amount of acceleration that we've seen in these inevitable trends this year. So that's a good thing for us and we want to capitalize on that. Now the other along the way not surprisingly we've seen the rise of some very intriguing banking fintechs and we've watched with great interest their strategies in many cases, they have very nice digital customer experiences in some cases they have created strategies that the banking industry didn't come up with and we look with interest in that and in many ways root for their success because it's all part of the same - their success is the manifestation also of the accelerating change in customer behavior and the opportunity for digital banks. So we have a lot of respect for some of the players, we're impressed by their innovation and we've energized by their success and the success that we're having and so as a result we're leaning in  delaying and leaning in a little harder on our own banking strategy. John Hecht : Appreciate the context. Thank you very much. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Rich, in terms of the fintech discussion. I was wondering if you could comment on buy now, pay later, does that impact your business from a wanting competition perspective or syndicated risk standpoint and bit material for us to keep an eye on from a risk perspective. Rich Fairbank : So now buy now, pay later is a really interesting marketplace. It's kind of ironic because the original buy now, pay later product for the credit cards and so it's interesting to be a very established credit card players and feel a little bit like the old guard as we're watching these innovations on buy now, pay later and I have a lot of respect for and I'm impressed by some of the things, the success of the point-of-sale lending products. And point of sale lending as of course existed since really the beginning of lending itself. I think what's striking here is the way that it exist of course in the ecommerce space, the way it's got shelf space right there at the checkout page, some of the elegance of the digital technology and interestingly right now sort of financially how this marketplace works because the striking thing to me is that right now merchants are actually paying the bill as opposed to consumers and that tends to create a healthy marketplace, it tends to create better selection dynamic then very often you see in some of the short-term lending products they tend to have very high effective APRs and things can sometimes axiomatically to adverse selection. So thing to me, the thing that I'm most interested in watching from some of the structure of that marketplace is what happens to the - in a sense the merchant discount with respect to those products as the competition from lenders heats up in that space. So that's something we'll have to watch. So I think there's a lot for Capital One to learn in this marketplace and we're watching it closely and we really with interest look to see how this opportunity evolves. Jeff Norris : We'll take next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Scott, congratulations. Rich, maybe just to dig in a little bit further on the efficiency. I understand that you don't want to put a timeframe on it. However if we look at the performance this year, we're in 46% range still about 400 basis points from the 42% target that you had laid out so. Can you maybe just talk about the path to getting there from a financial perspective? Is it all about the return of card loan growth and the revenue growth that comes with it? Or is there more the digital transformation on the cost side? And if cost is part of it can you maybe just talk about what some of those drivers are and what the timing is in terms of us getting there? Thank you. Rich Fairbank : Yes, so Ryan. The efficiency our journey and the success we had over a number of years really till the pandemic sort of set things back a bit was driven kind of mathematically of course by the two factors sustained revenue growth and the efficiencies that were coming particularly from transforming to a more digital operational model. And I think the same things that drove our efficiencies ratio down over the years are going to be same drivers going forward. At the time that we gave the guidance on 42%, there were a lot of things coming together not only on the efficiency side things like getting out data centers, things like the step up that in the Walmart revenue sharing relationship but very much we were looking at accelerating growth opportunities in our businesses particularly our consumer businesses. So the pandemic set that back and so I would still say the biggest driver of the efficiency gains that we will continue to work toward will be on the revenue side because we still continue to invest in the digital opportunities that are in fact enabling the revenue growth and one thing that we talk about is, that we're now finished with our eighth year of our tech transformation and in many ways this will be a lifelong transformation that this has been starting at the bottom of the tech stack journey and overtime we've been working our way up the tech stack and the more we get up the tech stack, the more the opportunities are things that will actually the world can see things that customers can experience and things that can more directly enable growth and that's why I mentioned on my comments about marketing is that, some of the marketing opportunities we see are in fact specifically enabled by our tech transformation. So therefore while tech continues to create efficiency opportunities it is also the basis for a number of our growth opportunities and we really want to take advantage of those, we're leaning in and of course it takes investment to do that. So that's why I think revenue growth is I would expect it to still be the bigger driver of our efficiency journey on a net basis than on the cost side. But really the key is having revenue growth that exceeds the growth in expenses of course. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : So Rich in the past you've had a tendency to see the loan growth lag the marketing spend and account growth based upon credit lines and talked about the need to kind of incubate those accounts and increase the credit lines overtime to get that balance and revenue growth. Can you talk a little bit about where you sit in that now given the unusual nature kind of where we in the economic cycle? Rich Fairbank : Thank you, Moshe. With our strategy of relatively lower lines, we've often talked about how in many ways the primary credit risk and the primary growth comes really on the line increase side more so than just the originations themselves. And so what we have often done in times of stress or when there is extra caution and you will remember Moshe, in the probably 18 months prior to this downturn maybe two years we were also talking cautiously about lines because we said we're so long in the tooth on this economy and so that has been our strategy for managing risk is to try to hold the lines down where we can continue to lean into the origination side of the business and then open up the lines as we see more of the sun coming out and more opportunity one customer at a time. So where we stand on that, we've been particularly tight on the lines during this downturn. But I think that as we watch the pandemic play out, I think that we see opportunities one customer at a time. But collectively pulling up on this we do see important opportunities for increasing those lines and as we do that can put some momentum around the loan growth in a way that you don't just get from originations which we're also leaning into. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it and maybe as a follow-up, when I would get the question in the past about what could cause rewards rates to kind of moderate or come down. It's said an economic downturn and obviously we've got some form as an economic downturn. If anything it's gone the other way, any thoughts about kind of intensity of rewards competition and how to think about that into the next year or two? Rich Fairbank : As you know it's a really interesting question, Moshe. Whether a downturn caused this rewards rates to go down or up. So the case for down in other words for people for the competition to get less intense about that is the people are pulling back, they're spending less and they're more concerned about riding through the downturn than they're about trying to grow quite a bit. Here's a flipside to that argument and the thing that I think is dominating in that particular tug of war and that is that what is most striking about the pullback probably true in any downturn, but especially in this one is how much of pullback there is been in spending and what a pullback there has been in spending by heavy spenders and I think that not just the point about heavy spenders. It's partly what heavy spenders spend their money on which is to travel and entertainment on a disproportional basis relative to others and those of the sectors that have been absolutely whacked  here. It's generally the case that the heavy spenders from a credit point of view everything that we have seen would be consistent that they perform well on a downturn. They just get more conservative in their spending, travel opportunities and things like that don't necessarily work so enticing and certainly the case in this downturn. And so I think what happens is a response from players to lean into increasing inducement to generate the volumes that people want to get. We have seen significant increases in upfront bonuses. We've seen increases in reward levels and I think that's probably a natural thing for us to expect in this particular environment even though paradoxically it's associated with so much pullback. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : My question is just on how to think about the reserve levels and the reserve release from here. I know the questions asked a little bit. But the reason I'm raising it is, I think you said that your reserve today is based on unemployment rate of 8% at 2021, I know there's lot more inputs than just that. But that 8% at year-end 2021 is similar to last quarters. Yet at the same time I know Rich you mentioned that every quarter that goes by with good credit is like a reduction of peak, if not a push out. So how should I triangulate that, should we be anticipating in a more aggressive reserve releases at the quarters come through that are not so bad? Or is there something else going on in the reserve analysis that we should be thinking about? Scott Blackley : Betsy, why don't I take that one? So look I think that the - as I mentioned a couple times, I think the biggest consideration in our reserve right now is just the uncertainty and trying to make sure that we're capturing all of the scenarios in thinking about that and that is resulting in us having a really high level of qualitative reserves on top of our modeled risk. And so even in the current quarter where you're right our 2021 fourth quarter estimate of unemployment around 8% is consistent with where we were last quarter. During the full year we're expecting lower levels of unemployment than what we had forecasted or used in our allowance a quarter ago and so that coupled with we saw the passage at stimulus were both factors that drove the release this quarter. but we still have even with the positive trends we put on even more qualitative factors because it is just really hard to forecast where this thing is going to go and how it may play out and we're in the allowance we continue to expect that we will see the very low levels of credit come up and meet the high levels of unemployment that we see today and I really do believe that we will overtime see that in a play out exactly how that relationship is going to normalize and if it doesn't normalize then we're going to have allowance releases and they're going to come in overtime. But until we start to see kind of more evidence that relationship is going to stay kind of at the levels where it is, I would expect that we're going to continue to reserve against a variety of downside scenarios. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We'll take the final question from Bob Napoli, please go ahead. Bob Napoli : And congratulations Scott look forward to hearing where you're headed. Scott Blackley : Thanks Bob. Bob Napoli : Rich question on the just on the tech investment. The amount  if you can quantify at all for us maybe Scott the amount you're spending on technology versus several years ago, the growth in those investment and then maybe more importantly what do you feel differentiate you the most from other banks or fintechs with the changes or the upgrades in the technology and what's on the roadmap for further upgrades? Rich Fairbank : Okay, Bob. We don't breakout our tech investment but Capital One I think relative to banks on our side invest quite a bit in technology then my sense is of what other banks our size invest in, by the way, our primary competitive set is the big national banks and they check  tech budgets, so we certainly know also what we're up against. But let me just talk about again so philosophically what we've done. I think what most banks - I think companies in general when they're looking everybody know they got to invest more in technology and even as recently this quarter so companies said they're increasing their technology spend and I almost can't image the companies not feeling the need to do that as they face and accelerating digital revolution. A thing that very common that companies do is, they make their biggest investments at the top of the tech stack. Meaning the things that are closest to the consumer investing in apps, investing in experiences for customers or associates for things that can more directly and immediately manifest in improvements and there is no, it's a very natural thing to do. Capital One has taken the unlikely journey, a little bit the road less traveled by to have our investment primarily at the bottom of the tech stack. So we're talking down at courses  and data and addressing vendor products and their role in this things bringing lots of thing in house, bringing a lot of engineering in house and it's been a journey that and you know this Bob and other investors on this call know that they would often say I know you're investing a lot, you're talking about it, but I can't see it because the problem is if you were to improve one system in the core systems, it doesn't really manifest itself in something that the outside world can see and this is really the essence of the challenge that we and our investors who have patiently owned our stock this journey that we're going through. What we so deeply believe that at the outset of this journey and absolutely believe now that in order to compete with the tech companies in order to be a modern company and be able to go where banking is going to go, one really needs a modern tech stacks and that's a hard thing for startup bank to build. It's really hard thing for a legacy company to build and I think it was little easier for Capital One only that we were in a sense an original fintech three decades ago and so maybe don't have as much legacy as modest companies do. But it's still been a very significant journey. But I think when you say, how do we compare ourselves with other companies? I think other companies have I think there's a lot of good things other companies go are doing. They have really nice apps for their customers and everything else. But I think more and more Capital One is built like a tech company and like some of the leading tech companies that are changing the world and I think it was the little bit of shock to some folks when one day we said by the way we're getting entirely out of data centers and into the cloud and that's the kind of thing that could only come as a product of many years of the and it's not an accident that almost no big enterprise legacy companies have in fact made that journey. Now where does - but what it puts in a position to do, is that is to drive for opportunities and act more and more like tech company and be able to be more dynamic faster to the market, create, offer better products, better customer experience and that give us the opportunity to transform how we work, really how a bank works on the inside from risk management, fraud, credit, compliance, operational execution and enables us to build our national bank and lean into that and enables us to win some partnerships that in head to head competition. I feel that we won by virtue of some of the tech capabilities we had and it enables to achieve better economics and not so much in saving on - well partly tech on tech cost like massive vendor cost that we can say. But at the same time we're investing a lot in tech so the big in that savings is not so much tech cost as it is the opportunity to reduce analog cost overtime. So that's kind of long answer to your question. But when we looked out and said overtime, we are going to want to do that or we're going to do  this thing over there or we're going to do that thing over there. In each case we saw a shared path of investment and transformation that we would need to do and we're well down that path. We're not done in many ways it's a lifelong journey but I think our opportunities are increasing as we get further down this path. Bob Napoli : Thank you really appreciate the detailed answer. Jeff Norris : Thank you everybody for joining this conference call. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on this conference call today. Thank you for your continued interest in Capital One and remember that the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a good evening, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Keith, and welcome everybody to Capital One's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please logon to the Capital One website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our first quarter 2021 results. Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter, Capital One earned $3.3 billion or $7.03 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings increased 1% in the quarter to $3.4 billion and we recorded a provision benefit of $823 million. After recognizing $535 million of gains during 2021 on our Snowflake investment, we had a loss on our position in the first quarter of $75 million or $0.12 per share. We've now fully exited our position with a cumulative gain of $460 million. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the first quarter, we released $1.6 billion of allowance. The release was driven by strong credit performance across all of our businesses and a more favorable economic outlook that includes the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March. Our allowance continues to assume that the relationship between economic metrics and credit performance reverts to historical patterns. And despite the strong credit performance and more favorable economic outlook, we continue to hold significant qualitative factors to account for a number of remaining uncertainties. Turning to Slide 5, I'll provide some detail on the allowance coverage by segment. After the impact of the $1.6 billion allowance release, our coverage levels declined modestly across all segments from the prior quarter and remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Our Domestic Card coverage is now 10.5%, down from 10.8% last quarter. Our Branded Card coverage is 12.1%. Recall that the difference between Branded and Domestic coverage is driven by the loss-sharing agreement in our partnership portfolio. Coverage in our consumer business declined 38 basis points to 3.6%, and coverage in our commercial banking business fell 23 basis points to 2%. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew, and it's great to have you as our CFO. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Year-over-year credit card loan balances and revenue declined in the first quarter, driven by the continuing impact of the pandemic. Purchase volume rebounded compared to the first quarter of 2020. And the biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses, which improved significantly. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which we show on Slide 11. For the third consecutive quarter, the story of our Domestic Card business continues to be two sides of the same coin. Historically, high payment rates amplified by the effects of government stimulus continue to put pressure on loan balances. And on the flip side, the same factors are driving exceptional credit performance. Jeff Norris : Thank you. Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. And if you have follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Keith, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good evening. Want to see if you could talk a little bit about the long growth outlook, perhaps maybe a timing of the inflection, just given us as stimulus benefits, ultimately abate and payment rates peak. And I want to see similarly when you would expect to see that peaking of payment rates or at least an inflection there. Thanks. Richard Fairbank : All right. Thanks, John. Good evening. The growth story is, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re mostly focused on card with that question, so let me turn there. It is really striking that of all the asset classes, one really stands sort of unique in the industry as the one asset class that shrank since the start of the pandemic and that\u2019s Credit Card. And of course that\u2019s because it is a discretionary spending and borrowing product. In the current environment, the biggest drivers of card growth are spend and payment behavior, and of course the traction that we\u2019re getting in the marketplace. Let\u2019s just talk about spend for a minute, which is recovering. John Pancari : Thanks, Rich, for all that detail. That\u2019s helpful. Just one quick follow-up on the marketing side and you indicated that you\u2019re still continuing to lean in there. The low single-digit growth year-over-year marketing expense was better than we had expected. Could you just possibly give us a way to think about how much of a lean in that you\u2019re looking at here incrementally as we look at the remainder of the year? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Thank you, John. So, from marketing point of view, this first and foremost is going to be powered by what we see on the opportunity to grow originations. Marketing and originations are really something that\u2019s very linked, of course, outstandings growth is not as closely linked in time or as directly. But so we see good opportunities to grow account originations and we\u2019re investing in marketing consistent with those opportunities. In card, we\u2019re certainly \u2013 in all our businesses, we\u2019re leaning in where we see some signs of strength. We also are continuing and sort of increasingly so to tell our story in terms of the customer experience we\u2019re building, some of the benefits of our technology we\u2019re building, and that\u2019s part of our story that gets reflected in the marketing. And that\u2019s something that powers the growth as well. And then we\u2019re continuing to invest in our brand and our national banking strategy. So that\u2019s why it kind of pulling way up with the collective set of opportunities we\u2019re seeing we\u2019re continuing to lean in to the market. John Pancari : Great. Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Hey, good evening, guys. Maybe to ask about capital. So, if I look at the 11% target, you have over $10.5 billion of excess, you\u2019ve got $3.5 billion of reserves above day one. And if I look at expectations, I think the market\u2019s looking for almost $10 billion of earnings the next few quarters. So I wanted to get a sense for how we should think about capital allocation, timing of the execution of the $7.5 billion you previously announced. And could we see either upsizing of the current program into the next year, or how do we think about the ability to sustain capital returns at these levels? Thanks. Andrew Young : Sure, Ryan. I\u2019ll take that. It\u2019s Andrew. The first thing I would highlight is, as you know, we\u2019re still under the capital preservation rules from the Fed. So in the second quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our repurchase capacity is going to be limited to just under $1.7 billion and we will also be limited to our prior dividend. And so we recognize that capital distribution is important component of our returns and our current position, and at least the prospects of earnings from here. So how quickly we complete that $7.5 billion that the board has already authorized is going to tieback to any unforeseen additional regulatory restrictions, but also trading volumes in our stock, and then just taking a step back and looking holistically at our capital position. But what I can say is we\u2019re excited at the prospect of moving under the SCB framework in the third quarter. So we\u2019ll have more flexibility in our choices looking ahead. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Rich, you mentioned the strikingly strong credit backdrop. I\u2019m just curious, using your analogy of sort of borrowing through the mountain, so do you think we\u2019d get through to the other side with this round of stimulus? And maybe I\u2019ll just ask my follow-up now. Andrew, maybe you could just give us some sense of how the NIM projects for the rest of the year, understanding there\u2019s different puts and takes, maybe you could just walk us through your sort of baseline assumption? Thank you. Andrew Young : Yes, Sanjay. So I think the main factor, particularly in the near-term with NIM is going to depend on how that pandemic impacts our balance sheet. Most notably what you\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters in terms of asset mix and deposit balances and our cash position, I think those are the things that are mostly going to have the impact for the next few quarters. I think over the longer term, I\u2019d expect our cash position and the size of the investment portfolio to come back down to more normal levels, I\u2019ll call it, and be a tailwind to NIM all else equal. But it\u2019s again important to know that the uncertainty of what we\u2019re seeing in deposit volumes and the impact of payment rates, as Rich said on loan growth, those are all factors that are going to create some variability and uncertainty in them in the near-term. Richard Fairbank : And Sanjay, with respect to your credit question and the burrowing through the mountain metaphor, let me just kind of pull up and give thoughts about what\u2019s going on with credit. The U.S. consumer continues to demonstrate striking resilience. And consumers went into this downturn with like twice the savings rate that they had before the great recession, lower payment obligations and none of the structural issues they faced a decade ago with the housing sector. And because everything sort of went into vertical, a drop at once as the pandemic began, they certainly reacted strongly and rationally, and launched this trilogy of behaviors of spending less, saving more and paying down debt. And then of course, the year end of the pandemic, direct government support to consumers, including enhanced unemployment benefits remains in place. And in fact, last month, in March, was the single largest month of direct government payments to consumers in dollar terms since the pandemic began. And the consumer savings rate was 17% in the first two months of 2021 more than doubled what we saw before the pandemic and something like five times what it was in the years before the great recession. And then we also have the forbearance factor. Although forbearance is winding down in card and auto, it is still relatively widespread for student loans and mortgages. And as we\u2019ve said before, the benefits of some of these effects like higher savings are probably cumulative to some extent, improving consumer balance sheets in ways that could lead to some sustained credit benefits. And now to the metaphor that I know I use all the time, every month that the consumer remains healthy, we\u2019re burrowing a longer tunnel underneath the mountain of still high unemployment. And we\u2019re reducing the cumulative losses through this downturn rather than just delaying the impacts. Now we should all keep in mind a few things here. There remains a great deal of uncertainty. As you know, COVID cases remain elevated, new variants continue to emerge. And while the U.S. has been moving in a pretty good direction, of course, a lot of the world is moving in the other direction with respect to COVID. The economy while improving still has a lot of strain elements in it. And so that we still look at this just extraordinary kind of paradox of the separation of some of what happened to the economy and what happened to consumer credit. But we should all keep in mind, the uncertainty that still remains out there. And then there\u2019s one other point that I just like to put on the table here. In the spirit of pattern recognition, I do want to flag that this period of unusually strong credit could lay the groundwork for credit worsening down the road as an industry point. And let me elaborate on that just for a moment here. Reliance on consumer credit characteristics that may be more temporary driven by things like stimulus and forbearance can be a real challenge for credit modeling. And the benign rear view mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth and to loosen underwriting standards, which as you know, can invite adverse selection. And then overlay on top of that, the excess liquidity and capital that\u2019s out there, and that could push lenders to stretch for less resilient business. So what we have here is a pretty benign period where we are right now. We\u2019re also watching the physics of how markets, not only economic markets, but how credit markets work. And so what we\u2019re doing at Capital One is leaning into the opportunities that we have. But by having a view of how the physics of some of these things work, we\u2019re very much watching out for that in all the choices that we make. And it\u2019s again, another reason why we\u2019re focusing as always on making sure that we book resilient business. So pulling way up, we\u2019re not ready to predict that the tunnel comes out just all the way across the mountain. And we are talking about some topography that can exist out there longer run as the consequences of some of the physics of how the current situation lasts. But those are some thoughts on the credit environment, Sanjay. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Rich, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing on used car values in April? We\u2019ve heard from some competitors that cars are barely on the lot for a day. And then what is your strategy on loan growth? Because competition obviously is picking up across the board, yet the returns are still very attractive. How are you thinking about that business? Richard Fairbank : So, Don, the used car prices are pretty electrifying here. Auction prices ended the quarter at all-time high, driven by strong demand and persistent constraints on new vehicles supply. And over time we still expect auction prices to normalize as these vehicles supply constraints work themselves out. But the time horizon for normalization has expanded given the strong recovery of demand and the continuing stress on global supply chains. So for example, microprocessors shortages have held back new vehicle production for some time. The first quarter saw disruptions due to winter weather events, and that impacted petrochemical supplies used for parts. And then most recently rubber shortages have manifested themselves. So the supply is shortage, there are signs of it everywhere. And for example, we see rental car companies are normally a source of used vehicle supply, but they have very lean fleets at the moment with little access to sell. So we still expect auction prices to normalize over time. And a very important thing is in our underwriting, we make conservative assumptions with faster normalization now. With that very unusual context there, and again, my view is that we cannot underwrite under an assumption that we\u2019re going to get the benefit of those things. It\u2019s certainly something we\u2019re enjoying on our portfolio. But as we always do, and particularly at this point, we need to look past that in our underwriting and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re doing. With respect to growth, industry retail auto sales were strong in the first quarter and especially in March. And in addition to tax refund seasonality, I\u2019m sure payments, stimulus payments likely really held strong sales both in the new and the used vehicle segments. So at Capital One over the course of the pandemic, we actually have \u2013 we tightened up in certain segments, especially, early on, but we are still probably net tighter than we were at the outset. We\u2019re watching things closely, but we have benefited by the tide rising for everyone in the industry, certainly it\u2019s been a very exceptional time. But also on top of that, our investments in industry-leading technology products have allowed us to maintain very strong relationships with dealers during these uncertain times and generate the ability to have less in-person face-to-face interaction during the pandemic has also really helped lift the digital products and the digital capabilities that we have both for customers and for dealers. So we have found on top of the rising tide, maybe a little bit of extra boost at Capital One, but I've also said that even more so than the card business, the auto business is hypersensitive to sort of the level of competition. And that's because a dealer sits there and holds an auction in ways that doesn't happen in a direct-to-consumer business like card. So it's not lost on us that \u2013 the tide rising everywhere in auto has caused quite a buoyancy in the auto business, so what we're going to do is continue to lean into the opportunities at that moment. But again to use my physics term, again, really keep a watchful eye on the physics of how the markets work and be looking for some of those things that can come on the side of excessive competition, as well as over time a breaking of the extraordinary things going on, a normalization of the used car prices. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rick Shane, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. When we look at the non-interest income, particularly in the domestic card business, it seems to be decoupling and outperforming the increase in spend. I'm curious how much of that is being driven by some sort of release of suppressed fees or how we should be thinking about catalysts for that? Andrew Young : Hey, Rick, it's Andrew. This suppression is actually flowing through net interest income. So that's not driving it. I think the biggest driver, if you're looking at it on a margin basis is we're seeing spend volume and interchange spend growing at a faster rate than loans. So that's providing a little bit of a tailwind to non-interest income as it relates to overall revenue margin in card. Rick Shane : Okay, great. That \u2013 I think that helps, but if we look at the year-over-year increase in spend and we look at the year-over-year increase in non-interest income, there's still a pretty significant gap. One of the things that's always a little bit hard to figure out with Capital One is where some of the rewards run through, is it a function potentially of lower rewards rates given what's going on in the market or is there something else as well? Andrew Young : Yeah, I don't think there's a big story there with respect to rewards or interchange Rick. Rick Shane : Okay. I will follow up offline, thank you guys. Andrew Young : Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Rich I was hoping to go back to the competitive dynamic, maybe a little less from a credit standpoint, but you guys have taken some actions recently with respect to your T&E products. Just talk a little bit about the rewards environment at your high end consumers, and then maybe the things that you did discuss with respect to kind of concerns about the competitive environment and what it kind of, how it informs your credit line increase side of the business? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Moshe, great questions there. Let's kind of pull up and talk about card competition. Competition can show up in a variety of ways, including the marketing intensity, the product offers, including there the upfront bonuses, enhanced rewards, pricing and other things. Competitive intensity is back to a tie levels, particularly as you point to Moshe in the reward space, at the higher end, the heavy spender end. Let's talk about marketing, marketing and media spend obviously dropped dramatically in the second quarter and since then activity has steadily increased. We get our data on a bit of a lag basis, but I feel it's very likely that marketing levels are now at or above pre-pandemic levels. The rewards offerings remain intense. And let's talk about some of the elements of that. Upfront bonuses have actually been relatively stable with some modest increases, mainly in the travel space and likely in anticipation of returning demand. As far as for rewards earned on spend, we've seen additional categories like groceries and restaurants qualify for enhanced rewards over the past year. And while the shifts have slowed down, reward levels overall remain high. And we've even seen a couple of a few competitors talk about still planning to be tinkering with their rewards here. So I think it's a very natural thing that's happened with spending having been way down. And also some of the things Moshe that are naturally rewarded are not the activities people tend to be doing that much of right now. There's been somewhat of a mixed change and I think a forward lean by the industry on this. So I think it's \u2013 the thing that I've said so often about the card business, these days, I think it's very competitive industry, but there's a rationality to it that I'm pretty struck by and one that I would not use, some of those terms to describe some of the other markets that we're in. So what are we doing, we are continuing to look at our opportunities lean into where we have opportunities. I think we feel good with the general structure of the rewards products we have, but we do know that competition is high and it's probably going to be increasing. We ourselves are going to lean into to marketing and \u2013 but, I don't necessarily see some sort of dramatic changes in the structure of offers out there to change to us the attractiveness of this. Part of the thing is, most of us operate on a relatively thin net margin, because while interchange rates are high, we are passing most of the interchange rates on to consumers in the form of really attractive deals. So pulling way up, we continue to like our opportunities. We have a lot of years of experience with the high level of intensity and I think we should probably prepare for that. Moshe Orenbuch : Then on the other side of the  increases, yeah. Richard Fairbank : Sorry, Moshe. Yeah. So as you know gosh, think about the number of years we talked about even before that the pandemic probably for 18 months, maybe Moshe we were talking about kind of pulling back onlines when the \u2013 we were \u2013 the recovery was so long in the tooth and we saw some of the things going on in the marketplace. So we took a pretty conservative policy with lines. And then during the pandemic, we took a particularly conservative strategy with lines. And so that contains some potential energy, as we've always talked about. It turns into kinetic energy when of course, we grant the line increases and there's more opportunity for people to spend. And the opening of lines has been something we've been doing over the last number of months. It's been kind of invisible with \u2013 to the outside world in terms of growth, because it's getting washed over by the extraordinary payment rates, but we continue to see an opportunity to open up some of the lines gradually and Moshe, I think that represents an extra part of growth opportunity. We're not doing anything really dramatic, but it's just part of the gradual leaning into the opportunity with what we're seeing with the performance of our customers. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening. I'll ask my questions upfront on efficiency. Rich, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about the strategic significance of your physical branch footprint? Is there any room for the branch optimization, either to fund further investments in the digitization of the business or simply extract greater efficiencies? And then also, if you could give us an update on the cloud migration, that would be great. Andrew Young : Okay. Bill, so let me start with the branches, as you know Capital One has over the years sort of leaned into the closing branches in conjunction with our building of our more national banking business, and also the \u2013 all the digital investments we were making, because we spent so much energy on creating an experience that doesn't need to have a branch on every corner. And we've been pleased with our strategy so far. But there's \u2013 we don't, I think there's more of a continuation of where we are, I think we're in \u2013 continuing to lean into the same strategy we've had for quite a period of time there. So I wouldn't look at our network and say, wow, there's a huge kind of potential to unleash there. We've just been gradually making our choices and continuing to develop our digital opportunities, watching customer behavior and then just continue down the same path. With respect to our cloud strategy, as you know we completely exited data centers last year. So we are 100% in the cloud. And we are enjoying the benefits of being in the public cloud, the hassle free access to infrastructure. The ability to ride the incredible wave of innovation that's happening on the cloud, both from the cloud providers as well as from the rest of the world software companies that are building on the cloud. So this is something we've been, you know many years in the making and we're happy to be all-in on the cloud. But it doesn't mean our journey is done on the cloud we find as we get there, there's \u2013 the opportunity to build many more capabilities, the opportunity to really enhance resilience, operating resilience, fail over capabilities, efficiency, the ability to over time move. Basically one of the real benefits of the cloud is the ability to abstract the developers from being burdened with the details of the infrastructure that they're operating on. And the cloud itself is in an abstractor of that the infrastructure worked for a developer, but within \u2013 if you just look at what's happening to cloud, the continuing migration sort of abstracting up the tech stack and where cloud has gone with containers, and now where it's going with serverless, just continues to liberate developers so that they can focus on doing what they came to do, which is to create great things and ship products. Now, all of that doesn't happen automatically, companies have to continue to stay on the forefront. So Capital One is continuing to invest in the serverless side of the business for example, as we continue to move the level of abstraction up the tech stack and create opportunity for the software to be developed faster, more effectively and safer. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good afternoon. Richard Fairbank : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I had a couple of questions one on \u2013 just Rich, in thinking about the marketing investment spend and also the opportunity to pick up some new customers. Just wanted to understand the kind of timeframe that you think you'll be getting that return on investment relative to maybe pre-COVID? And I'm wondering if it might be a longer timeframe to get that return on investment, given the stimulus that's in people's pockets right now, or could it be the same because the target market you're going after is not a stimulus receiver, just trying to think out loud about how that's going to happen? Richard Fairbank : Well, the first thing to think about marketing always is good marketing, while it can influence balance levels, marketing is really about growth of a franchise, growth of accounts and building brand and those kinds of things. So I think a way to think about the pandemic is that it took a company like Capital One and our card business, and just set us back like 15% behind the starting line. And that's a pretty jarring thing to happen in our flagship business in a very successful and profitable business, but this whole payment phenomenon essentially did that. Now in that context, as we start farther behind the starting line, as we look at the opportunity to grow accounts, the opportunity to build the franchise, the opportunity to get out there with some of our really great digital products and things like this, the ability to \u2013 and of course on the banking side, the ability to grow the national bank that is still very \u2013 that opportunity is still very much there. And isn't really \u2013 it isn't really that changed by the pandemic. Now on the outstanding side, first of all have the pay-down story. So that definitely is pushing us and others farther back, all other things being equal. There's the \u2013 sort of the issue for how much credit demand there that we'll see from folks on that. We certainly have the spend weakness on the travel side of the business as well. So I think that we feel the effectiveness of our marketing in building the franchise is very much like it was before. The outstandings metrics of the company started farther behind and they have headwinds to them. But \u2013 since we've always talked about, if payment rates stay high, we're going to have to live with all the great credit performance that we have, and the earnings and the ability to distribute capital. So the benefits come in a different way, but we are very focused on continuing to build the franchise. And I think Capital One is in a similar position to do that as we were pre-pandemic in many ways, maybe even a little bit better position, because we're farther along on our tech transformation. Do you have follow-up Betsy? Operator : We'll take our final question this evening from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Afternoon, thanks for fitting me in here. You've talked about competition quite a bit on this call, but maybe an extension at it, I guess, how does the calculus of competition change with all these Neo banks and the other kind of digital product platforms you're competing for first time customers? Does it change anything with respect to the opportunity set? Richard Fairbank : John, let's talk about that from a couple of perspectives. First of all, as I often say, Capital One was one of the original fintechs before anybody used that word. So I think fintechs are particularly near and dear to my heart and I watch with tremendous interest. The growth of fintechs, there are some of the really clever innovation they're coming up with, we should all know of course, that all of these fintechs are born in the cloud, they're starting with modern technology, and that already gives them a bunch of advantages relative to a lot of banks. I think, Capital One being in the cloud, I think has been \u2013 it's in a sort of much better position competitively relative to that, but we \u2013 what we should all favor about the fintechs is the modern tech platform they have and that's \u2013 it's always \u2013 and I think those advantages are larger nowadays than they were in the past, because the difference between being built on a modern tech stack versus not is just a greater advantage and something that's motivated us to do a very big tech transformation as you know. So the \u2013 and the fintechs journey is not just sort of use some clever technology, they're also very much positioning themselves to take advantage of some of the opportunities to gather more data, different data than typically gathered and to leverage it in real time, so there are some bunch of impressive things there. When we look at the fintechs, we are both generally impressed. We think that they do represent threats to the business, but to us I think they are very much also just a good examples of the kind of innovation that's possible and the kind of innovation that companies like Capital One who are in the cloud with on a modern tech stack, the kind of things that we can do as well. So we look at it from that perspective and we fire it, worrying and inspiring at the same time. Then you have the lending side of business. I want to make a special comment about lending. Half an hour ago, I put a caution note out there that we've got to \u2013 that I worry about we are in the marketplace lending goes from here with people building models that are looking at a recession that was very, very unusual with sort of spectacular credit. And I worry particularly about fintechs who are not that experienced in some of the credit choices they can do and the impact on our marketplace. So I think the fintechs and you can see in the commentary by banks, I think banks are becoming a lot more sort of realizing the scale, the growth, the collective size of the growth rate and the innovation that the fintechs are bringing. And they're going to be a force to reckon with, and to us there are continued impetus that we've got to lean forward, we've got to continue on our tech transformation, and we need to lead the way ourselves with innovation. John Hecht : Appreciate that. Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Thank you. Jeff Norris : Well, thanks everyone for joining us on the conference this evening, and thanks for your interest in Capital One. And as a reminder, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you might have. Have a great night everybody.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question and answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Holly. And welcome everyone to Capital One's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2021 results. With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release. Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff. And good afternoon everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $3.5 billion or $7.62 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter was a $55 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter was $7.71. On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings increased slightly in the sequential quarter to $3.4 billion. We recorded a provision benefit of $1.2 billion in the quarter as $541 million of charge-offs with offset by a $1.7 billion allowance release. Revenue grew 4% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the impact of a strong domestic card purchase volume on non-interest income, and the absence of the mark on our Snowflake investment a quarter ago. Period-end loans held for investments grew $6.5 billion or 3%, inclusive of the effect of moving $4.1 billion of loans to held for sale during the quarter. The loans moved to held for sale consisted of $2.6 billion of an international card partnership portfolio and $1.5 billion in commercial loans. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in the quarter. We released $1.7 billion of allowance, primarily driven by observed strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook. Turning to Slide 5, we provide to be allowance coverage ratios by segment. You can see allowance coverage declined in the quarter across all segments, largely reflecting the dynamics I just described. However, coverage ratios remain well above pre-pandemic levels due to continued economic uncertainty as our allowance is built to absorb a wide range of outcomes. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew. And good evening everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2020, more than offsetting a modest year-over-year decline in loan balance and provision for credit losses improved significantly. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Side 11. Second quarter results reflect building momentum in our domestic card business. As we emerge from the pandemic, consumers are spending more and continuing to make elevated payments. Accelerating purchase volume growth partially offset the impact of historically high payment rates resulting in strong revenue growth and a more modest year-over-year decline in loan balances. High payment rates are continuing to contribute to strikingly strong credit results. Domestic card purchase volume for the second quarter was up 48% from the second quarter of 2020. Purchase volume was up 25% from the second quarter of 2019, which is an acceleration from the first quarter when we saw a growth of 17% versus 2019. T&E spending continues to catch up to overall spending and accelerated through the second quarter. In June, T&E purchase volume was up 3% compared to June of 2019. At the end of the quarter, domestic card loan balances were down $4.1 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held for sale last year, second quarter ending loans declined about 2% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending loans were up about 5% ahead of typical seasonal growth of 2%. Jeff Norris : Thanks, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question, plus a single follow-up. If you have follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Holly, please start the Q&A. Operator : Absolutely. Thank you so much.  Our first question today will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good evening. Want to see if I can get your thoughts on the payment rates. Did you see a peak in the quarter? And if not, if you can talk about the timing of inflection? And then separately, how does that impact your growth assumption for card receivables and the timing on that front? Thanks. Andrew Young : You know, John, in our card business, payment rates remain at historically high levels. And as you know, government stimulus has been amplifying payment rates. And while these programs have been winding down, customer balance sheets are extremely healthy and payment rates remain elevated. You can see the payment rate trends in our reported trust metrics. And while not a perfect reflection of our total portfolio, Q2 payment rates remain at historically high levels and these high payment rates are muting balance growth even as spend is very strong. And of course, the flip side of high payment rates is strikingly strong credit performance, which drives strong profitability and capital generation. So, we actually are always happy when our customers are paying in high levels and it's indicative of a healthy consumer. And those high-payment rates correlate with the really strong credit results that we continue to see. We are -- if we look at the monthly numbers, we can see, John, a little bit of easing of the payment rates. I don't know if that would be a trend to indicate. It's certainly would be very plausible to me that as consumers now step up and spend more and more and they're going out, returning hopefully back to normal, it would be a natural thing that payment rates would ease a little bit here and that also credit metrics would move toward normalizing a little bit. So I guess, John, I would say, we've seen the earliest of indications of that. It's still running at really quite a breathtaking level. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Rich, putting together the comments you made about the significant amount of excess capital and then the comment in the release about seeing increasing near-term opportunities to build your franchise, could you talk a little bit about whether you're looking at primarily kind of organic opportunities or inorganic ones as well? Richard Fairbank : Moshe, as you know well because you've been there from the beginning in following us and having great insights. We really built our company as sort of wired for organic growth. We installed that in the founding days, what I call horizontal accounting where we track every action and cohort, and everything on a lifetime economic basis and we measure it before and during and afterward to see how it's going. And that -- and so, we always put organic at the top of the list. And here is a great example. I mean, while every bank that's -- every National Bank that's been created has come through many, many acquisitions. We've had some acquisitions in our journey but we are really leaning into an organically driven national growth strategy in banking. So -- and as I said a few minutes ago, we see good organic growth opportunities, which are partly a function of the market and where it is right now and very much these opportunities stand on the shoulders of the technology that we've built in some of the innovations that we're rolling out. On -- with respect to acquisitions, we're not putting any energy or strategic focus on doing bank acquisitions. What we are looking at is technology acquisitions. And really, in fact, there is a spectrum on the technology side with respect to FinTechs and tech companies on the continuum at one end is, just being a partner with them and then next notch on the continuum is being a partner and an investor in them. And you saw that with Snowflake for example and then there are some times acquisitions. All of those have -- we've been active in all of those places on the continuum over the last few years, and I'm struck by the traction and success that we're having. When we look back at some of the acquisitions of little FinTechs for example and tech companies, we are very, very pleased with the performance and in many ways, these things are generally outperforming. One of the big benefits that we have is that we have a modern tech stack so do the FinTechs or tech companies that we're buying. And so, the integration and the compatibility, the ability to attract and then really retain the talent past the -- sort of the contractual period is something that I think leans in our favor. So, lots of positives there. There is one big kind of elephant in the room with respect to acquisitions on the tech side and that's the valuations. So, we've recently gone to several -- a few of these conversations and said, love the company but not at that price. So, we are very aware about the -- where pricing is but strategically, I think if you kind of open the aperture and don't talk about necessarily this very moment, I think for Capital One it's an organic-first strategy but acquisitions of FinTechs and tech companies at the right price, usually be little ones, I think will help fill out our business and accelerate our opportunities. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : Absolutely. Next, we'll hear from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Thank you. Considering the -- we saw in the first -- during 2020, do you expect normalized credit to maybe run below pre-pandemic levels as we go into 2022 and eventually into 2023? Richard Fairbank : Kevin,  hearing that. But I think we -- it was a little echoey but I think we -- I felt I heard what you were saying there, Kevin. From where we are right now, which is at an extraordinary benign level that virtually has never been seen before in modern times. It's got a ways to go to normalize. We are not choosing to make a prediction on where that is because we want to be coy about it, but because in fact, I think it's a hard thing to predict these days. What we like to talk about is the drivers. So, talking about the drivers, the consumer is in a very strong place right now. And I think what's striking is, and I mentioned this earlier, when you look at what the average consumer and this is average because the experience for an individual consumer can be way different from what I'm describing on average. But the accumulated sort of surplus that consumers have been able to build up is something that even when the government stimulus monthly benefits ease , I think there is a bit of accumulated balance there that will be beneficial for the credit performance of consumers. The -- so we -- there's really only one way for the credit to go from here and that is in normalizing. I think it starts with a bit of a head start and I think that the rate at which it normalizes is going to be pretty linked to consumers' choices on payment rates. And as I mentioned earlier, I think it's a natural thing for payment rates to gradually decline and for credit to gradually normalize. The directions are inevitable, the timing is speculative. Our view is during this period of time let's take advantage of the market opportunity that is here, the place the consumer is but let's also be cognizant of how markets work -- how credit markets work in particular and be on the lookout for some of the natural indicators of overheating. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Look, we're -- and this topic has come up a couple of times. We're looking at the reserve rates and thinking about them in the context of day one reserve levels. I'm curious how you now reflect on day one allowance coverage and what that could look like on a long-term basis as we return to normal? I'm curious in particular, if you think some of the policy initiatives we've seen during the crisis change your long-term outlook in terms of potential loss rates?, Andrew Young : Thanks, Rick. This is Andrew. I'll take that. I think as we look at the allowance, every quarter we're going to take into account a large number of variables and assumptions which would certainly take policy and other factors. And so, as I reflect back on the ratio that we had upon adoption, a lot of things have changed since then. And so, within every single asset class, the mix is going to impact our coverage needs and then you look at overall the balance sheet mix across each of those asset classes will impact things. So, I look at all of those factors and I don't think that the ratio at adoption is necessarily a destination. But I also think that if you put into the formula, like all of the economic assumptions and all of the asset mix, I still believe that the pre-pandemic coverage ratio can still serve as a very rough benchmark of what coverage ratios might look like. But again, it will take into account each successive quarter all of the things that we're looking at in terms of the mix and broad economic assumptions, including policy as you mentioned. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good afternoon. Andrew Young : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Just a question here on how you're thinking about the opportunity to invest for that account growth. You indicated the account growth is up, maybe give us a sense as to how much more it's up unusual? I know you usually don't give numbers for that, but it would be helpful to understand the benefit that those marketing dollars is generating today? And then how much more you think the opportunity set is here to ramp up the marketing in the back half of the year given the opportunity set that you have in front of you? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Betsy, yeah, we don't tend to give out the specific account growth numbers, the origination numbers. But they are strong right now. They're not the strongest that we have ever seen. And we're pleased that they're really quite strong because obviously, there was some weakness a year ago in those kind of numbers. So, we have seen a very solid performance. We feel really good about the account originations. So, we are leaning further into marketing to drive future growth and also to just continue to build the underlying franchise. And as we've said, these opportunities are partly because of what the market has to give right now and partly opportunities that are enhanced by our technology transformation. And the marketing of course is especially going into the card side of the business, but also -- just look on TV, you've seen us steadily investing in national banking. We're very happy with how that's going. And you may have seen for the first time this quarter that we have now gone on National TV in the auto side. So, these are advertising that is debuting some of the technology innovations that we have at Capital One, some of the exceptional customer experiences that we've built. And we're seeing good traction in the origination side of the business. And so, we continue to lean into marketing. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hey, Rich. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the tech spend outlook. I saw a report that Capital One was hiring a large amount of software programmers to take advantage of the public cloud move. And then you mentioned FinTech, I was just curious if you thought that the regulatory landscape whenever balance out or is that sort of something that's not going to happen? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Yes, Don. Thank you. So, let me talk about tech and the tech hiring. Winning in technology really kind of begins and ends with one thing, hiring world-class tech talent. And it is the easiest thing to talk about and possibly the hardest thing to pull off in business today. As -- you know, because while this principal is -- this talent principle is true in any business. It is profoundly true in technology as the demand for world-class tech talent vastly exceeds the supply. So, we've built a tech brand and have had great success in attracting top talent. And we're competing head-to-head with the leading technology companies in the US. And we've been leaning into tech hiring for years and this is a strong year of hiring. Most of the new roles we're hiring for are engineering roles in software development, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning. And these are the most sought-after roles in the world and we're getting real traction here. But essentially, if you pull way up and we -- it's more than just words when we say it, we've really been living this which is to from the ground up build a technology company that does banking essentially, what Capital One is. The technology and data are increasingly what the business is and at the heart of that journey is the tech talent. I also mentioned one other thing, Don, is that the cost of technology talent is visibly moving upward right in front of our eyes and I wanted to flag that to investors. That is just something that -- again, it's the natural consequence of the demand greatly exceeding the supply. But -- so I think it's going to be hard for most companies, for all companies to do hiring and get the numbers that they want. We are leaning into that. I think we're in a very good position. But it's -- we're going to need to pay appropriately for that talent. Don, you asked about FinTechs and what we feel about FinTechs, and possibly a comment on the regulatory side. I just have a tremendous interest in FinTechs, maybe that's because Capital One was an original FinTechs before there was such a word. And I look at the FinTech marketplace and I think some of these FinTechs are bringing great innovations to the market. And we very carefully study these innovations and I think that we look at these both as threats to our business, we look at them as opportunities. Maybe we can partner with the FinTechs, in some case, their acquisitions associated with that, and in some cases what they are doing as beacons of opportunity that we can pursue. The FinTechs today, I think what banks have to stare at is that FinTechs today are benefiting from their modern cloud-based technologies and their innovative and entrepreneurial approach to disrupting  markets, the tremendous amount of funding that is out there. I mean for example, these days, the venture capital funding going into FinTechs is close to I think, I don't have this data right in front of me, but it is close to double the next category in terms of the amount of venture funding going into this. So this is pretty electrifying. And the FinTechs benefited from a lower level of regulation than financial institutions have. Now, I don't think, right now, the success of FinTechs that one can look at FinTechs and say the primary reason they're succeeding in areas, sometimes more than the banks are, is because they are less regulated. I think they are succeeding for the factors that we talked about. I think when you look over time and envision these FinTechs with tremendous growth and being large disruptors, it is an elephant in the room relative to what's the regulatory context, the capital that they're going to be carrying, the regulatory requirements, and the levelness of the playing field. So, we certainly have a watchful eye on that. But when we look at the FinTechs, the success we're seeing in them, to me is indicative of the opportunity that exists to re-imagine banking. And that's what we've been focused on for years. And then if we kind of take our focus off of Fintechs for a minute and think about Capital One, like the FinTechs, we have a modern technology infrastructure based in the cloud. We also have other benefits they don't have. I have mentioned most of them. We have tremendous customer scale, a powerful brand, and literally decades of underwriting and banking experience. So, when I pull up, I think we and the FinTechs are well-positioned for success in some ways for the same reasons, in some ways for different reasons. But I think the biggest takeaway of all of this is that the banking industry is changing on an accelerated basis. The competition is unbelievably and increasingly well-funded and we look at that and we say it indicates the magnitude of change, the magnitude of the opportunity, but it also is a -- indicates an imperative that we need to make sure that during the windows of opportunity that we lean in and invest where we need to invest, because these opportunities won't last forever. Thank you, Don. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. I guess I had a follow-up question on the opportunity in US card for growth. I assume a lot of the account growth that you're seeing right now is coming in the super-prime or the transactor space because of the growth in transaction volumes. Is that correct? And I guess, if we think about the subprime consumer, maybe you could just talk about what their behaviors are today? And how do you see growth from that segment unfolding? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Sanjay, the -- certainly, what's the biggest newsworthy thing that's happening in the short run is the surge on the super-prime side, the return to travel and entertainment spend powered a lot by heavy spenders. And that you just can feel in a sense the world pent up and just bursting out. And I think that's sort of the biggest news that we see inside our numbers as we look at it. The subprime business I think has been more characteristic of in general, the sort of mass-market of America. And that is -- that things have not been as dramatic in terms of pullbacks nor are they -- is dramatic in terms of leaning in. But we've just continued to take the same strategy we've had in the subprime business really, in the prime business for years and we are carefully leaning into originations and growing the underlying franchise. And then at the right opportunities, raising the lines when we feel that the opportunity and the conditions warrant. So, we continue to lean into originations really, across our business and we are opening up credit lines -- gradually opening up credit lines because we see good results, the consumer is in a pretty good position, our customers are in a good place. And you remember, Sanjay, we talked about the sort of years of holding back on that. It's not like we're unleashing the credit lines right now, but we are sort of net-net more on the opening up side than the tightening side at the moment. And that's of course with a watchful eye on all the key indicators and things that naturally will change because of our credit market's work. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey. Good evening, everyone. Andrew Young : Hey, Ryan. Ryan Nash : So, Rich, you mentioned several times that you're leaning into marketing. I guess from the outside looking in, how should we assess the return on these investments? Should it come in the form of accelerating growth or improved efficiency? And I guess, Rich, just on the efficiency point, we obviously saw improvement year-over-year for the first time in several quarters. It seems like the top line should be improving. This combined with the technology investments that you're making, at what point do you think you'll be ready to reintroduce the 42% efficiency target or what do we need to see for you to reinstate a timeline for that? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thanks. Well, first a word on marketing. As I said to Betsy, we are leaning into the marketing right now and sort of leaning a little further into it, because what we do is always so windows driven, as you know, Ryan. And so that's where we are in the marketing side. So, from an efficiency point of view, you notice pretty high levels of spending on marketing. That - marketing goes up, marketing goes down, but that at the moment is been more on the upside. Let me turn and - one thing I want to say about competition if I could just because this is very relevant to these growth conversations and then our pivot to the efficiency point. Most competitors have been - the feel of their earnings calls is they too are leaning into the opportunities that they see at the moment. And we see this - we see competition heating up all around us, especially in rewards. Typically, that's kind of the flashpoints where you see these things the most. But you see it in the marketing and the media activity, we see it in direct mail numbers, we see it in the rewards offerings and the heating up of some of that. And competition is intense right now, Ryan, but it's not yet irrational. But I want to just kind of take the moment to reflect on what I call sort of the physics of competitive cycles. Because I've seen this enough that it's pretty much you can count on these things happening, the timing is always the question. But right now, credit is historically good across the industry and the consumer is in great shape. The longer this persists, the more competition will likely be to extrapolate these trends to inform their decision-making. And this can embolden them to make more aggressive offers, market more intensely, and a particular one I worry about, loosening underwriting standards. And in this particular environment, the benign rearview mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth and it could be exacerbated by credit modeling that relies on consumer credit data that frankly may be very unique to the downturn and not as good for predicting where credit performance is going to be over time. Ryan, if you're building a credit model right now and you're looking back at the data on the last year or two, what are you going to do with that with respect to what that tells you about the next time things turn down. So the - and there is also a lot of earnings and capital and liquidity in the system, and then you've got the FinTechs that are really revving up as I talked about earlier. So the - there - even as we're leaning into this opportunity, we remind ourselves every day that the seeds for the next challenges coming up in the credit cycle as opposed to the economic cycle in the credit cycle, these seeds are being planted right now. And so, what we do is, we don't just look at our models to make decisions  way up and we have a very watchful eye for the key indicators of these not only likely, basically inevitable things to happen and then we will act accordingly, we just never want to be surprised. Let me turn to talk about operating efficiency. We've been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years. And from 2013 to 2019, we delivered 400 basis points of improvement with the combination of revenue growth and tight expense management. And of course, the pandemic interrupted our progress, particularly on revenue growth. As it turns out, the pandemic also accelerated the technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and frankly, particularly in banking. And so, as I talked about earlier, I think everyone can feel the clock ticking. Companies, everybody in banking feeling the clock ticking on their tech readiness. The investment flowing into the FinTechs, the arms race for talent. And so, we are struck by the emerging opportunities in the marketplace, they are significant, but the windows aren't unlimited. So, we feel we're very well positioned on this. But, we are continuing to invest in this moment in our technology and in the opportunities that we see out there. So, meanwhile, we continue to focus on operating efficiency. Our tech transformation is the engine of long-term efficiency gains, both through revenue growth and digital productivity gains. So, continuing to invest in our technology opportunities and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path. We're still driving towards the same destination of operating efficiency, but the timing of our operating efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. And delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important pay-offs of our technology journey and a key element of how we deliver long-term shareholder value. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : Absolutely. Next, we'll hear from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Rich, as you think about the process of normalization of payment rates and revolve rates that you described, would you expect that to provide an incremental tailwind to loan growth such that we could actually see loan growth outpace spending growth as we look ahead? Richard Fairbank : I think one of the things that I think the banking industry -- I mean, we've talked about this relationship between payment rates and growth from time to time but I think it's been more of an occasional conversation with the street. And I think the whole banking industry and the investment community has really sort of collectively gone through and learned an important lesson here about the metric that really honestly wasn't talked about that much which is payment rates and the profound impact payment rates has on both loan growth and in fact, credit performance. And the striking thing is, it's not only empirical that relationship, but it's intuitive as well, which to me really reinforces -- there is something very important here. And as I've said to you, we kind of route for higher payment rates. Because I think it reflects a healthier consumer even and we get paid on the credit side and sometimes paid very well as you can see here. But it is a natural thing that will happen over time, the normalization of credit will very likely come along with the lowering of payment rates. And that in turn is likely sort of mathematically all other things being equal, that will be a boost to loan growth. So, when you say will -- but I think for those numbers to move significantly enough to in fact, have loan growth lead the rate of growth relative to metrics like spending and some of the other things or for us originations and things like that, that's got quite a journey to do to get there. I'm not saying that it won't, but I wouldn't run to the bank counting on a loan growth topping the lead tables of the various growth metrics. But I think what is baking -- what really essentially is baking in the oven is a gradual normalization of credit, correspondingly for the same reason a lowering of payment rates. And we are probably seeing the very early -- sort of on a monthly basis, the very early indicators of that phenomenon. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And our final question today comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : Thank you and good afternoon. Rich, appreciate your comments on FinTech and how you're looking at partnering, buying, and et cetera. But I just was hoping to get maybe a little bit more color and your thoughts around what areas of FinTech? I know, it's been a few years since you bought Paribus, the online price tracking. But there's a lot of -- there is, as you talk about all that investment, it's going into a very broad group of -- whether it's buy now pay later, B2B payments, wealth management, business spend management, kind of charge card business spend management areas. So I just wondered what areas are most attractive to you where we would see partnerships or acquisitions? Richard Fairbank : Bob, what we do is -- and you mentioned a bunch of interesting areas, for example. But what we do is rather than say these three areas are our priority areas and let's go look for FinTech. We have a -- and this is one of the -- really, one of the benefits of years on our tech transformation is we see opportunities in a lot of areas across the portfolio of businesses that we're in. And so, rather than say these three here are the priority, let's go see what we can partner with or buy. What we do is we massively study the FinTech marketplace across all the areas that we are also leaning into. Frankly, we study it beyond that because we can learn a lot. So -- and then what we do is, the sheer learning alone is worth the effort. And so, we go to school on this and we try to say -- a bunch of times, we say, wow, look at that. They thought us that idea. We did it in Capital One, they're good or bad but look, let's see what we can learn from that. And -- but also along the way. We look across that continuum of partnering, investing, or buying these things, but if we really look from the other end of the telescope rather than what we need, what we look for is what do we find -- and especially, what do we find relative to a company with the talent and the culture and the business model that would be really accelerative to us. And so, every once in a while we do an acquisition and -- but there is a lot of focus on that particular business model. We always ask ourselves, could we build that rather than buy it. And then we really look hard at the talent, because in the end, what really has made our most successful acquisitions has been that the talent comes, stays, and leads becomes leading executives in the company. And so, that's how it works. And a lot of times, we don't buy anything but we always come out having learned a lot, Bob. Thank you. Jeff Norris : Well. Thanks, everybody for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, Investor Relations team will be available in just a few minutes if you have any further questions. Have a great night.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Keith, and welcome, everybody, to Capital One's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our third quarter 2021 results.  With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and click on Quarterly Earnings Release.  Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. For more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports accessible at Capital One's website and filed with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew? Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $3.1 billion or $6.78 per diluted common share. Included in our results for the quarter was a $45 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter were $6.86.  On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings were $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% relative to a quarter ago. Period-end loans held for investment grew $11.8 billion or 5% as we had strong loan growth across all of our businesses. Recall that we moved $4.1 billion of loans to be held for sale late in the second quarter so average loans in the third quarter grew more modestly at 3%.  Revenue increased 6% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the loan growth I just described, coupled with margin expansion in our Card business. Operating expenses grew 3% in the quarter, with total noninterest expense increasing 6%. In addition to strong pre-provision earnings, the P&L was aided by a provision benefit in the quarter as record low charge-offs were more than offset by an allowance release.  Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. We released $770 million of allowance in the third quarter as the effects of continued actual strong credit performance and a reduction in qualitative factors drove a decline in allowance balance, which was partially offset by loan growth in the quarter. Turning to Slide 5. You can see our allowance coverage ratios continue to decline across all of our segments, driven by the factors I just described.  Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 143%. The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $124 billion, down $13 billion from the prior quarter as we continue to run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic.  The 9% decline in total liquidity was driven by a modest reduction in the size of our investment portfolio and $8 billion in lower ending cash balances, which were used to fund loan growth and share repurchases. The decline in cash balances had an impact on our NIM, which I will discuss in more detail on Page 7.  You can see that our third quarter net interest margin was 6.35%, 46 basis points higher than Q2 and 67 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The linked quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by 4 factors.  First, the decline in average cash balances I just described; second, margin expansion in our Domestic Card business; third, loan growth in our Domestic Card business; and lastly, the benefit of one additional day in the quarter. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by covering our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8% at the end of the third quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets and share repurchases.  We repurchased $2.7 billion of common stock in the third quarter and have approximately $2.6 billion remaining of our current board authorization of $7.5 billion. At the beginning of the third quarter, we began operating under the Federal Reserve's stress capital buffer framework, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital requirement of 7% as of October 1. And however, based on our internal modeling, we continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. Before I turn the call over to Rich, let me describe a few items related to our preferred stock. On October 18, we announced our intention to redeem our outstanding preferred stock Series G and Series H in early December. As a result of the full quarter of recent issuances and a partial quarter of the planned redemptions, we expect fourth quarter preferred dividends to remain elevated at around $74 million.  Looking ahead to Q1, we expect the run rate for preferred dividends to decline to approximately $57 million per quarter, barring additional activity. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth and strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2020 and provision for credit losses improved significantly.  Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. As you can see on Slide 11, third quarter Domestic Card revenue grew 14% year-over-year.  Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 28% year-over-year and up 27% compared to the third quarter of 2019. And the rebound in loan growth continued with ending loan balances up $3.7 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Ending loans also grew 4% from the sequential quarter ahead of typical seasonal growth of around 1%.  Ending loan growth was the result of strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction we're getting with new account originations and line increases, partially offset by continued high payment rates. Payment rates leveled off in the third quarter, but remain near historic highs. The flip side of high payment rates is strong credit and credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.36%, a 228 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 1.93%, a 28 basis points improvement over the prior year. The pace of year-over-year improvement is slowing, particularly for the delinquency rate. Domestic Card revenue margin was up 218 basis points year-over-year to 18.4%. Two factors drove most of the increase. Revenue margin benefited from spend velocity, which is purchase volume growth and net interchange outpacing loan growth and favorable current credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in third quarter revenue as well. This credit-driven revenue impact generally tracks Domestic Card credit trends. Total company marketing expense was $751 million in the quarter, including marketing in card, auto and retail banking. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends.  We continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business. Our loan -- well, our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Turning opportunities into actual growth requires investment. And once again, we're leaning further into marketing to drive growth and to build our franchise. At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Looking ahead, we expect a sequential increase in total company marketing in the fourth quarter that's consistent with typical historical pattern. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to build our franchise. Slide 12 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Consistent auto growth and strong auto credit are the main themes in the third quarter Consumer Banking results. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continue to drive strong growth in our auto business. Driven by auto, third quarter ending loans increased 12% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 12%. Auto originations were up 29% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were down 11% from the exceptionally high level in the second quarter. As we discussed last quarter, pent-up demand and high auto prices had driven a second quarter surge in originations across the auto marketplace. Third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $2.7 billion or 1% year-over-year. Average deposits were also up 1% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue increased 14% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans. Third quarter provision for credit losses improved by $48 million year-over-year, driven by an allowance release in our auto business. Credit results in our auto business remained strong. Year-over-year, the third quarter charge-off rate improved 5 basis points to 0.18% and the delinquency rate improved 11 basis points to 3.65%. Looking at sequential quarter trends, the charge-off rate increase from the unprecedented negative charge-off rate in the second quarter and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 39 basis points from the second quarter, consistent with historical seasonal pattern.  Moving to Slide 13, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were down 2%. Ending deposits grew 18% from the third quarter of 2020, as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Quarterly average deposits also increased 18% year-over-year. Third quarter revenue was up 17% from the prior year quarter and 23% from the linked quarter. Recall that revenue in the second quarter was unusually low due to the impact of moving $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans to held for sale. Commercial credit performance remained strong. In the third quarter, the commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was 5 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.9% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities. I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning.  In the third quarter, we drove strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and new accounts. And loan growth is picking up. Credit remains strikingly strong across our businesses, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. In the marketplace, the pandemic has clearly accelerated digital adoption. The game is changing from new and permanent shifts in virtual and hybrid work to more digital product and exceptional customer experiences to new fintech innovation and business model. The common thread throughout all of this is technology and the stakes are rising faster than ever before. Competitors are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue. The investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and it's growing. We can see investors voting with their feet in stunning fintech valuation. And the war for tech talent continues to escalate, which will drive up tech labor costs even before any headcount increases. All these developments underscore the size of the opportunity for players who lead the way in transforming how banking works. And Capital One is very well positioned to do just that. We are in the ninth year of our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up. We were in original fintech, and we have built modern technology capabilities at scale. But what is also clear in the marketplace is that the time frames for investment and innovation are compressing. The imperative to invest is now. We have been on a long journey to drive down operating efficiency ratio powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains. Our journey will need to incorporate the investment imperative of the rapidly changing marketplace, and it is likely to pressure operating efficiency ratio along the way. Pulling way up, we're living through an extraordinary time of accelerating digital change. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our opportunity. It's setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking and it's the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term.  And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Keith, please start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So Rich, you talked about competition across the industry has intensified, you noted in both traditional players and fintechs. And yet, it seems like your strategy is working as evidenced by the better-than-peer growth metrics and credit. So I was just wondering, can you maybe just talk about the competitive environment you're seeing out there? How does it compare to maybe the middle part of the last decade? Where we saw competition accelerate? And where do you think it goes from here? And then I guess, maybe wrap that in with what does it mean for growth for the company? And I have 1 follow-up question. Richard Fairbank : Okay. Ryan, great question. So what -- there's -- let me really talk about the card competition that's probably the heart of your questions here, but we can also expand on that. But in Domestic -- in the Card business, competition has definitely intensified, especially in rewards. Marketing and media activity are I would say, approaching pre-pandemic levels and competitors continue to lean into marketing and originations. Direct mail is back to 2019 levels. Originations have also recovered across the industry and are above pre-pandemic levels. The pricing continues to be mostly stable. Our rewards offerings have become richer, and we continue to watch that very closely. We saw some modest increases in upfront bonuses, mainly in the form of limited time offers and in travel as demand returns.  Our rewards earned rates have also increased with some of the new product structures introduced recently, particularly in the cashback space. And of course, there's also a lot of increasing activity with fintechs, such as buy-now-pay-later, installment lending, and we talked about the breathtaking levels of investment by venture capital into that industry. So -- and by the way, all of this is incredibly natural how a market should be reacting. If we didn't see everything that I just described to you, I would wonder if I woke up in the wrong place. This is incredibly natural. But in the context of this increased competition, we continue to see good opportunities for growth, which are enhanced by our tech transformation.  And we're keeping a close eye on competition, looking for adverse selection that may come as a result of that. And we are underwriting with the expectation of higher losses in the future. Now you asked for a comparison, Ryan, about how does this compare with the last decade. Certainly, in the middle of the last decade, competition in the credit card space really started picking up. But -- and some of the descriptors I would use here, I would use there in the sense that more spending on marketing and originations being kind of robust for the industry. Back then, we saw a bunch of things that we really don't see now, but we'll have to keep it out and eye out for that. What we saw back then is very aggressive behavior in ways that was more than just marketing. It really was in the form of looser underwriting. And in practices, some consumer practices that we did not feel were fully in the customer's interest. So there were a lot of things to react to in that marketplace. And if you look back Capital One's loan growth kind of slowed in the card business as we moderated in the face of what we thought was competition that was over the top and that was going to not only make it more costly to originate, but much more importantly, could impact the quality of -- the credit quality of what is being booked. So we do not feel right now that we're at a time like that, we have to be on the lookout for natural things that happens as competitors continue to heed up their efforts to grow. But I think we're in a pretty good period, Ryan, right now in the marketplace. And for Capital One, as indicated by my comment about marketing, we see good opportunities. We're leaning into that. And we have our having learned over the years and seen a lot of things, Ryan, we're going to have our eye out for things that we think are over the top. Ryan Nash : And if I can just ask one quick follow-up. I know credit is as good as it's ever been. And I know you don't have a crystal ball, but yours is probably better than mine. So I was wondering that given that this downturn has been like no other, how are you thinking about the trajectory of credit over an intermediate time frame? Do you think we could run well below normal for an extended period of time? Or do you think there is the risk of fast normalization as the industry has become more concerned about? Richard Fairbank : Well, I think we are, Ryan, certainly in a pretty extraordinary -- well, not even pretty extraordinary. We're in an extraordinary place from a credit point of view, and I'm speaking of the industry, and obviously, Capital One as well. And not only for our Credit Card business, but also really across the board at Capital One. So as we think about where it could go from here, let's think a little bit about what's driving where it is. So obviously, the high level of consumer support through the government stimulus has been a factor. Although that's mostly in the rearview mirror, there's some lingering benefits in terms of the consumer balance sheet that come from that. But this will be a good time to watch how credit performs in the -- basically in the absence of that. We've also had widespread industry forbearance and consumers themselves have behave very rationally through this period of uncertainty, generally saving more spending less and paying down debt. And then on top of that, we've seen strong labor markets so far this year with very high demand for workers, solid wage growth, which should support consumers as government stimulates stimulus expires. So where does everything go from here? It feels inevitable that losses will increase from the exceptionally low levels of the past year and of where we are. But I think the timing -- it's much easier to have conviction about what will happen and the timing of that. We're looking for signs of normalization, card delinquencies ticked up modestly in August and September. Although this is the time of year when we tend to see seasonal increases in delinquencies.  So we -- this is just a -- I think this is a very strong time. And the I think most companies are enjoying the strength that most banks enjoying the strength that they have. I think they're leaning into their opportunities. And for Capital One, I think our opportunities are particularly good because of the technology that we -- the shoulders that we stand on. But with a watchful eye for normalization that will absolutely inevitably happen. And by the way, when it happens, that's normal. That's not necessarily alarming at all. It would be surprising if it didn't happen, but we'll just watch out for the extremes of behavior and in the meantime, lean into our opportunities. Operator : We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Rich, you talked a lot about the competitive dynamic in the credit card industry and talked about some steps you're taking from an underwriting standpoint to kind of make up for that. Could you talk a little bit about how you think about the ability to expand credit lines for your customers? Because that's always been a big factor in terms of generating kind of ongoing loan growth and strong spreads. I do have a follow-up question. Richard Fairbank : Yes. So Moshe, we are -- as you know, we talked about continuing our originations going in prior years, sometimes while we were holding back on line with the caution about the environment that we were in. And we talked about the coiled spring that, that represents.  And so we always take the philosophy of trying to continue to build the underlying franchise and then expand the lines as we see validation about the strength of the marketplace and the strength of the individual customers. And we are gradually increasing credit lines, nothing too dramatic, but consistent with how we're leaning in, in general. We are increasing credit lines gradually. So that will be another boost on the loan growth side. Moshe Orenbuch : Got you. And just as a follow-up, you talked about the potential for pressure on the efficiency ratio. I mean, you've had some pretty strong revenue growth. Could you talk about -- I mean, obviously, one would think that, that kind of helps from the standpoint of being able to fund the investment. Could you talk about what factors would drive periods of time where that efficiency ratio would be pressured versus times would be improving? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Well, look, revenue growth is the best friend of efficiency ratio, as you point out, Moshe. And our philosophy, I think some companies sort of drive -- try to drive a very sustained efficiency ratio improvement by just squeezing cost out and we're certainly trying to drive a lot of efficiencies from technology. But our philosophy is certainly that leaning into investing in technology and in growth opportunities can be an engine for revenue growth, and that, combined with digital efficiencies can help drive a sustained long-term improvement in efficiency ratio. And of course, we've enjoyed something like a 400 basis point improvement in efficiency ratio from 2013 to 2019 when the pandemic kind of interrupted our process. The reason I pointed out the -- my comment about efficiency ratio a few minutes ago was pointing out some of the pressures on the cost side that really come from the sweeping digital change that's transforming the marketplace and the compressed time frame for investment and innovation. And -- so new and traditional competitors embracing the need to invest in technology, the arms race for tech talent is fierce. And in fact, it's the biggest talent arms race that I've seen in my 3 decades of building Capital One. And that Moshe, that's a disappointing one because that raises the tied level of tech costs without generating in a sense, any benefits directly from that. And just talking about the fintechs for a minute. Here's some striking data. Investments in fintechs through the first 3 quarters of this year has been more than $90 billion or on an annualized basis, of course, that's $120 billion, and that's more than double last year's total.  And I mean those are just breathtaking investment numbers. And that's a huge assault on our industry from a kind of a defensive point of view as we react to that. But also, I look at this and say, that's a clear indication that banking is ripe for transformation, which we have believed for many, many years. So this all shows up in the need to invest both in technology itself and in leading digital products to gain competitive advantage and the clock is ticking.  So we're in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace, and we have invested for years to build a modern tech stack. We have a deep heritage in big data and analytics. And we have a large customer franchise and a national brand. So I really like our positioning and our chances, but we do have to invest to capitalize on the opportunity. So Moshe, the pulling way up -- the pressures come really from 2 things, which both derived from one thing, which is the rapidly changing marketplace. So you've got the cost pressure in terms of tech wages and the compressing time frames for innovation across the industry. And we just wanted to share that with investors and that we are leaning in to capitalize on this opportunity. And all other things being equal, that pressures' efficiency ratio. Of course, when you pull way up everything I just talked about, maybe not so much the tech labor cost. But the investment imperative is in service of the same longer-term objectives, enhancing growth, building a franchise and very importantly, driving greater efficiency. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Rich, I wanted to understand in the spend numbers that you generated in the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense as to what you're seeing in terms of where there's been change at the margin? Has this spend been accelerating in any specific type of customer, maybe the higher end or the starter routers. And then the degree to which you think that's sustainable here going forward, what are you sensing in terms of spend trajectory from here? And then I have a follow-up. Could you hear me, okay? Andrew Young : Betsy, this is Andrew. I can hear you, but we had Rich on mute for a second. Richard Fairbank : I was on mute, sorry. Let me start over, Betsy. Great, It was so eloquent. I can't repeat what I said now. But the spend growth is really an across-the-board thing from mass market customers to the heavy spenders that we have in our portfolio. And virtually every spend category is up, and it's up over -- it's up over last year. It's up over 2 years ago. The only laggard versus 2 years ago -- I shouldn't say laggard. Basically, the travel and entertainment category has kind of caught up with where it was 2 years ago.  But given that you saw our overall purchase volume numbers are up 27% compared to 2019. It just kind of shows you how much -- pretty much all the rest of the categories are surging ahead. So that's partly a comment on the marketplace. And it's also partly a comment about Capital One and our -- the traction that we're getting in spend across our business. Obviously, you can see from our marketing and from our products, and we've spent years investing in building a spender franchise. And we -- the numbers that we've been posting are indicative of a lot of traction there. Now I'm going to -- I'm not going to give guidance on where it's going to go from here. I think it's got good momentum. But also, I think consumers have been sort of making up for lost time. And I think as they break out being so cooped up in the pandemic, the spend levels have been up. And we'll see where things go from here, but we certainly carry quite a bit of momentum into the marketplace. And the purchase volume success ends up being -- giving a boost to the outstanding growth of Capital One, which, of course, like all the banks is still being constrained somewhat by the high payment rates. But we were really happy to see that even the outstanding growth is -- the needle started to move there in the quarter. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Just the other follow-up question I had has to do with how you think about not only the cost per account, but the value of that account and how long it takes for that account to become at run rate? I asked because you mentioned earlier how the competition is quite hot. So you might -- someone might come away from this call thinking, okay, cost to acquire account is up, but then the value of that account getting to full run rate levels, how do you feel about that in this environment versus what you've seen in the past? Is that something that takes a 12- to 18-month time frame or given where we are with the job growth inflation pick up all that, is it possible that there's a longer tail on the value of the accounts that you're generating today? Richard Fairbank : So the time to pay back for any of the originations we do, obviously, is dependent on the particular segment. But we've been investing for years and not just spending money on marketing, but spending money on building the franchise of Capital One. And the building a brand, creating the really exceptional technology that powers the products that we have with customers, creating exceptional customer experiences. And I think what we are seeing is the continued benefit of our investment in the franchise. Now we talked about leaning into marketing, which we have been doing and -- as I said, we're continuing to do that. We see good opportunities in the places we've been investing for years. And while there is increasing competition, we continue to see a good origination traction and a cost per account originated that is very reasonable for us by our historical standards. And we really like everything we see about the early performance of the things that we're booking. So that would suggest, let's see that the value of these accounts should be strong. And so given all of this, we see opportunity to continue as we've been going and keep a close eye on things that may change in the marketplace one segment at a time. But for right now, we think the opportunities are good and the return on the growing investment that we have had is good. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : Rich, look, you've been very clear about the opportunity, generally speaking, in terms of technology. When we think about technology, I think there are probably 4 places or 4 opportunities. It's product, it's customer experience, it's back office, and it's potentially underwriting and adding value there.  I'm curious, when you think about those 4 factors or those 4 elements, where you see the biggest opportunity to enhance return? And are you seeing misuse of technology and people driving bad decisions or bad outcomes on any of these factors? Richard Fairbank : So hello, Rick. And all the areas that you mentioned are opportunity areas. I think that the list is even more expansive than what you have, but I certainly agree with the 4 because I'm looking at products, customer experience, back office and underwriting. And I -- let me just kind of think through some of the real opportunity areas for us. And importantly, what I want to say is and what I'm going to talk about here stands on the shoulders of our modern tech stack and we're working to build breakthrough capabilities and solutions. For example, our new marketing platforms leverage big data streaming in real time to reach more customers with the right offers and driving to improve and optimize conversion rates.  Our new credit decisioning platforms enable us to use way more data and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to make better credit decisions. our new fraud platform enables us to approve more transactions for our customers while simultaneously reducing fraud costs. And just let me pause on fraud for a second because one thinks that while investing in fraud is really important, of course, to getting fraud cost down because fraud costs have continued to sort of rise in the industry. But it's also the opportunity -- having breakthroughs in the management of fraud creates an opportunity on the customer experience side and the business opportunities we have. I'll give you 2 examples. One is in credit cards for very heavy spenders, where the card always works is an incredibly important battle cry in -- at the top of the marketplace. And so the spillover benefits there are significant and also in building a national digital bank. So if a bank just goes out there and hang out a shingle and say come on in and have folks sign up for digital bank accounts. It turns out while fraud rates in the branches or people -- if they want to commit fraud, they don't typically walk into a branch to commit account opening fraud.  But it's very easy to do that online. So what we have found is that our heavy investment in fraud has been instrumental to our national banking strategy that you see featured on TV and the ability to really, on a mass basis, open up accounts nationwide and be comfortable with respect to the fraud cost. So the -- so we've been talking about some of the risk management side. Let me also say just another key area, not really directly on your list, but sort of risk management beyond just underwriting or fraud is, as you know, just banks, the business. Risk management is the business. And the ability to automate risk management process is the ability to move to a 100% monitoring all the time in real time of things that were otherwise just sampled. There's just a lot of benefits that come from transforming how we work. Then to your customer experience category, we're building growing franchises in addition to the core card business and enhancing the experiences of our flagship cards. We're growing franchises with innovative products like Capital One Shopping and Credit Wise.  In the auto business, we're delivering innovative products like Auto Navigator, which offers real-time underwriting of any car on any lot in America in a fraction of the second and enables customers to know in advance what their financing terms will be on any car before they visit the dealership. And that was a little word-of-mouth thing until we put it on national TV in the last few months. I'm sure you've seen the ad. We're strengthening our brand and customer franchise, evidenced by high Net Promoter Scores and J.D. Power naming Capital One, the leading mobile banking app. I turn to the card partnership business. We're winning card partnership opportunities where increasingly, retailers are focusing on digital capabilities as like a preemptively important part of the conversation. We're partnering with tech leaders like Snowflake, where we are their largest customer. And in addition to getting valuable early investment stake in them, we've been able to leverage the world's leading data management platform for our own innovation. On the operating side, we're steadily working to automate our operating processes, enabling us to reduce risk and to reduce cost. Then there's the tech-on-tech savings, our investments in modern technology are enabling us to reduce legacy tech costs and legacy vendor costs. So again, even as we invest more in modern tech, we're really powered by some of the benefits of reducing legacy tech costs. Digital productivity gains are powering speed to market and revenue generation. And with all these growing opportunities, we're enjoying the virtuous cycle of attracting more and better tech talent, which in turn accelerates our progress. So even sort of beyond your list of 4, which is a great list, our technology transformation is changing the trajectory of Capital One in driving growth, improving efficiency, strengthening risk management, enhancing the brand and improving our status as a leading destination for great talent. And so we like very much the position that we're in here. as I've said, time frames are compressing in the industry, and we want to make sure that we capitalize on those opportunities. Thanks for your question, Rick. Operator : We'll take our next Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Rich, I wanted to ask specifically about your high-spending transactor business. Are you seeing evidence of the larger banks demonstrate demonstrating a willingness to go underwater on credit card rewards with the hope of driving engagement and winning business in other areas like wealth management and mortgage. And if so, how do you see these dynamics playing out across the industry in general and Capital One in particular? Richard Fairbank : So the competition in rewards is certainly very intense. We see it in the marketing levels, everybody's stepping up for more of that. The product structures and the overall rewards levels continue to be fairly aggressive. And you can see banks out there refreshing products in the market recently with enhanced rewards. And not only in the cash back space but also to your point, at the very top of the market, including with the high fee rewards card. So I have not -- look, I think we all live on pretty thin margins in transaction margins in this business really because of what's happening and it's great for consumers.  The leading banks have past so many benefits on the consumers. But what I -- I would be surprised if our biggest competitors at the top of the market are losing money on every transaction and trying to make it up with volume elsewhere in their franchise. Now there may be selected examples of that. But I think what the leading players and this is certainly what we've been doing at Capital One, we have invested for years in brand and digital capabilities, customer experience, the servicing side of things, the card always works side of things to where one doesn't have to compete solely on the basis of rewards, important though that is, I think, really for the top players, I think this is really, at the end of the day about building a franchise, a sustainable franchise. And I certainly, from everything I see, feel that, that's what we have here at Capital One. And I think a small number of players are particularly investing -- years of investing to get that position. And I think all of us are well served by what we have. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Just on the expense side, I know you indicated on the marketing side, you expect a sequential quarter increase in the fourth quarter, consistent with the historical trends. If you look at it, going back, you're seeing anywhere between $100 million to $300 million linked quarter increase in the fourth quarter in marketing costs. So just wanted to try to get an idea if you can maybe help us size that up. And then one separate thing on the expense side. The efficiency ratio longer-term implication of the IT investment. Just wondering if there's any way to think about what that could interpret into in terms of an impact on the ratio on that operating ratio. Andrew Young : John, I'll take the first question and then pass it over to Rich for the second one. As you note, in the fourth quarter, we typically have seasonal increase just due to volumes and a number of -- I think you used the term sundry items. And Rich has talked about the investment that we are making on the technology side and compensation. So I would think that not giving any sort of explicit guidance, but I think if you look at history as your guide, there's a lot in there that kind of would suggest where we might be going in the near term.  And Rich talked about the investments over time and how that's going to play into the number of factors across the P&L in terms of revenue growth in fraud and many other things that are playing down through there. So that's how I would think about the short to medium term. And I'll turn it over to Rich to answer your second question. Richard Fairbank : Yes. So John, we declared years ago that through the tech transformation that we were driving, which along the way was going to cost more to drive that, that over time this transformation and the extra growth that we could get in the marketplace could -- that would put us in a good position to drive operating efficiency over the longer term and that, that would be an important part of the investor value proposition for Capital One.  And we've already -- seeing some significant improvements in operating efficiency. I talked about the pressures that come from rising tech labor costs and the imperative to invest. But while, again, the rising labor costs sort of by themselves don't really generate a lot of value, they cost money. The things we're talking about here of leaning into investment opportunities are the very things that are part of our original strategic philosophy about driving operating efficiency. That's the way that we drive more growth over time. The way that we drive more digital productivity gains will be to continue leaning into our tech transformation and the investment at the top of the tech stack for the -- in the growth opportunities that can help power that. So we are still all in on the quest, the efficiency ratio quest. And the kind of destinations that we have talked about, we need to incorporate the investment imperative that we have along the way. John Pancari : And then on the credit front, on delinquency trends, just wanted to see if you can talk a little bit about if you're seeing any changes in the lower FICO bands in terms of delinquency trends. We've been seeing that at a couple of other players that they're seeing some pressure on the lower FICO and non-prime areas? Are you seeing anything there, any evidence of upside pressure that would not be otherwise seasonally evident? Richard Fairbank : Yes, John, I think that most of what we see tends to be more in the range of normal. But I would be the first to argue that subprime customers have certainly had a number of benefits in the marketplace that, that over time will and are going away. So it would be a natural thing. Normalization is a very natural thing across the board. It would certainly be a natural thing there. We watch all these trends carefully. What we've seen in both card and auto would really be in the category of both seasonal and normal. But I wouldn't draw any big extrapolations from that, just more of an observation of what we see at this point. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess I have 1 big picture question for Rich. Obviously, a big topic in the fintech world is embedded banking and how big tech companies might be the central hub for consumers rather than what currently might be the bank app? I know you're making sizable investments to compete, but do you think there's inevitability that behavior shift towards these aggregators? Richard Fairbank : So Sanjay, look, that is a really great question. And one that for many, many years, we have been -- we put a -- we have put your strategic question, kind of front and center in our own thinking for years. So ever since you could watch, of course, in China and the incredible way that inside tech apps, one's whole life, including financial life gets embedded in there. That's the most extreme example of the front end of banking really being taken over by a tech company. And the risk, of course, as one looks at the marketplace, to your point, is the front end of banking being taken over by tech companies and banks being the utilities quietly behind the scenes of that. And that has been central on our radar screen from for many years. And we have seen -- and I think that there continues to be momentum in both camps. So in terms of the tech companies being the front end of banking, we see increasing traction in aggregation and many, many types of aggregation, not just people coming to go get a budgeting app kind of thing. We see that one-off aggregation for particular things and a whole variety of things in consumers' life. But between the incredible scale that tech companies have in terms of customers, the incredible engagement they have and now the increasing traction in aggregation that is something that all of us need to really be staring at. And I think there is, in a sense, kind of a great race going on between that model and the model of a bank being the go-to place, not only for the back end of banking, but really for the front end of banking where one can manage one's financial life through the technology of a customer's bank.  And that's been a primary objective of ours for a long time. And one of the probably 20 reasons that we've worked so hard to transform our technology because we want to have shoulders to stand on, that are the same shoulders as the leading tech companies have. So that we can build software and have the kind of capability and speed to market and so on that comes from being a modern tech company. And I have -- we have seen a lot of traction at Capital One. And I think some of the other leading banks have seen a lot of traction too. I mean just looking at the growth of not only how many mobile customers that we have -- both online and mobile customers, the growth rate of that. But also the frequency of visits and the increasing number of things that we can do for our customers. And the old world of banking was a reactive one. Customer would walk into a branch and say, I have a particular need, and then the banker would figure this out. The opportunity that comes in the new world of technology is where proactive banking is as important as reactive banking. They're not proactive banking in the sense of spamming more customers with lots of cross-sell offers. But really banking where we are watching the customers' money when the customer isn't, and providing leverage right in the flow of the customer's financial life to provide them the information that they need and the guidance that they need.  And if you notice some of the TV ads, we did probably 6 to 12 months ago, were all about some of the real-time alerts that were helping people with things that they really had no idea were going on with respect to their money. So I think that the great race that you talk about is on. It's one of the reasons we feel a real imperative to invest. But we like our position, and I really like actually our chances to not just build some features and have a bunch of customers, but actually to be at the center of our customers' financial lives and to be able to really build a growing franchise where Capital One is right there, where the eyeballs are and where a customers' mind share is. Sanjay Sakhrani : Just one quick follow-up for Andrew. On the NIM, obviously, you saw a nice increase and you mentioned a number of different items. But as we look ahead, it would seem with the loan growth and the remixing, there's probably tailwinds for the NIM to the upside? Or how should we think about that, U.S. cards specifically? Andrew Young : So Sanjay, you're touching on really the primary drivers. So if you're looking just at card versus the corporate side, I mean, there's kind of 4 factors I would call out that drove it in the quarter in card yield. Specifically, Rich talked about the credit, kind of, benefits that are flowing through in suppression saw a tick up of delinquencies in the third quarter, in line with seasonal trends, but that aids late fees.  They tend to have a fourth -- a third thing of seasonally higher revolve rates and then day count in the quarter are kind of the drivers of card yield. So when I think about how those play out, you can figure out which things are kind of seasonal to the quarter versus which things are driven by more macroeconomic factors versus what is sort of underlying trends.  I'll pull up though and just give a corporate view of NIM because you touched on some of the other dimensions that are really playing through more corporately, which is the reduction of cash at the total company level and having that be replaced by card growth. And then those factors, coupled with the higher yield in card that I just described is really what benefited this quarter. So as we look ahead, continued normalization of cash, continued growth in revolving card balances, those are the things that would be tailwinds to NIM, but movements in the other direction, things like sustained higher than normal payment rates or reduction in card yield would be headwinds. So we'll just have to see how those things sort of net against one another. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Sanjay actually just asked my NIM question. So I have a question, maybe diving deeper into the growth opportunities. Are you seeing -- is there a better arbitrage or better competitive opportunities in revolver versus transactor? Or is it subprime versus prime? And maybe answer that both card and auto. Richard Fairbank : Okay, John, I don't see a particular segment that really stands out. A strategic thing that we've been really leaning into for a number of years at Capital One is a continued migration toward the transactor side of the business, not running away from the other one, but differentially really investing and enhancing that. And of course, when you see all the purchase volume growth and other things, you can see the benefit there. But what we have also found is that the real emphasis on the transacting side of the business even for revolvers ends up being something that not only generates more transactions, but it helps drive a healthier prime and even subprime book. So that quest is very aligned and well at Capital One.  We see growth opportunities really across the board. There's pretty intense competition across the board, but I think we see growth opportunities and a relatively rational marketplace in card across the board. The auto business, auto -- there's 2 things I would say about auto. First of all, there's like 4 or 5 planets that are aligned in the auto business that I don't think in our lifetimes are going to align again that have led to some of the extreme performance that's happened in the auto business in terms of the growth, the revenue, the credit side of the business, it's been a very strong thing.  Given the strength, we have been particularly -- had a cautious eye looking at competitive pressures in that business. And I've always said that the auto business is more subject to competitive pressure disrupting the business than the card business because the card business is one-on-one us with a customer or a prospect. The auto business, again, has the dealer in the middle of the whole exchange and the dealer is driving an auction.  And so we continue to be -- very carefully monitoring the competitive effects. We are seeing growing competition in the auto business. It's showing up across the board from big banks, credit unions, and smaller independent lenders, and we're seeing it play out across all credit segments. It's showing up in pricing, underwriting and loan terms. And many lenders have expanded beyond their pre-pandemic credit box. And as the competitive environment continues to evolve, we remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy and our core philosophy of maintaining high resilience and taking what the market gives us remained unchanged. In our underwriting, we made conservative assumptions and assume rapid normalization of vehicle values to more sustainable levels. So there's kind of 2 competing things going on in the auto business that sort of -- that drives the results that you see. One is growing competition, which is very understandable because every auto player has posted really strong returns and wants to get more of that. There are some signs that we raise an eyebrow to make sure that we see sound underwriting out there in the marketplace. But we also have -- our opportunity is differentially being also powered by our tech capabilities that we have in the auto business, things like Auto Navigator, things like our relationship with the dealers and their reliance on our technology to help them underwrite better and sell cars more rapidly and effectively.  So the net of those 2 forces has led us to post another really solid quarter, and we're leaning in, in the auto business, but we should all understand we should be cautious about where the marketplace will go and also understand that the planet alignment, at some point those planets won't be as aligned as they have been. Operator : Our last question this evening is from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Just to follow-up on some of the competitive dynamics that you speak about, especially for fintechs. I mean have you considered possibly more radical change? Whether it's acquiring the fintechs in order to accelerate your growth or your competitive position in the market or potentially trying to develop more radical efficiencies within Capital One, in order to spend to address the competitive environment within fintech? Richard Fairbank : Sorry, I was on mute there. Sorry for the silence. Thank you, Kevin, for the good question there. As we have said on a number of occasions, the banking industry -- by the way, scale matters a lot.  And by the way, however important scale was years ago -- and by the way, as someone that started Capital One 3 decades ago -- and I've always were worshiped on the altar, scale, and it's been a tough journey because we didn't have the scale for most of the time. And One is always reminded of how more scale would help. Banks -- most of the banking industry is, I think, focusing a lot on buying other banks to build a very important scale. At Capital One, we are not looking at bank acquisitions. We are building a national -- I mean -- by the way, we did 4 bank acquisitions in our past that were very important in putting us in a good position of threshold scale in the banking industry. But where we are focused on the banking side is in building a national digital bank. And that's really going to be an organic quest. No company has ever really built one organically, but we like where we are, and we like our chances. Our acquisition focus is looking at technology companies and the fintechs. And I mentioned both of those. We have done acquisition of technology companies where they have some of the tech capabilities that we're building. And since we share a similar tech stack, that's been a compatible thing to do and an accelerant. And then, of course, we are looking at fintechs and Capital One has done a number of those acquisitions in the past as well. We -- it's not lost on us the breathtaking valuations that these companies command. And so we want to be a patient investor, but we are real students of the fintech marketplace because we can learn so much from them. We're inspired by some of the things they come up with and the things that they do, and we partner with some of them to take stakes in some of them and sometimes do acquisitions. I think Capital One is in ideal position as an acquirer of a fintech because of the tech stack that we have. And pretty much every fintech out there -- every modern fintech out there is on the cloud. And I think that the -- they're on the cloud, the tech talent they have is like very similar to our own. Culturally, the whole thing, the emphasis on data and analytics that is behind a number of the fintechs has been a focus of our company since its founding days. So I think that we have some natural advantages on the acquiring side. So for years, we've looked at fintechs and occasionally, made acquisitions, and we certainly are pleased with the ones we have made. Jeff Norris : Well, I think that concludes our earnings call for this evening. Thank you for joining us on the conference call today, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Norris : Thanks very much, Justin, and welcome, everyone, to Capital One's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website, capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2021 results.  With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew are going to walk you through the presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and the press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.  Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew? Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.41 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $12.4 billion or $26.94 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year earnings per share were $27.11. Full year ROTCE was 28.4%.  Included in the results for the fourth quarter was an upgrade to a legacy rewards program, which increased our rewards liability and decreased noninterest income by $92 million. Both period end and average loans held for investment grew 6% on a linked-quarter basis. Ending loans grew 10% in Domestic Card, 7% in Commercial and 1% in Consumer Banking. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 4% driven by the loan growth I just described, while total noninterest expense increased 12% in the quarter driven by increases in both operating and marketing expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $381 million as net charge-offs of $527 million were partially offset by a modest allowance relief .  Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. For the total company, we released $145 million of allowance in the fourth quarter, bringing the total allowance balance to $11.4 billion. The total company coverage ratio now stands at 4.12%.  Turning to Slide 5. I'll discuss the allowance of each of our segments in greater detail. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio declined in each of our segments. In Domestic Card, the allowance balance remained flat at $8 billion. The decline in card coverage was driven by the impact of balance growth that I highlighted earlier. In our Consumer Banking segment, continued strength in auto auction values drove a decline in both the allowance balance and the coverage ratio. And in Commercial, the decline in allowance balance was driven by modest credit improvement in the existing portfolio. In addition to the allowance decline, the coverage ratio was also aided by growth in lower loss segments.  Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 139%. The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. We continue to gradually run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic. Relative to the prior quarter, ending cash and equivalents were down about $5 billion and investment securities were down about $3 billion as we used our liquidity to fund loan growth and share buybacks. Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. You can see that our fourth quarter net interest margin was 6.6%, 25 basis points higher than Q3 and 55 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The linked quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by balance sheet mix as we had a reduction in cash and securities as well as a higher amount of card loans. Outside of quarterly day count effects, the NIM from here will largely be a function of the change in card balances, cash and securities levels and interest rates.  Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.1% at the end of the fourth quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases and growth in risk-weighted assets. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $2.6 billion of common stock, which completed our $7.5 billion Board authorization. Our Board of Directors has approved an additional repurchase authorization of up to $5 billion of the company's common stock.  With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Accelerating year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11.  As you can see on Slide 11, our Domestic Card business posted strong growth in every top line metric in the fourth quarter. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 29% year-over-year and up 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up $10.2 billion or about 10% year-over-year. Ending loans also grew 10% from the sequential quarter, ahead of typical seasonal growth of around 4%. Ending loan growth was the result of the strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction we're getting with new account origination and line increases, partially offset by continued high payment rates, and revenue was up 15% year-over-year driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans.  Domestic Card revenue margin increased 123 basis points year-over-year to 18.1%. Two factors drove most of the increase. Revenue margin benefited from spend velocity, which is purchase volume and net interchange growth outpacing loan growth, and favorable year-over-year credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in fourth quarter revenue. Credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.49%, a 120 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.22%, 20 basis points better than the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 13 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 29 basis points.  Noninterest expense was up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2020. The biggest driver of noninterest expense was an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $999 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. We continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business and our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build our Domestic Card franchise. At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to grow and build our franchise.  Moving to Slide 12. Strong loan growth in our Consumer Banking business continued in the fourth quarter. Driven by auto, fourth quarter ending loans increased 13% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 13%. Fourth quarter auto originations were up 32% year-over-year. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive year-over-year growth in our auto business. In the fourth quarter, we saw a pickup in competitive intensity in the marketplace. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were down 16%.  Fourth quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up $6.6 billion or 3% year-over-year. Average deposits were up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue grew 7% from the prior year quarter driven by growth in auto loans, partially offset by declining auto loan yields. Noninterest expense increased 15% year-over-year. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $58 million year-over-year driven by an allowance release in our auto business. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate remain strong and well below pre-pandemic levels. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 0.58%, up 40 basis points. And the 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.32%, up 67 basis points.  Slide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans, deposits and revenue in the quarter. Fourth quarter ending loan balances were up 12% year-over-year driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were up 8%. Ending deposits grew 13% from the fourth quarter of 2020 as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Quarterly average deposits also increased 14% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenue was up 19% from the prior year quarter with 29% growth in noninterest income. Noninterest expense was up 17%.  Commercial credit performance remains strong. In the fourth quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was a negative 2 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.1%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our Commercial capability.  I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning. Growth momentum is evident throughout our fourth quarter results. In the quarter, we drove strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans. We also posted strong auto and Commercial growth. Credit remains strikingly strong across our business and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. As we enter 2022, we continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our businesses and build our franchise. We will continue to lean into marketing to capitalize on these opportunities and drive growth. For years, we've talked about how sweeping digital change and modern technology are changing the game in banking. Last quarter, I noted that the stakes are rising faster than ever before. The investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and it's growing. Also, many legacy companies are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue for them and are increasing technology investments. The war for tech talent continues to escalate, which is driving up tech labor costs even before any headcount increase. All these developments underscore the significant opportunity for players who have modern technology and who are in a position to drive growth. Capital One is very well positioned to do that. We've spent years driving our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up. We were an original fintech, and we have built modern technology, infrastructure and capabilities at scale. And we're investing to leverage these capabilities to grow and to realize the many benefits of our digital transformation. We have been on a long journey to drive our operating efficiency ratio down. We expect that the striking rise in the cost of modern tech talent, on top of our growth investment, will pressure annual operating efficiency in the near term. But these pressures do not change our belief in the longer-term opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains.  Pulling way up, we're living through an extraordinary time of digital change. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity. It's setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. And it's the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term.  And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. . Justin, please start the Q&A. Operator : . And our first question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Rich, I want to kind of circle back to the efficiency ratio comment that you highlighted. I guess if I look at the fourth quarter, it's tough to know how to think about that level of expenses kind of going forward. It's not generally your practice to give specific guidance, but it would really be helpful because in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, it's not just an efficiency ratio that deteriorated, it's actual -- PPNR was down because even though revenues were quite strong, the increase in expenses was more than that in dollars. So is there -- can you talk about are there any gating factors in terms of when you think about expense levels kind of into 2022? Richard Fairbank : Moshe, there are a number of different factors going on in the fourth quarter, and maybe Andrew can comment specifically about the fourth quarter. But my point about the efficiency is really -- and some of the factors that were -- that I'm talking about in the efficiency ratio certainly manifested themselves in the fourth quarter. But our real point is that we're on a journey to improve operating efficiency. We've been leaning into this, and we're very optimistic about not only what we've done but what we can continue to do. And we're just flagging the tech talent costs and the continued investment in the opportunity. And that opportunity continues to be toward the top of the tech stack, which translates more into growth opportunities probably than some years ago when our investment began at the bottom of the tech stack. These investments are very important. And our point is that collectively, these things will pressure annual efficiency ratio in the near term, but it's really the same journey and the same drivers of opportunity and efficiency.  Andrew, I don't know if you want to make any comments about the fourth quarter specifically. Andrew Young : Sure. Yes. Moshe, you're well aware that we seasonally typically have higher expenses in the quarter, largely driven by the marginal cost of growth. Beyond that normal seasonal pattern, there were a few things that are reflected in this fourth quarter, the first of which is we saw some revenue driven and other incentive compensation. We also chose to make some of the investments, that Rich just described, in the professional services side to help accelerate some of the technology and other project work that Rich is referencing that will drive future growth. And so those couple of factors, some of which will continue as we head into next year. And we're seeing a little bit of the leading edge of the wage pressures so I would expect that to accelerate a bit, but some of the marked-related items in incentive compensation, some of the project work, will likely fall off. Moshe Orenbuch : Right. And maybe just as a follow-up, just to talk specifically about marketing, it was just about $1 billion in the quarter. December was the industry's largest month of mail volume in a decade. So you're not alone in that, although the level is fairly high. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how long do you see that -- and I do know that marketing was also typically high for you in the fourth quarter, but it was particularly low in the first half of 2021. How do we think about it as we go into 2022? Richard Fairbank : Moshe, it's clear that competition is intense. And you can see from the one you pointed out, direct mail is back at pretty high levels. You can see media advertising increasing throughout 2021. Of course, earnings calls from card players have indicated an expectation of increasing competition. And also in the rewards space, you can see competition is pretty intense there. So we have a very careful eye on that. I would say, though, that even as we have a very careful eye on that, I am struck by how the consumer is in a very good place right now. I think there's some natural growth capacity there. And I'm really struck by the traction that we're getting at Capital One. We continue to see some really good origination opportunities really across our businesses, and we like very much the results that we're seeing.  And the other thing about the competitive intensity at this point is more in upfront investments, such as marketing and upfront bonuses. And at this point, we're not seeing, in the competitive environment, sort of the sacrifices in margin and resilience. I'm talking particularly in the card business there. So we have experience through competitive cycles, and we know what to look for. But we are really pleased by the results, really struck by our opportunity to capitalize on them. And that's why we're leaning in. And that's also why we're flagging, of course, that we have our eyes on the very important issue that you mentioned relative to competition. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Rich, I wanted to get a sense from you on the opportunity set that you have in front of you with regard to the loan growth. And I'm asking the question because I get investor questions on, hey, is this revenue -- is this loan growth rate we're seeing right now reflecting peak levels the cycle that we could get. So I would rather hear from you as to what do you think about the loan growth acceleration that you got in the fourth quarter. Was it being driven by in terms of new accounts versus increased line utilizations, increased offers? And what's the legs on this as we go into the next year? Richard Fairbank : Betsy, great questions there. So we feel very good about our growth and our growth opportunities that we're seeing right now. Let me start with purchase volume. Obviously, our 29% purchase volume growth was really significant. And we've seen a lot of purchase volume growth across the industry. Of course, that's not just a Capital One effect. But with Capital One, specifically, we are seeing a lot of traction in our various spender programs. We're optimistic about that trajectory.  And the loans, I've been talking for quite a while about the poor loans are sort of losing out in the growth rates to purchase volume and some of the other things that card issuers don't really disclose like originations of accounts, the building of the franchise. And that, of course, was driven by another kind of elephant in the room, which has been the high payment rate. And so I think for a lot of players, the payment rates have really muted the loan growth. That includes Capital One. But I think what's striking, what you see, Betsy, here is that we saw still very high payment rates, and you can look in our trust to see some of the electrifying levels there.  But still, even despite that, some very nice traction in the quarter on loan growth. So what's driving that? In many ways, this stands on the shoulders of a number of years of leaning hard into origination growth and having the balances build over time. Also on credit line increases, we are leaning into those as well, not like a big dramatic thing, but I think in this environment and seeing the results we're seeing, we are leaning more into the credit line opportunity as well. So loan growth is still going to be a hard one to predict and very affected by the payment rate. Parenthetically, we love high payment rates because I think it's a very healthy customer base, an indication of a healthy consumer and we love what it does for the credit side. But I think that we see the opportunity for loan growth, in addition to the other growth metrics, as good. Jeff Norris : Do you have a follow-up, Betsy? Betsy Graseck : Can you hear me? Jeff Norris : Yes. Richard Fairbank : Yes, we can. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Sorry about that, just pivoting to Capital. I saw the Board authorization for $5 billion. Can you give us a sense as to the time frame that that's over and if there was a view on what drove that decision to do $5 billion as opposed to any other number? Andrew Young : Betty, it's Andrew. I'll take that. So we take into account a number of factors to drive these programs. So as always is the case, our pace for this repurchase authorization as well as the pace and amount of future authorizations are driven by a number of factors, including our actual and forecasted levels of capital and earnings and growth as well as market capacity to repurchase shares. And it also needs to consider the results from each unique CCAR cycle, which effectively happens at the midpoint of each year. So we take all of those factors into account to figure out the amount and the pacing of that. And so we will dynamically manage that given that we are now under SCB, and we have a great deal more flexibility to execute than we have previously. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : Rich, when we think of the factors that are contributing to the high payment rate, we're all aware of a lot of the economic factors. One thing that we've started to wonder about is, is there some sort of 80-20 rule on transactions? Are large idiosyncratic transactions getting scraped off by some of the alternative products? And is that changing the composition of the book anyway in terms of payment rates? Richard Fairbank : Our large transaction is getting scraped off by some of the alternative players out there. It's not a thesis that I have explored. I think that any question people are asking about : are there kind of on little cat feet, effects going on from the fintechs, the huge investment in them and their own investment in our very business, I think they are great things to look for. One thing I would say about payment rates, though, is how broadly across the spectrum of our card business that we have seen payment rates increase over this period of time. It's really not seen to exist or be dominated by a particular segment, let's say, the top of the market or whatever. It's been really pretty broad-based.  We also ourselves have had another growth story going on beneath our growth story, which is the continuing gains and growth in the heavy spender side of the business. And so what we see is -- maybe your effect is going on, but what we see, if anything, is particularly good growth rates over time in the heavy spender side of the business, which I think is more a manifestation of our investments in the kind of products that we've been marketing for a number of years and our investment in the comprehensive experience to really win in that part of the market. Operator : And our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Rich, I wanted to follow up on your payment comments. Are you at all concerned about the normalization of credit outpacing the normalization of payment rates? Or would you expect those metrics to normalize together? Richard Fairbank : Well, I think 2 things are kind of driving elevated payment rates right now. And it's really a funny thing. I've been in this business for, as you know, like 3 decades, and payment rates are just not something in general that people always talk about. We would always watch them. Some years ago, even before the pandemic, we started noticing some elevation in payment rates, but we probably more attributed that to the gradual mix change towards spenders in our own portfolio. But if we talk about the 2 main drivers of elevated payment rates, first is payment rates tend to correlate with spend levels. And for obvious reasons, when people are spending more, they're not going to be spending for very long unless they're also paying to keep their open to buy there. So I think that pattern is sort of almost, in a way, sort of just spend and payment math. And given how strong spending has been that, that is an important factor, I think, behind the payment rates.  And then there's the continued impact of healthy consumer balance sheets. And it's unmistakable the effect that, while there are many factors going on, just watching what happened across various segments of our business as things like government stimulus came in and what happened to payment rates, it's pretty clear that consumers, when their balance sheets improved, really used a bunch of those resources to pay down on their credit card and build more open to buy. And we have gone back and really studied the relationship between payment rates and credit for the whole history of our company, and the relationship is unmistakable. Bill, to your point, though, it's not like one-for-one. And I think that we could certainly expect there could be some divergences there.  On the topic of normalization, when we think about the normalization of payment rates, my mind first goes to the normalization of credit. And I think these record levels of low credit losses inevitably have to normalize. And I think when you pull out a magnifying glass and sort of look at various metrics and things in the numbers and behind the numbers, you can see the early signs of normalization that are a little bit ahead of seasonality, for example, that's a very natural thing. Probably what strikes us and kind of surprises us is how modest and moderate those are, but we certainly operate with an assumption of normalization. So I would expect the payment rates to follow, not exactly in lockstep, but I think that, that should follow. And so what happens for investors is a little bit of a trade. At the moment, the financial trade is lower payment rates, lower growth of loans and really spectacular credit. And as things normalize, I think that gives a boost to the loan growth but sort of is offset on the credit side of the house. So the other thing that's going on at Capital One because if you look at our trust data -- now by the way, our trust, and it's probably true for every player, the securitization trust is not an absolutely representative sample of anybody's full portfolio. But if you look at payment rates at Capital One, probably, even in particular, have just risen so significantly over this period of time. And I haven't looked at it lately, but it wouldn't surprise me if it even rose sort of more than for a number of other competitors. And I think that also reflects another Capital One specific thing that's going on, which is the continued traction of the spending side of the business at Capital One which, of course, manifests itself year-after-year being kind of at the high end of the league tables in terms of purchase volume growth. Bill Carcache : That's super helpful, Rich. If I could squeeze in a related follow-up. Maybe could you expand on that a little bit and discuss your confidence level in the normalization of payment rates and maybe what some of the puts and takes are to the extent that the normalization occurs a bit faster or slower? Richard Fairbank : Well, I, again, think of payment rates, I just go back to the 2 drivers. So one is the strong correlation with spend levels. So one needs really an outlook for what's going to happen to purchase volume in our business and in card businesses. Purchase volume has an incredible strength to it right now, a manifestation of the consumer. Some of it, by the way, is catching up for big pullbacks, of course, during the pandemic. But there's real strength there. If that strength continues, and that's pretty plausible, that would tend to have an upward boost on the payment rate. And then you get to the consumer credit side of the business. And I just believe reverse gravity has got to pull these numbers up. And we all have to understand that, that normalization, the word normal is a really important part of that. It would be extremely normal. It would be expected. We are certainly managing the business to expect that. But as that happens, count me is betting that, that driver of payment rates is going to pull the payment rates down. Operator : And our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So Rich, in your prepared remarks, you noted that all these investments that you're making in tech and tech talent will pressure the efficiency ratio. But I guess, just given a follow-up on some of the questions from earlier, the revenue backdrop is clearly much better, 10% exit run rate loan growth. And I was wondering, can you maybe just talk about -- you actually used the phrase pressure. I'm wondering, are you actually expecting the efficiency ratio to increase? And if you are, maybe can you just give us some parameters on how long do you expect this to last? How much of an increase can we see over an intermediate time frame? And maybe what are some of the things that you and the team are doing to offset some of these pressures? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So we're not giving really explicit operating efficiency ratio guidance. There's so many factors that go into that, and you know them well. What we wanted to point out is we always want to share with investors the things that we see going on in our company to make sure that they understand this. And the first one, this tech cost, I'm struck a lot of companies, most companies are kind of waiving at labor costs. And I think tech labor costs are an elephant in the room, and every tech company I've talked to is this is an absolute elephant in their room. And I think when you stand back and think about it, that's because every company in the world pretty much these days and we really need to drive tech change and opportunities as fast as we can. How long that supply and demand imbalance is going to last, we'll have to see.  It is the biggest imbalance I've seen in my 3 decades of building and running this company in a labor market. And it may be that this is more of a headwind right now for Capital One in our numbers than for some of the banks or just others. And I want to savor that for a second. One of the big things we've done in our tech transformation is bring in-house engineering talent at scale. And a lot of companies do a lot of outsourcing of that. So we have built a very big engineering team and the related families there. And we've built a brand, and we're a destination for really top tech talent. And that's a wonderful thing, and it really helps us on the recruiting side. But I just wanted to flag that one because how long that imbalance last, I don't know, but it's something that to me is very, very clear.  The other point is on the investment side. And I really want to say it, it's not like we're just going along, doing our tech transformation and looking at the market and say, \"Oh my gosh, we have to just massively invest in ways like we weren't before.\" That's not really what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that we are continuing to move up the tech stack in terms of where our investments are. And that's a wonderful thing because the closer you get to the consumer and the top of the tech stack, the more of those opportunities directly can be capitalized in the marketplace. So that's a good thing.  And we've been investing for a long time. My point is that we are still really leaning into this opportunity because the opportunity, the time frames, the imperative is real. And already, what's driving a lot of the growth that you're seeing is the benefits of those things, and it's what will drive a lot of the future growth as a company. So back to your question, while we're not giving explicit efficiency ratio guidance, the use of the word pressure is to explain those 2 phenomena that are going on that I wanted to share with investors that are real, and that pressures the efficiency ratio. Exactly what number come out in the end depends in the end on a lot of things and revenue growth and things. But I just wanted to share that. And I made the same comment in the call the quarter before. Ryan Nash : As a follow-up to Moshe's question on marketing, I understand the thought that you're leaning in and we're obviously seeing really, really good traction on the growth side. But if I think about the competitive intensity, we've heard Amex saying that marketing is going to come down a little. Discovery's growing. JPMorgan is accelerating. And I think all of us are just looking for some parameters to maybe understand where you are in the stage of investment. And maybe can you just help us understand. Are we at run rate levels in the back half of the year? Do you see another step-up? And just any color that you could provide on how you're thinking about the pace of marketing spend, I think, would be helpful. Richard Fairbank : Yes. Ryan, it is striking the comments that everyone is making about this and probably a little bewildering for investors to understand where equilibrium is these days. You know our philosophy, Ryan. You and I have known each other for a long time. We don't really start the year by saying, this is precisely the marketing -- I mean we always make a budget, but we don't start the year and say, \"Well, this is what everybody has in marketing dollars, no matter what.\" Sometimes we contract what we put in there. Sometimes we expand it. But it's very focused on what's the nature of the opportunity. We also have a strong belief that there are windows of opportunity for growth. And you capitalize on those when you get them or those windows pass. And so that doesn't also lend itself to the kind of let's go and just allocate the same marketing budget every quarter to different parts of our business or anything like that.  So what we do at Capital One is when we see opportunities, we really lean into them. I can't, in advance, tell you quite how far we lean into them because we really look at what's the productivity at the margin for what we are investing. And we look at marketing efficiency on average. We look at it at the margin. We look at it in all of our programs. And of course, also, we look at our brand investments and the other things that we're doing to lift the votes. My message to you here is really 2 points. One, this is a lean-in time and we're going to continue to do that to the extent that the opportunity is there. And you can see the fourth quarter was a pretty high level of lean-in, so that would be an example of that. My other point is we are, as closely as you, watching the competition and the choices they're making. And higher levels of competition themselves can manifest in different ways. It can affect the ability to generate response. It can affect pricing. The worst thing is when it starts making its way into underwriting practices and starts affecting the credit side of the business. But right now, if I pull way up on the marketplace, we've got a strong consumer where kind of everybody is sort of roaring out of the sort of pandemic, not society necessarily when I'm talking about many of the metrics here. And the marketplace is still generating this opportunity resiliently, and we are leaning into that. Operator : Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani. Sanjay Sakhrani : So maybe just to ask Ryan's question a little bit differently. I mean shouldn't we expect revenue growth to be above average given these accelerated investments you're making? Maybe you could just give us a sense of what kind of revenue growth you're targeting and what some of the specific products might be that you're rolling out that are sort of unique and separate yourselves from the peers. I'm just thinking about buy now, pay later. Like where are we with the product rollout? Richard Fairbank : Okay. So we're not giving specific revenue guidance. We are commenting and pleased with the momentum that we have, particularly momentum you saw that picked up in the fourth quarter, and we certainly hope to keep our momentum going there. So I think on the purchase volume side, there's a lot of thrust. We're very pleased with the account originations that we have been able to generate from the enhanced marketing that we're doing and the loan growth, which is a very important part of the revenue growth. That one is always kind of the hardest one to sort of predict because of its linkage to the payment rate. But we do see a good trajectory there. We're not giving specific guidance, but we like what we see there.  In terms of what is driving the growth, I don't think -- you'll occasionally see Capital One on TV with a new product or whatever. We are always coming up with new products, so is competition, by the way. Our surge in growth is not the result of some new product there that's suddenly driving this. This is the result of many things coming together, working particularly well right now. I think a lot of it is really driven by opportunities and capabilities and expansion and experiences for the customer that stand on the shoulders of our tech transformation. So we're hopeful we can continue to drive some strong growth. We're not giving guidance on that. And the biggest, I think, question will be what happens to payment rates and what that does to loan growth. Sanjay Sakhrani : And maybe just another follow-up on expenses. I'm sorry I'm asking the same questions everyone else is. Rich, you seem to think that the work for sort of inflationary pressure is transitory. Is that the only risk in terms of getting back to sort of that 42% operating efficiency ratio? So if that sort of passes at some point, you guys can get back there? Or is there something else too? Richard Fairbank : So we are still driving toward the same destination for operating efficiency improvement. But the timing, that needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace and particularly the one we flagged here more recently, the striking rise in the cost of modern tech talent. The investment imperatives of the marketplace and the rising cost of tech talent will pressure our operating efficiency ratio in the near term, as we have discussed. But modern technology capabilities are the engine that drives revenue growth and digital productivity gains, and the investments we're making today are the drivers of the efficiency improvements that we expect to continue to get over time. So we're not in a position to declare the timing of operating efficiency destinations. It's the same journey, the same engine powering it. There are some pressures we shared with you in the nearer term, but it's the same journey. And delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important payoffs of our technology journey and a key element of delivering long-term shareholder value. Operator : And our next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : I'll shift gears a little bit, but I do also agree it would be helpful to have some kind of sizing around the expenses just given the environment. You have a really good story to tell outside of that. I guess on auto lending, are you signaling that you might moderate a little bit of growth there? And the Auto Navigator product, which I think is really benefiting from the public cloud, are you getting penetration on that? And can you size that? Richard Fairbank : Yes, Don, the auto business has really been growing strongly. And for starters, that's, very importantly, an industry point. A lot of factors have aligned to create a lot of demand, a lot of demand for used cars, high used cars, car valuations. And it's certainly been, for us and really for the industry, a bit of one of our strongest periods in history. But if we look beneath that because, obviously, all those things normalize over time, we continue to leverage our leading technology, our data and underwriting capabilities to identify market opportunities that we think have attractive and resilient risk-adjusted returns. And by the way, a very important part of that is keeping an eye on the very, very high used car prices and as we underwrite, assuming a significant decline in those. So we don't count on something that's not going to be long term sustainable. Whether the industry fully does that, we'll have to see.  Our technology journey, and you mentioned the Auto Navigator product, that's a manifestation of a lot of the technology we've built in the auto business. It really helped us not only deepen our relationship with consumers but also with dealers because Auto Navigator is a winning product for dealers as well as it is for consumers because it's bringing in consumers who've already done a lot of the work to prequalify themselves, and it's the highest quality lead like a dealer can have. So we're not giving out data on the success of Auto Navigator, but we believe that it is a powerful product.  And I've often said to investors, \"Hey, if you want to look at an example and go kind of see the differentiation that Capital One has created in a tech-based, information-based, machine learning-based product, the Auto Navigator and the real-time underwriting of any car on any lot in America in less than a second is a manifestation of that.\" And that is getting traction. But I do want to say that there are a lot of changes going on in the auto industry, a number of competitors working hard to reinvent how car buying works. And I think for Capital One and a lot of players who are on the frontier of some of those changes, I think there is opportunity for us. And I think some of the success in auto is exactly a manifestation of that.  Let me say one other thing, though, with respect to growth in the auto business. I've always said that the auto business is even more sensitive to competition than the Credit Card business is because of the role that a dealer plays between the consumer and the lender in holding an auction. And so the dealers understandably really tend to drive their business toward the lender who is the most flexible on pricing and terms. And we have seen some of those metrics move in the last quarter. And I think a very robust auto market, it's a natural thing to expect that competition might overheat and pricing and practices could be affected along the way. So I don't want to overstate my point. It's a caution that I put out there, but we are still leaning into our opportunity. But the bit of the volume decline in the fourth quarter, I think, was a competitive effect of the very thing we're talking about. Operator : Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : I guess I'm interested in maybe talking through the mechanics of your net interest margin. Obviously, I want to hear your thoughts on what maybe each rate hike might do to the margin. But beyond that then, there's a lot of other moving factors, like you're going to get some suppression of yield with the evolution of NPAs, you're going to get some late fees to offset that and so on and so forth. So maybe can you give us a sense of what to expect as all those factors come to play in the next few months? Andrew Young : Sure, John. It's Andrew. And maybe I'll expand the horizon beyond the next few months because it will take a while for some of the factors that you just described to play out, but why don't I start with the rate side of the equation that you brought up. Our current balance sheet is asset sensitive. So as rates move up, it will clearly be a tailwind to NII. At this point while it's moved a fair amount over the last few months, including, I think, about a 10 basis point retraction over the last week in the 10-year, so it's a volatile number, but the market is currently, last time I checked at least, expecting around 4 hikes in '22. And so that equates to an average Fed fund rates that's about 50 basis points higher for the full year. And you can get a directional indication of the impact of that.  In our Q3 disclosures, I think we showed that relative to forwards, the 50 basis point shock impacts the next 12 months of NII by 1.9%, I believe, is the number. So that's just roughly under $500 million. So that's the dollar effective rates. If you translate the dollar effects into NIM, to the other side of your question, the 3 big factors that are ultimately going to impact NIM are the 3 things that I highlighted in my talking points. And that is just the quantum of card balances. Even though some of the factors you described will potentially impact card margin, it's much more about the card balances to the overall company NIM. The other is cash and securities, which you saw we had an investment portfolio at $100 billion at its peak, it was probably something like $15 billion higher than what is a more normal level and cash levels that were also really high. So you could see cash and securities coming down, which all else equal benefit NIM. And then finally, the rate effect that I just described. So really, those are the 3 things that we're primarily looking at and will ultimately have the biggest effect on NIM on a run rate basis. In terms of the next few months, the only thing that I know for sure is there's 2 fewer days in the first quarter. So that's roughly a 15 basis point headwind to NIM, all else equal, but the other effects are really what's going to drive the NIM over the longer term. John Hecht : That's great. I really appreciate that detail. I guess an unrelated follow-up is it seems like you guys have put out a lot of products over the past several quarters that may be targeting some of the fintechs and neobanks. I think you've canceled overdraft protection or moderated that. You've got early payment mechanisms. You've got direct auto type products. I guess the question is, are you able to quantify how that impacts your customer base? Do you get good cross-sell? Does it affect retention rates? Or generally speaking, how do these compete against these new banks that are trying to, I guess, disrupt the overall system? Richard Fairbank : Yes, John. Well, I love the focus that investors have on fintechs. And let's talk about the reasons for that. First of all, I think the investors are voting with their feet to just the amount of money that is poured into fintechs on the venture capital side, the valuation of fintechs, although the last little bit has been rough for them really speaks to a belief, I think, in the investor community that banking is going to be transformed and the fintechs are going to be important drivers of making that happen. And we're an original fintech. So maybe I have a soft spot in my heart for fintechs and also an understanding of the challenges they face as well. But one thing, we start with one thing that's very clear, Fintech start with modern technology. Everybody starts in the cloud. They don't have all the scale technology you need. They got to build a lot of things, but they start in the cloud.  There's also another phenomenon going on, and that is that one of the most successful parts of fintech has been the platform companies building the shoulders for other fintech to then stand on and build their business. So the ability to enter businesses and move quickly and have modern technology is really striking. The fintechs are also unregulated. So there's a whole vector there in terms of some of the things they're doing and some of the ways that they move and operate that wouldn't be consistent with the banking side of the business.  But I favor all that because I believe also, as do so many investors beating a path into this space, that banking is absolutely in the process of being transformed. And it's kind of striking, the industry has taken as long as it has to be as transformed relative to a lot of other industries. And I think a big reason for it is the regulation that has tended to surround the banking space. Interestingly, by far, the biggest growth vectors have been sort of in the least regulated side of things, in payments and platforms and crypto. And I think the almost unmitigated success of companies in those spaces are really striking.  But let me now go back to Capital One. And I say this as an original fintech and a fintech that really transformed itself into and became one of America's biggest banks. We are building essentially a fintech, and we have built a fintech at scale. We don't have some of the benefits that fintechs have. We have a lot of benefits a lot of fintechs don't have, including a gigantic customer base and national brand, a 3.5 decades of underwriting experience, an unbelievable amount of data that we have collected and have, through our tech transformation, built a very sophisticated, kind of comprehensive way to manage big data and machine learning in real time to create opportunities to be at the forefront of how banking is being transformed. We, as a bank, face our own unique set of challenges fintechs don't have. Fintechs face a lot of challenges they have. But it's not an accident that you noticed Capital One out there with a number of products and even a bit of a brand personality consistent with where fintechs are because we are leaning into some opportunities, the same ones the fintechs are. Some are ones that we're creating in places they're not. But when you hear an optimism in my voice and an excitement, it relates to standing on the shoulders of our tech transformation and the scale and market position we have as a company to create opportunities that I think Capital One is uniquely positioned to do it. It's a tough journey. It requires continued investment, which we talked about, and it's not easy. But I really like our chances. And I think Capital One is ideally positioned to take advantage of the accelerating transformation in banking. Operator : And our last question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the credit front, I just wanted to see if you can give a little bit of color on the increase in charge-offs and delinquencies on the non-card consumer businesses. I know you mentioned auto. Just wondering if you can give a little bit more granularity on the drivers there. And then also on the reserve side, another sizable reserve release. As you're looking forward here and as loans begin to strengthen in terms of the balance sheet, do you expect ultimately to begin matching or building reserves here in the coming quarters? Richard Fairbank : Okay. John, let me talk about credit. Andrew will do the reserve question. So the consumer credit just remains strikingly strong. I mean in all my years, I've never seen anything quite like what we have been through with consumer credit in the last couple of years, and it's still strikingly strong. We, of course, have been saying all through this, normalization is bound to happen. How fast, and it does, and at what trajectory we'll have to see. In the fourth quarter, our card losses, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they were up 13 basis points, which is consistent with normal seasonal trends. Our card delinquencies increased 29 basis points, and that increase is a bit more than the normal seasonal trend. And I would point at that as an indicator of, more likely than not, early signs of some normalization off of a very, very low base, of course. In the auto business, let's talk about credit performance there. Auto credit performance has been strikingly strong through the pandemic. Fourth quarter losses were just 58 basis points, and that's roughly 1/3 of what they were before the pandemic. In addition to all the positives that have supported consumer credit in general, like you see in our card business, auto is seeing exceptionally strong recoveries supported by record-high vehicle values. And this was enough to push losses negative earlier in 2021. And obviously, that's not sustainable. But by any measure, losses remain exceptionally low. The quarter-over-quarter increase in Q4 was largely normal seasonality. Auto vehicle values remain about 50% above pre-pandemic levels backed by strong consumer demand and ongoing supply constraints. So we certainly would expect auto losses to increase from current levels even if the health of the consumer remains strong, especially because auction prices should normalize over time as supply constraints are resolved. So it's an amazing period that we're in, and we are trying to lean in and capitalize on the opportunities to grow the business with the strength the consumer has and the capacity to grow their own balance sheet. And we are especially watchful of the natural things that can happen to credit at a time like this. I'm talking about the industry. And let me just name 2 there. One is, of course, the natural things like more aggressive marketing and, in the auto business, more aggressive practices with the dealers and things like this.  There's also just one other thing we'll all have to keep an eye on, and that is when we think about -- any of us, and we ask ourselves this question, but I think we're in a stronger position to answer it than maybe many, but when one is doing credit underwriting, how do you build models? What are your models supposed to be looking at when they look in the rearview mirror and see the best credit in the history of these businesses? And so Capital One has a very long kind of history of data on consumers, and we very much point our models to a longer horizon there. But I do worry, especially for the fintechs who are building their own companies from scratch, exactly what's the rearview mirror and what's the information-based underwriting capabilities that can be built here? So we'll just keep an eye out for those effects and expect normalization to occur and take advantage of the opportunities while they're in front of us. Andrew? Andrew Young : Yes. John, with respect to the allowance, unfortunately, I don't have an easy yes/no answer for you around allowance releases. So let me just start by describing the current allowance because I think that backdrop will be helpful in just painting various pictures of how the coming quarters might unfold. In that way, you have as much knowledge as we do. So when we think about the composition of the allowance, the first thing is just our expectation of future losses and recoveries. And so right now, our outlook assumes relatively swift normalization of losses from today's unusually strong levels. The second factor is just qualitative factors, which we've described before. And today, these qualitative factors remain elevated to account for the remaining uncertainties around the pandemic and the economy, and this is why our coverage ratios remain high. And then the last factor is just the size of the balance sheet at each successive quarter.  And so keep in mind that under CECL allowance, impacts of new growth is pulled forward, so it definitely adds to the quantum of allowance that we need as we grow. But future allowance movements from where we are today will just be determined by how all of these effects net out. And so if normalization plays out and we continue to grow at a significant clip, we could see allowance builds over the next few quarters. The other scenario could be, and clearly, there's many scenarios, but another scenario is favorable credit trends continue the uncertainties that drive the qualitative factors subside, and growth is a little bit more modest than we would likely see further allowance releases. So I just wanted to give you a window into all of the pieces that go into the calculation, and we'll go through a rigorous process every quarter, and we'll see how it ultimately plays out over the year. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just lastly, can you just maybe comment a bit on the commercial loan growth trends you're seeing? I know your commercial segment loans were up double digits year-over-year. So I just want a quick bit of color on the drivers there. Richard Fairbank : Yes, John, our commercial loan growth was 7% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year, and it outpaced industry growth. Normalizing for PPP forgiveness, we're much more in line with the growth of our peers. While we did see a slight increase in our revolver utilization this quarter, our growth was almost entirely driven by originations in our specialty businesses where we generate strong risk-adjusted returns.  And of course, just the other thing I would point out, of course, is our activity in commercial reflects the increased economic activity and a quite attractive market, quite attractive lending conditions in 2021. So it's been, I think, a good time for all commercial lenders. This is in the context of actually a market that still we have a very cautious eye of looking at with the tremendous growth of nonbank lenders and some of the lending practices that are happening outside the banking industry that make their way into our customers. So I think it's a great period at the moment. We continue to be cautious about the opportunity in the context of the bigger marketplace. But thanks very much, John. Jeff Norris : Thanks, Rich. And thanks, everybody, for joining us on tonight's conference call. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Investor Relations team will be here to answer any follow-ups you may have later on, and have a good evening, everybody. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent night.",

Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew? Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide three of tonight\u2019s presentation. In the first quarter Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.62 per diluted common share. The results include one notable item, $192 million gain from the sale of two Card partnership loan portfolios in the quarter. Period end loans held for investment grew 1% on a linked-quarter basis and average loans grew 3%. Revenue in the linked-quarter increased 1%. Non-interest expense decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by declines in both marketing and operating expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $677 million, as net charge-offs of $767 million were partially offset by an allowance release. Turning to slide four, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. For the total company we released $119 million of allowance in the first quarter and the total allowance balance now stands at $11.3 billion. We continue to hold an elevated amount of qualitative factors to account for a number of uncertainties. Our total company coverage ratio is now 4%. Turning to slide five, I will discuss the allowance and coverage of each of our segments. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio was largely flat across each of our business segments. In our Total Card segment, the allowance balance declined $65 million, driven by our international Card businesses. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance remained flat at $8 billion. With the slight decline in ending loans, the flat allowance balance in Domestic Card resulted in a slight increase in the coverage ratio to 7.38%. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $16 million, which when coupled with loan growth resulted in a 10 basis point decline in coverage to 2.37%. And in Commercial, the $41 million decline in allowance balance was driven by portfolio credit improvement. The decline in coverage ratio was driven by both the allowance release, as well as growth. Turning to page six, I will now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 140%. The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. The investment portfolio ended the quarter at $89 billion, declining by about $6 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Rising rates drove a market value decline of $4.3 billion, with the remaining decline due to our continued efforts to reduce our investment portfolio from the elevated levels during the pandemic. Turning to page seven, I will cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.49%, 50 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 11 basis points lower than Q4. Relative to a year ago, the increase in NIM is largely driven by a balance sheet shift, as we deployed excess cash to loans. The linked-quarter decrease in NIM was driven by having two fewer days in the first quarter. Normalizing for day count effect, higher yields in both our Card business and in our investment portfolio were roughly offset by the impact of hedges on the balance sheet and lower auto yields. Outside of quarterly day count, the NIM from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix, interest rates and the impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas. Turning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.7% at the end of the first quarter, down 40 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases, the impact of the CECL transition and higher risk weighted assets. Recall that the phasing of CECL transition relief began on January 1st. We recognize 25% of our $2.4 billion total after-tax phasing amount in the first quarter. Also in the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion of common stock as part of the $5 billion share authorization that our Board approved in January. Earlier this month, in addition to approving our CCAR 2022 submission and our capital plan, our Board of Directors also approved the authorization of up to an additional $5 billion of common stock repurchases that will be available beginning in the third quarter of this year. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I will begin on slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the first quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. Our Domestic Card business posted strong year-over-year growth in every topline metric in the first quarter, as we continued our longstanding strategic focus on winning with heavy spenders and building a franchise across the business. Purchase volume for the first quarter was up 26% year-over-year and up 47% compared to the first quarter of 2019. The rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up $16.9 billion or about 19% year-over-year. Ending loans were down just 1% from the sequential quarter, better than the typical seasonal decline of around 7% and revenue was up 20% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans, as well as strong revenue margin. Domestic Card revenue margin for the first quarter was 18.3%. Revenue margin continued to benefit from spend velocity, which is the purchase volume and net interchange growth outpacing loan growth. Spend velocity is driven by the traction we are getting with heavy spenders. The margin also includes a gain from a Card partnership portfolio sale in the quarter. Credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.12%, a 42 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.32%, 8 basis points above the prior year. Gradual credit normalization continued in the first quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 63 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 10 basis points. Non-interest expense was up 33% from the first quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $918 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest, but of course, not the only driver of total company marketing trends. We continue to see opportunities to book Domestic Card accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns and we continued to lean into marketing to drive growth and build our Domestic Card franchise. Consumer balance sheets and labor markets are strong, and in our own portfolio, credit results continued to be well below pre-pandemic levels and they are normalizing gradually. We are keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. And as always, we are underwriting to worsening scenarios, even as we lean into marketing. Our Domestic Card marketing is evolving and increasing as our decade long focus on heavy spenders continues to gain traction. We increased marketing to grow the heavy spender franchise and drive the successful launch of Venture X. Growth in new accounts and robust customer spending drove an increase in early spend bonuses, which show up in our marketing expense and part of our marketing is focused on strengthening our heavy spender franchise with investments in our new travel portal and airport lounges. And looking across the whole company, our digital transformation is generating new business opportunities like Capital One Shopping in our Card business and Auto Navigator in our Auto business. And modern technology infrastructure and capabilities are driving our digital first National Direct Banking strategy in Consumer Banking. We are marketing to continue to propel these growing digital businesses. Our marketing is paying-off across these opportunities. We posted very strong growth in Domestic Card purchase volume, new accounts and loans. We are gaining share and building a long-term franchise with heavy spenders. And away from the Card business, we are growing auto originations and deepening dealer relationships with Auto Navigator and our National Direct Banking business is winning with customers and driving growth. Speaking of our Auto and Retail Banking businesses, let\u2019s move to slide 12, which shows that strong loan growth in our Consumer Banking business continued in the first quarter. Driven by auto, first quarter ending loans increased 14% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 14%. First quarter auto originations were up 33% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, auto originations were up 20%. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive year-over-year growth in our Auto business. We continue to closely monitor competitive and credit dynamics in the auto marketplace. First quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up $4.4 billion or 2% year-over-year. Average deposits were also up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue grew 2% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans, partially offset by declining auto loan yields and the early effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees. The year-over-year decrease in auto loan yields was driven by a mix shift toward prime loans and our focus on booking higher quality loans within credit segment. Across the auto lending industry, the pace of price increases has not kept up with the pace of rising interest rates. The decline in loan yields coupled with the pace of pricing changes has compressed margins in our Auto business. First quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of $126 million in the first quarter of 2021 to a net expense of $130 million. The allowance for credit losses in our Auto business was flat in the quarter compared to an allowance release in the year ago quarter. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate are gradually normalizing, and remain strong and well below pre-pandemic levels. The charge-off rate for the first quarter was 0.66%, up 19 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.85%, up 73 basis points year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 8 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 47 basis points. Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans, deposits and revenue in the quarter. First quarter ending loan balances were up 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties and increasing utilization. Average loans were up 15%. Ending deposits grew 9% from the first year, excuse me, from the first quarter of 2021, as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Quarterly average deposits increased 12% year-over-year. First quarter revenue was up 16% from the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was also up 16%. Commercial Credit performance remains strong. In the first quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.7% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.8%. In closing, we continued to drive strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the first quarter. We also posted strong Auto and Commercial growth. Credit is gradually normalizing and remains strikingly strong across our businesses and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. Pulling way up, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity and it\u2019s the engine of enduring value creation over the long-term. And now, we will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thanks, Rich. Let\u2019s start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any questions following the Q&A, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Keith, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you.  We will take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. So, obviously, the investor sentiment has turned quite cautious on the consumer, but it seems like, Rich you think credits doing, I mean clearly credit is doing quite well in your loan book and you guys are leaning into growth. Maybe you could just give us some perspective on some of the macro headwinds that the consumer is facing, and sort of how you see it progressing through the portfolio as the year progresses? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Okay. Hey, Sanjay. Yeah. So let\u2019s just talk about the health of the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer continues to be strong. While the savings rate has reverted back to pre-pandemic levels, the cumulative impact of savings over the last two years is still a significant positive. We see this in higher bank account balances and higher household net worth and it is true across the income spectrum. Now, of course, the bulk of government stimulus is now behind us and most industry forbearance programs are winding down. But I think we will see some sustained benefits from consumer deleveraging through the pandemic. Debt servicing burdens are lower than they have been in decades, supported both by deleveraging and by low interest rates. On the other side of the consumer balance sheet, labor market demand remained strong. So in our own portfolio, Sanjay, we see continuing strength in roll rates, cure rates and recovery rates, and even as we see signs of normalization, our credit metrics remain strikingly strong by any historical standard. There are emerging headwinds as well, for example, high price inflation. The inflation has the potential to erode the excess savings, consumers accumulated through the pandemic, especially of price increases continue to run ahead of wage growth and also higher interest rates would push debt servicing burdens back up. But if we pull up on the whole, I\u2019d say consumers are in good shape coming out of the pandemic relative to most historical benchmarks. In fact, the -- I am just learned over the years that, I have got a lot of confidence in how -- what consumers learn from downturns and scares that they have and the choices that they make and I think we are just seeing very rational behavior by consumers. I worry more about markets and how competitors operate and lending practices and things like that, we can save that for another question. But we still feel good about the consumer and look it is a natural thing, it would be an unnatural thing for credit to stay where it is. And so, normalization, the root word in normalization is nor, and there is quite a journey to really sort of an equilibrium place for credit performance. And one of the reasons that we are still leaning pretty hard into our growth opportunities is our confidence in the consumer and our read of the marketplace at this time. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Great. And a follow-up question on some of the regulatory scrutiny we are seeing. There has been some chatter on Card loan fees and overdraft fees, the latter of which I think you guys have gotten in front of. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the Card loan fees -- the Card fees, chatter out there from some of the regulators and how it might affect your business? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Yeah. Well, Sanjay, we as a company have been very focused on minimizing fees, just in general for our consumers. Obviously the overdraft announcement was a pretty dramatic case in point there. But even in the Card business, when you look, we really what Capital One has is an APR and a late fee and in some cases a cash advance fee, both of those fees are really to discourage certain behaviors that we don\u2019t think are in the interest of the consumer. So, yes, so our strategy has been to have pricing be upfront and have -- it be clear and very simple. Now late fees or something that we have continued to have late fees, because we wouldn\u2019t want our loved ones ending up paying late on their bill, so just late fee, I think is one of the natural fees that probably makes sense to have on a product. The fed is created a Safe Harbor with respect to late fees, maybe the industry well, that will be revisited and obviously we will watch that as we continue our business. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We will take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Thanks for taking my question. Can we just talk a little bit more about the partnership portfolio sale, how to think about that from an asset perspective in the impact on the P&L in terms of revenue and any associated decline in expenses associated with that sale? Andrew Young : Yeah. Rick, it\u2019s Andrew. I mean, we disclosed the overall gains between the two portfolios of $192 million. The two portfolios combined, you saw probably last year when they got marked held for sale were roughly $4 billion, but below the surface there we are not going to get into specifically the run rate of revenue or the expenses associated with that in part, because we are growing the rest of the portfolio and you are going to see partnership businesses come in and out over time. Rick Shane : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We will take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good afternoon. Rich and Andrew, you have unique insight into consumers at both ends of the credit spectrum. Could you parse out for us in a little bit more detail, just following up on Sanjay\u2019s question? Specifically at what kinds of credit normalization trends you are seeing at both the high end and the low end of the credit spectrum, if you could sort of juxtapose those for us and maybe call out any differences? And then, perhaps, any possibility of that inflationary pressures could lead to a bit faster normalization at any -- at the lower end? Richard Fairbank : Yeah. Hey, Bill. So we have for quite a long time saying, we should all expect normalization. In terms of what we see in normalization, I -- it\u2019s pretty early and pretty modest, in fact, if anything I guess, we would -- we are sort of struck by the how moderate the pace is, but we shouldn\u2019t necessarily count on that, but it is certainly striking so far. What we are seeing in normalization is really across the credit spectrum and across the income spectrum. It does seem that normalization is a bit more pronounced at the lower end of the market, if you sort of measure either in terms of income or credit score. But those are also populations that improved more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic. So that\u2019s -- so I think we are seeing and we would expect this is and across the Boards kind of return toward normal over time. With respect to inflation, we worry a lot about inflation and that is something that, especially if inflation, as we have seen in, what it costs to live is faster than wage inflation. These can put pressures and sometimes can put pressures more on the -- in the Main Street America. And so it\u2019s something that we worry quite a bit about and I think that, it would be very natural for these inflation pressures to put more pressure on consumers. Bill Carcache : Thank you, Richard. It\u2019s really helpful. If I may ask a related follow-up, maybe could you discuss the extent to which positive credit migration fueled by pandemic stimulus, that perhaps may have led you to increase line sizes and then now the extent to which we could sort of see a reversal in that and perhaps as credit normalizes, would you expect negative credit migration to ultimately lead to a reversal of those line sizes or is that not how it worked? Richard Fairbank : Yeah. Over the years, we have worked hard to originate accounts, and we have said, it\u2019s kind of a coiled spring of growth opportunity and we uncoil the spring gradually based on customer performance and also the marketplace. And so we have as part of the growth that you see, while it\u2019s being powered by very strong originations and in some return to spending in Card usage by the back book, we also have been selectively increasing credit lines. Nothing dramatic, but it\u2019s consistent with my earlier comments about the consumer, and again, with great demonstration by the performance of our customers, we have been selectively increasing credit lines and I think I don\u2019t see anything that would change our lean in that direction. Again, it\u2019s selective and it assumes a worsening environment, it assumes normalization in all of those things. So I don\u2019t think we would be setup to be surprised there and I don\u2019t see -- I don\u2019t have any conversations about trying to reverse that direction. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We will take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good evening. On the -- regarding the credit on the reserve front, I know you had released an incremental $190 million and you indicated that you do have additional qualitative reserves aside. I know your reserve ratio right now was a near your day one CECL level. How should we think about the potential for incremental reserve releases from here? Do you think that we stabilize at this level of the reserve ratio or do you think there is incremental room to release? Andrew Young : Well, John, when you quote the -- this is Andrew, by the way. When you quote the reserve level, keep in mind that there pretty significantly different reserve levels by asset class and so the total company level, of course, is influenced by that mix. So I would suggest we decompose it a bit by each of them since auto was a little bit below where it was on CECL day one and that\u2019s largely a function of the elevated used car prices, our mix in prime. So we are seeing loss rates that are much below, I think, 66 basis points was the number this quarter. And so all else equal, you would expect that our coverage ratio there would be well below, what it was at adoption and yet, it\u2019s only a little bit below and that\u2019s for the qualitative factors there. But the largest factor to the total company reserve will clearly be Card. And that\u2019s one where I think it\u2019s always helpful to just start with a reminder of how that allowance is constructed, because answering your question is really dependent on a number of assumptions, where quite frankly your guess could be as good as mine. And so with Card, the first thing that goes into the allowance is just the expectation of future losses and recoveries and you can see within our delinquency bucket in the near-term, but beyond that, we assume that there is a relatively swift normalization of losses from those unusually strong levels, historically strong. The second is the size of the balance sheet, which he saw this quarter is growing at a quite healthy pace when you normalize quarter-over-quarter for seasonal effects and certainly up 19%, I think the number is in Q1 for Card relative to a year ago. And then the third input is that level of qualitative factors and that\u2019s really just to account for a variety of risks related to inflation and various things that are impacting that and just uncertainty in the more macro economy. And so the future allowance is really going to be determined by how all of those effects net out. The one thing that I will just remind you is, what we call the quarter swap effect and that is as credit begins to normalize, we will be replacing a currently low loss quarter with a slightly higher loss quarter, so that\u2019s another thing that will create pressure, all else equal. But if favorable credit trends continue and the factors driving those qualitative reserve subside, we could see the allowance be down to flat. But if normalization plays out and we are growing at a significant clip, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that we will see allowance release, in fact, I can see allowance build. So it\u2019s really just a function of all of those factors. Sorry for the long-winded technical answer there, but I just think all of those factors are really important for you to understand, because the range of outcome on the allowance is quite large. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, Andrew. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is just around consumer spend behavior and volumes. On behavior, are you seeing any shifts in spending on discretionary towards -- shifting towards non-discretionary? And then, secondly, are you -- on the volume side, do you forecast a slowdown in Card spend volume overall as the fed hikes and aims at slowing the economy? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, John. I have not -- look, recently a discretionary versus non-discretionary, so I don\u2019t want to speculate on that. I will tell you a thing that is -- certainly striking is what\u2019s happening with T&E spend these days. Just by way of comparison T&E spend was up 90%, compared to the first quarter of 2021. Of course, that was a very depressed quarter. But up around 20% from first quarter 2019 level. So there is a lot of -- I think would people sort of just bursting out and wanting to free themselves from some of what they have been through in the pandemic, we certainly see strength there. But I think your question about, as really inflation hits and we see just a lot of downstream effects that can happen from that, that certainly could impact Card spend. But I would say a lot of the traction that we have in Card spend is coming from our -- are really spender focused business, and frankly, heavy spender focused business and I think that, I am not sure that a change in inflation is going to have necessarily that much impact on the propensity of the heavy spenders to spend. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We will take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : Hey. Good evening, everyone. Andrew Young : Hey, Ryan. Richard Fairbank : Hey, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Hey, Rich, Andrew. So maybe just to start off, Rich, you referenced the competitive landscape out there in Card and Auto, a few times, I think you said larger upfront bonuses and you are closely watching some of the competitive dynamics. Can you maybe just talk about, what you are seeing out there and I think it\u2019s historically it\u2019s been unusual for you to be grown this fast when the rest of the market is also growing? So I am just wondering, can you maybe just talk about on the Card side, what you are seeing banks versus non-banks and anything you are seeing on the Auto side would be helpful at this point? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Ryan, I do have a smile at your comment, because often we have zagged while -- zig while others zag and we have -- you and I in fact have chatted about that and the reason sometimes behind it. Because it\u2019s not just an accident that sometimes has been our pattern, because part of what we are reading is the competitive marketplace and that has impact on the opportunity and on credit performance and selection dynamics and a lot of things. So your question is a great one, but I think a lot of companies out there to see the strength of the consumer. They are sort of feeling the consumer, sort of roaring back with respect to more normal activities. And I think people are leaning into to take advantage of that and certainly we are. But we -- let me talk a little bit just about the competition in the Card business. We certainly know that there is elevated marketing. All the companies are pretty much coming out and showing more marketing, talking about more marketing, so that is happening and we have a careful eye to see what that does to the opportunity that we are experiencing. But I will kind of come back to our opportunity there, but certainly marketing levels are elevated. Competition in the rewards space is probably a notch more intense than pre-pandemic levels, but it\u2019s pretty stable in recent quarters and not what I would call irrational. Certainly incredibly good players at the top of the market and there is a lot of competition there, but that hasn\u2019t really altered our view of the opportunity, either APRs generally been stable. Turning to the fintechs for a second, obviously we have seen a lot of, buy now pay later activity. I think that we should note that the fintechs who are in the lending business have been lending in the greatest rearview mirror of credit -- industry credit performance that you could ever imagine. And businesses like instalment lending based businesses sometimes are pretty sensitive in that environment. So I -- but we continue to see quite a bit of activity on fintechs as well. But on the Card side, before I turn to Auto, all -- we have an eye on the competition, I think generally the competition while intense is not unreasonable, we have not seen the big changes in people\u2019s underwriting policy, the kinds of things that -- we haven\u2019t seen dramatic changes in pricing. So I think it\u2019s more, I would label it at the intense level that we would expect that a time like this, but not unreasonable and not something that would cause us to move off our pretty strong lean into the growth opportunity. So in the Auto business, let me just talk a little bit about this. The competition in the Auto business continues to remain intense. It\u2019s showing up across the Board from credit unions, big banks and small independent lenders, and it\u2019s playing out across all Credit segments. And you just kind of double-click into that for a second, credit unions that have been wash with deposits, they have been gaining significant share, consistent with what we have observed during prior cycles and especially as interest rates go up a little bit. And let\u2019s talk in fact about rising interest rates. I think it\u2019s almost always the case in business that when in a sense a cost of goods sold rises, there typically is a lag and how that makes it way into consumer pricing. What we have -- as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we have not seen the marketplace, the auto marketplace yet respond in terms of pricing relative to what\u2019s actually happening to interest rates, so there is a some compression there. I think typically what we have seen in the past is competitors respond with differing speeds to interest rate increases. So sometimes players like credit unions tend to and maybe they have different FTP methodologies or whatever it tend to be sort of the slowest to respond, but we -- so we will have to keep an eye on that. But I think that, we are really excited about our opportunity in the Auto business. The technology products that we have out there are really cutting edge and getting a huge amount of traction. Our -- I is just very careful on the pricing out there and also just whether there is an over exuberance relative to the number of planets that are aligned in the auto lending business, particularly what sort of happened to used car values and is -- and in fact that still there, just keep an eye on whether that industry can remain as rational as it\u2019s been in the last couple of years. Ryan Nash : Maybe as a quick follow-up, sticking with things that are unusual, Andrew, you guys are continuing to aggressively return capital. I think you have two different $5 billion asset  out there, which again is unusual for you guys. I was wondering, can you maybe just talk a little bit about the timing of the utilization of those and how to think about use of capital as you are getting closer to the 11% CET1 target? Thank you. Andrew Young : Yeah. I recall that in January, we did not have an active program at the time, so our Board authorized $5 billion and capital levels were even higher than they are today at that point. And so earlier this month in conjunction with the approval of the capital plan in our CCAR submission they authorized an additional $5 billion, which coincides with the capital plan and therefore would be available at the start of the third quarter. But in terms of the pace of that activity, it feels a little bit different than it did when we were at 14.5% over a year ago. To your point like asymptotically we are sort of heading towards 11% and so the pace of repurchases is as always is going to be dependent on our primary use of capital for loan growth and then the dividends. But beyond that, we are going to keep a really close eye on just the level of capital and earnings and growth and end market dynamics and take advantage of the fact that we are able to operate under the SCB framework and maintain that flexibility. So nothing specific in terms of the timeline there, but just wanted to be clear about the approvals when we announced it a few weeks ago. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good evening. Andrew Young : Hi, Betsy. Richard Fairbank : Hi. Good evening, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I guess, just switching gears a little bit. I wanted to ask a little bit about what you are seeing with regard to payment rates and is there any differentiation amongst the customer base as to how that\u2019s been projecting? Richard Fairbank : So, Betsy, we continue to see elevated payment rates across our customer base and while lately it\u2019s been sort of flattening out if you will, I mean, payment rates are just well above pre-pandemic levels. And while not a perfect proxy, you can see these trends in our trust metrics where the payment rate in March remained close to 50%. One of the more recent drivers of higher repayment rates is really the flip side of amazingly strong credit and healthy consumer balance sheets and we certainly expect consumer credit to gradually normalize, maybe you know it\u2019s kind of been happening a little slower than one might otherwise expect. And I certainly believe payment rates will remain sort of the flip side of really strong credit. So over time, the normalization of credit plausibly leads to some normalization of higher payment -- of normal, excuse me, a payment rate. I think there is another phenomenon happening sort of on little cat feet, behind our payment rate numbers and that is that each year we are gaining more and more traction with heavy spenders. Also you may remember for years we talked about, gosh, this goes all the way back to the Great Recession, Capital One\u2019s systematic avoidance of high balance revolvers, which leaves a lot of revenue and earnings on the table during the good times, but is a move for the sake of resilience. But I think this sort of systematic effects of avoiding high balance revolvers and the systematic effects of more and more traction with heavy spenders also has created somewhat of a sort of more sustainable change in our payment rate as well. But, certainly, probably, the biggest factor of the moment is the rate at which consumers are being so creditworthy and putting so much of their money into payments. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And then just as a follow-up on the marketing piece, I know we spoke about a little bit earlier in the call. But as we are thinking through the opportunities that we have, do you feel like there is an opportunity to lean into marketing kind of Q-by-Q-by-Q to a greater degree. So we should build half off of 1Q, such that our marketing is higher year-on-year, full year and that\u2019s what I am getting from the conversation earlier, but I just want to make sure it\u2019s the right takeaway? Richard Fairbank : Well, yeah, let me just -- why don\u2019t I do this, Betsy, let me just pull up and sort of talk about marketing overall and then we can kind of come back to the quarter that we just had. There are few things driving our marketing levels higher these days. First of all, the opportunities that we see. We are seeing attractive growth opportunities across our businesses and we are leaning hard into them while the opportunities are there. In our Card business, we have continued to expand our products and the marketing channels that we are originating in and these opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology transformation, which is enabled us to leverage more data, access more channels, leverage machine learning models and enable customized solutions. So we are seeing significant traction in originations across our business. And I want to note that, so much of our Card business overall and our growth is in our Branded Card franchise, as opposed to co-brand and private label partnerships. And by the way we also like those businesses, but for Capital One that\u2019s a relatively smaller proportion of our business. And in Branded Card, we enjoy the full economics of the business and we own the customer franchise. So while the industry doesn\u2019t track data on this, I think, our share growth in Branded Card s is particularly noteworthy. And Branded Card is, of course, as the word implies, it\u2019s about our brand and we continue to invest in the company\u2019s brand and in the flagship products. And some of the strength that you see in our revenue margin comes from having so much Branded Card, where we own all the economics. But the flip side of that is that, the marketing and the brand building are entirely on us and that all shows up in our marketing numbers. But that\u2019s an absolute centerpiece of building a highly valuable franchise. Now second important driver of our growing marketing spend is the continued traction we are getting in our more than decade long journey, to drive more and more our market with a focus on the heavy spenders. So we launched our venture Card way back in 2010 and that was the beginning of that strategic push for heavy spenders. But it hasn\u2019t just been about flagship Card s, it\u2019s been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and that\u2019s about great products with heavy reward content, it\u2019s about great servicing, it\u2019s about customer experiences tailored for heavy spender lifestyles, and of course, an exceptional digital experience. So for years we have been on this journey and every year we have had growing traction and while our whole franchise of spenders has grown nicely, we have grown even faster with heavier spenders. And with each year of success we have had the license to stretch a little higher up market and we are continuing to invest to make that possible. And lately, you have seen our launch of our travel portal which has garnered some rave reviews in the marketplace. You have seen the launch of airport lounges, which have a special appeal to the top of the market and the frequent travelers. And last fall, we launched Venture X, which moved us into the next tier of premium Card s. And that launch has been very successful and we continue to invest in the growth of that product. You can see some of the results from our continued quest for heavy spenders in the tremendous purchase volume growth that we have had. Over any time period you pick over the last decade or shorter time periods, you will find Capital One with -- posting really high in your top of the league tables, if not at the top of the league tables purchase volume growth. And also note that almost all of the heavy spender growth is in our Branded Card s and that\u2019s why you can see such strength in spend velocity and our revenue margin. This journey for the heavy spender has a different economic mix than some of our traditional Card business. It has higher upfront cost, brand building, higher upfront costs of marketing and promotions, and of course, investment in high end experiences. But long-term value of the heavy spender franchise is tremendous with high spend levels, strong margins, very low losses, low attrition and a lift to our brand and really the rest of our franchise. So the spender franchise is already making its mark on many line items of our financial performance and that\u2019s a continuing long-term benefit of these investments. I just want to mention the third factor contributing to the higher marketing, if some of the traction that we are getting with our new digital offerings, including Auto Navigator, Capital One Shopping and our National Bank. And just to comment on the National Bank, which unlike Capital One, unlike other banks who are driving growth through bank acquisitions, we are focused on continuing to build our bank organically, which of course, does take marketing investment. So that was just, take me a chance to share with you what is behind the pretty high levels of marketing that you are seeing and the great opportunities that we see for our franchise and to grow it. Now, due in part to the current marketplace environment and importantly capitalizing on our strategic quest, those quest being our building of the modern tech stack and the continued move up market. This has -- these things are contributing to driving higher marketing levels these days. So that is -- that sort of a pulling out sort of a narrative on why it is that we are leaning hard into marketing and it\u2019s a combination of sort of the opportunity at the moment, as well as capitalizing on the journey that\u2019s been many years in the making. Typically, we have a seasonal dip in marketing levels this year. An important contributor to our marketing was things related to that, for example, the launch of venture Card s, early spend bonuses and things like that. So things are not -- it\u2019s not quite as strong and a seasonal effect this year as it has been in other years. We are not specifically giving a guidance on the rest of the year, but I just wanted to share with you, why it is that we are leaning in the marketing, what\u2019s driving that and I am -- as you can probably tell from the answer, I am really enthused about our opportunities and we are though leaning into take advantage of them and a lot of that is about marketing. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Rich, just wondering, what would it take to see both kind of -- you talked about some of the potential pressures particularly for the lower end consumer in terms of inflation and other sorts of things. What would it take to actually start to see you pulled back both at the lower end consumer and for the higher spenders, like what sort of -- what will be the warning signs? Richard Fairbank : Yeah. So, Moshe, with respect to the lower end consumers, it\u2019s less about, let\u2019s imagine we don\u2019t have to do very much imagining to envision environments that are more difficult than this one, where the consumers in a more challenged place where the competitors are -- have gone a whole notch more aggressive. And what I think is more our pattern in that case is to particularly use the credit line lever to manage the risk as opposed to just a big dial back say in origination machines. So we just more cautious online, try to continue to build the franchise, maybe not as aggressively as sometimes. But, again, we have over our 30 years, Moshe, in building sort of Main Street franchise, really do a lot of the regulating and things on the loan side . On heavy spenders we continued to find so much traction and what I have often said about the quest for heavy spenders, unlike a lot of things that I have seen in our business journey, this is not a thing that is very well suited to a blitz here a pullback of blitz and a pull back. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean we wouldn\u2019t be dialing the knobs up and down, on certain things like marketing or choices or product or whatever. But this is and I think there is a reason that not very many players are really, really successful at the top of the market. This is about really building a franchise at that end of the market. That\u2019s not just taking regular consumer products and addressing them up with more rewards or the fancy advertising and the -- that\u2019s why, I mentioned, this journey that were like in the 12th year of the journey where we declared we are going to just keep moving up market. One can\u2019t do it overnight. It\u2019s something you have to earn along the way. But all of our metrics continue to show traction and success, traction on brand metrics as well, and pretty much all the customer metrics, you have seen what\u2019s happening on purchase volumes, the -- when we track, the things that we have booked over the years we sort of love the annuities we are booking. So that to me is something that we are going to keep pursuing as we have for a long time. But what we will -- the things that we will throttle along the way are certain marketing choices, certain product choices, but that one, that I partly shared -- I want to share this a little bit more about this today that that\u2019s a journey that Capital One has been on as part of our central part of our strategy in Card for a lot of years. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks, Rich. And as -- maybe as a follow up, could you talk a little bit about where you see the industry and Capital One in terms of the deposit price competition is now starting to see a deposit betas as we are now starting to see interest rates moving up? Andrew Young : Sure. Moshe, it\u2019s Andrew. And recognizing that retail deposits are 85% of our portfolio, I will focus on that and over the last gosh six-ish years we had the falling rate cycle over the last couple where betas were right around 50% and then the last rising cycle, which was from the late 2015, I think, to early 2019, our cumulative beta was right around 40% and so betas are generally slow to rise over the first couple of hikes. But keep in mind is that last rising rate cycle we had eight hikes over 3.5 years, I believe it was, whereas in this cycle we could see four hikes that each equal 25 basis points and get up to 250 or 275 is forward suggest quite quickly. So I could make a case that industry betas will be higher or lower than that history. On the lower side there is elevated deposit balances across the industry, that loan-to-deposit ratios are quite low, industry NIMs are low and we are moving off a zero floor. But the flip side is the larger and quicker rate hikes, the possibility of some more aggressive pricing by institutions that are more reliant, on those funds to deposits to fund loan growth and institutional surge deposit run-off. So just want to give you a flavor of -- I think there is a lot that we are going to learn over the course of the next few months. But as we look at all and have a point estimate, that kind of run through all of our assumptions and our point estimate at this point is that, going to largely be in line with that rising, the last rising cycle of something like 40 basis points that starts-off a little slower and picks-up. But again they start-off slower might be a particularly condensed timeframe relative to what we saw in that last cycle. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : We will take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Quick question on the outlook for the adjusted efficiency ratio from Q1 levels, and then, Rich, on Commercial Card issuing, can you talk about that business and I know it\u2019s -- you have been marketing I know in that small business Card, which has been sort of tough for banks to rollout? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Don, thank you. We have been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years. And the pandemic also accelerated technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and certainly in banking. And I think for every player the clock is ticking on their tech readiness and companies are waking up to the investment imperative. And we have talked about the investment flowing into fintechs is breathtaking and the arms race for tech talent is fierce is that I have seen in any time in my career and in any job family. So there is an urgency in responding to the marketplace. But I do want to also say that the fast-moving marketplace is also the creator of our opportunity and I think Capital One is uniquely positioned to take advantage of that opportunity and that\u2019s why we are investing now. So really this is very similar message to what I said last quarter. What I have been saying for a long time, we are still very focused on the opportunity to drive operate -- operating efficiency improvement over the longer term. The engine that powers it is revenue growth and digital productivity gains. But the timing of efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. So, but delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be an incredibly important north star to us and frankly one of the most important payoffs of our technology journey and an important element of how we deliver long-term value. So I think you have sort of seen -- you can see some of the effects of what I am talking about in the first quarter operating efficiency and when you adjust for gains from portfolio sales in the quarter. So I think it\u2019s very similar conversation to what I was saying last time, we can see some of the evidence of that in the quarterly numbers, but the current pressure doesn\u2019t change at all, our belief in the longer term opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement. Andrew Young : Don, what was your question on Commercial? Don Fandetti : Yeah. Richard Fairbank : Oh! Sorry. Sorry. Don Fandetti : My question was\u2026 Richard Fairbank : You wanted to... Don Fandetti : \u2026Rich, your outlook on commercial, I know, as you rollout of node limit small business Card, which has been tougher banks to do. I didn\u2019t know if maybe you are using the public cloud, just wanted to see your thoughts on that? Richard Fairbank : Yeah. So when you are talking about, yeah, Commercial you are talking about here in our business Card -- business Credit Card. You may have seen the ads on TV that talk about no preset spending limit that\u2019s more complicated way to just say in a sense, not a credit limit that gets hard wired. This is something that is you know, dynamically there isn\u2019t a credit line per say this is dynamic transaction underwriting in real time. It\u2019s a very hard thing to build. It\u2019s taken us years to get there and it\u2019s absolutely a -- one of the many, many benefits of the tech transformation we have done and the journey to the cloud in the building of modern applications in modern platforms. And so, I have always said to -- investors will often ask where can I see, where is the -- I want to reach out and touch the benefit of your tech transformation and all the money we have spent on that. And I have said, look, there is not going to be any one thing, that you point out and say, oh, my gosh, that\u2019s I now see everything. This is about this journey -- is a journey that when we -- when years ago when we kind of said, some day we would like to do this thing over here, some day we would like to do that. We would also like to have much better efficiency, we would like to better risk management, we would like to do lots of things and a striking thing was, all the things that we wanted to do, usually in life, they are -- you have to pick some and it\u2019s all about trade-offs. What I am struck by in this journey is a shared path to all the things that years ago we set out to do and that path relates to building modern technology across the company and from the bottom of the tech stack up and that is what we have done. And then over time, you as investors will see manifestations of that. See while that Auto Navigator product Capital One built that can underwrite every car in America and for any consumer in a fraction of the second that\u2019s striking and then one sees, well also -- you actually have a no preset spending limit that\u2019s striking. And we didn\u2019t do the journey for the sake of any one of those, but I think on an increasing basis, investors will see examples of things that are -- that stand on the shoulders of the years of investment we have made in technology. And things that also by themselves like this Card thing we are talking about is itself, within that journey that took a bunch of years. But it\u2019s all about working backwards from wins with customers and that\u2019s why we are doing that. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our final question this evening will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Thanks very much guys for fitting in my question. Rich, you talked a lot about credit in the strength of your customer base. Aside from that, that we are seeing you, call it, some of the more modern or emerging platforms, we are observing some delinquency drift there. And in fact, we are even seeing some reactions in the capital markets, some securitization deals are getting canceled or renegotiated as they go. I am wondering what do you ascribe that to and are there any reverberating effects from that type of development or migration into your business over time? Richard Fairbank : So, John, as I often say with the smile, Capital One was one of the original fintechs. We are a fintech -- before fintechs were word. But if you think about what we did is, we built a lending company, we started with Cards that we ultimately building a broad based financial institution. One thing that enabled that journey to happen is the advent of the capital markets and we were able to ride the very mediocre growth Capital One in the \u201890s based on securitizations and things and so we were very grateful for that. But at the same time we then did, probably one of the most things that I think most shocked our investors, I guess, it shocked because you spent a lot of years talking about it before we did it, but striking thing when we chose to transform our company to a traditional bank balance sheet, because we want to create much greater resilience in our funding. So the reason I mentioned that is, as we were in the old days and as fintechs that are built on securitization, have an opportunity to grow quickly. But they also have a just an inherent structural challenge with resilience. So, for all of them, they need to and their investors need to keep a careful eye on that. I want to talk just a little bit about, you mentioned, some of the lending results and some of the uptick. So first of all, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see upticks and delinquencies just for companies in general, whether they are banks or some of the fintechs. Typically, companies that have a less of a history of consumer credit data are probably more challenged with respect to how to read this rearview mirror. I mean, for example, let\u2019s just say, that you created a fintech in the last couple of years, how would one look in the rear view mirror and determine where resilience is and where it isn\u2019t, since in general pretty much everybody did well. So that\u2019s one of the challenge any new company has is building deepen of credit history to do that. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s just a challenge they bring to the table, it\u2019s not their fault. There is nothing. It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a structural thing. The other thing that always happens with normalization, as normalization tends to happen faster on front books than back books and so part of what you may be seeing on fintechs is, if their high growth fintechs, just the proportion that their front book represents as a percentage of the whole is quite different and it would be surprising if they didn\u2019t normalize faster, given that typically front books normalize faster than back books. And a lot of us have seasoned back books with years of experience with them and that\u2019s also very helpful in normalization journey. So as one that was an original fintech, I have great fascination with the fintechs, lot of respect for a lot of things they are doing. But also know that, there is some structural things that they are going to have to confront that they and their investors will have to keep an eye on. John Hecht : Perfect. Appreciate the color there. Jeff Norris : Well, thank you for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember Investor Relations team will be here after the call to answer any further questions you may have. Thanks for joining us. Have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

For more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports, both accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Young : Thanks, Danielle, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $2 billion or $4.96 per diluted common share. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans held for investment grew 6% and average loans grew 4%, driven by growth across all of our segments. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% or 3% after accounting for the $192 million gain on sale recognized in the prior quarter. Non-interest expense grew 1% in the quarter, driven by an increase in marketing, which was partially offset by lower operating expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion driven mostly by net charge-offs of $845 million and a $200 million allowance build. Turning to slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The total company's $200 million allowance build in the quarter brings our allowance balance up 2% to $11.5 billion as of June 30th. Our total company coverage ratio decreased 15 basis points to 3.88%. The changes in allowance and coverage ratio varied by segment, which I'll cover on slide five. Across all our businesses, loan growth and a worsening economic outlook drove upward pressure on allowance. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $145 million. The coverage in Consumer Banking increased 14 basis points to 2.51%. In our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $152 million. The coverage in Commercial Banking increased five basis points and now stands at 1.36%. In addition to the allowance build, there was also $39 million of provision related to unfunded lending commitments. In our Domestic Card business, we released $128 million of allowance despite the effects of the growth and worsening economic outlook I previously mentioned. We have seen some signs of gradual normalization in our card credit metrics. But so far, the pace of that normalization has been slower than what we assumed when we set last quarter's allowance. The impact of this slower-than-assumed normalization more than offset the growth and worsening economic outlook, leading to the allowance release. We continue to carry elevated levels of qualitative reserves for downside risks related to economic uncertainty. The coverage ratio for Domestic Card now stands at 6.82%. Turning to page six. I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 144%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves declined $17 billion in the quarter as our liquidity normalizes towards pre-pandemic levels. Cash and cash equivalents declined about $5 billion and now stands at $22 billion. We also had a $6 billion decline in our securities portfolio driven by the combination of the mark from rising interest rates and the continued runoff of the outsized portfolio built during the pandemic. Turning to page seven, I'll cover our net interest margin. Net interest income in the quarter was $6.5 billion, up 13% from the year ago quarter and up 2% from the sequential quarter. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.54%, 65 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and five basis points higher than the prior quarter. Relative to a year ago, the increase in NIM is largely driven by a balance sheet shift as we continue to deploy excess cash and securities into loan growth. The linked quarter increase in NIM was driven by an additional day to recognize revenue. Higher yields on assets in the quarter were offset by higher wholesale funding and deposit costs. Outside of quarterly day count, our NIM from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix, the impacts of interest rates beyond forwards, wholesale funding costs, and the impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas. Turning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.1% at the end of the second quarter, down about 60 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases and growth in risk-weighted assets. We continue to estimate that our long-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. In the quarter, the pace of our repurchases slowed to about $2 billion. The pace of any future repurchases will be driven by a number of factors, including our actual and forecasted capital earnings, growth, economic conditions and market dynamics. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on slide 10 with second quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic card results which are shown on slide 11. Our Domestic Card business posted another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in every top line metrics. Purchase volume for the second quarter was up 18% year-over-year and up 48% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Ending loan balances increased $19.7 billion or about 21% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 6% from the sequential quarter, and revenue was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans, as well as strong revenue margin. Strong credit results continued in the quarter. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to gradually normalize, but remain well below pre-pandemic levels. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.26%, a 2 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.35%, 67 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 14 basis points, roughly in line with normal seasonal patterns. The delinquency rate was up 3 basis points from the linked quarter, which we -- when we typically see modest seasonal improvement. Non-interest expense was up 28% from the second quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was about $1 billion in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest, but not the only driver of total company marketing trends. The primary non-card driver of increased marketing is in our Consumer Banking business, where we're marketing to drive deposit growth and build customer franchise in our digital-first national banking strategy. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to see opportunities to book accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns. And we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build a franchise across our Domestic Card businesses. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risk. And as always, we underwrite to a worsening scenario, even as we lean into marketing. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in purchase volume, new accounts and loans across our Domestic Card business. And we continue to gain traction in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders. In the second quarter, heavy spender marketing includes increased early spend bonuses driven by strong first quarter account growth and spending as well as investments in franchise enhancements like our travel portal and airport lounges. As a result of our marketing, we posted strong growth in heavy spender accounts and strong engagement and spend behaviors with new and existing customers. We're gaining share and building a long-term franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the market. Pulling up, our heavy spender franchise has a different economic mix than some of our other card businesses. It has significantly higher upfront costs of brand building, marketing and promotions and investments in high-end experiences. However, the long-term economics are compelling. And as our heavy spender franchise has grown significantly in recent years, its impact has quietly and gradually changed several Domestic Card metrics and financial results. Heavy spender credit losses are low, which lowers overall Domestic Card loss rates, all other things being equal. Naturally high heavy spender payment behaviors are a key driver of our long-term trend of increasing domestic card payment rates, and high payment rates go hand-in-hand with strong credit performance. Heavy spender attrition is very low, and that's been a factor in our strong Domestic Card loan growth. Heavy spenders have a particularly large impact on increasing purchase volume and have been a major driver of strong Domestic Card purchase volume growth that has generally exceeded loan growth over time. This spend velocity has driven increases in net interchange revenue in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue. And these interchange fee revenues -- revenue annuities are strong and sustained over very long-term customer relationships. Our heavy spender franchise generates financial results that are attractive, less volatile and very resilient. As a result, the heavy spender business requires less capital and delivers strong long-term returns on capital. Pulling way up, our 10-year quest to build our heavy spender franchise has brought with it significantly increased levels of marketing, but the sustained revenue, credit resilience and capital benefits of this enduring franchise are compelling, and they're growing. Slide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the second quarter, choices we made in our auto business impacted several Consumer Banking trends. We pulled back on growth in auto in response to competitive pricing dynamics. As you'd expect, many auto lenders have raised pricing as rising interest rates drove higher marginal funding costs, but some others have kept pricing relatively flat. These competitors have gained market share and pressured industry margins. We chose to pull back on auto originations, which declined 20% year-over-year and 12% from the linked quarter. As we pulled back on originations, the year-over-year growth of ending loans in the Consumer Banking business decelerated to 9% in the second quarter. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans were up 1%. Second quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 2% year-over-year, aided in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits from our commercial bank. Consumer Banking deposits declined 1% from the sequential quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter as growth in auto loans was offset by the effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees and the year-over-year decline in auto margins.  Auto margin compression was primarily driven by the increase in our marginal funding costs, resulting from rapid interest rate increases and the aggressive competitor pricing that, I just discussed. Noninterest expense was up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2021, driven by the increased marketing for our digital national bank and continuing investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses. Second quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of $306 million in the second quarter of 2021 to a net expense of $281 million. We added to the allowance for credit losses in our auto business in the quarter compared to an allowance release in the year ago quarter. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continue to gradually normalize, but we remain well below pre-pandemic levels.  The charge-off rate for the second quarter was 0.61%, up 73 basis points from the unsustainably low, in fact, negative quarterly charge-off rate a year ago. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.47%, up 121 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was down 5 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 62 basis points. Slide 13 shows second quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans and revenue in the quarter. Second quarter ending loan balances were up 9% from the sequential quarter. Average loans increased 5%. Growth in selected industry specialties drove our growth.  Ending deposits were down 14% from the first quarter and down 10% year-over-year, driven in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits to our retail bank that I mentioned a few moments ago, as well as rate-driven runoff as some customers withdrew deposits in search of higher returns. In the second quarter, deposit balances were also impacted by seasonal outflows.  Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the linked quarter and 26% from the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was down modestly from the linked quarter and up 16% year-over-year. Provision for credit losses increased $214 million from the first quarter, largely driven by a build in the allowance for credit losses. Commercial Banking credit remained strong in the second quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 14 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.3%, and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.7%. In closing, we continued to drive good growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the second quarter. Consumer Banking loan growth continued, albeit at a slower pace. And our Commercial Banking business posted strong growth in loans and revenue. Credit results remain across our businesses, with charge-off rates and delinquency rates well below pre-pandemic levels even as credit continues to gradually normalize. And we continued to return capital to our shareholders. For more than three decades, we have hardwired resilience into every underwriting and growth choice we make in good times and bad. And we've steadfastly focused on building an enduring franchise. Sticking to these core tenets, we've demonstrated resilience through several cycles. We've been in a strong position to seize opportunities as markets evolve and as cycles played out. And we've delivered significant value over the long-term. And we're living by these same core tenets today. We continue to see opportunities to lean into marketing and resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities long after the normalization trends and cyclical credit pressures play out. We're confident in the choices we're making. As we continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and increasing economic uncertainty, our credit results remain strong. We're staying focused on the most resilient businesses and sub-segments. And we're continuing to hone the proprietary underwriting and product structures that have driven our resilience through prior cycles. All of these growth in credit risk management choices are enhanced by our technology transformation. We're managing costs tightly even as we continue to invest in transforming our technology and digital capabilities that are the engine of future growth and efficiency. While the imperatives and marketplace opportunities and risks impact the timing, we remain focused on delivering operating leverage over the long-term powered by growth and digital productivity gains. And we're managing capital prudently to put ourselves in a strong position to weather a broad range of possible economic scenarios and to emerge in a strong position to capitalize on opportunities that are often generated as cycles play out. Pulling way up, we believe that our long-standing core tenets and the choices they drive today are putting us in a strong position to continue to deliver resilience and compelling long-term shareholder value as the sweeping digital transformation of banking continues. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Danielle? Danielle Dietz : Thanks, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up question. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Melinda, please start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey good evening everyone. Richard Fairbank : Good evening Ryan. Ryan Nash : Rich, maybe just to start off on marketing, which was up again sequentially. Have we seen the peak impacts of the early bonuses? And maybe just more broadly, are you guys still leaning in? And maybe you could just talk about the decision in the context of where we are in the economy with inflation? And maybe are you pulling back in any pockets just given what's going on across the customer base? Richard Fairbank : Ryan, we -- on the early bonuses, I mean, that's really tied to how hard we lean into Venture X, for example. I mean we have early spend bonuses pretty much across our rewards business. So, let me separate a little bit. So, we have the launch of Venture X, and some companies launches are sort of a quarter long kind of thing. We continue to lean into that. You've seen our national advertising continue on that. So, the early spend bonuses continue as part of that and then also their early spend bonuses at a stable rate for the -- some of our other rewards products as well. With respect to the economy, we -- it's not lost on us that there's a lot of noise out there in the economy. And we -- every day, we talk about this and there's always uncertainty. There's probably, I think, more uncertainty at the moment and probably on average, and that's not lost on us. We -- so we don't make a top-of-the-house decision that says we're going to spend this much on marketing because these decisions are very -- decisions at the margin based on models and estimated loss rates and putting resilience factors in there and response rates and a lot of things. There has been some trimming around the edges in card quite a bit more so in auto, by the way, as I talked about just a few minutes ago. But staying with card for a minute, there has been some trimming around the edges. But generally, the kind of core target segments that we've been going after, we are continuing to feel good about and lean into. So, I think your net impression should be that while we have a very watchful eye on the economy and obsess about it every day, our underwriting decisions underwrite systematically. At Capital One, we underwrite to a worsening scenario. And so we feel good about our originations. And -- but one thing about our tech transformation that has really been good also is it allows us to move and adapt much more quickly. In most -- in companies and frankly, in some of our past years, when we decided to turn, it sometimes took quite a bit of time to move the whole machine. We've been able to create a much more adaptive and responsive infrastructure at Capital One. And so that's also helpful in a time of uncertainty. But net-net, we feel good about the opportunities, and we're leaning into them. Danielle Dietz : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Thank you very much. Could you further discuss some of the things that you're seeing on the auto sector just given where it's been throughout 2021 where we saw really good performance? And then now it just seems like the combination of rising delinquency rates, unresponsive yields and just some softening in used car prices are really impacted. Can you just give us an outlook on what your expectations are and how Capital One going to react through this year and potentially in a recessionary environment in 2023? Thank you. Danielle Dietz : Rich, I think you need to unmute yourself. Richard Fairbank : Sorry, sorry. Kevin, thank you. The auto business is one that -- I mean, we're still -- we still see significant opportunity in the auto business. But, of course, what we always share with investors is how we're feeling at the moment and at the margin. So the biggest at the moment thing that we wanted to share with you is how the competitive environment feels. And we've been saying for some time that the low charge-offs, we worry that too long of a period of low charge-offs and too long of a period of, in many ways, unsustainably high used car prices can dull the senses of players in the auto industry and cause a weakening in underwriting. We haven't really seen -- that's not the primary story that we see. We certainly are on the lookout for that. The story has really been more hijacked, if you will, by what's happened with inflation and the significant increase in -- for companies and in cost of funds. And most auto players, and certainly, the money center, in particular, have moved up their pricing very consistently and responsibly to the increases in the underlying cost of funds in the economy. And what is striking is that, some competition has not. There are a few large players whose movement is -- in pricing is well behind that. And then you have the credit unions who have, I think, a very different kind of business model and a different way to calculate what their funding cost is. The credit unions have really not moved at all in terms of their pricing, and they've had actually a very significant increase in market share. So we are -- we continue to be very dedicated to the auto business. We have relationships with dealers. We're not -- this is not like a huge pullback, but what we're doing at the margin is, with the tighter margins that now at least temporarily exist in the business, for us, that has led us to trim around the edges. That's, I think, the biggest story that we would say in auto. The other thing is used car pricing. Let's talk just a little bit about that, Kevin. Vehicle values remain strikingly high and obviously well above pre-pandemic levels. And supply constraints remain the biggest factors supporting high vehicle values. And everything that we see suggests vehicle production will remain constrained in the near-term. And even when production normalizes, I think it will take time for dealers to rebuild their inventories. So probably the near-term outlook is pretty good with respect to used car values. But if I pull up a concern that I've often voiced is that from an underwriting point of view, what really matters is not the absolute level of collateral values, but the relative value of collateral values versus the underwriting assumptions that a lender made. And so we assume significant declines in collateral values in our underwriting, but we have a watchful eye on an industry that for quite some time now has been hopefully not getting used to the used car prices that are at relatively -- are at record levels versus anything we've seen in the past. So I think the auto opportunity continues to be a significant one for Capital One, but particularly driven by pricing, which may, by the way, ameliorate for certainly everyone except the credit unions in a relatively short period of time. But until then, we will continue to be pretty tight around the edges, and we wanted to share that with you. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening, Rich, Capital One has long been known for its rich information-based analytics. How are you thinking about the risk that the strength we're seeing in the consumer and labor markets is in and of itself inflationary and could lead the Fed to have to do more? And since the impact of Fed hikes tends to be lagged, unemployment tends to continue to increase well after peak Fed funds, maybe can you talk a little bit about how this dynamic feeds into costs, underwriting and reserving models? Richard Fairbank : Okay. So -- well, thanks. Let's just kind of pull up and talk about inflation. We haven't seen sustained inflation in the US in many decades, but it's been running above 5% for over a year now, and it reached, I think, 9.1% in June. And producer prices are increasing even faster. And of course, the Fed has started raising rates in response, and the market expects further increases. So what I want to do is maybe list some of the potential impacts to our business of sustained inflation, and it's mostly negative. So if the economy suffers as a result of efforts to slow inflation, we will certainly feel that. And the biggest way that we would feel that would be in consumer credit losses. Consumers also were already starting to feel the impact of price inflation outpacing wage growth. Also in our lending business, higher cost of funds could put pressure on our margins, especially if lenders don't adjust pricing in response.  And we're already seeing that in the auto business. By the way, in the card business, just as a comparison, I've been struck by generally the responsiveness of the pricing in the card business to be responsively adaptive to interest rates. I mean it's a variable rate product, but also just in terms of offered rate by competitors, that seems to have moved much more dynamically than what we've seen selectively in auto.  Then other things about the impact of interest rate increases, let me think. We've got \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can sometimes see lower demand for credit products just because headline pricing seems higher even if real pricing isn't. And in our underwriting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, let me just say one thing, and you put your finger on it. Well, a striking thing right now is, how low the unemployment rate is. And we have certainly seen in our modeling of credit over all the decades, we've been doing this at Capital One.  From a macroeconomic point of view, the biggest direct driver of credit losses is unemployment. And so, we start in a very strong position now. But to your point, there's irony in the strength of this position, and it could contribute to some of the affects you identified.  I do want to also just -- while we're on the subject of inflation, though, just highlight a few favorable effects of inflation as well. Existing debt levels will decrease in real terms in a period of sustained inflation. High vehicle values, which support auto credit, may be more sustainable in a high inflation environment. But in total, I think the effects tilt definitely in the negative direction.  So, it's a tough thing to model collectively all these things, but what we do is we start with sort of a general theory of how this stuff works. We try to incorporate it into the decision-making that we do. And then like a hawk, we look for these various effects to happen and are prepared to be responsive.  And in fact, just the one last thing I want to say is, I've always felt that it's very hard to predict economic cycles. I don't think Capital One is in a better position than anyone else to predict economic cycles. Sometimes you've seen us weigh in, in predicting credit cycles, which can be correlated, but not the same thing as that. But the most important thing that -- what I take away from years of doing this is, it's very hard to predict these cycles.  The key thing is to underwrite to a resilience level to make it very successfully through cycles, and that's been a cornerstone of our strategy, actually since the founding day of Capital One. Bill Carcache : Yes, super helpful Rich. Thank you for taking my question. I will let others jump in. thanks. Danielle Dietz : Great. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Rich, when I sort of piece together everything that I'm hearing and looking at the numbers, if we particularly focus on the growth and the reserve movements at the consumer lending business, the Credit Card business and the commercial lending business, it kind of feels like you are diverging in your outlook in terms of the Credit Card business outperforming the other businesses likely from a cost perspective. Is that because of competitive pressures, or is there something in line that you're seeing that would cause that divergence? Richard Fairbank : So Rick, I don't know if we explicitly run around with a -- I wouldn't say our view is that stark as you say it, but I think that we certainly feel the most bullish about the card business. Let's talk about why for a second. First of all, just as the business and with the business model Capital One has, with the resilience it's shown through several downturns now and the power of leveraging data and analytics and mass customization to that business, I think that we feel particularly high level of resilience in that business, and that has been demonstrated in the past. And if anything, I think the technology transformation and some of the continued choices we've made like dialing back from high balance revolvers and other things has -- and as I said, the whole heavy spender push, I think, has put Capital One and actually an even stronger position from a resilience point of view. Also in terms of what we see going on with the -- in the business, there is normalization, but it is really quite gradual. By the way, the normalization is gradual across all of our businesses. But the -- but I want to point out just a bit of a math point in auto, for example. Auto is normalizing gradually, so is card, but -- and the front book with respect to auto and card, which are both normalizing faster than the back book, by the way, I've seen that universally, whenever there's normalization, one always sees it more in the front book than in seasoned back books. But if you think about auto as an average life of like two years, and Credit Card last much longer than that. And so as there's front book normalization, the replacement speed in the portfolio in auto is much faster than in card. So even for the same amount of normalization in those two businesses, in, say, the front book, you're going to get just mathematically faster normalization in auto. So it is our expectation. It would be surprising to us if that weren't the case, more just because of the math of replacement of a more rapidly turning over portfolio. So, we certainly -- card is the business we're most bullish about is the one that we're leaning hardest into. And you'll notice our story here. We're not -- our story is not a universal one that says I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there, but we feel great about growth. So, we're leaning into it everywhere. You can see an example of what you've seen over the years of how Capital One works. Everything is choices that is made at the margin locally, I mean, in various businesses. And the fact that in auto, we're pulling back significantly as we've talked about while leaning pretty hard in the card and certain parts of commercial is a window into that very phenomenon. Rick, thank you very much. Rick Shane : Thank you. Danielle Dietz : Rick, did you have a follow-up question? Okay, we'll go to the next question, please, Melinda. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. A question for Andrew. Could you just talk about how you see the NIM progressing from here? Obviously, the rate outlook suggests more rates than last quarter. Maybe just talk about how you're seeing deposit betas progress and sort of how that plays through the NIM? Andrew Young : Sure, Sanjay. Why don't I start with beta and just give a little bit of detail there and then feather it into the broader NIM question you asked. And so when you look at our deposits, roughly 15% are a combination of commercial and brokered, which have higher betas, but really the 800-pound gorilla is the -- something like 85% of the deposits that are in retail. So, I'll focus mostly there. And I think looking back on history as a guide is a bit of a challenge in this cycle. So we've already seen 150 bps of move in the first six months. We're expecting another 200 or so over the next. And in the last rising cycle, it took three and a half years to just get to 200 in that first year. We moved 50 in total versus the 350 we might see this year. And so I share that context to say the faster and larger set of moves, coupled with quantitative tightening and the possibility of some competitors being a bit more aggressive to fund their loan growth, all will play into how competitors behave and the overall level of deposits. And so if I look at the last rising cycle, we were at something like 40%. And the last falling cycle, we were around 50. But given the factors that I described a moment ago, it's hard to really pinpoint exactly what's going to transpire looking ahead, but I would think our cumulative beta could be around or slightly above the last rising cycle. And so in line with what you've seen historically, beta moves pretty slowly in the beginning to the first set of hikes. And so this quarter, you saw that we were high single-digits, but the planned rate hikes for the second half of the year are likely going to pressure that beta up. And so, when I take that and factor it into our NIM outside, obviously, of the quarterly day count effects, the tailwinds to our NIM are going to be the asset mix moving towards higher yielding assets like card. And what we saw in this quarter, by the way, ending card loans grew faster than average, so the more that card is growing relative to other asset classes and the cash and investment portfolio and then just the broader asset yield increases from the higher interest rates. Those are things that are going to be tailwinds. The headwinds are going to be the deposit costs, not only from the rising deposit betas that I just described, but also wholesale funding costs to the extent that we do more of that and depending on credit spreads in the marketplace. But there isn't one dominant force in those factors from where we stand today. So I think they're all going to be pushing against one another and we're going to see where that nets out in the coming quarters. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Just a follow-up question for Rich. Obviously, there's been a massive dislocation in the fintech space from a valuation standpoint. I'm curious if you think that presents opportunities for M&A for Capital One. Thanks. A \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Sanjay. Capital One, we've said for a number of years that unlike most banks, we're not on a quest to go buy other banks and build our national banking franchise that way. So -- and that really where we would do acquisitions, it would really be of -- either basically of tech companies themselves that bring a tech capability or fintechs that bring a tech-based capability right in our business sweet spot. So we have -- for that reason, plus our great interest in learning from fintechs, we have been very keen observers of that marketplace. We -- you haven't seen much in the way of acquisitions from Capital One, because of the breathtaking pricing that fintechs have had. But certainly, to your point, as the pricing has crashed in that marketplace, we continue to watch the market carefully. And our strategy remains the same that we believe that Capital One is kind of an ideal buyer for fintechs, because we have a modern tech stack and we built a company that feels very much like a tech company and I think is very well suited to acquire and assimilate and provide opportunity to the talent that comes in a tech acquisition. So that's sort of the principle behind it. So we continue to look in the marketplace, and that's the primary acquisition interest that Capital One has, which is kind of different from, I think, most banking institutions. Danielle Dietz : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hi. Rich, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about where you see more downside surprise risk on the credit spectrum. Is it the lower end consumer, or is it the affluent heavy spender? And I guess on the low end, can consumers really weather the strong inflation, in particular, unemployment softens a little bit? Richard Fairbank : So Don, thank you for that. Let's start by just talking about the consumer. Certainly, I'm certainly struck by the starting point of where the consumer is because the US consumer remains quite healthy. We see sustained improvements in consumer balance sheets coming out of the pandemic. Let's see. Debt servicing burdens remain near like mutli decade lows. The savings rate has dipped below pre-pandemic levels over the past few months, but cumulative savings over the last two years remain a significant positive still for consumers on average. We see higher bank account balances and higher household net worth across the income spectrum. Labor market demand remains exceptionally strong with record numbers of job openings and solid wage growth. And in our own portfolio, we see continuing strength in our delinquency roll rates and recovery rates. Despite times of credit normalization, our credit metrics remain strikingly strong by any standard -- any historical standards. So that is the context that we see. But to your point, the big headwinds for consumers are price inflation and higher interest rates. And inflation could erode the excess savings consumers accumulated through the pandemic, especially if price increases continue to run ahead of wage growth. Higher interest rates could push up debt servicing burdens, although this effect is muted by the fact that most existing household debt is in fixed rate mortgages and auto loans. So I'm struck by, though, the strong starting point for consumers as we look into the potential -- the headwinds of inflation and more economic trouble. And I would contrast this, of course, to the Great Recession or the global financial crisis, which -- where the consumer was in a much weaker position going into that. Now the strength of the consumer is pretty much across the board -- across the -- from the top of the market into sub-prime. And so I think the thing most striking is how sort of universal it is. But it is also the case that normalization is a bit more pronounced in sub-prime than it is higher in the market. But these \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these populations, though, Also more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic. So, I think these trends shouldn't be surprising. So, I think certainly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now FICO score and income are not the same thing. But a lot of times, people tend to state them in the same breadth. Our subprime business is definitionally about people with FICO scores below a certain level. But I think that the consumer starts in a strong place, then we should probably expect normalization to be a little faster on the lower end. And interestingly, if you switch to kind of income, which is a different cut than FICO certainly, and income, I'm struck by the fact that consumers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the wage growth for the lower income consumers is -- they're kind of the one category, the lower income consumers, where their wage growth has been keeping up with inflation, but that won't necessarily continue, but that's also a position of strength. But pulling way up, I think we could see normalization a little faster in subprime. I think, in fact, we already can see very modestly that effect. But of course, in our underwriting and the whole business model of Capital One, that's also where we have built in kind of the biggest buffers of resilience. So, we feel good about that part of the marketplace. We feel good really across the credit spectrum and to lean into our marketing opportunity. Don Fandetti : Got it. Thank you. A \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Danielle Dietz : Great. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Rich, you had mentioned that you saw good kind of increases in prices for new accounts across the spectrum. But at the same time, I guess, rewards and upfront bonuses have also been very high. Can you just talk about how you're seeing the kind of competitive environment, particularly for the higher-end consumer where you're spending a lot of that effort? Richard Fairbank : Yes. So, competition in the rewards space is, I'd say, more intense than pre-pandemic -- a bit more intense than pre-pandemic levels, but largely unchanged in recent quarters. So early spend bonuses in points offers were slightly more aggressive than in the first quarter, and we continue to see certain offers come in and out of market.  Cash, early spend bonuses are higher now than pre-pandemic, but have been relatively stable at these elevated levels since basically mid last year. And then if we look at the baseline rewards earn rates, particularly in the cashback space, they overall were probably more aggressive in the middle of 2021 as new products were being introduced, but it's been relatively calm since. Now we feel great about our flagship products. We continue to be very pleased by consumers' response and engagement with them. We're very pleased with the launch of our Venture X card. But I think if I pull way up, Moshe, one of the things that I so deeply believe and have experienced is that winning in the heavy spender space, I think it requires good products, but you can't win with good products. It takes a lot more than that. And the customer experience, specifically the digital experience, the brand, the -- a lot of experiential things that are way beyond the product are part of the whole package. And what we have said -- this is why we've been saying for years now that winning at the top of the market is not an in and out thing. It is a matter of choosing as a few players have done, Capital One being one of them that, that's where we're going, and we're going to continue to lean into that. And I have been struck by the sustainable success that we have been generating. And also the marketplace, while very intense hasn't tipped over to being unreasonable or irrational. So it's very competitive, but I continue to really like our opportunity in that space. Moshe Orenbuch : And maybe just as a follow-up. The yield for the last four quarters in your card business has been pretty flat both the yield on the loans up a little bit this quarter, I guess, with the rate increases that you talked about. But what is it really going to take to get that to be a higher number? Is it -- are you going to see more revolving from some of your high-end consumers? Is it -- what is it going to -- to get that -- the level of revenue growth and profitability enhanced? Andrew Young : Hey Moshe, it's Andrew. And I think if you put the card yield in the context of a longer term history, looking a year ago, it's up 100 basis points. And that's really been a shift to a higher mix of assets in our branded book, which is both growth of existing customers and the success we're seeing in the originations that Rich talked about. And as we sit here today and looking over the last few quarters, we're also seeing a modest uptick in fees from the very low levels last year and so driven by the delinquencies that have ticked up very gradually year-over-year. But I think having a yield at these levels is something that has sustained. But to your point of how can we drive it up, I think we're seeing an impact from rate changes that's been a bit of a tailwind on the yield side. But clearly, that comes with a funding cost that ultimately will probably leave margin much closer to flat. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks very much. Danielle Dietz : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich of Citi. Arren Cyganovich : Sorry I was on mute. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on that last point. You're talking about the benefits of some of these super prime spenders. And I guess one of the aspects that's, I guess, less challenging or less beneficial is that you're not really revolving or they don't tend to evolve nearly as much because that spend velocity is so high, and they pay down each month. As you think about that customer base growing over time, would that just have a natural kind of downward pressure on your Domestic Card yield? Andrew Young : Well, Arren, it depends a bit on the degree to which they're revolving versus just pure transacting. But if they're transacting, they're bringing quite a bit of interchange and relatively low outstandings over time. So, that very well could prove to be a net positive and not create the downward pressure that you just described. And not to mention the fact that in doing so, it creates less of a capital need. And so it ends up being over time at least a pretty capital-efficient business, which is one of the reasons why we've been on this decade-long journey to build that franchise. Arren Cyganovich : Okay, got it. And then just on the deposit side, you had a modest decline kind of seasonal, I'm assuming that had to do with taxes. You haven't really, to your benefit, I guess, not been a leader in terms of pricing on the online side. Are you seeing kind of quarter-to-date an increase in deposits or do you expect that to be a little bit slower growth as we see the rate hikes increase? Andrew Young : Well, I'm not going to comment specifically on what we see so far this quarter. But let's take a step back and think about the industry context and then talk a little bit about our strategy there. As you look at the industry, you brought up, at least in retail, the tax outflow phenomenon that happened in the second quarter, and we certainly felt a little bit of that. But where industry deposit balances go from here, first thing is at least history, whether it repeats itself, would indicate that the rate of deposit growth drops in rising rate environment. And in this particular cycle, the Fed fund rates, as I mentioned to Sanjay's question, are both larger and faster than previous ones, and the Fed shrinking its balance sheet. So who knows? I guess this is good as yours, but I think we could see a scenario where industry-wide deposits are flattish to down in the near-term. And so what we choose to do there is really trying to optimize our balance sheet across a number of different dynamics of liquidity and funding and tenor and pricing. And so we feel like we're in a great position to compete in that industry backdrop with simple straightforward competitive products that have a great user experience. But where our deposits ultimately go from here in the context of that industry will be a function of our deposit needs and competitive dynamics. Richard Fairbank : Arren, let me just add that this is -- I want to underscore the strategy that Capital One has had for years now, which is, we are building a national bank through, not by just acquiring branches on every corner across the United States, nor by just having a national digital bank, but really building a, in a sense, full-service digital bank that can provide almost everything that you can get in a local branch to provide it nationally -- excuse me, digitally. And that is part of our strategy to build primary banking relationships that are digital-first and digitally originated. And it's all part of a larger strategy to build a consumer banking franchise that is not about just the highest rate paid, but really about high-quality products, a great customer experience and a full-service set of capabilities where people can -- banking relationship and then also have savings deposits there. And one of the -- one of my comments that I made about our marketing levels, which, everybody notices, are high is, one thing we've continued to invest in over time is, Capital One as a company that doesn't have branches on every corner. We've got branches on some corners, but a greater proportion of our expenditures are on the marketing side, are on the brand building side and, to some extent, on the tech side as well. But it is very much in service of building a franchise of -- a brand and a franchise that enables us to dynamically grow our deposits at very appropriate blended pricing and build long-term loyal banking relationships. And we're very pleased with the success we've had in that, but we continue invest very much in that. Danielle Dietz : Next question, please. Operator : Moving on to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good evening. Richard Fairbank : Good evening, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Andrew, just wanted to double-click on the comments that you're making around the high transaction -- high transactors having lower capital intensity, and that's a function of them just being higher credit quality, shorter duration on the book? Is that basically what it's about, or is there something more there? Andrew Young : No. It's really just the loss content of that book, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Okay. And then when you were going through the deck on the capital slide, I think you mentioned 11% is your CET1 target. And so, given that there is such demand for spend and borrow right now, should we take your comments to mean that it's unlikely that you'll be doing buybacks in the near future while this high loan growth period is upon us? Andrew Young : Well, just to repeat a little bit, Betsy, of what I shared in my prepared remarks there's just a number of factors to consider, just our forecasted level of capital and earnings and growth, but we need to put those things in the context with a particular eye to the error bars around those estimates. And so what I was mostly trying to highlight is if you look back a year ago, we were at 14.5% CET1, that's down to 12 1 this quarter. And so we're getting much closer to that 11% level. And at a time when there are a number of uncertainties given the economic environment and the growth opportunities, those error bars just start to matter more. And so we slowed down a bit in the second quarter. But as always is the case, managing capital both conservatively and efficiently is top of mind for us. And so looking ahead, we're just going to dynamically adjust our pace in the context of those evolving factors. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Danielle Dietz : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Thanks so much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide us with a breakdown of your -- and remind us of your Domestic Card spending by retail category as a percent of total spend within Domestic Card, so grocery or T&E or gas, whatever you could provide would be excellent. I would just think that as you're targeting the higher spenders, it's probably had an effect on that mix over the last 10 years as that's changed. Any color you could provide would be great. Thanks. Danielle Dietz : Rich, you need to unmute, please. Richard Fairbank : Sorry. Sorry. Yes. Sorry. I have in front of me -- I don't think it's the exact thing you're asking, but I have in front of me some growth rates, in fact, finishing growth since -- versus 2019 of a bunch of categories that I find pretty fascinating, but this is not -- this isn't our own mix, but these things in fact mix things, I guess, but gas 90%. Now by the way, this is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this includes growth by Capital One overall. There's been significant growth of our whole business. So -- but just some relative comparisons. Travel, 26%, although travel is second to gas, if I look at year-over-year gross, only gas as a category has grown more. So gas is up 54% year-over-year. The travel is up 42% year-over-year, and those are swamping most of the other categories there. But travel was way the laggard during the downturn, and it's been -- like I said, other than \u00e2\u0080\u0093 than energy, it has been the one that is really catching up quickly. So what's striking is just how much these things vary across categories as the consumer reacts to the COVID or energy costs. And also, it'll be interesting to see how much the consumer migrates to whether -- to -- between discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. We'll keep a close eye on that one as things get a little tighter in the marketplace. Dominick Gabriele : Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up. Given \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just to take some of the conversation one step further around deposits and funding, given the amount of card growth that you're seeing and building out this franchise, but the slowing deposit growth, is it reasonable to assume that as a management team, you would really look to focus on growing this business first, regardless of perhaps the funding cost, trade-off between deposits and non-deposit funding because really, you're just gaining more customers within your card franchise and you would make that trade? Thanks so much. Richard Fairbank : Yes. So first, pulling up, it's not lost on us that our assets are growing rapidly. Right now, all banks are growing more slowly in deposits. So, we -- I think that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean this is a natural thing that happens at this part of the cycle. And so, this is why I made my earlier comments about being very pleased that we have already been leaning into having a deposit franchise and being in a position to build primary banking relationships, to grow savings accounts, to have a brand as a company that will have attractive savings rates, but not to have to go generate all our business off of the bank rate tables kind of marketplace.  So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but with respect to the economics, Dominick, I think the card margins are such that -- it's hard to imagine that we wouldn't continue to make the trade that even if we have to pay more for deposits, we would not turn down the growth opportunity. So long as the deposits are available and they're there, it's going to be a good trade to continue growing that card business as far out as we can see because of the particularly robust economics that come with our card franchise.  But just to finish off that point. I'm sorry. But we also like being in a position as a national bank with a national brand for digital banking that we're in a position to gather the deposits we need in order to fund the kind of growth opportunity that we have at a time when it's going to get harder to grow deposits at this part of the cycle. Danielle Dietz : Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on this conference call today, and thank you for your interest in Capital One. The Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer your questions, if you have any, and have a great evening. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, everybody. Good night.

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 3 of tonight\u2019s presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $1.7 billion or $4.20 per diluted common share. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans grew 3% and average loans grew 5%, largely driven by growth across our Domestic Card and Commercial businesses. In the linked quarter, revenue increased 7%, largely driven by growth in net interest income. The loan growth I just described and NIM expansion, both contributed to the increase in net interest income. I will touch on the NIM more in a moment. Non-interest expense grew 8% in the quarter, driven by an increase in operating expenses. Higher headcount and the associated compensation costs were the single biggest driver of the linked quarter increase. In addition to compensation expenses, the collective impact of a number of smaller items also drove up Q3 expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $1.7 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $931 million and a $734 million allowance build. Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The total company\u2019s $734 million allowance build in the quarter brings our allowance balance up to $12.2 billion as of September 30. Our total company coverage ratio increased 14 basis points to 4.02%. Turning to Slide 5. I\u2019ll discuss the allowance and coverage across each of our business segments. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio increased modestly in each of our segments. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased $530 million, bringing our coverage ratio to 6.9%. The $6 billion of loan growth in the quarter drove the majority of the allowance build. The impact of continued normalization and a modestly worse corporate economic outlook were partially offset by the release of a portion of our qualitative factors linked to uncertainty in the economy. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $61 million, driving a 9 basis point increase in coverage to 2.6%. The modestly worse corporate economic outlook I just mentioned and expectations of credit normalization drove the allowance builds. And finally, the allowance increased by $107 million in our Commercial business resulting in a 9 basis point increase in coverage to 1.45%. A combination of the modestly worsening corporate economic outlook, an uptick in criticized loans and loan growth drove the allowance build. Turning to Page 6, I\u2019ll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 139%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves were roughly flat at about $93 billion as our liquidity reserves have largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Our securities portfolio declined by about $8 billion, driven by a combination of the decline in market value from rising rates and the continued planned runoff of the outsized portfolio we built during the pandemic. The decrease in our securities portfolio was primarily offset by higher cash and cash equivalents. Turning to Page 7. I\u2019ll cover our net interest margin. Net interest income in the quarter was $7 billion, up 14% from the year ago quarter and up 7% from last quarter. Our net interest margin was 6.8% in the third quarter, 45 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 26 basis points higher than last quarter. The 26 basis points linked quarter increase in NIM was driven roughly equally by three factors : first, an extra day to recognize income in the quarter; second, a continued balance sheet shift towards card away from lower-yielding assets; and third, the net benefit of the higher yield of assets relative to higher funding costs. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our preliminary common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.2% at the end of the third quarter, up about 10 basis points relative to last quarter. The $1.7 billion of net income in the quarter was mostly offset by growth in risk-weighted assets, dividends and a little over $300 million in share repurchases. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 10 with third quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the third quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 16% year-over-year and up 47% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Ending loan balances increased $22 billion or about 22% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 5% from the sequential quarter, and revenue was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin. Strong credit results continued in the quarter. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate are well below pre-pandemic levels and continue to normalize. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.2%, up 84 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.97%, 104 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was down 6 basis points. The delinquency rate was up 62 basis points from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was up 28% from the third quarter of 2021, including an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $978 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We\u2019re seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in purchase volume, new accounts and loans across our Domestic Card business. And strong momentum in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders continued in the third quarter. Heavy spender marketing includes early spend bonuses driven by continued strong account growth and spending as well as investments in franchise enhancements like our travel portal and airport lounges. In the third quarter, our marketing continued to drive strong growth in heavy spender accounts and strong engagement and spend behaviors with both new and existing customers. Our decade-long quest to build our heavy spender franchise has brought with it significantly increased levels of marketing. But the sustained revenue, credit, resilience, and capital benefits of this enduring franchise are compelling, and they\u2019re growing. Slide 12 shows third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the third quarter, we continued to pull back on growth in auto in response to competitive pricing dynamics. Many auto lenders appear to have reflected rising interest rates in their marginal pricing decisions, but others have not, and they have gained market share and pressured industry margins. We chose to pull back on auto originations, which declined 28% year-over-year and 20% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in originations, Consumer Banking loan growth is slower than previous quarters. Third quarter ending loans grew 5% to the year ago quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were essentially flat. Third quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking deposits were flat compared to the sequential quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was up 7% year-over-year as growth in auto loans was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in auto margins and the effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees. Non-interest expense was up 13% compared to the third quarter of 2021, driven by continuing investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and the increased marketing for our digital national bank. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the third quarter. The charge-off rate for the third quarter was 1.05%, up 87 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.85%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 44 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 38 basis points. Slide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 2% from the sequential quarter, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were up 7% in the quarter. Ending deposits were up 6% from the second quarter. Average deposits were down 2% in the quarter. Third quarter revenue was up 12% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was also up 12%. Commercial Banking credit remained strong in the third quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 5 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.97%, and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.57%. In closing, we continued to drive strong growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the third quarter. Loan growth in our Consumer Banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we pulled back on auto originations, and our Commercial Banking business posted another growth \u2013 another quarter of strong revenue growth. Credit results remain strong across our businesses. Charge-off rates and delinquency rates are below pre-pandemic levels and credit continues to normalize. We typically see an increase in operating expense over the second half of the year \u2013 of any year. This year, the timing of some of our investment opportunities drove a larger than usual third quarter increase in operating expense, which was up 11% from the second quarter. We expect that this year\u2019s linked quarter increase in fourth quarter operating expense will be smaller than the approximately 7% linked quarter increase we\u2019ve seen on average over the last five years. Turning to operating efficiency ratio. Relative to full year 2021, we expect annual operating efficiency ratio to be roughly flat in 2022 and modestly down in 2023. As usual, our operating expense and efficiency expectations exclude any potential adjusting items. Pulling way up, we\u2019re in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value as modern digital technology continues to transform banking. We continue to see opportunities to lean into marketing and resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities. Our growth opportunities are enhanced by our digital transformation. We continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. Powered by our modern digital technology, we\u2019re continuously improving our proprietary underwriting, marketing and product capabilities. And we\u2019re managing capital prudently to put ourselves in a position to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now, we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. Remember, as a courtesy to other investors and analysts, you may wish to ask a question. Please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have additional follow-up questions, after the Q&A session, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Liz, please start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Kevin Barker : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate the comments around credit and how we\u2019re still in a normalization, back to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in some key asset classes. But at what point do you say that the year-over-year growth rate and delinquency rates is too fast relative to what you would expect for a typical normalization? Richard Fairbank : Yes, Kevin, so thank you for your question. Let me just pull up and just comment on normalization. First of all, the context of where we are because consumer credit remain strong, as you can see from the metrics. And our Domestic Card losses in the third quarter were about half of pre-pandemic levels. And our delinquencies are \u2013 and we\u2019ve often said this, unmistakably normalizing. But right now, they remain about 20% below pre-pandemic level. There is not a certain point where we \u2013 we don\u2019t look out there and say if the rate of growth of delinquencies exceeds a certain number, then we will pull back. But let me comment, first of all, that we\u2019ve said for a long time, Kevin, and I know you know this that normalization is bound to happen. It would be shocking if it didn\u2019t happen. And we\u2019ve been talking for a bunch of quarters now saying it started you needed a magnifying glass to see it and we talked about that. And now, of course, you can see it in the numbers, and it\u2019s definitely normalizing. What \u2013 the rate at which it\u2019s normalizing is, frankly, more gradual than we generally expected, but we didn\u2019t really have a road map to know exactly what pace it would normalize, we just believe so strongly that it would. So what we do with \u2013 rather than say there\u2019s a certain number that would lead us to make a certain decision, we, of course, look at this with what\u2019s happening with every segment and micro segment of our business and how it\u2019s performing. We look for starters at the back book, and that is normalizing as \u2013 well, frankly, like everything here, more gradually than expected, but still the back book is clearly normalizing as well. We then look for other patterns of normalization. And here are some of the patterns that we see, Kevin. It\u2019s more pronounced in the front book of new originations than in the existing back book. And by the way, it would be \u2013 that would be shocking if it weren\u2019t the case because 100% of the time in our history, front books normalize faster during periods of change. And we \u2013 so that \u2013 but we confirm again that front books are normalizing faster. It also seems that normalization is more pronounced at the lower end of the market. And of course, those are the populations that improve more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic. Lower income consumers may also be feeling more pressure from inflation. So these trends shouldn\u2019t be surprising. But at the \u2013 at kind of a high level, what we see is very normal and is \u2013 and basically, the way we\u2019re leaning into the marketplace is very consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying for a bunch of quarters now. But what we do at the micro level, at the segment level and the sub-segment level is look at the various metrics, both on the back book and on the front book to see what the patterns are, and we\u2019re comfortable with what we see in terms of front book vintage curves as a general point and across a vast majority of all the segments that we operate in. We have \u2013 around the edges, we\u2019ve done a little bit of dialing back in particular pockets where metrics are normalizing a little bit faster. We also sort of pull up and say, what are the kinds of \u2013 what are the risks that we would expect to see at a time like this with orthogonal looks through our book. And we brainstorm on what all the risk we could see, we go hunt for them. And in a couple of places, we have seen effects that caused a little bit of trimming around the edges, but the collective amount of trimming in the card business is pretty small relative to the overall scale of our growth. As you know, the \u2013 in the auto business, we have pulled back. At the very same time, we\u2019re leaning into the card business, we\u2019re pulling back in the auto business, but maybe I\u2019ll save that for another question. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then just a follow-up. I mean, is there anything \u2013 I appreciate all \u2013 the look at the granular side of the business and what you see within your book on a very micro level. But from a macro level, is there anything that you\u2019d look at that would make you pulled back that may not be apparent at the micro level? In particular, I think you made some prepared remarks about changes in the corporate outlook in particular. Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Sorry, the changes in the corporate \u2013 can you repeat that last part, changes in corporate outlook. Kevin Barker : I believe in your prepared remarks, you said there were changes in the corporate outlook that may have affected part of your allowance. Was there anything in particular that stood out that may cause you to pull back when you think about the macroeconomic outlook? Richard Fairbank : Well, the \u2013 we, of course, at the whole time, we\u2019re doing the micro examination of one segment at a time. We are looking at the macro trends. It\u2019s really striking the level of inflation. And as I\u2019ve often said, we collectively, everybody on this call, none of us \u2013 and \u2013 nobody across the business world has really lived something like this since the early \u201880s. So we\u2019re especially looking for effects that might be different this time, Kevin, with respect to inflation and the \u2013 how that can play out. But \u2013 so we\u2019re always on the lookout, but the net impression, I would want to leave here is very much the same impression that I\u2019ve left with you the last many quarters here. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Ryan Nash : Hey, good evening everyone. Richard Fairbank : Hey, Ryan. Ryan Nash : So maybe just to start on the cost and efficiency side, Rich. So it\u2019s good to hear that you\u2019ll be back on the efficiency improvement journey next year. So I guess, just a two-part question. You talked about OpEx ramping less in the fourth quarter. But just given the level of marketing spend and how the spend has shifted under the hood in terms of moving up market, should we expect to see less than historical seasonality on the marketing side? And then second, just \u2013 can you help us with the magnitude of the efficiency improvement into next year? And what is actually driving the improvement? Is it pulling back on hiring or something else? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re here to declare a \u2013 I want to make a comment about marketing seasonality. It\u2019s not as \u2013 that\u2019s not as much of a physics kind of thing as certain things like credit and delinquency seasonality with consumers. I think \u2013 so I\u2019m not here to declare changes in the pattern of seasonality and marketing. The big driver of our marketing is the opportunities that we see as well as the investment in building businesses like our heavy spender business and our national bank. With respect to the drivers of operating efficiency improvement, just kind of pulling up on the journey that you mentioned. We\u2019ve been focused about this and talking with investors about operating efficiency for years. And we\u2019ve achieved a 440 basis point improvement from 2013 through 2021 even as we have invested in a comprehensive transformation of our technology over that same period of time. And we know that investing in technology modernization and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path. Technology investment helps our revenue growth and helps drive productivity improvements. And beneath the surface of the high level of investment has been significant productivity gains from modernizing our tech stack, eliminating legacy vendor costs, driving customers to digital and driving more automation in the company. And at the same time, of course, we have continued to lean into this technology journey and the opportunities that it generates. And the \u2013 so it\u2019s a very shared path. And I think that our guidance for modest improvement in 2023 is a reflection of continued traction in growth and operating productivity while also continuing to invest in future opportunities. Ryan Nash : Got it. I guess, as a follow-up question, maybe one for Andrew. Andrew, you laid out the details of some of the drivers as it pertains to the net interest margin. I fully understand that there\u2019s a seasonal component to it in 3Q. But can you maybe just talk about the positioning of the balance sheet from a rate perspective? Do you think that you can continue to see the margin drift higher? And maybe just talk about of the drivers as you look out over the course of the next couple of quarters during the rising rate cycle? Thanks. Andrew Young : Sure, Ryan. Recall, it\u2019s probably helpful to start with a little bit of history here. And you\u2019ll recall, our NIM was compressed during the pandemic, largely driven by a balance sheet that was skewed much more towards cash and securities than card loans. And as we progressed over the course of the pandemic, you saw that begin to normalize. And so just by way of evidence, a year ago, our NIM was, I think, 6.35%. I had said in my prepared remarks. And at that point, card was closer to 27%. I think of our interest-earning assets and cash and securities was something like 33%. Cards now shifted to be just over 30% and cash and securities are down to 27%. So I share that to say we\u2019re now operating much closer to our pre-pandemic balance sheet mix. And our NIM is roughly in a similar spot to where it was before the pandemic. So to your question then about rate risk, you can see in our Q, our rate risk disclosures, we\u2019re really only slightly asset sensitive at this point. And keep in mind that\u2019s relative to forwards. So the 150 basis point projected moves over the next couple of months are already sort of embedded in that neutral baseline. And so as I think about the future, there\u2019s a number of things that can impact NIM, not to mention seasonality, but the credit impacts on revenue, competitive pressure on loan margins and deposit pricing. But as we sit here today, I think a lot of the things that we pointed to in the past in terms of balance sheet mix at least have largely run their course. So hopefully, this gives you some sense of the primary forces that play with NIM. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good evening. Richard Fairbank : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Just to follow-up on that for the follow-up question. So now that you\u2019re back to the pre-pandemic mix of liquidity and loans, how should we think about where the balance sheet projects from here in terms of funding mix and funding stack? And maybe you could speak a little bit to your thoughts on the buyback because I noticed this quarter, it was down a bit, $313 million, down a bit from the prior two quarters, which averaged about $2 billion. So if you could help us understand how you\u2019re going to be funding the loan growth and what kind of mix we should be expecting? Should liquidity go down even more than what it was pre-pandemic? Thanks. Andrew Young : Okay. I\u2019ll take, I think, what I heard is the first two questions there, Betsy, in NIM and funding, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Rich to talk about buyback. So on the NIM side and the asset portion of that, I just want to clarify what will drive it from here. I do think if you look back historically, cash and securities were roughly 25% of our balance sheet. We\u2019re a little bit above that. But given our needs for liquidity and how we use the investment portfolio, I would think that something in that 25% range of the size of the balance sheet is a reasonable assumption for that. Then on the loan side, it really becomes a matter of just marketplace dynamics, what we see as opportunities for growth. And so whether card is growing more quickly than, say, auto or commercial, its percentage of the rest of the balance sheet could drift up. But I don\u2019t want to give any indication of how we think that\u2019s playing out, and there\u2019s certainly not a target that we have in terms of the asset side of the balance sheet. On the funding side, we aim to have a diversified mix of funding that\u2019s largely skewed to retail deposits, which, again, historically has been something, I think, around 70% of our overall funding, and we have commercial deposits and brokered CDs and then securitization and wholesale funding \u2013 other sources of wholesale funding. And so again, I would say if you look back to pre-pandemic levels over history compared to where we are today, we\u2019re kind of back in a relatively similar place there. So I think I heard in your question, not just mix, but how do we fund growth from here in making marginal decisions for funding incremental loan growth. We\u2019re going to weigh a variety of factors, our customers\u2019 appetite for different deposit products and our ability to build customer relationships with them, the economics of different funding instruments, the duration of funding or liquidity needs. So we\u2019re going to throw all of that into our decision-making process to figure out how to fund. But I also think it\u2019s important to think about those funding choices at the margin. It\u2019s not just about the liability side. We also have asset growth choices at the margin, too. So we\u2019re just going to look at the total integrated economics of both sides of the balance sheet to make those choices. And I\u2019ll hand it over to Rich to talk about buybacks. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew. Betsy, we \u2013 so with the question with respect to why did you slow down your share repurchase pace this quarter. So we repurchased roughly $300 million of shares during the third quarter. About 1.5 years ago, we had a CET1 in the high 14s. Since then, we\u2019ve been repurchasing shares and our CET1 ratio has come down into the low 12s. And the pace of our repurchases is, of course, driven by a number of factors, including our actual and forecasted capital earnings, of course, growth, economic conditions, market dynamics. And at this point, there remains some pretty sizable error bars around some of these factors, particularly growth and economic uncertainty. And so it\u2019s not lost on us at times like this. It\u2019s prudent risk management to be conservative with our capital actions. And this is a very dynamic process. And under the new SCB rules, we\u2019re able to maintain flexibility in our capital decisions. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Rich, you mentioned you\u2019re keeping an eye on your competitors. I\u2019m just wondering if you could just drill down a little bit on that given you\u2019ve had a lot of fintechs in the space growing. And obviously, it\u2019s a very unpredictable next 12 months to 18 months. So maybe you could just talk about domestic card and auto as well because you mentioned a number of different variables there? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Well, Sanjay, did you want me to talk about competition in those spaces? Or is it a competition-driven question? Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess, competition, but also how it might have an impact on credit as we look forward because you\u2019ve had some new players underwriting as well. Richard Fairbank : Right. So, let\u2019s talk about competition in the card business, and then I\u2019ll talk about it in the auto business. But generally, in the card business, competition continues to be high, but largely stable and rational over the past few quarters. Now here, I\u2019m really talking about the major \u2013 the banking industry, the classic competitive set within the card business. But we certainly have seen marketing levels that have returned to really beyond pre-pandemic levels. So, we certainly have an eye on that. On the rewards competition side, there\u2019s \u2013 here or there, there are new things that people come out with, but there\u2019s generally a stability in that space on APRs in the card business have generally \u2013 the issuers have generally adjusted headline rates along with the change in the prime rate. So there\u2019s a kind of a stability in the margins there. And so again, we see a pretty stable competitive environment in the major \u2013 among major card players. A thing that we\u2019ve mentioned a number of times is concerned about the fintechs and their impact on a business like the card business, less so by the fintechs actually running around issuing credit cards, but more by the impact from other credit products like installment loans, buy-now-pay-later loans and others that can affect the portfolio of borrowing that our customers, current and prospective customers might have. So, we were pretty concerned and we\u2019ve talked about it a number of times about the rapidly growing extent of fintech credit extension compounded by the fact no one could measure the size of it, because many of these folks like many of the buy-now-pay-later players, for example, not reporting to the credit bureaus. The other thing that caught our eye, of course, all along the way here is, virtually every fintech that enters lending, enters in the lower side of the market. There\u2019s virtually no one that enters right at the heaviest vendor side of the market. They just don\u2019t have the scale for those thin-margin businesses. And so the fintech accesses to the extent that they\u2019re there were logically and inferentially from what we see would be more in the lower end of the market, and that, of course, is something we watch pretty carefully to the best extent that we can see it. Now the one thing that, that just intuitively is a helpful thing to the cause here is that fintechs have generally struggled. They seem to have dialed back quite a bit. So there may be less pressure in that particular space. But another thing to keep our eye out for here is it\u2019s not just the amount of volume of marketing or the intensity of competition is the underwriting choices that folks make. Another thing that, Sanjay, that we have had our eye on is basically FICO drift. And you can absolutely see out there the reduction in the size of the subprime population. Now we can all ask ourselves is that really just great news that the size of subprime America has declined or how much is that a shorter-term impact from all the stimulus, the forbearance, the spending pullbacks and things that happened during the pandemic. So, we ourselves do our best to try to normalize for those effects in our underwriting. And so where I would [Audio Gap] to say, I think the competitive risks that exist and that we have seen out there are more in the lower end of the marketplace even with credit cards themselves. If you look at the data, there has been the highest \u2013 there\u2019s been more growth in the lower end of the market in terms of just credit card customers than anywhere else. So all of this is something we\u2019re watching incredibly carefully. And to the earlier question that was asked about how do we do underwriting, we, of course, do everything we can to look at every segment and the \u2013 to look for any changes that we\u2019re seeing ultimately in our own performance. We\u2019ve trimmed around the edges in a few places. But overall, so far, it looks pretty good, but partly how we do this. We don\u2019t just run around and just let the numbers do the talking. We do a combination of using actually machine learning monitoring-based methodologies to look for early signs of things being off of expectation within our portfolio. And then at the same time, broad strategic logic on what would you expect to happen from this competitive environment, from this credit environment, from this inflationary environment. So that\u2019s a window into that side of the business. On the auto side of the business, the competition, I don\u2019t \u2013 our issue with the competition is really not an underwriting issue at this point. The general risks that we talked about just a couple of minutes ago exist in that space as well on the credit side. But the elephant in the room is the \u2013 really the pricing of auto loans at this point by a number of players. And while that is not directly a credit concern, it lowers the margin in the business, it lowers the buffer of resilience and so on, and we manage very carefully to trying to keep a maximum amount of resilience in downturns and lower margins lead us to pull back on the least resilient parts of the business. Sanjay Sakhrani : Great. Thanks very much. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks. Rich, you had an earlier question about kind of the change in delinquency rates. And I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m wondering whether if you think that this cycle, there will be a different \u2013 any sort of different relationship in your two major businesses in card and auto between the loss rate and delinquency rate better or worse as we go through the next 18 months or so of credit normalization? Richard Fairbank : Well, Moshe, as usual, that\u2019s a very insightful question. Let me just comment a little bit on \u2013 just a little bit of a calibration of how we think about credit in the card and auto businesses. The first point would be, it\u2019s normalizing in both places. But overall, credit has been strong in both our card and our auto business. But there are three effects that are driving faster normalization of auto losses, then of card losses. And the first is that normalization tends to be more pronounced in the front book of new originations. That\u2019s a universal thing that applies across our consumer businesses. But because the front book \u2013 in auto, the front book replaces the portfolio much more quickly. Then in card, overall portfolio losses should normalize more quickly in the auto business. The second is that recovery rates are much higher in auto than in card. Now recoveries tend to be lagged relative to charge-offs. But \u2013 so some of the exceptionally strong performance we saw in auto, including the quarter where we actually had negative charge-offs, that was boosted by higher recoveries from earlier charge-offs. Now that we\u2019ve seen low charge-offs for an extended period in auto, the raw material for future recoveries is coming down, even if the recovery rate stays strong, and this will have a bigger impact in auto than in card. But it will be an effect in both businesses, and it\u2019s not something that I think gets a lot of airtime out there, but recoveries are definitionally about what\u2019s happening with , if you will, the back book of recoveries. And in both of our businesses, the back book, which has been the byproduct of the great news over the last few years in terms of credit to back book, there\u2019s just less to work with, but it\u2019s especially an effect in auto. And finally, auto vehicle values are now normalizing, which is a headwind relative to a year ago and contributes to the pace of credit normalization in that business. And given where used car prices have been going to sort of record levels over the past year, the general direction of that is much more likely to be down rather than up so that also contributes to a difference between those two businesses. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. And as a follow-up, it\u2019s good to see the guidance or some form of expectation of an improving efficiency ratio. But as I look at it, it seems like your balance sheet is still asset sensitive. And so to the extent that revenue growth is impacted and positively impacted by margin expansion, I mean, wouldn\u2019t one really naturally expect to see that efficiency ratio improve because that doesn\u2019t really come with a lot of attendant costs? So, I\u2019m just wondering how to think about that? And what\u2019s the right way to think about the spend \u2013 kind of like-for-like spending versus revenue growth? Andrew Young : Moshe, let me take the first part of that, and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Rich in terms of asset sensitivity. You can see last quarter\u2019s Q, and I would expect it will be a fairly similar number this quarter, an up 100 basis point shock. Last quarter was 70 basis point impact to 12-month NII, which is something like a couple of $100 million of NII. And again, that\u2019s a shock relative to forwards. So, I just want to clarify that when you talk about us being asset sensitive, we\u2019ve already baked into our baseline the anticipated, call it, 150 basis points of additional Fed moves over the next couple of quarters. So achieving what I just described suggests the shock beyond that. But I think you should walk around with at this point, we are pretty neutral from an asset sensitivity. So, I just wanted to clarify that before Rich provides the broader answer. Richard Fairbank : Yes, Moshe, the \u2013 I\u2019ve often said \u2013 and you and I have gosh, we\u2019ve been working together for two or three decades now, Moshe. And I\u2019ve often said that \u2013 I know we do a calculation that says this is on the things that we can measure. This is the impact of, let\u2019s say, a rise in rates. I\u2019ve often said, it can look good on paper to have a rise in rates, but I for three decades have been rooting against rises in rates because of the sort of unquantifiable other aspects on the business. Now of course, no one out here is rooting for the kind of inflation that we\u2019re seeing and the kind of risk there. But I just want to flag that while the math talks about certain benefits that come just a couple kind of obvious, but I think important things that affect many of our metrics in the business. One is the conversation that we just had about the auto business. I think it\u2019s \u2013 most businesses in the world, most industries struggle when the cost of goods sold goes up, struggle to get that to make its way into pricing. And the auto business is a classic example of this. And particularly since, unlike if you\u2019re selling groceries at the store, it\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s the cost of goods sold, and therefore, how you might want to price those groceries in this business with the complexity that comes from how any particular auto lender calculates their funds, transfer pricing and really effectively what is their margin that can put pressures in the business. And what we\u2019re seeing in auto, the compression in margins, the growth opportunity that we\u2019re losing right now, that can sort of swamp the math of Andrew\u2019s interest rate calculations. And then, of course, I think the biggest issue is the impact of rising rates on the economy and on potentially credit outcomes. And back to our friend the operating efficiency ratio, credit impacts make their way into the operating efficiency ratio, of course, through \u2013 well, through the growth \u2013 through how much growth we can get and also things like the fee and finance charge reserve impacts that come. So I\u2019m not \u2013 yes, so that\u2019s why I think, in many ways, the kind of progress that we continue to hope to achieve over the years an operating efficiency ratio might be more in spite of rather than because of higher rates. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Your line is now open. Arren Cyganovich : Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the card acquisitions that you\u2019re having today and you\u2019re a full spectrum lender, but your, I guess \u2013 I would characterize, I guess, newer in the heavy spend section and with your Venture X card. Are you acquiring more of that segment? And then also have you been pulling back at all in maybe revolver nonprime segment recently? Richard Fairbank : Yes. So the \u2013 we have talked a lot about the traction that we\u2019re getting at the top of the market in the pursuit of heavy spenders. And I wouldn\u2019t call us relatively new player in that business. We\u2019re one of the actually pretty significant players in the space, but certainly not the biggest, not even close. But I think that \u2013 the bigger point there is that we continue to see more traction there. And whenever we \u2013 you see metrics about growth in purchase volume, we don\u2019t share metrics about what kind of growth rate we\u2019re getting at each spender level in the marketplace. But the higher the spender level, the higher \u2013 the even faster growth rate we\u2019ve been getting. So that\u2019s a manifestation of the success we\u2019re getting. And it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s both the byproduct of the investment we\u2019re making, but also leads us to continue to lean in to those investments. But for all you hear of our enthusiastic comments about the top of the market, I don\u2019t want to leave an impression that we are therefore less enthusiastic about the opportunity elsewhere. We continue to grow across the credit spectrum. We have several decades of experience in the lower end of the market and one of the real benefits of our tech transformation has been allowing us to build a lot more sophistication, more data, more machine learning and other things into the credit underwriting process. And that allows us to be stronger and have more growth opportunities and better credit quality in the \u2013 at the lower end of the market. So the story, the net impression I want to leave with you is one of very continued success across the spectrum. There are places, however, that we for a long period of time have been cautious about and frankly doing our best to minimize. And one of those is high balance revolvers. So high balance revolvers, which just what the term we \u2013 that term to us just to clarify that concept is not necessarily what are the balances that any revolver, any customer might have with us, but it\u2019s collectively their total bureau balances. And we have been very cautious about booking customers for years now. And even more so after the great recession, booking customers with a high level of balance \u2013 revolver balances across their \u2013 that consumer\u2019s portfolio. It tends to be a \u2013 to not go there ties one hand behind her back a little bit in terms of growth because growing high balance revolvers is a great \u2013 a good way to grow. And it\u2019s also tends to be quite profitable business. But that is a segment that we have been concerned about the resilience and downturns. And so we\u2019ve tended to for years now try to deemphasize that. I say deemphasize, that no one can fully get out of a segment like that, because the \u2013 we can\u2019t control whether our own customers turn into high balance revolvers, but what we can control is whether they enter as high balance revolvers. So that\u2019s a little window into maybe where we go a little more lightly. Arren Cyganovich : Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Don Fandetti : Hey, Rich. Can you talk a little bit on the move to the public cloud? It\u2019s been a bit since we\u2019ve heard a lot on that. Are you still feeling like it\u2019s improving your new product development rollout? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Well, Don, we feel great about our move to the public cloud. It\u2019s a central part of our technology transformation. Probably the most salient part of it, but certainly not the only part. But this transformation has involved \u2013 a transformation in terms of the tech talent within the company, bringing lots of thousands of engineers in-house, bringing more of the tech investment inside the company as opposed to reliance on vendors, so many of them industrywide who are old school legacy vendors and quite expensive. Is that \u2013 at that it\u2019s involving \u2013 involved transforming how we build software. It\u2019s involved going to the cloud, it\u2019s involved transforming our data ecosystem. It\u2019s involved modernizing all of the applications on which the company is built. So there\u2019s been a lot to this journey and we\u2019re a decade into it. The benefits are all around us and it really starts in many ways with benefits in the tech business itself, where our technology teams are moving faster, getting products to market sooner. And our software engineers are just way more modern tech stack to work with and automated software delivery methods and can also to your cloud point benefit by the tremendous, not just, well, the tremendous and continuing innovations that are happening on the cloud. Our customer experiences to continue to get more and more just better and better. And some of the \u2013 we notice it in net promoter scores and occasional awards that Capital One wins. The new products we\u2019ve been able to innovate things like Capital One Shopping, virtual cards, dealer navigator, instant issuance. Many things have been very benefited there. I mentioned earlier the ability to get some transformational improvements on underwriting, fraud management, and a lot of things behind the scenes that leverage the power of big data and machine learning in real time. That has been very beneficial. Our transformation also is changing how we work inside Capital One, our new marketing platforms. Part of the reason that we\u2019re investing more these days in marketing is really the power of mass customized machine learning driven marketing. So that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been a good thing. And it\u2019s also, as I mentioned earlier had a bunch of benefits in terms of enhancing productivity of the business. And the final thing I would say there Don, is that the tech transformation is really helping us get more of the thing we needed to start with to make it happen and that was talent. The biggest elephant in the room for corporate America who sit on legacy tech stacks is you need lots and lots of very modern, best-in-class tech talent in order to drive that transformation in a world where the scarcest, the tightest and most competitive labor market I\u2019ve seen in the history of building Capital One is the competition for really modern tech talent. The transformation requires so much of that talent. And one of our rewards is now as we get on the other side of the canyon and really have a tech stack build like the very modern tech companies, the ability to attract talent is accelerating. And that\u2019s part of a virtuous cycle. That is why we did it, is why we went on this journey, and it\u2019s something that we see to this very day, and it\u2019s also why we continue to invest more in the opportunities that we see. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Rick Shane : Hey guys, it\u2019s Rick Shane. I think guys got called on. Andrew, quick question for you. When we look at the reserve rate on the domestic card portfolio, it ticked up slightly most of the build was a function of portfolio growth. Context is year-over-year, the single biggest increase in delinquencies that we\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m curious, when you think about the factor setting the allowance going forward, have you incorporated the trajectory of how fast delinquencies are increasing or is it a function of where delinquencies are now and in economic outlook? And can you capture that sort of rate of change? Andrew Young : Sure, Rick. Well, let me just start by talking about the inputs to the allowance. I just think it\u2019s important to sort of ground on the mechanics, the entirety of the mechanics, not just the piece that you called out. So, the first factor of course is just the size of the balance sheet. The second is really aligned to what you were just talking about, but it\u2019s kind of a combination of factors, and that is really our outlook for future losses, net of recoveries against that balance sheet. So that starts from a place of looking at what is in the delinquency buckets today, which gives us a really good view of how the next, say six months or so of losses are going to play out. And then after that period, we have an assumption of continued normalization from those unusually strong levels. And then beyond that horizon, as I think, under CECL, there\u2019s just an assumption of a gradual revision to historical averages. And then the third point is we apply qualitative factors against all of those expectations to account for uncertainties around economic downsides and inflation related risks. And so when we think about the allowance going forward, yes, I mean, today\u2019s allowance of course does incorporate in what is in the delinquency bucket today and what that implies. But as we go forward, the allowance is really going to primarily be determined by just the growth in the balance sheet. And we saw that impact the allowance this quarter. But then secondly, every quarter we continue to normalize, we are going to be replacing lower loss content of the current quarter with higher loss content of future quarters, which again, will be informed by how the delinquencies are playing through each successive quarter. So there\u2019s a number of other modest considerations, but that\u2019s really the two big forces at play. And hopefully that gets to kind of the nature of your question. Rick Shane : It does. And I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand is that if we follow the path that you expect in terms of normalization and what\u2019s embedded in the reserves today and economic outlook doesn\u2019t change. Again, I realize that\u2019s something you can\u2019t control. If you follow the expected path will, does that mean the allowance stay static or do you follow along that path? I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m really trying to get to. Andrew Young : Well, you\u2019re going to follow along that path because then when we get to a quarter from now, we\u2019re going to apply all of those same factors to the allowance at a quarter from now. And the change in the allowance is just going to be the quantum of allowance we have today compared to the quantum of allowance that we would have doing those exact same things a quarter from now. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. Following up on that last question. What level of unemployment would you say is implicit in your allowance and marrying some of the micro with the macro from the earlier discussion? How does Capital One view the risk that some of the credit normalization trends that you\u2019re seeing currently will ultimately be accompanied by some degree of degradation to the extent that the Fed proceeds through the hiking cycle? Andrew Young : Why don\u2019t I take the first one, and I must admit, I\u2019m not quite sure I followed the second. So I\u2019ll see if Rich followed that. Otherwise we\u2019ll come back to you for clarification. But in terms of unemployment, I\u2019m not going to provide specific metrics or economic assumptions. I will say though, Bill, we are generally consumers of like industry forecast as opposed to developing our own. So I think you could look at general consensus expectations for all of the key economic variables and assume that kind of roughly approximates what underlies our economic views on those variables. And I\u2019m looking at Rich to see if he followed the second part of your question. Richard Fairbank : Bill, I think, your question was, I\u2019m going to put it in different words just to see if I\u2019m saying the same thing. Bill Carcache : Okay. Richard Fairbank : We\u2019ve got normalization going on right now with an economy that\u2019s in some ways, certainly employment wise and some metrics not in a terrible place. And you have normalization \u2013 when normalization meets potentially significant economic worsening coming out of the or maybe catalyzed by the Fed going through their tightening right now. How do we feel about that? Was that your question? Bill Carcache : Yes. Richard Fairbank : I\u2019m going to start doing earnings calls by just asking the questions and then answering them. So \u2013 but look, that is a great question and I think none of us should just be mathematical about normalization. Now, I\u2019ve talked about how the root word in normalization is normal because what is abnormal is that credit ever got to this once in a lifetime place it did during the pandemic. So as I\u2019ve said in the \u2013 in absolutely normal times, this thing should normalize. So the way \u2013 so we look at that and say, and expect that should continue. And then we look at the economy and the way that we would always look at that is we\u2019ve done, many times we\u2019ve been looking down the gun barrel of a potentially highly uncertain and maybe likely a worse economy. And it\u2019s certainly hard to be in the prediction business. But what we do is we \u2013 there\u2019s couple of big things that we do as an approach. First of all, we underwrite to an assumption of worsening. We try to make it so if things go bad, it\u2019s not a surprise that it would be really bad banking to \u2013 it\u2019d be underwriting to good scenarios. And I know everyone tries to be conservative, but I\u2019m just saying with over three decades in building this company, at the heart of it is underwriting that looks in the rear view mirror of how programs are doing and overlaying a worsening assumption on that because that is could happen, and we need to be resilient to that. So you\u2019ll often hear Capital One talking about the word resilient \u2013 resilience. Without a crystal ball about what\u2019s going to happen over time, the critical thing is what is the resilience of the loans that we are booking. And we spend a lot of time, for example, in the card business, just looking at the ratio of revenue margin to the charge-off rates and stressing that and all kinds of things. So we underwrite to worsening. That\u2019s a very important thing. Secondly, it is the management of credit decisions at the micro level so that we\u2019re looking for the earliest indications of where problems can occur. And like I said earlier, that\u2019s both \u2013 there\u2019s \u2013 let me just give you a little bit of window into that. We, of course, have our way that we look at how all our businesses are doing and all of our vintages are doing. We leverage machine learning though, to also look for aberrations and anomalies that happened faster than they would show up with a report and maybe coming from sources that would not be our standard set of variables by which otherwise, our models would look at the business. And so real-time machine learning-driven monitoring is really important in any environment, but we \u2013 it\u2019s really important in an environment like this because we\u2019re looking for \u2013 because we expect anomalies to happen, we expect some of our segments to be stressed in even the current environment certainly as things get worse, and so we\u2019re on the lookout and we have machine learning to help us. And then as I mentioned earlier, and sorry to be repetitive, but \u2013 but then \u2013 but it\u2019s not just letting the machines and the models do the work is standing back and saying, gathering people around and saying, let\u2019s think of all the things that could go wrong, what do you think will go wrong and what \u2013 where would weaknesses appear. And then based on that intuition, we go hunting for them. And all of the different approaches have been bearing fruit lately on a more modest basis in the card business and a little bit bigger basis in the auto business. And I would expect as the environment gets a whole lot worse from here, we\u2019re going to \u2013 there\u2019s going to be a lot of active trimming all over the place. And so it\u2019s a combination of literally the most micro and analytical approaches marrying the most intuitive and big picture judgmental approach to managing risk. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Mihir Bhatia : Hi, thank you. I think just \u2013 follow. But I wanted to ask about the \u2013 I appreciate your comments earlier about you\u2019re enthusiastic about all of card lending so full spectrum. But just given the recent focus on the higher spend and the more transactor-type customers, I was wondering if you think that growing that portion a little bit, maybe that portion has been growing at an outsized rate, how is that growth of that subsegment potentially change the card portfolio\u2019s performance through the cycle or in a downturn? Richard Fairbank : That is a great question. In fact, let me pull up for a second before I answer your question. We have very gradually across the business, paralleling the move to the top of the market. All across our business, we have been leaning harder into the spender side of the business and just continuing to be most attracted to customers who are there to spend whose patterns would be more consistent with the spending side of the business even as there is a bunch of revolving. So across our business, there has been a very gradual but purposeful migration for years toward the spender side. So I\u2019ll put that down there. And then the second thing is the avoidance of high-balance revolvers. And then thirdly, the thing you\u2019re pointing to the \u2013 importantly, increasing mix of heavy spenders in our business. That the impact, I think when a downturn comes, these things that we\u2019ve been leading into and things we\u2019ve been avoiding should be all other things equal beneficial to the performance of the business in terms of the credit losses themselves, the payment rates that we experienced there during the business. And part of why we have leaned into spenders more is just because all the evidence that we have seen is that it tends to just be pound for pound a more resilient group. So while it\u2019s not a controlled experiment, I think the net effect of these changes will be beneficial to the credit results. And I think, enhance the resilience of the business that we have booked. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. And then just if I could ask just about the tech investments that you\u2019ve been making. Can you talk about just how do they improve your ability to flex expenses as the competitive or macro environment changes? Thanks. Andrew Young : Ironically, I think they may be \u2013 make things a little less flexible to \u2013 on the expense side, let me explain that. An increasing part of our cost structure as a company is our \u2013is the tech business that we have built. It\u2019s got a lot of fixed cost to it. And so that is not \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to set an expectation that our sort of tech stack and our tech company that we have built is a more variable cost business because if anything, it might be a little more fixed cost business. Now there within that, choices on what we invest in and the timing of those always create flexibility. And in stressful times, they\u2019re certainly on the investment side within tech can be more flexibility there. But the tech investment though pulling way up has tremendously enhanced Capital One\u2019s overall flexibility. Our ability to turn quickly in the marketplace to make credit choices. If you look back to the \u2013 when we all went \u2013 when the world went into vertical free fall of uncertainty in the pandemic, just look back at how quickly Capital One turned with respect to some of the pullbacks we did, that would not have been possible in the more legacy world that we lived in before. So the ability to respond quickly, the ability to create changes in the offerings to consumers the ability to create \u2013 we have flexibility and offerings, flexibility and forbearance, new ways to adapt to the marketplace. Everything about Capital One, the speed of change of managed change is dramatically different from before. We also \u2013 and this is probably the most important recession resilience point is the monitoring point I made earlier, to have put in place a much more comprehensive real-time monitoring capability with root cause analysis that\u2019s much more comprehensive than what we could have done before will allow us to be informed earlier on about things that are happening. And I do want to say I\u2019ve been asked by a number of investors. Rich, we know you well enough to know how cautious you are about the economy and about downturns and the utmost respect for what \u2013 how risk can play out in these businesses, why are you leaning into the marketing opportunity? And one of the reasons that we\u2019re doing that is this substantially improved measurement, monitoring and speed of response and the level of segmentation and micro segmentation by which we can do that gives us \u2013 allows the sort of paradoxical thing to lean in more than we otherwise might have been able to do. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our final question this evening comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, can you hear me? This is Dominick from Oppenheimer. Richard Fairbank : Yes, Dominick. Andrew Young : Yes. Dominick Gabriele : Okay. Sorry. I guess so \u2013 is there any reason, Rich, why you would expect the payment hierarchy among consumer products in which they choose to pay or default, let\u2019s say, in times of severe stress, is there any reason why anything you\u2019re seeing that would change that hierarchy this cycle around from previous cycles? And then I just have a follow-up. Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Dominick, that\u2019s a great question. I can only sort of speculate here, but the most striking thing about the global financial crisis and Great Recession that \u2013 from a payment hierarchy point of view is what we saw with people literally walking away from their mortgages and what was really high on the payment hierarchy was auto loans. And we \u2013 and that may be a kind of a more universal resilience point on the auto side because people still have to drive to work. And so that\u2019s probably more of a sustaining insight. I think that the, we got to look at student loans and think about where \u2013 I think we\u2019ve already observed that\u2019s pretty low in the payment hierarchy and trends these days and forgiveness and various things there would probably ensure that\u2019s on the lower end. Another one that I would probably just speculate to add to the hierarchy this year is this time around is fintechs. And I think the fintechs who don\u2019t report to the credit bureaus may have enjoyed their stealth opportunity to grow, but that\u2019s probably not lost on the consumers. And so I think one of the reasons, we\u2019ve really leaned harder into having spending be the anchor part of a consumer credit card relationship is that it\u2019s not only a healthier place to be from the consumer point of view. But I think, counting on that credit card and making sure that you\u2019ve got that in a downturn, that helps from a payment hierarchy point of view. Dominick Gabriele : Okay. Great. And then just \u2013 when you just think of \u2013 I just want to go back to the tech investment and spend and how you think about it over the cycle and perhaps even some of the peers that you talked to at conferences. How do you as one of the country\u2019s largest banks think about the investment that you put on? And what do you find does have what type of economic factors? Is it NIM? Is it NII growth changes or the credit growth changes that can have you put the brakes on the edges on year-over-year growth and tech investment spend? Thank you so much. Richard Fairbank : Thank you, Dominick. These are all great questions. We \u2013 in case you haven\u2019t noticed, I have a pretty deep conviction about the benefit of these tech investments, and that\u2019s not just how I feel, that\u2019s how all of us collectively feel here at Capital One. And the benefits of that tech investment are so comprehensive, although the company inside this company, we can see them everywhere. And they do so enhance how we work, the ability to manage risk, the ability to serve customers, the ability to create new products, the ability to grow. And so we do \u2013 and because we see such benefits, we are continuing to lean into tech investments. And as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s sort of under the surface quite a bit of productivity gain coming from the tech investment. But on the other hand, at the same time, we\u2019re leaning in pretty hard into tech investments such that it\u2019s \u2013 the effects are not that dramatic. In fact, over close to a decade, there\u2019s been a more gradual kind of improvement in operating efficiency. We \u2013 there\u2019s always the opportunity if times get really tough to pull back on tech investments, but we are not viewing these like luxury investments and just what to do on a sunny day because they are very materially transforming the opportunities of this company and the ability to manage risk and the ability to weather the very downturn that might motivate that reduction in investment.

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew? Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll start on slide 3 of tonight\u2019s presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $3.03 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $7.4 billion or $17.91 per share. Included in the results for the fourth quarter were two adjusting items, which collectively benefited pretax earnings by $105 million. Net of these adjustments, fourth quarter earnings per share were $2.82 and full year earnings performance share were $17.71. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans grew 3% and average loans grew 2%, driven by growth in our domestic car business. This loan growth coupled with net interest margin expansion drove revenue up 3% on a linked quarter basis. Noninterest expense grew 3% in the linked quarter, driven by an increase in marketing expenses while operating expenses were largely flat. Net of the adjustments I mentioned earlier, operating expenses were up 2.4%. Provision in the quarter \u2013 provision expense in the quarter was $2.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $1.4 billion and an allowance build of about $1 billion. Turning to slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $1 billion increase in allowance in the fourth quarter brings our total company year-end allowance balance up to $13.2 billion, increasing the total company coverage ratio by 22 basis points to 4.24%. I\u2019ll cover the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $795 million, bringing our coverage ratio to 6.97%. Three things put upward pressure on our card allowance. The first factor was the continued credit normalization in our portfolio. The second factor was a modestly worse economic outlook than our assumption a quarter ago. And finally, we built allowance for the loan growth in the quarter. The impact of the fourth quarter loan growth on the allowance is more muted than typical loan growth given the seasonal nature of these balances. These three factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $129 million, driving a 20 basis-point increase in coverage to 2.8%. The build was primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto business, including lower recovery rates. The second factor also putting upward pressure on our allowance is the impact of a modestly worse economic outlook. These two factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors. And finally, in our Commercial business, the allowance increased $73 million, resulting in a 9 basis-point increase in coverage to 1.54%. This was largely driven by reserve builds for our office portfolio. Turning to page 6, I\u2019ll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 143%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves increased by $14 billion to $107 billion. Strong consumer deposit growth throughout the quarter drove cash balances higher and allowed us to pay down prior FHLB borrowings. Turning to page 7, I\u2019ll cover our net interest margin. Our net interest margin was 6.84% in the fourth quarter, 24 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter and 4 basis points higher than the prior quarter. The 4 basis-point linked quarter increase in NIM was driven by higher asset yields and a balance sheet mix shift towards car loans. This impact was mostly offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs. Turning to slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.5% at the end of the fourth quarter, up about 30 basis points relative to last quarter. The $1.2 billion of net income in the quarter was partially offset by growth in risk-weighted assets, dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $150 million of common stock in the quarter, bringing the repurchases for the full year to $4.8 billion. We continue to estimate that our longer term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thank you, Andrew, and welcome, everybody. I\u2019ll begin on slide 10 with fourth quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. In the fourth quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Ending loan balances increased $22.9 billion or about 21% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 8% from the sequential quarter. And revenue was up 19% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize and were below pre-pandemic levels. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.2%, up 173 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter-end was 3.43%, 121 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 102 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 46 basis points. Noninterest expense was up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2021, which includes an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was about $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our choice in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We\u2019re seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. Slide 12 shows fourth quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see the effects of our choice to pull back on auto growth in response to competitive pricing dynamics that have pressured industry margins. Auto originations declined 32% year-over-year and 20% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking loan growth continued to be slower than previous quarters. Fourth quarter ending loans grew 3% compared to the year ago quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. Fourth quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 6% year-over-year, and up 5% over the sequential quarter. Average deposits were up 4% year-over-year and up 3% from the sequential quarter. Our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction. Consumer Banking revenue was up 10% year-over-year as growth in auto loans and deposits was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in auto margins. Noninterest expense was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and marketing for our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the fourth quarter. The charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 1.66%, up 108 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.62%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 61 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 77 basis points. Slide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, fourth quarter ending loan balances were down 1% and average loans were flat. Ending deposits were down 1% from the linked quarter. Average deposits grew 7%. Fourth quarter revenue was down 23% from the linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven by an internal funds transfer pricing impact that was offset by an equivalent increase in the other category and was therefore neutral to the Company. Excluding this impact, fourth quarter commercial revenue would have been down about 6% quarter-over-quarter and up 2% year-over-year. Noninterest expense was up 2% from the linked quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate increased 74 basis points from the linked quarter to 6.71%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 17 basis points from the linked quarter to 0.74%. In closing, we continue to drive strong growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the fourth quarter. Loan growth in our Consumer Banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we continued to pull back on auto originations. Consumer deposits grew. And in our Commercial Banking business, ending loans and deposits were roughly flat compared to the linked quarter.  Charge-off rates and delinquency rates continue to normalize across our business and were below pre-pandemic levels. Total company operating expense net of adjustments was up 2.4% from the linked quarter. Our annual operating efficiency ratio for full year 2022 was 44.5% net of adjustments, a 15 basis points improvement from full year 2021. And we expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. Pulling way up, we continue to see opportunities for resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities. We continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. Powered by our modern digital technology, we\u2019re continuously improving our proprietary underwriting, marketing and product capabilities. We\u2019re focusing on efficiency improvement and we\u2019re managing capital prudently. As a result of our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, we\u2019re in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now, we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to our other investors and analysts who might wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Victor, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from line of Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : I wanted to ask about just the vintage seasoning or growth math as you talk \u2013 as I think we\u2019ve talked about in the past. We\u2019ve added a lot of loans here in last year. And as these loans season, I was just trying to \u2013 wonder if you could maybe talk about just how you see that flowing through into your loss rates and what that does to your delinquency and loss goes here over the next 12 to 24 months? Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Yes. Thank you. Let me just start with a reminder of what we mean by growth math. As a general rule of thumb, losses on new loans tend to ramp up over a couple of years and then peak and then gradually come down. When we accelerate growth and especially when those new loans are added to a seasoned back book with low losses, it can increase the overall level of losses of a portfolio. We grew rapidly \u2013 for example, just looking back at when we talk a lot about growth math, we grew rapidly in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and had a particularly visible growth math effect in the wake of that growth. At that time, the large front book was adding to a back book that was unusually seasoned because it had survived the Great Recession. Given our recent rate of growth, I think it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see some growth math effect again over the next few years. But I think the general normalization trend will be the bigger driver of our credit trajectory. One other thing that\u2019s different about growth math going forward is CECL. Under the CECL accounting regime, the allowance impact of new growth are pulled forward significantly. We haven\u2019t seen this effect for most of the pandemic, even as we have accelerated our growth because of the offsetting favorable factors in our allowance. But as our growth continues, a portion of our allowance builds going forward are intended to support that growth. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. Thanks. And then just maybe on your reserve. Just trying to understand just some of the assumptions underlying the reserves. Maybe you could just talk about what you\u2019re assuming for unemployment whether you have a recession built into the short term. Any additional color you can help us with there? Thank you. Andrew Young : Sure Mihir. As I said in the past, we are largely consumers of economic assumptions. In this particular case for unemployment, we are assuming something that\u2019s a little modestly higher than consensus estimates for where we will land in the fourth quarter. I think consensus is somewhere around 4.8. We\u2019re \u2013 our baseline forecast gets up to around 5% in the fourth quarter. But it\u2019s important to note there\u2019s a lot of other things that go into the calculation of the reserve, things like unemployment \u2013 sorry, changes in the unemployment rate, inflation, home prices, wages, all of those factors matter as well, but our unemployment assumption is to be around 4% in the fourth quarter \u2013 sorry, around 5% in the fourth quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sharma with Capital One. Jeff Norris : Hey Victor, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. Ryan Nash : Was that intended for me, Jeff? Jeff Norris : Hey Ryan, why you don\u2019t go ahead. Ryan Nash : So Rich, maybe I can ask Mihir\u2019s \u2013 one of Mihir\u2019s questions in a slightly different manner. So, competitors in the industry are talking about reaching pre-pandemic loss levels by year-end or maybe even overshooting those levels. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about how you think about the pace of normalization or maybe even overshooting those? And maybe just talk a little bit about normalization versus parts of the portfolio if you\u2019re actually seeing any deterioration. Thanks. And I have a follow-up. Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So consumer credit metrics remain strong. And of course, as we\u2019ve seen, they\u2019ve been normalizing steadily through 2022 and are approaching pre-pandemic levels. At first, normalization was more pronounced in some segments more than others. It was \u2013 of course \u2013 and by the way, this is always the case that front book, new originations tend to be higher. So, that would have been shocking, had it been different. But the other thing we also said and talked to investors about it was more \u2013 normalization was happening everywhere, but it was more pronounced at the lower end of the market. More recently, we\u2019ve actually seen more uniform trend of normalization across businesses and segments, so, for example, across various FICO ranges and also across income levels. When we index them on credit metrics back to where they were before the pandemic, the sort of rest of the credit spectrum and rest of the income spectrums caught up to the, very recently in the last few months, to the lower end. So really, if I pull on that, it looks like the normalization is pretty consistent across the board. And \u2013 yes, go ahead, Ryan. Ryan Nash : No, no, go for it. I\u2019ll ask my follow-up when you finish. Richard Fairbank : So, you asked various competitors are forecasting or talking about different times at which things cross 2019 levels. I think at Capital One, we\u2019re not making specific predictions on that. But I think the key thing I would have you look at is the delinquency metrics. Delinquency metrics are the best single predictor of where things are going to go in the near term. And in fact, if we look at flow rates, we can see that very early flow rates into delinquency buckets are pretty normalized. So, we\u2019re not giving specific guidance. But we would say, look at the credit metrics, look at the dynamics across other metrics, but we feel this is \u2013 it\u2019s clearly normalizing as we see it. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then, Rich, maybe to follow up on the comments regarding the efficiency being flat to modestly down. I think last quarter, you were talking about modest efficiency improvements. There have been headlines about the firm reducing some headcount. So, I\u2019m just curious, has anything changed in terms of your expectations for efficiency improvement? I guess given the pace of revenue growth that\u2019s expected and contemplated, is there any acceleration in investments that\u2019s taking place to drive the stable to modestly efficient \u2013 improving efficiency? Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Yes. Ryan, our efficiency outlook is exactly the same as it was last quarter. If you recall, actually, we guided to the \u2013 for full year 2022 for efficiency to be flat \u2013 basically kind of flat to 2021, and then modestly down for 2023 relative to 2021. What happened is that \u201822 came in a little bit lower. So, our guidance of flat to modestly down, it\u2019s the same outlook as we had before. And so, there\u2019s not big investments behind that. It\u2019s a continued journey of Capital One to lean into our opportunities to continue to invest in the tech opportunities that we see and the opportunities to create breakthroughs in the marketplace and continue to transform how we work. But pulling way up the sort of story if you kind of pull way back on operating efficiency, the journey that where we\u2019ve driven 440 basis points of improvement from 2013 \u2013 well, through 2019. And then we had the whole pandemic thing. But if I pull way up the gradual operating efficiency improvement is what we are continuing to drive for through the leveraging of our tech transformation even as we continue to invest. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So two questions. One, just as we think about the margin and the net interest margin, interest margin outlook, \u2013 can you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about deposit betas and how that\u2019s likely to grow here over the course of the year. I noticed you talked a little bit earlier about deposit growth was really strong. Maybe give us a sense as to which types of deposits you\u2019re really leaning into at this stage. And then help us understand how asset yields are likely to trend given \u2013 forward curve, I\u2019m assuming is the base case, but tell me if you have a different point of view on that. Thanks. Andrew Young : Yes. Betsy, I\u2019ll start with your last question first, which is we are following the forward curve, assuming 50 bps here in the first quarter and holding flat throughout \u201823 before coming down in \u201824. With respect to how we\u2019re thinking about beta and asset yields as components of NIM, as we get into the latter part of this rate cycle, lagged deposit rates really have a bigger impact than the asset yields that reprice more quickly and did so over the last couple of quarters as the Fed was moving rapidly. And so, there\u2019s a bit of that sequential dynamic going on. In terms of thinking about overall deposit beta and product mix, roughly 85% of our deposits are in consumer. It\u2019s where our focus lies. And so if you just look at the cumulative deposit beta for the total company, it\u2019s around 35%, was low-20s last quarter. But if you look at the last increasing rate cycle, I think the terminal beta was around 41. So, I could see a terminal beta being somewhere above that, just given competitive dynamics in the marketplace at this point. So, I would say the net of all of those factors is likely to be a modest headwind to NIM. We talked last quarter about balance sheet mix \u2013 and we are largely back to a pre-pandemic balance sheet mix from where we were a year ago. And frankly, our NIM is roughly in a similar spot. So, I would say balance sheet mix over a multiple quarter period isn\u2019t likely to be a big driver, unless we just see outsized growth in the higher-margin card business. And then, the other factor that could prove to be a tailwind to potentially offset a little bit of the modest headwind that probably comes from the beta dynamics that I described is we could also see a bit of an increase in card revolve rates from where they are today. So, all of those things are \u2013 just to leave you with kind of a net impression that there are headwinds and potentially some tailwinds. But the one thing I will just note as we look ahead to the first quarter, as a reminder, in the way we calculate NIM day count has an effect. So, the one thing we know for sure is we\u2019ll have a 14 basis-point or so headwind in Q1 due to having two fewer days in the quarter. Betsy Graseck : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful color. As a follow-up, I just wanted to get a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about the outlook for marketing, obviously, a critical driver of growth, and I know it\u2019s been something that you\u2019ve been very successful with in generating that top of wallet customer. But just wanted to see how we should think about that investment as we go into the next year with this NIM headwind, et cetera. Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Betsy, yes, we continue to \u2013 I feel very good about the traction that we\u2019re getting in marketing. Of course, most of the marketing that we do is in the card business. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities across the business for new account origination. We have continued to expand our products and the marketing channels that we\u2019re originating in. We see evidence all over the place of the benefits of our tech transformation that\u2019s giving us some extra opportunity. So, we feel very good about that. You mentioned, of course, how do we feel about leaning into this in the context of the potential looming downturn. And what we do is we just continue to look all around the edges of our originations and look for places that either we would think might be particularly likely to have a challenge or be vulnerable or things that we see having any kind of performance issues, and we sort of trim around the edges. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for three decades at Capital One, and we continue to do this. So there\u2019s a little bit of trimming around the edges. But really, the net impression I would lead you on the card side is we continue to lean in. Now, of course, there\u2019s the marketing that we do just the \u2013 to originate accounts directly through all the direct marketing media. We, of course, have our continued investments on the brand side, we \u2013 the heavy spender investments, which are particularly heavy in terms of marketing costs. We continue to get very good traction on the spender side, our growth as you sort of look at each sort of range of spenders, the \u2013 we are getting the most growth at the higher end.  So, that continues to be a good sign for us. And so, we\u2019re leaning into that. And then the other thing on the marketing side, of course, is the national bank marketing. You\u2019ve seen some of the success we\u2019re having there. Everybody in banking is sort of leaning into the deposit growth side in the context of changing interest rates, and some deposits leading the banking systems. So our marketing venues to get very good traction there. So pulling way up, we continue to feel good about the marketing. We like the traction that we\u2019re getting. And we have, of course, a very vigilant eye on the economic environment that we\u2019re moving into. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Rich, I wanted to follow up on your commentary around delinquency metrics. At the current pace of normalization, is it reasonable to expect that we could see DQs get back to pre-pandemic levels by the mid-2023 time frame? And then from there, does your outlook suggest that you expect delinquencies to flatten out, or are you conservatively expecting DQs to drift higher and are prepared for some degree of modest worsening in credit that perhaps goes a bit beyond normalization? Richard Fairbank : Well, what we have said, Bill, is there are lots of metrics to look at, and I can even talk to you about a few \u2013 some of the others we\u2019re looking at as well. But number one, that we would point our investors to look at is delinquency. And delinquency entries and individual delinquency flow rates have \u2013 we see the normalization happening there, as I mentioned earlier. And we think the there continues \u2013 it\u2019s interesting the \u2013 when you look at the delinquencies themselves and most of the credit metrics, they continue to just keep on moving toward what we\u2019re calling sort of normalization. Normalization, of course, is not any precise point. But there are also a number of other things that we look at that I think show sort of the strength of where this thing is headed. And one is on the vintage curves from new originations. They continue to be pretty flat month after month. They\u2019re, of course, lagged by several months, but pretty flat. And in \u2013 when we compare individual segments to where they were back in the pre-pandemic period. It\u2019s pretty much on top of each other. So, that is a good sign. We continue to look at our payment rates, which continue to be elevated. We like elevated payment rates that we\u2019ve assumed they\u2019re going to normalize part of the way down to where they were before. But of course, there\u2019s been some mix shift towards more spender within Capital One\u2019s portfolio. But payment rates continue to be strong. The percent of customers making just the minimum payment is still below pre-pandemic levels. The percent of customers making full payments is above pre-pandemic levels. Revolve rate is roughly flat relative to last year and remains below pre-pandemic.  So, these are all things that are positive indicators. But I do want to say also, again, there\u2019s been some mix change in our own portfolio with a bit of a shift toward the heavier spenders. So, many of these metrics may not fully get back to where they were pre-pandemic. But if we pull up on this, what we see is \u2013 nothing we see is surprising. It would be consistent with a consumer coming off of some of the extreme stimulus and some of the extreme pullbacks in the pandemic and returning to more normal behavior. And I think the delinquency metrics are certainly leading indicators of that trajectory. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s very helpful, Rich. Thank you. If I may, as a follow-up, separate topic. Can you give us an update on Capital One\u2019s strategy for reducing friction at checkout with different electronic consumer wallet solutions. There have been some recent press reports regarding partnerships with other digital wallet providers. It would be helpful if you could just share your latest thoughts. Jeff Norris : Before you go, we\u2019re getting a lot of background noise, Bill. Could you go on mute? Bill Carcache : Yes. Richard Fairbank : So, a phrase that I\u2019ve often used is the tip of the spear in the transformation of banking is payments, both on the consumer and the commercial side. And the reason I say this is that first of all, it\u2019s very prone to significant changes in technology, and also, it\u2019s not as heavily regulated a space as much of banking is. You don\u2019t have to be a bank holding company to be doing a lot of those things. And that\u2019s actually the area that we have seen certainly a lot of traction in \u2013 by some very successful tech company.  So, Capital One has \u2013 we continue to support the various technology players who have developed payment innovations, and we continue to develop innovations of our own. There were some news out about in the news today, in fact, about potentially a new wallet coming out. We are 1 of 7 co-owners of EWS. And we\u2019re one of the thousands of banks that use EWS. But on that one, we really don\u2019t have any specific comments to get ahead of the EWS management team on that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Rich, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about your thoughts on auto credit. And then, as a follow-up, what you\u2019re seeing on credit card spend, in particular, heavy spenders and whether or not they can sustain for travel and spend numbers. Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thank you, Don. In auto, let\u2019s talk a little bit about the auto business and maybe a little bit of a comparison to the card business. Just to talk about \u2013 auto as many of the very same trends. It is all the same general trends going on with the consumer and the normalization that we have been talking about. The auto business also has some other things that are unique to it. Auto recoveries, for example. Auto recoveries inventories are unusually low because of the very low charge-offs that we\u2019ve had in the past few years. The past charge-offs are basically the raw material for future recoveries. So, the generally good news that has been in the auto industry of robust used car prices actually puts upward pressure on our overall loss rate as recoveries inventory build. So, we also, in terms of the credit metrics, we have seen more degradation in the very, very low and mostly below where we play in the auto business, but we have trimmed a little bit around the edges at our own low end. But basically, we continue to feel very good about our originations. From a credit point of view, the biggest issue in auto is the margin pressure that has come from the rising interest rates that have not been fully passed through by the competition. So we continue to feel really good about the auto opportunity, but our pullback is really not a credit-driven pullback so much as it is a margin-driven pullback. But we certainly do see the \u2013 we can see the normalization in the auto business. Don Fandetti : Okay. And then on the credit card spend, same story. Are you seeing moderation? And can you talk about heavy spenders trends? Richard Fairbank : Yes. We \u2013 you\u2019ll notice our own spend growth numbers moderated quite a bit this quarter. We are seeing spend per account per customer moderate across our portfolio, moderating the most at the lower end, but we see the moderation. We see it the least in the very heaviest spenders, but the moderation that you see in our spend growth metrics are driven really by what\u2019s happening per account, we continue to get nice growth of accounts. So that is a phenomenon that \u2013 and then we kind of ask, well, what should we be rooting for? I think you\u2019re seeing a very rational response by consumers to the environment. There was a big surge in spending. I think it\u2019s moderating somewhat, particularly at places other than the very highest end of the marketplace. So, I think it\u2019s basically a sign of consumers being rational. Operator : Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Andrew, first question for you on share repurchases. Maybe you could just help us think about the pace of share repurchases as we move forward because I know you guys slowed them down, but you\u2019ve been building capital. Maybe you can just help us with that first. Andrew Young : Sure, Sanjay. In terms of thinking about the capital that we have moved down over the course of the last couple of years from \u2013 in the 14 to we hit a low point of 12.1, a couple quarters ago. But as we sit here today, we\u2019re just looking at the actual and forecasted levels and the earnings and growth and in particular, economic conditions, and there\u2019s some pretty wide error bars around those factors, particularly with respect to growth and economic uncertainty. And so, we feel like at this moment in time that it\u2019s good to be a little bit more on the conservative side with risk management of managing that capital. But clearly, we have the flexibility around our capital decisions under SCBs. And so \u2013 and I don\u2019t know, Rich, if you wanted to make any comments about repurchases as well. Richard Fairbank : Yes. Well, we \u2013 I think we just continue to generate a lot of capital. And we \u2013 a central part of our strategy is the return of capital through share repurchases and dividends. Lately, we\u2019ve dialed back a little bit on that just really as a measure of prudence in an unusually uncertain time like this. I think there\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve never met anyone who sort of says that they had too much capital in a downturn. So after very strong levels of buybacks, we\u2019ve moderated here in this environment, but the strategy of Capital One continues to be the same. And we believe that return of capital is an important part of the economic equation for investors over time. Sanjay Sakhrani : So, should we assume sort of the fourth quarter pace as a good run rate or just not assume anything? Andrew Young : Yes. Sanjay, we\u2019re just going to manage it dynamically based on what we see in the marketplace and the factors that I described before. So, at this point, you\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve been doing over the last handful of months, roughly $50 million a month. But again, we have flexibility, and as we have a bit more certainty of how the coming quarters will play out, that\u2019s going to inform our actions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Arren Cyganovich : Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the level of marketing growth for the year. You had a bit of a step up, I\u2019d say, in 2022 and the growth rates there are obviously showing a lot of traction in most of your metrics. Is there essentially kind of a bit of a slowdown but still have the ability to continue to grow and get into the opportunity on the card side? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Arren, yes, marketing \u2013 the marketing story has several components to it. One is just the \u2013 and an important part of that is the sort of real-time response to the opportunities that we see. And we continue \u2013 and especially talking about card and of course, card is where most of the marketing is. But, we continue to see attractive growth opportunities really across our business and are leaning into them.  So that \u2013 and it\u2019s corresponded with some expansion in opportunities that are just a byproduct of our tech transformation, and it\u2019s just more access points, more channels, more better credit models that give a little bit deeper and wider access to opportunities and more granularity. The more granularity that we get from our models, actually, the more we can separate the attractive customers from the less attractive and it allows us to lean in more. So, the marketing \u2013 the pursuit of the real-time opportunities we see is an important part of the marketing, and that is going very well. The second important driver, of course, is the continued traction we\u2019re getting in our really 10-year journey to drive more and more upmarket with focus on heavy spenders. And I think back to when we launched the Venture card in 2010. And \u2013 but of course, this journey \u2013 and we\u2019ve been declaring for years that the pursuit of the top of the market is not something that is an opportunistic one of in and out. And it is much more about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and then investing to be able to do that. And that\u2019s about great products with heavy reward content, great servicing, exceptional digital experiences but also more and more of the experiences that are consistent with the very high end lifestyle and so on. So, there have been a bunch of investments there. Most of that \u2013 not all of it, but a lot of that shows up in marketing. That also has a significant upfront component in terms of not only the direct marketing and the brand building, but also the early spend bonuses that go right through the marketing line when we \u2013 at the early stage of these accounts. So, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been growing and sustaining over the last number of years. We love the traction that we\u2019re getting. And so, we continue to lean into that. And then again, the national bank, where I just want to comment, we are really pleased with the national bank that we\u2019ve built. This is a \u2013 we are the really only kind of full service national bank that is \u2013 doesn\u2019t have a national quest to \u2013 through acquisition to continue to grow.  In other words, of all the banks our size or even smaller, the realistic path to growth is to do that through mergers and acquisitions, our path is an organic one. We\u2019ve invested quite a bit to create full digital capabilities for almost everything you can do in a branch to be able to be done by a customer digitally. And so that our growth story is not just about savings accounts, but it\u2019s very much about checking accounts as well. And this is our quest we\u2019ve been on for some number of years to build a national bank. That also is \u2013 that\u2019s physical distribution light and marketing heavy. So a bunch of things kind of come together to create the pretty big marketing levels that we have now, but we feel very good about the traction that we\u2019re getting. Jeff Norris : Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Shane with JP Morgan. Richard Shane : Andrew, you\u2019ve made the comment talking about the reserve rate on the card portfolio and reflecting the seasonality of the increase in spend and balances from spend-driven accounts. As we move into Q1, should we assume that with normal portfolio runoff but a mix shift that that allowance coverage ratio will actually pick up then because you\u2019re going to get a mix shift? Andrew Young : Well, there\u2019s a number of factors, Rick, that will play into coverage ratio. So, why don\u2019t I just pull up and lay out the key pieces and forecast assumptions of our allowance. And I will get to your kind of seasonal balance point in a moment. But I think it\u2019s important to lay out all of the component parts rather than just talk about one individual one since all of them will affect where coverage goes from here. So, the first part of the allowance is we\u2019re using models to estimate the next 12 months of losses. And the early period of this forecast is generally more accurate because, as Rich was talking about earlier, we can look at the existing delinquency inventories and flow rates, beyond those months we incorporate in the economic assumptions, they become a more significant driver of expected loss content. I referenced that in the answer to the first question that was asked on the call, but the error bars around the loss content widened the further we go out over the course of the year. The second factor impacting the allowances, we start from the year one exit rate for losses and then assume a reversion to a long-term average over the following 12 months. And then, the third thing is we net forecasted recoveries against the loss estimates for all of those periods. And so, on top of all of those assumptions, we then put qualitative factors in places where we believe modeled outcomes have limitations. And so, we end up putting all of those pieces together to evaluate the allowance. The open-ended product of credit card is different than closed-end loans as we go through those mechanics because with closed-end loans, we\u2019re reserving for estimated loss content for the account. But in a revolving product like card, we\u2019re only able to reserve for the loss content related to the balances that are on the books at the end of the quarter as opposed to the projected loss content for the account. So getting to your question then, when we have elevated seasonal balances in the fourth quarter, we expect a portion of those balances to pay down very quickly. And therefore, those specific balances are likely to have very, very low loss content given the life of the balance is far shorter than the life of the account.  So all else equal, the coverage ratio in the fourth quarter has a bit of natural downward pressure from that elevated denominator as you suggest. But looking ahead, there\u2019s a bunch of factors that can impact where the allowance goes from here beyond that single effect. In periods where future losses may increase we would replace the low loss content of the current quarter with the projected higher loss content in a future period. And for what it\u2019s worth, those assumptions also then carry into that reversion period. As we have growth with seasonally adjusted balances, Rich mentioned this before, CECL significantly pulls forward that allowance cost of growth. And then the third factor is coming out of a period where we have unusually low losses like we\u2019ve experienced, over the last couple of quarters, you have lower recoveries to offset the forecasted loss content. So, all of those things can put upward pressure on allowance but we can also have revisions to our economic assumptions, to delinquency flow rates, to just our overall loss content. And so, there\u2019s pressures in the other direction. And so, I appreciate your bearing with me for a long-winded complex answer, but I think we all saw the complexity and pro-cyclicality of CECL play out during the pandemic when we had to make a bunch of assumptions as the pandemic played out, we built a sizable allowance only to release virtually all of it over the subsequent quarters. And so, it\u2019s just a very difficult thing to predict given all of the assumptions at play, which is why we are trying to focus you on Mako [ph] and having delinquencies as a leading edge indicator of Mako because that is ultimately where the real economic cost is felt. Richard Shane : Got it. No, it\u2019s a great answer, and I\u2019m glad to bear with you. I\u2019ll probably read it in the transcript about 7 more times. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : And I was hoping to talk a little bit about marketing. I mean, Rich, you did mention that you were primarily in card and primarily in the upscale customer. But could you just talk a little bit about, number one, what you might be doing kind of in nonprime and how we should think about whether that total marketing spend given what you see is likely to be higher in \u201823 or not? Richard Fairbank : Yes. So Moshe, I\u2019m glad you asked the question because I would not want the net impression to be \u2013 I think what you were saying is that, is our marketing primarily just in the upscale customer segment? Differentially relative to years ago, we\u2019ve certainly had a shift to the higher end in terms of our marketing. The marketing is also so expensive at that end. And then, also the marketing at the higher end tends to, in some sense, lift the boats across the franchise. So, the marketing at the higher end is carrying a lot on its shoulders, Moshe. But, we do a lot of marketing in the mass market of the card business, including in the higher end of the subprime segment of the market.  This is \u2013 our strategy here is \u2013 well, it changes all \u2013 we tweak it around the edges all the time. We\u2019ve been doing this for pretty much approaching three decades now, at the lower end of the market. And the marketing there is direct marketing, stimulus response, very information based. And so, the marketing machine that we\u2019ve built, which has been enhanced by technology here is definitely leaning into that opportunity. And I do want to say that the \u2013 we continue to get good traction in the subprime and prime parts of the marketplace, even as we certainly relative to 10 years ago, have a lot more marketing going on at the top of the market. So, there\u2019s quite a bit going on, and we feel good about the traction there. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Maybe just to kind of \u2013 as a follow-up, what would it take for you to see, either in the portfolio or in the market for you to do less marketing? Richard Fairbank : Yes. The way this tends to happen is it happens in one little segment, one micro segment at the margin in response to things that we see going on there. I use this phrase a lot, trimming around the edges. And you\u2019ve heard me use that for many, many years. And this is something that we always do or something we\u2019re expanding around the edges. The net feel of these days is we\u2019re doing more trimming around the edges than expanding around the edges, but it is \u2013 so it\u2019s less about at the top of the house saying, we just believe we should do \u2013 obviously, at the top of the house, we\u2019re looking at all the macro things, but we\u2019re linking what we see in the macro level to what we\u2019re seeing right there in real time or the earliest we can see from our credit metrics. And then, using the technology we\u2019ve continued to invest so heavily in to have a more and more granular diagnosis. And at an earlier time than ever before diagnosis of where anything is deviating from the trajectory that we would expect. And then one is sort of the diagnosis of deviation. And the second thing, of course, is trying to get sort of a root cause, understanding of what may be driving that. And this is something that we continue to put a lot of energy into and it has led us to trim some \u2013 there are some things that we have seen degrade a fair amount around the edges. They\u2019re fairly small in the overall size of things, but we\u2019re certainly glad when we see them. And then, what we try to do is to link data that we see to behavior that \u2013 excuse me, to sort of an explanation of what\u2019s going on from a customer and credit dynamic to be able to be \u2013 it makes total sense. So therefore, as things play out, it\u2019s less likely \u2013 and let\u2019s say, we go more into a downturn, it\u2019s less likely on the card side that you would see a big pullback. The kind of things you\u2019d see is more trimming around the edges, more reduction of the credit lines that are given, and that would be more how it would play out. Operator : John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the \u2013 regarding the reserve build in terms of the drivers of the reserve build this quarter, I know you cited loan growth, you cited the macro backdrop, and you sited credit normalization. Is there any way to help parse out how much of the build of $1 billion is attributable to loan growth versus macro versus credit normalization? Andrew Young : Yes. John, we don\u2019t break out those components in part because some of them are actually related to one another. For instance, how we think about qualitative factors and how we think about our base forecast is tied into one another. And so, that\u2019s why we just wanted to lay out that quarter-over-quarter when you look at consensus estimates for things like unemployment, looking ahead at 2023, from where we were as of the end of the third quarter to where we were at the end of the fourth quarter, looking ahead on some of those metrics, we saw a degree of worsening. And when you couple that with shifting forward one quarter and replacing a much lower loss content in the fourth quarter with continued normalization, as I referenced it heading into 2023, those are factors that go into it. But actually not even really able to break out the component parts because they\u2019re tied with one another with all the assumptions. John Pancari : Okay. No, I get it. That\u2019s helpful. The normalization point, if I could just ask one more thing on that, was there anything about the normalization? And I appreciate the color you already gave. But is there anything about the normalization that you\u2019re seeing that is kind of faster than expected, or any change like that that necessitated the size of the build this quarter? Andrew Young : No. And I think Rich touched on some of these in one of his earlier responses, but what we\u2019re seeing in terms of normalization is playing out as we expect. It\u2019s part of why I wanted to highlight the fact that the mechanics of the reserve though only take into account that 12-month model period and revert from there. And so, we\u2019re only allowing for the content \u2013 the outstandings content at the end of the quarter as well. So, even if things play out exactly as we expect, we could see allowance build, just like we saw this quarter. It just depends on a whole host of factors. Jeff Norris : And I think that concludes our Q&A for the evening. Thank you for joining us on the conference call today, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Investor Relations team will be here later this evening if you have any further questions. Have a good night. Richard Fairbank : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter, Capital One earned $960 million or $2.31 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4 billion were flat to the fourth quarter and up 3% relative to the fourth quarter net of adjustments. Period-end loans held for investment declined 1% and average loans were flat. Total deposits grew throughout the quarter, increasing 4% on average and 5% on an ending basis. The increase in deposits was driven by strong retail deposit inflows, which was slightly offset by a decline in our commercial deposits. Our strong retail deposit growth drove our percentage of FDIC insured deposits, up 2% to end the quarter at 78% of total deposits. We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the linked quarter decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower noninterest income while net interest income was largely flat. Noninterest expense decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by a decline in marketing from the seasonally higher fourth quarter. Operating expenses were up about 2% on a GAAP basis and roughly flat net of the fourth quarter adjusting items. Provision expense was $2.8 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $1.7 billion and an allowance build of $1.1 billion.  Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $1.1 billion increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $14.3 billion as of March 31st. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.64%, up 40 basis points from the prior quarter. In our allowance, our assumptions for key economic variables remain similar to those of last quarter. We continue to assume economic worsening from today's levels on most measures. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $867 million, increasing our coverage ratio by 69 basis points to 7.66%. Our build in the quarter was primarily driven by 3 factors : the first factor is the impact of underlying growth in the quarter, which replaced seasonal balances from the fourth quarter for which we held minimal allowance.  The second factor is the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the first quarter of 2023 and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the first quarter of 2024. Recall that our allowance methodology uses a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period, before it begins to revert to our historical loss average with additional consideration of qualitative factors. And finally, the third factor in our allowance build was the impact of acquiring the BJ's portfolio in the quarter. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $32 million, mostly driven by the decline in loans. The coverage ratio increased by 2 basis points and now stands at 2.82%. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $245 million. The coverage ratio increased by 28 basis points and now stands at 1.82%. The allowance increase was driven by a $262 million reserve build related to our $3.6 billion commercial office portfolio. The coverage on the commercial office portfolio increased about 770 basis points and now stands at 13.9%. We have provided additional details on this portfolio on Slide 17 of the presentation.  Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 148%, up from 143% last quarter and 140% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by $20 billion to $127 billion, primarily driven by increased levels of cash. Our cash position ended the quarter at $47 billion, up $16 million from the prior quarter. This increase in our cash position was primarily driven by the strong consumer deposit growth I referenced earlier.  We expect average cash balances in the near term to be elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. In addition to the higher cash, the market value of our AFS securities portfolio grew $5 billion to $82 billion at the end of the quarter. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.6%, 24 basis points lower than last quarter and 11 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The 24 basis point quarter-over-quarter decline in NIM was driven by 2 factors : first, 15 basis points of the decline was a result of having 2 fewer days in the quarter; and second, the mix impact of the elevated cash balances that I previously described pressured NIM by approximately 11 basis points. Outside of these 2 effects, higher asset yields roughly offset higher funding costs.  Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.5%, flat to the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter and lower risk-weighted assets were offset by common and preferred dividends, the $150 million of share repurchase we completed in the quarter and a 17 basis point impact from the phase-in of the CECL transition. At the end of the first quarter, the unrealized losses in AOCI from our AFS investment portfolio were $6.7 billion. If we were to include the impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital, our CET1 ratio would have ended the quarter at 10.5%, and we continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with first quarter results in our credit card business. Year-over-year growth in loans and purchase volume drove an increase in revenue compared to the prior year quarter. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the first quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the first quarter was up 10% from the first quarter of 2022, ending loan balances increased $23 billion or about 21% year-over-year and revenue was up 17% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 58 basis points from the prior year quarter and remains strong at 17.7%. Revenue margin continues to benefit from growth in the high-margin segments of our card business. In the first quarter, that benefit was more than offset by 2 factors : first, loans are currently growing at a faster rate than purchase volume and net interchange revenue. That dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin. And second, as charge-offs increase, we're reversing more finance charge and fee revenue. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was up 192 basis points year-over-year to 4.04%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 134 basis points from the prior year to 3.66% and is now essentially at its March 2019 level. The charge-off rate hasn't caught up yet. But based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think the monthly charge-off rate we'll get back to 2019 levels around the middle of this year. Noninterest expense was up 11% from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher operating expense, partially offset by a modest year-over-year decline in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $897 million in the first quarter. Our choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing. First quarter marketing was down about 2% from the year ago quarter and down about 20% from the fourth quarter of 2022 as the first quarter is typically the seasonal low point for domestic card marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation, and we're leaning into marketing to drive resilient growth. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We are seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum and our decade-long focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. Slide 12 shows first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the first quarter, auto originations declined 47% year-over-year and 6% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking ending loans decreased $2.2 billion or 3% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. We posted another quarter of strong retail deposit growth. First quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up almost $33 billion or 13% year-over-year and up 8% compared to the sequential quarter. Average deposits were up 9% year-over-year and up 6% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction. Consumer Banking revenue was up 12% year-over-year driven by deposit growth. Noninterest expense was up 4% compared to the first quarter of 2022. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.53%, up 87 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.0%, up 115 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 13 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 62 basis points. The linked quarter trends were consistent with expected seasonal patterns. Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, first quarter ending loan balances were down 1% and average loans were down 2%. The decline is the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as higher customer paydowns in the quarter. Ending deposits were down 6% from the linked quarter. Average deposits declined 7% decline. We saw normal outflows throughout the first quarter as clients use their cash for payroll, tax payments and other business as usual disbursements. And consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters, we also continued to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances.  First quarter revenue was up 10% from the linked quarter. Recall that revenue in the prior quarter was unusually low, driven by a company neutral move in internal funds transfer pricing. Excluding this prior quarter impact, first quarter commercial revenue would have been down 10%, driven by a decline in noninterest income from our capital markets and agency businesses. Noninterest expense was down 5% from the linked quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 9 basis points. Criticized loan balances increased primarily in our commercial real estate business. The criticized performing loan rate increased 60 basis points from the linked quarter to 7.31% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 5 basis points from the linked quarter to 0.79%. In closing, once again, we delivered strong growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the first quarter. We continue to see opportunities for resilient domestic card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities, and we continue to lean into marketing. And as always, we're closely monitoring and assessing competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. In our Consumer Banking business, loans declined modestly and consumer deposits grew in the quarter. Our national digital-first consumer banking strategy continued to grow and gain traction, and we're leaning into marketing to grow our consumer deposit franchise. In our commercial bank, ending loans and deposits were down compared to linked quarter, reflecting our cautious stance in the commercial banking marketplace. Our commercial bank continues to focus on winning through deep industry specialization. And across our businesses, credit trends continued to normalize in the quarter, and we reached or we're approaching pre-pandemic levels at quarter end. We continue to expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. And our balance sheet demonstrated its strength through the recent period of turmoil in the banking industry. In the first quarter, we built additional balance sheet strength as we increased allowance for credit losses, grew retail deposits and maintained or increased strong levels of capital and liquidity. Pulling way up, the future of everything in banking is digital. And with each passing quarter, banking is accelerating toward its inevitable destination. Capital One is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to truly transform technology and put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital. Our modern technology capabilities are generating and expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. We are transforming the customer experience in banking. And our tech engine drives growth efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. Our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, put us in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : [Operator Instructions] If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Amy, please start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : I just want to follow up on the reserve build within the card portfolio. You said it in the slide presentation worsening credit trends and domestic credit cards. But at the same time, your prepared remarks said this is more of a normalization than anything else and you continue to grow. So what gives you confidence that this reserve build and the fairly rapid increase in delinquency and net charge-offs is truly a normalization as opposed to signs of further deterioration that's likely to occur. Richard Fairbank : Kevin, thanks for your question there. Yes, let me just talk about this. Look, I think as we -- as things get back to where they were pre-pandemic, at some point, the word normalization, we'll need to retire that because things get pretty normal. So let's just talk just a little bit about what we're seeing and what's inherent and how we're in our outlook. So at this point, many of our credit metrics have returned to their pre-pandemic levels. Others have not yet, but they're headed there. And we have -- we've particularly pointed as probably the best single metric to look at is delinquencies and delinquencies in the first quarter were at 3.66%, which is essentially back to 2019 levels, excuse me. Now our charge-offs haven't caught up yet, but based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think they'll get back to 2019 levels around the middle of the year -- of the year, excuse me.  And our credit metrics tend to move what I've seen just over the many years, probably a quarter or 2 ahead of the industry in both directions. We saw that in the global financial crisis, and we saw it again in the pandemic, and we're probably seeing it again here. So first of all, just relative to our outlook and how we think about in terms of forecasting our losses going forward. There is one effect that's more of a Capital One effect. It's an effect that exists for everyone. I think it's more pronounced for Capital One relative to our loss rates, which is related to recovery. So let me just pause and explain that 1 for a minute. Past charge-offs are, of course, the raw material for future recoveries and we just lived through 3 years of very low charge-offs. So our recoveries will be unusually low in the short to medium term. This is a larger headwind for us than most others because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work -- most of our recoveries we tend to work them on our own as opposed to selling them. So the recoveries come in over time and not all at once as would be the case in a debt sale. So that's just a Capital One effect that we've been talking about for a while, and that is inherent in sort of the math of how our charge-offs are working and will work over time. The other effect is the economy. And we are assuming material worsening of labor markets with the unemployment rate rising from today's very low levels to above 5% by the end of 2023. We are also assuming adverse effect from inflation and some further worsening of consumer profiles from the sort of the flip side of their extraordinary outperformance in the earlier period during the pandemic. So that's just a comment about how we create outlooks. We continue to feel very good about the business. We are leaning into our growth opportunities, our originations are coming in consistently solid, and we like the opportunities we see out there.  We underwrite -- we always have underwritten for worsening scenario. So as the economy -- and sort of as credit performance normalizes, which we've expected for a long period of time, we are just continuing right on the path we have been on for quite some time. Every quarter, we trim a little bit around the edges where we see or where we anticipate an effect where customers might be a little bit more vulnerable. We're also struck by the continued expansion of opportunities that are very resilient, and we're leaning into those. So we -- this business is built to anticipate volatility in losses and higher loss rates. And what we're doing is consistent with things that we have expected and we continue to really feel good about the opportunities. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then in the past, you made comments that the new growth -- the flow rates were relatively normal on a lot of your newer business. Do you continue to see that? And then also in the near term, are you still seeing the type of traction from your marketing spend, I guess, in the first quarter as you did in 2022? Richard Fairbank : Yes. So on your question about flow rates. Let me just -- why don't I just seize the moment a little bit and just talk about a bunch of our credit metrics and where they are. So we've talked about delinquencies we've talked about losses. Our individual flow rates have normalized and if we look at very early entry flow rates and a couple of delinquency buckets. In some cases, they're just a tick higher than they were in the way back at 2019 levels, but things are basically back. Our payment rates have -- payment rates are a striking thing because you saw just the electrifying -- well, sorry, if you look at the trust data, the electrifying increase. The whole industry's flow rates increased pretty dramatically. Capital One's increased the most. And that was a striking effect driven really by 2 different things. One is the flip side of the -- or a manifestation of the extraordinary credit performance of the consumer where they just were in such a good position. They just were paying the card off at high levels. And it was also a manifestation of the continuing mix shift towards the top of the market and the traction we were getting in heavy spenders. So payment rates have declined from the very high levels. They're not even close to where they were originally. But because of these 2 effects, if we separate them out and sort of look segment by segment, we see that payment rates are declining in every segment, but not yet back to where they were pre-pandemic. So that's something to keep an eye on there. Our revolve rate is roughly flat to last year and remains below pre-pandemic levels. But I think, again, there's a growth in transacting balances effect there. So we'll have to sort of adjust for that. And then a very important one is new originations. Let's talk about that. So we see early performance that is consistent with our expectations, the earliest delinquencies, so we, of course, look very carefully at the early delinquencies on our most recent vintages that would be some months ago because they have to have a few months where we can start reading them. But the earliest delinquencies on our newest monthly vintages of origination are consistent with pre-pandemic originations as we compare 1 segment at a time on current originations versus several years ago. And then vintage over vintage month over month for recent vintages, we're seeing pretty stable risk levels. So we feel very good about that. One thing that I've commented on over time is we have continued to -- in anticipation of market changes trim a little bit around the edges so that our -- the fact that our originations are performing on top of -- sort of where they were several years ago is also the result of some active anticipatory management. And so probably it offset some underlying worsening that's happened in the marketplace. So if we pull up on that set of metrics, we are -- we continue to feel very good about the choices we're making, as I said before, the -- this is -- puts us in a position to continue to lean into the marketing. We enter our originations, anticipate worsening as just a matter of underwriting anyway. And so we're leaning into the marketing even as we continue to trim a little bit around the edges here or there. And so in some ways, our message here is just very, very similar with the feel of how this has been for really quite a few quarters now. Operator : Next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So just want to make sure I understand on the reserve ratio. I know you already spoke a lot about it. So I just want to make sure I understand you just say yes or no. Is it fair to assume that the reserve ratio should go up every quarter where the macro stays in the current situation that we've got right now because the book that's rolling on is worse quality than the book that's rolling off. Is that fair? Andrew Young : I don't want to limit myself to a yes or no, Betsy, given the framing of your question. The short answer is no. And I will spare you from the allowance tutorial answer that I provided a quarter ago. But really, the mechanics are -- we have assumed for the losses or reserved for the losses that based on the current balances, that were on the books at the end of the quarter, what we assume we will experience over the next 12 months. And so if you're just replacing loan for loan with similar characteristics, you wouldn't otherwise have a build. I'm getting -- if I'm interpreting the nature of your question correctly. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then the follow-up question is just on a slightly different topic, which has to do with the expense ratio. I know you mentioned that you're looking for the operating efficiency to be flat to down this year on a year-on-year basis. I'm just wondering how to square that with what you mentioned on the marketing side where it sounds like you see a lot of opportunities in card and you are planning on leaning into the marketing side. So I just wanted to square those 2 things up. Andrew Young : Well, Betsy, let me just clarify, and then I'll turn it over to Rich. When our guidance for efficiency relates to operating expenses, it is not a total efficiency point. And so it would exclude whatever choices we make in marketing from that calculation. But I'll turn it to Rich to respond to the broader question. Richard Fairbank : Yes. Well, I was going to say the same thing. So our guidance is with respect to operating efficiency ratio to be flat to modestly down relative to 2022. And we continue to put a lot of energy into that, of course. The total efficiency ratio includes also the marketing side of the business, as we've talked about. That's not part of our specific guidance. Our marketing choices are very dependent on the opportunity that we see, and Betsy -- you and most of the people on this call have known Capital One for a long time. And when we see opportunities, we really lean in on them. And so we can talk about marketing maybe on another question, but that's the efficiency point there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Rich, you had mentioned that you expected the card charge-offs to kind of reach 2019 levels by the middle of the year. You also talked a little bit about assuming higher unemployment over time. I guess, what's the -- what should we think about as the trajectory, I guess, in other words, which is 2019 a stopping point? Or is -- if your expected unemployment levels are reached, then we would expect to see those losses go up even higher. Richard Fairbank : Moshe, just with respect to unemployment rate. I want to make a comment on that. All companies, including Capital One, try to look into limited historical data. And the thing I often call trying to model on 2 humps of the camel because it's only been a small number of times in the history of the card business that various economic metrics have gone up and gone down. So limited to the camel hump point, we all do our best to try to look at the drivers of -- and the correlations with respect to credit losses. A striking thing all along in our journey has been the -- sort of parallel movement of unemployment rates and credit losses. So the -- it turns out from a modeling point of view, while often in the standard way people talk about things is to focus on the level of unemployment, in many of our models, actually, the rate of change is what matters most either as a measure like monthly job creation or is the change to the unemployment rate. So an increase in the unemployment rate from the 3s to the 5s is pretty material worsening. But that's more of a window into the -- well, we would be cautious about even though historically, card losses almost strikingly to the number of average industry card losses. They've been pretty close to the unemployment rate over those 2 humps of a camel in the past. But I think that -- I think we lean a little harder into the effects that happened when unemployment rate changes. And therefore, that just happens to be a bigger element in our own models. I do want to just make a couple of other points, just intuitive points about the economy. So we start with a consumer that's in a very strong place. We know that. And the consumer excess savings on average is, of course, winding down, but it's still there. But of course, credit losses play out at the margin, not just on average. But there are just a couple of effects that none of us will know until sort of after the fact one of the two, I'm going to talk about will never know, but I just want to comment on those because those affect our outlook of where credit losses can be.  One, of course, is inflation. And none of us really have historical data in the card business to understand or predict the effects of significant increases and levels of inflation, but we are expecting inflation to impact consumer credit by compressing real incomes and as kind of a separate effect from an unemployment effect. And we -- since we haven't seen sustained inflation for more than 40 years, we can't really model this effect directly, but we make informed assumptions in our outlook to sort of account for this effect. So for example, a way to think about this is if there is a decline in real income that happens with this, we can look at our history and our cross-sectional evaluation of how people do as a function of different income levels, and then we can sort of extrapolate from those credit effects and proxy how something like inflation can have an effect there.  So it's sort of using proxies, but it matches off to an intuitive assumption that high levels of inflation are going to be challenging for people. And finally, the other effect is, as I intuitively think about the marketplace, over all the years of sort of my journey in this, we've tended to see that periods of abnormally good credit are followed by periods of worse credit and vice versa. And the credit performance we saw over the past 3 years was unprecedented. So there's -- what maybe we could call a catching-up effect that happens on the other side of that for consumers who might otherwise have charged off over the past 3 years. And sort of the reverse of this effect happened in the global financial crisis, where charge-offs were accelerated and then it was kind of followed by a period of strikingly benign credit. This is an effect, I intuitively believe, we can't measure it. We won't even in hindsight, be able to measure it, but I just think it's part of the intuition that we bring into the business. So when we pull kind of way up on things, we share with you the credit metrics that we see. And pretty much what you see is all that we see. So now we're all in the business of saying, where does this go from here? I shared with you some intuitive views that would lead to higher charge-off levels over time. And when we look at those, when we look at our card how we underwrite in card, we both can believe effects like this or -- will happen over time and also how strong the opportunity in card continues to be. So that's just a little window into how we think about that. And then that's sort of me talking, but then, of course, Andrew leads the whole process relative to -- and our Head of Credit, the whole process relative to the allowance build. But anyway, those are some thoughts about credit and how the kind of factors that may play out over time. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Maybe just switching gears a little bit. You mentioned the capital ratio and then the capital ratio if the AOCI were excluded or included. When you think about capital return over the next year, which one of those are you using as your base? Andrew Young : Yes, Moshe, it's Andrew. We look at a number of things as we are considering our capital actions. And so I've been saying for a couple of quarters now, we've seen an increased level of uncertainty in the economic environment, wide ranges around growth opportunities and everything that's happened over the last 1.5 months has increased that level of uncertainty. And so we continue to believe that it's prudent to operate above our 11% long-term target, both until we have more clarity, both not only on the economic front, but to the potential regulatory changes that may be coming down the pike, which could very well include treatment of AOCI in capital. But of course, we don't know that yet. And so for now, we're continuing to operate above that long-term target. But suffice it to say, we have substantial capital generation capacity, and we regularly evaluate our plans in light of the economic changes in light of regulatory changes, we have the ability to pivot quickly in our deployment and certainly we'll do so when we feel like the time is right. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : Andrew, I'd like to talk a little bit about the impact of the surge in deposits. When we look at the impact, it appears that it primarily runs through the corporate and other line in terms of where the NIM impact is. But the other change that I think we see is that it looks like the transfer pricing on deposits went down modestly. When we think about things going forward, should we assume that there's a continued drag at the corporate line from the elevated deposits and that because the reinvestment rate is lower, that the transfer pricing is going to be a little bit lower as well. Andrew Young : Well, Rick, let me just clarify first. And I'm assuming you're just looking at the net interest income trends in other, which does serve as a clearing house for FTPs, but happy to talk to you offline in more detail about this. But the basic tenets of the FTP process or there's an arm's length transaction between corporate and other and deposits. And so they're getting a prevailing rate, which shows up in the revenue of either the Consumer Banking segment or the commercial banking segment. And so there isn't a subsidy or drag going on there. There's just a number of other clearing factors that happen in other. Richard Shane : Understood. But actually, we've figured out a way over the years to calculate the NII on the transferred deposits through the consumer bank and it looks like they were down, and it's been very accurate over a long time. It looks like the transfer deposit rate was down about 8 basis points -- so at the consumer bank. So I'm curious, it looks like there was a drag in terms of corporate and other and actually the benefit of the bank was a little bit less attractive from an NII perspective as well. Jeff Norris : Rick, it's Jeff. I don't think we can comment on a calculation that you're doing that we don't fully understand. Why don't you and I take that offline? Richard Shane : Okay, terrific. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Arren Cyganovich : Maybe talk a little bit about credit card purchase volumes look like they inched up a little bit during the quarter. We've heard that from others that they're seeing slowdown in purchase volume in March and into April. What are you seeing within your portfolio? And are there kind of any differences between different income demographics that you're seeing within your customers? Richard Fairbank : So Aaron, yes. Let's just talk about purchase volume. So -- in Q1, our card purchase volume was up 10% year-over-year. And this grows while it's very solid, has decreased from the first part of 2022. But I think it's striking to separate out spend per active account and then like the growth of accounts and some of the benefits of our recent origination efforts. So if we look at spend per active account, now it was sort of -- it just really surge from the doldrums of the deep pandemic, then it really surged into the levels it was a year ago. We see spend per active account is pretty flat to a year ago. And it is -- and we can watch it on a typically, over the last few months, it has been sort of declining on that coming down to basically a sort of net result of being flat for a year ago or I think maybe it's actually in the last couple of months a little bit under where it was a year ago, if I remember the graph that I was looking at. Now initially, it's a funny thing how so often we see effects that start on the lower income, lower credit score side and then make their way up. I mean, pretty much the whole way credit has played out both on the improving side in the pandemic and then on the normalizing side, that's happened. But on spend, this slowing down happened in lower income segments first, but now it's more broad-based across income bands and really segments of our card business. So we, of course, are having very nice growth in accounts, and that's continuing to power purchase volume even as the spend sort of levels out. Now in the spirit of what are we rooting for, it seems to me to be a pretty rational thing for consumers to sort of level off this pretty strong spend that they have had. So I think what we see, we're pretty pleased with -- and then when we look at things like discretionary and nondiscretionary spending, both of them have slowed significantly over the last year. Well -- no, the growth rates have slowed significantly, but the category mix of spend, the more things change, the more they stay the same because basically pretty much across all the categories, things have returned to the pre-pandemic level. Arren Cyganovich : And just following up. I appreciate the commercial office disclosures you put in your slide deck. It looks relatively small comparative to the overall commercial and overall loan portfolio total together. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about your commercial real estate business. Is this -- I know you acquired several kind of smaller banks, North Fork and Hibernia and Chevy Chase. Are these predominantly portfolios from around those regions? Or do you also have a national lending business that deals in larger commercial real estate as well? Andrew Young : Yes. Let me start by talking about kind of what isn't in the disclosure that we provided because I know there's differences across various organizations. I mean as you know, Arren, that it's a little less than $4 billion and represents about 1% of our total loans, but this is our commercial office space. It is excluding, as you probably saw in the footnote, medical office and REIT and REIF medical office just has very different characteristics and so 2 does that's REIT and REIF. So in terms of the commercial office portfolio on our books, it's roughly 2/3 concentrated in New York, D.C. and San Francisco. It is roughly 60% B, C and obviously, 40% Class A. And so it has been accumulated over time, but it also was a business that up until a few years ago, we were active in, but we haven't had any new originations for the past few quarters and reduced our exposure to this segment over the past year by a little north of I think it's 10%. But given right now just the uncertainty that we see with office vacancies being elevated and utilization rates significantly below pre-pandemic levels and increasing debt service burdens despite the fact that we are getting 100% payment on principal and interest just in light of the continued uncertainty that I described just in terms of utilization and other factors. We decided to increase the coverage ratio quite a bit this quarter, and that's what you see in the disclosure in the back. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Maybe I know there's been a lot of questions on credit, but maybe just to follow up on another one, Rich. So can you maybe just talk about where the credit performance was worse or where it deteriorated. And also I'm surprised by the comment that you're reaching normal levels despite continued elevated payment rates and lower revolve rate. So how do you think about from here balancing growth versus the risk of credit continuing to not only normalize but get worse? Richard Fairbank : So yes, Ryan, I think the best net impression despite the fact that when we look at all our credit metrics, the -- some of them, like half of them aren't sort of back to pre-pandemic levels, and half of them are. My gut feel is it's a better net impression to view them as back. And I just think the underlying effects of continuing to lean into spenders, not only at the very top of the market, but within our segments and just the emphasis that we put on spend and some of the products, the marketing, the way we manage accounts, the kind of -- the people we raise lines to, et cetera. I just think there's been a subtle shift a little more towards the spending side. So I think that might explain why a few of these metrics are behind, but behind in terms of the -- but I think I walk around with the perception that things are pretty much at the levels of where they were a few years ago.  So now we feel very comfortable with respect to the choices that we're making, and let's just talk about why that is. I've already said, we underwrite to assumed worsening. So let's go back to back when the behavior of the consumer was at levels we've never seen in the whole history of the company. The credit performance was so good. We just assumed that was unsustainable. We underwrote to much higher levels of losses. So as things normalize, that's not really sort of changing anything at Capital One. So we -- but at the same time, you see the noise all over the place on the horizon. So we obsessively look for -- we not only use all of our modern and machine learning-based monitoring tools to identify little pockets that might be gapping out from expected performance or prior performance or anything like that.  And by the way, we have seen that in some pockets and then we dialed that back. We also hunt around and think about where would most intuitively the vulnerabilities be to where the economy is going. And we even anticipatorily kind of dial back around the edges there. But as I said earlier, I'm kind of struck by the number of new opportunities that are originating in terms of driven by the tech transformation of the company, new channels, new ways to succeed with customers that for kind of -- for every dial back that's happened, we seem to have had opportunities open up, and so we lean into those. And so it leads to my sitting in here and saying with respect to the card business, we feel, and I want you to walk away with that same net impression, the same level of optimism about our growth opportunities and our marketing and really the opportunity to create value in this part of the -- where we are in the cycle with card to be very strong. Now even as that happens, just to -- it's always striking to talk about the fact that the sibling of the card business, which is our auto business has been in a striking pullback mode over the very same period that we've been leaning in here and I partly point that out just to say that we don't at the top of the house, say there's just a green light out there.  This is all very much one part of the business at a time, 1 segment, 1 business area, but that pullback in auto has been a minority of the pullback, but still an important part of the pullback has been credit driven in the sense of looking at things in the card business and trying to get ahead of any effects that we think might happen from a credit point of view, but the majority of the effects have been margin related, as we've talked about with the some of the marketplace not passing through into their pricing, the higher interest rates. And so the -- and so we have dialed back quite a bit in auto. But given that most of that dial back or certainly the majority of it is really more margin related and not so much credit related. We -- if things change and normalize a little bit more on the pricing side, we might be able to open up more opportunity in auto. But what I'm pleased about is the combination of the -- walking around with an intuitive model about how the marketplace works. And as I shared in the earlier answer, thinking about the ways customers -- credit can worsen and customers can do perform not as well as it might appear as we obsess about that, that informs our choices and then by monitoring at the margin and incredibly granularly to look for effects and then having the technology to move so quickly with respect to the identification, the diagnosis of what's going on, the root causes of it and then taking the action, which is a cycle that's way faster than it used to be before our tech transformation. All of these contribute to the ability to be able to move with confidence in a changing environment and probably has contributed to why the vintage curves sort of keep coming back -- coming in on top of each other despite a changing environment. And all of that finally leads to why we feel confident about our opportunities to lean into growth because every opportunity has a limited window, and we're the company that when we see those opportunities, we go after them. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : As a follow-up for you, Andrew, on your allowance commentary, just to make sure I have the mechanics right. If macro conditions do indeed worsen from here as you expect? And each new quarter, that comes on reflects the worse outlook than each old quarter that rolls off. Is it reasonable to expect that your reserve rate would drift higher in future quarters given that dynamic? Andrew Young : It would, Bill. I was responding to what I interpreted to be Betsy's question of just individual vintages being the same, similar to what Rich just described. That in and of itself if you have a consistent growth rate wouldn't add to allowance. But if we're updating our assumptions a quarter from now and our economic view changes that will likely change our estimation of the loss content of the portfolio at that time. Bill Carcache : Understood. That's super helpful. And then separately, Rich, I wanted to ask you about the CFPB [ lengthy ] proposal. We know it's less significant for you than it is for others who are more deeply involved in the partnership business. But as we try to think through how this may play out across the industry, can you give any perspective on the extent to which you'd expect some merchants to possibly push back against efforts by their issuing partners to renegotiate economic terms following the proposed reduction in late fees, particularly in cases where merchants expect their sales to come under pressure? Richard Fairbank : So Bill, I don't really -- I don't really have a -- I don't have a prediction about what exactly happens in the partnership business relative to merchant -- partnership agreements and then something as significant as the change in late fees comes and therefore, what do the collective -- the merchant and the issuer sort of do about that, I don't really have a prediction on that one. I just -- I wouldn't want to let your opening comment go just when you say, well, it's obviously much more probably for the people with partnerships than others because this -- where this legislation to come into effect, it has a significant impact on Capital One. So now there's a lot of miles to go before maybe everything works out. But just to comment on this for a second. First of all, with respect to the proposal, it's not final, and we -- the CFPBs will get lots of public comments. And we'll have to see how the rule-making process plays out. Late fees play in a very important role in the system because they provide a direct and clear incentive for customers to pay on time and avoid running into delinquency. And it's also a way that issuers can sort of price for risk, and all this leads to greater access to credit and a lower cost of credit on average.  So we certainly have a point of view on this one. A change in -- a significant change in late fees could affect consumer payment behavior and delinquencies, it could affect access to certain parts of the population. So there's kind of a lot at stake. But what I wanted to say for Capital One, this is -- it's an important revenue source for Capital One. And we obviously are working on thinking about those impacts, what might be mitigating measures. And so we're early into our thinking about it, but I think not only for partnership-based companies. But for Capital One and maybe some other players as well, this is an important development that we're going to all have to take very seriously. Operator : Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Actually, all my questions have been asked and answered, but something came up to me and Rich, I apologize, it's somewhat nebulous. But in the past, you've given us some good metaphors to think about the environment. I think during the pandemic and stimulus zone, you talked about it, you're boring through a mountain because of stimulus, which helped avoid some level of loss content. We're in this unique world where we have inflation. Many of us haven't really lived or at least analyzed the equity markets in a period like this.  And then we've got a lot of other factors going on as well, both good and bad. I'm wondering whether it's a metaphor or not, you -- with stepping back, how do you describe the overall environment? You're advancing in certain categories, pulling back and others. Is there some context you can give us or a comparison to a previous time or how you think about it in comparison to previous times? Richard Fairbank : Well, thank you, John. I'd forgotten all about. I know you've been around me for quite a while. I love metaphors, and sometimes metaphors, I think, can be pretty striking ways to think about things that otherwise are complex to talk about. But going back to the boring through the mountain. Remember, we were talking back then each quarter, we'd say, well, we're in -- what could be very whopping losses that come from the tremendous upheaval of the pandemic every quarter, we are boring through the mountain and with the government stimulus and so on. If we think back, we got all the way through the mountain to the other side. And it was better from a credit point of view than anything that we can kind of imagine. So if I pull up and just say, where am I just -- how do I feel about where we are. When I think about the health of the consumer, the U.S. consumer remains a source of relative strength in an uncertain economy. The savings accumulated over the pandemic remain a positive for many consumers, that servicing burdens remain low by historical standards. The labor market, which is usually the most important economic driver of consumer credit performance remains strikingly strong, although we have seen some indications of some softening. Now you -- on the other hand, home prices have been falling a little bit. Inflation, I really believe none of us know really the effects of inflation, so we're going to be needing to manage intuitively here. We can't pull out PhDs to figure this one out. But -- so we assume the inflation is going to -- here's an interesting thought on inflation versus unemployment, John. Unemployment affects a small number of people terribly. Inflation affects all of us somewhat. And so from a credit point of view, I believe the reason unemployment has been the biggest driver is that because charge-offs happen at the tail of the distribution and the tail moves when the economy moves, so what is the effect of all of us losing a little bit of our purchasing power. My gut feel is it's just something that is slow in its effect. It's cumulative. It doesn't have the sort of precipitous effects that the unemployment does. But I still believe on little cat feet, there's another metaphor for you, John. I think it will play out. The other one, and it's almost -- I want to go back. I don't have a perfect metaphor for it, but I do want to say, again, I -- I've been around this business long enough to kind of know that extreme effects with respect to credit for a period of time, create the opposite effect on the other side, just -- it does with respect to markets and competition, but that's not even what I'm talking about here. I just -- I believe in life, let's just say there's always a certain percentage of consumers that are living on the edge, they're vulnerable and they don't have much of a buffer to absorb shock. So then when the global financial crisis came along, it was like a tsunami wave coming in and everyone who was -- I feel just so many people that were in a somewhat vulnerable situation got sort of washed over from that, that it was followed by this period where we had trouble keeping up with our own forecast of the losses. We -- in a good way in the sense that we finally said, this is the survivorship effect. The Great Recession accelerated so many charge-offs that at some point were statistically probably going to happen that we had a survivorship effect going on that anybody can survive that probably not charging off anytime soon, and that's why you sort of had there for the reverse of that effect. And I believe intuitively, I have no way to prove it and we'll never be able to quantify it, but just intuitively thinking about it when there were still vulnerable people all during the period of the pandemic, so many of them got lifelines that I think you can -- it doesn't mean there are lives necessarily changed. And I think you have sort of the reverse survivorship effect or maybe the sort of the catching-up effect from very, very low losses. And this is something that I believe is a real effect. And so if I pull up, I think the consumer is in a great shape. You're going to have sort of on little cat feet, the inflation effect and the catching-up effect and then you have a wildcard of a quite uncertain economy that creates greater volatility than usual in terms of where things might go. But in the context of all of that, and the opportunities we see -- one of the things -- sorry, it's a long answer to your question. But one of the things that you may remember my saying back when the credit was just unsustainably good a couple of years ago. I remember saying that there will be real consequences in the competitive marketplace if this abnormal environment continues for too low. And we really already saw it happen in the period of the extraordinary credit. What you saw is a tremendous inflow of FinTechs, you saw a huge expansion of credit, primarily in the subprime and even below sort of where we play in that space. We were worried that the underwriting that any of them were doing would be -- it's based on data, would definitionally not have a rear view, it would have a rearview mirror that is extremely unreliable. So I think when I would pull back this sort of great normalization that's happening even with some cat feet effects that are still probably going to play out is a very healthy thing to happen in terms of credit environment, competitive environments in the marketplace over time. So all in all, I feel really good about where we are. And if you detect optimism in my voice, you're getting the right read there. Operator : Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Almost to piggyback on that last question a little bit. There have been a lot of new card issuers and types of cards and payment types like P2P, debit rewards, FedNow is coming out. Could you talk about the evolving of both debit and credit card space? And how you expect the competition and offerings could change over time, not just versus, let's say, Discover Synchrony or American Express, but other payment types and how Capital One is positioned as payment preferences among consumers might change. Richard Fairbank : Yes. Well, the -- we've seen a lot of innovation over the last number of years. I'd add one to your list, one that really was quite a made quite a flash, which is buy-now pay-later that came into the marketplace. Let me really sort of start with that one. With buy-now pay-later came out, I remember having sort of saying this is kind of ironic because the original and still extraordinary buy-now pay-later product is called the credit card. So what is this new one that says, you can buy-now and pay-later. But anyway, it was riding on the back of some very, very clever technology sort of modern tech stacks and really good merchant relationships that made quite an impact on there. Now it was hailed as a revolution in payments from everything that we saw early on. I think it was, by the way, a very clever payment -- a very clever innovation, but it turned out to be more of a credit access play than necessarily. I'm not saying it isn't a revolution.  Well, I'm saying that when we look at who flop there, it was a credit from looking at our bank customers and card customers, everything else, it was a credit access play and I think it's running into some challenges with respect to merchant discount rates and some credit challenges and other things, but it was certainly quite innovation. If you look at debit cards, anyone innovating in the debit card space that has access to the differential interchange that came from the law that created, tried to advantage smaller players versus bigger and networks other than -- well, different choices for different networks and different sized players. Anyone who has the fortune to ride on the back of that. I think that's a promising opportunity for them. And so payments -- the payment space will continue to evolve. One other thing about payments that when you look pull way up and say in what areas have FinTechs or major tech companies have the biggest impact on banking. It was -- we, of course, worried that all aspects of banking would get affected. But the biggest -- I think the biggest single area that has really been impacted is payments itself which -- when you think about it, that it's kind of the holy grail from a tech company's point of view because it's where the money is, and it's a real-time kind of customer experience activity. And importantly, it's not heavily regulated. For what it's worth the other play that I think the tech companies enduringly have had the greatest impact is in the platforms space, either payments platforms or other kind of platforms, building on modern tech stack. So those are some thoughts in the marketplace. But -- so just a reminder, Capital One has got to stay on the forefront of innovation or we can be yesterday's news. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I've got some follow-up questions for Andrew and some of the comments. Maybe just first on the 11 basis points drag from the excess cash. Does that persist over the course of the year? Or does that go away at some point? Andrew Young : Well, as I said in my talking points, Sanjay, I think that is something that we do expect to remain at least elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. So yes, I would -- that's probably where I would leave that. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And then secondly, just the comments on capital levels and capital return. Should we assume like you're going to maintain CET1 inclusive of sort of AOCI or work your way up to that level and then consider any moves with capital return? Or maybe you can just help us think through how we should read into some of your comments there. And then -- at what rate does AOCI accrete over the course of the year? Just would love to get some color on that. Andrew Young : Yes. Why don't I start with the second one first, which is -- if you look at our AFS AOCI, about 40% of that will pull to par between now and the end of '24. In terms of capital targets, I absolutely would not say it's a mechanical linkage that we are thinking about our capital targets inclusive of AOCI. There's a lot of uncertainty of regulatory treatment. It is not included in our regulatory ratios at this point. I just referenced that, that is one thing that we look at in addition to a number of other factors inclusive of just economic uncertainty and our growth opportunities. And so for now, we've been operating above our target. We're going to keep an eye on those things. And as we have more certainty of the future, we have a lot of flexibility with how we return capital to shareholders, if that's appropriate. Operator : Our final question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the net interest margin front, I wanted to see if you could possibly give us some color on how you see the margin trajectory here from the 660 level just given what you said about cash balances likely to remain elevated? And then maybe how deposit pricing plays into that and how you're thinking about through cycle deposit beta at this point. Andrew Young : Well, I'll go in reverse order on that one, too, because the beta will feed into the NIM response there. I'll remind you of my comments from a quarter ago, where I talked about cumulative deposit beta for the overall company could be somewhat higher than the last rate cycle, which was 41%. I think a quarter ago, our cumulative beta was in the mid-30s, where we sit today, it's 44. It is hard to predict how much further deposit betas will increase from here. There's a number of unique factors, especially following the events of the last month that makes predicting betas a challenge. Everything from product mix to the market in competitive pricing, if there's really intense competition from more insured deposits and just the sheer magnitude and pace of Fed fund hikes is unprecedented and what happens to on the other side when the Fed eventually starts lowering rates, and all of this is happening in the context of a Fed that's executing QT. So where we go from here is going to be impacted by a number of factors, customers' appetite for different deposit products, our focus on customer relationships, industry competition, funding needs. But I will say, given deposit pricing tends to lag asset yield resets. I wouldn't be surprised if there's at least some upward pressure on beta from where we were in the first quarter. So as I then pull that into thinking about NIM over time, that is likely a potential headwind for us, particularly in the near term given the lag of deposit pricing, where wholesale funding costs go could also be a headwind. And as credit continues to normalize, we could continue to see revenue suppression.  So those are a few things that will potentially provide a headwind to NIM from where we sit today. But on the other hand, there's definitely some tailwinds even though my response to Sanjay's question in the real near term, I would think our average cash position will stay elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels, not necessarily relative to what we saw in the first quarter. But over a longer period of time, that will almost assuredly come back down and eventually be a tailwind for NIM. We also could see a growing percentage of revolving card balances and in the immediate term, keep in mind, we'll have one more day in the second quarter. So I know that that's a lot of headwinds and tailwinds, but just wanted to give you a sense of all of the forces that play there. John Pancari : That's very helpful. And then just secondly, we've seen some headlines regarding the Walmart partnership. And I don't know if you can provide a little bit of color there and where that stands, maybe can you confirm the discussions, the timing of when any change could be? And then lastly, if you can update us on any other upcoming negotiations or maturities of other types of partnerships on that front? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thank you, John. So -- we are, of course, in the middle of litigation. So there's only so much -- I'm going to share in an earnings call about the various legal arguments being made by each side. But at a high level, Walmart has sued us trying to terminate the deal early, and we deny that they have a contractual right to an early termination. Walmart points to some service failures that we cured in 2022 and which had no impact on the value of the portfolio. Now in the meantime, we are committed to meeting our contractual commitments while we defend ourselves in court. And we will keep you updated on the litigation in our periodic SEC filings.  With respect to timing of any potential impacts there are a lot of unknowns. There's the -- of course, the question of whether Walmart will win their litigation seeking early termination. And if so, when that will occur. We, of course, deny that they have a right to terminate early. Then there's a question of how long it will take for Walmart to transfer the portfolio to a new issue. We currently expect that the transfer of the Walmart portfolio to a new issuer would occur no earlier than January 2025, even if they win their litigation. So we will keep you updated if our timing expectation changes. Jeff Norris : Well, that concludes the earnings call for this evening. Thank you for joining us on this conference call, and thank you for your interest in Capital One. The IR team will be here later this evening to answer any questions that may remain. Have a good night, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

In the second quarter, Capital One earned $1.4 billion or $3.52 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4.2 billion were up 7% compared to the first quarter and 16% compared to the year ago quarter. Both period end and average loans held for investment increased 1% relative to the prior quarter, driven by growth in our Domestic Card business. Period-end deposits declined 2% in the quarter, largely driven by tax-related outflows. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits grew 1% to end the quarter at 79% of total deposits. We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% driven by noninterest income. Noninterest expense decreased 3% in the quarter driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses. Provision expense was $2.5 billion, with $2.2 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $318 million. Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $318 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $14.6 billion as of June 30. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.7%, up 6 basis points from the prior quarter. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $544 million, increasing our coverage ratio by 12 basis points to 7.78%. Three factors impacted the allowance in the quarter. The predominant factor was growth as ending domestic card loans grew about $5 billion in the quarter. The second factor was the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the second quarter of 2023 and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the second quarter of 2024 as part of our 12-month reasonable and supportable period. These 2 factors were partially offset by an improvement in our economic outlook, which still assumes a worsening from today's level. but less so than our outlook a quarter ago. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $20 million, mostly driven by the decline in loans. The coverage ratio was essentially flat at 2.83%. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance decreased by $218 million. In the quarter, we moved approximately $900 million of loans from our commercial office portfolio to held for sale as we pursue the potential sale of a portion of the portfolio to reduce future risk. With that move, we recognized charge-offs that were already largely reflected in our allowance, which was the primary factor driving this quarter's decrease. The decrease in allowance from moving these loans to HFS was partially offset by a build for our remaining commercial office portfolio. We have provided additional details on our Commercial Office portfolio in the appendix of tonight's presentation. The coverage ratio in the Commercial business decreased by 20 basis points and now stands at 1.62%. Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 150%, up from 148% last quarter and 144% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased by about $9 billion to $118 billion, driven by modest declines in both cash and the investment portfolio. Our cash position ended the quarter at $42 billion, down about $5 billion from the prior quarter. We are also disclosing our net stable funding ratio for the first time this quarter. The preliminary average quarterly NSFR for both the first and second quarters was 134%, well above the 100% regulatory minimum. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.48%, 12 basis points lower than last quarter, and 6 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline in NIM was driven by deposit and wholesale funding costs increasing more than asset yields. That impact was partially offset by a continued mix shift towards card loans and 1 additional day in the quarter. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.7%, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was partially offset by changes in risk-weighted assets, common and preferred dividends and the $150 million of share repurchases we completed in the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, the unrealized losses in AOCI from our AFS investment portfolio were $7.6 billion. If we were to include the full impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital, our CET1 ratio would have ended the quarter at 10.4%. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement, which will be effective on October 1 of this year, is 4.8%, resulting in a total Fed capital requirement of 9.3%. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. The Domestic Card business posted another quarter of strong year-over-year top line growth. Purchase volume for the second quarter was up 7% from the second quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $21 billion or about 18% year-over-year. And second quarter revenue was also up 18% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 40 basis points from the prior year quarter and remained strong at 17.76%. The decline was driven by 2 factors : first, loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter. This dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin. And second, charge-offs increased, so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue. These factors were partially offset by an increase in the revolve rate. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was up 212 basis points year-over-year to 4.38%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 139 basis points from the prior year to 3.74% and is now above its June 2019 level. The charge-off rate hasn't quite caught up yet but based on what we see in our delinquencies, we expect the monthly charge-off rate will reach 2019 levels in the third quarter. Noninterest expense was up 8% from the second quarter of 2022, driven by higher operating expense, partially offset by a modest year-over-year decline in marketing. Total company marketing expense was down about 12% year-over-year in the second quarter to $886 million. In most years, marketing is lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half. In 2022, that pattern was less pronounced. In 2023, our marketing is following a more typical historical pattern. Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing, and we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our Domestic Card franchise. And as always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in Domestic Card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business, and strong momentum in our decade-long focus on building a franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. Slide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the second quarter, auto originations declined 31% year-over-year. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking ending loans decreased about $4.3 billion or 5% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 1%. We posted another quarter of strong year-over-year retail deposit growth. Second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $30 billion or 12% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were down about 2%, largely as a result of typical seasonal tax outflows. Average deposits were up 12% year-over-year and up 2% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results. Consumer Banking revenue was up 8% year-over-year driven by deposit growth. Noninterest expense was down about 4% compared to the second quarter of 2022 driven by the timing of marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.40%, up 79 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.38%, up 91 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 13 basis points while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 38 basis points. Slide 13 shows second quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were down 2%. Average loans were down 1%. The decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as the movement of loans to held for sale that Andrew discussed. Ending deposits were down 4% from the linked quarter. Average deposits declined 5%. We saw normal outflows throughout the second quarter as clients use their cash for payroll, tax payments and other business-as-usual disbursements. And consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters, we also continued to manage down selective, less attractive commercial deposit balances. Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the linked quarter while noninterest expense was down about 9% from the linked quarter. Second quarter commercial credit trends were largely driven by the Commercial Office portfolio, inclusive of the movement of loans to held for sale. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate increased to 1.62% in the second quarter. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.73%, down 58 basis points compared to the linked quarter and the criticized nonperforming loan rate increased 10 basis points to 0.89%. In closing, we continued to deliver top line growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the second quarter. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient Domestic Card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities and build our franchise and to drive growth in our national digital bank. And we continue to expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. Pulling way up, Capital One is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital. Our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our business. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale and our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. Our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, put us in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session [Operator Instructions]. Amy, please start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Maybe to start on the margin, Andrew, where we saw some pressure. Can you maybe just talk about how to think about the margin from here? You talked about card loan run faster, which is a tailwind. But there's obviously -- rising deposit cost has been headwind. So when you put it all together, what do you see the trajectory of the margin shaking out? And embedded within that, what are your most updated expectations for deposit betas at this point? And I have a follow-up question. Andrew Young : Sure. So why don't I start with the deposit beta speech Ryan, since that will feed into the NIM. As we talked about last quarter and you see playing out in the marketplace at this point, there's just a number of factors that are impacting beta between product mix and the competitive dynamics on pricing, just how quickly the Fed has moved over the last 5 quarters. All of this happening under the backdrop of QT. And so we put that on top of our view for deposits all of the needs that we have, our desire to grow customer relationships and the like. And so those forces, coupled with the fact that at this point in the cycle, deposit pricing just tends to lag yields. And so you've seen our betas continue to rise over the last few quarters. I talked about the last cycle us being in the low 40s. And a quarter ago, I said you should expect us to kind of move up from where we were. We are now in the 52% range. I wouldn't be surprised if there continues to be upward pressure on beta from here given all of the factors that I just described. So why don't I then start on your question about NIM with headwinds That, of course, would be one, the beta lag as well as what we're seeing in the wholesale funding market, spreads are a little bit wider. So just overall funding costs, I think, would probably be a headwind. And then we're also seeing credit continue to normalize. Rich touched in his talking points around card margin. So revenue suppression would be another headwind, all else equal. But we do see at least a few tailwinds, one being the level of revolve rate in card in the second quarter tends to be seasonally lower. And just on a longer-term basis, the current run rate has been lower over the last couple of years. So both of those factors could be driving card margin up. I also think that when you look at our cash position, cash is likely to remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. This quarter, we saw ending cash come down. Average cash was largely flat since we had built up, cash over the course of the first quarter. But I think you should expect that cash will remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic but over time, it probably will come down at least modestly from here. And then the last thing is in the back half of the year, we'll have an extra day in the quarter. So as we move into Q3, that will be a definitive tailwind. So those are what I would enumerate as the primary forces at play. And so one of the big ones that's going to drive the trajectory is really what ends up happening to beta. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then Rich, maybe as my follow-up, maybe just an update on what you're seeing with the consumer. When I look in the credit -- in the card book, delinquencies in the past 4 months have been rising, let's call it, 130, 140 basis points per year. And given all the growth that has come on to the books in the past 24 months, can you give us a sense for how to think about how far past 2024 level -- 2019 levels, we could be going on losses and maybe, Andrew tie in, what this all can mean for the allowance over time? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So just to put some numbers behind your comments. So the Domestic Card delinquencies in the second quarter were about 10% higher than the same quarter of 2019. Our charge-offs are still a bit below their 2019 levels. But based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think they'll get back there in the next few months. So when you interpret our credit metrics, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. There is one effect that is increasing our loss rate that is probably more pronounced for Capital One, at least for a time, which is related to our recovery. Past charge-offs are the raw material for future recoveries and we just lived through 3 years of very low charge-offs. So our recoveries will be unusually low in the short to medium term. This is a larger headwind for us than for most others because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work our own recoveries, so they tend to come in over time, not all at once, which happens in a debt sale. Also, we have to remember that the credit performance we saw over the past 3 years was unprecedented. So we believe there's some catching up that happens on the other side of that, especially for consumers who might otherwise have charged off over the past 3 years. So we call this sort of the deferred charge-off effect. It's something that really can't be measured. We won't even be able to measure it in hindsight, how big this effect is, but it's intuitively sort of the reverse of the effect we saw in the Global Financial Crisis, which in many ways, just pulled forward charge-offs for lots of folks that were in a vulnerable position. And then what we saw in the aftermath of that for those that -- and weathered that, we just saw strikingly low charge-offs. So I think really what -- kind of what's going on with this whole sort of normalization in the context of such extraordinarily low unemployment rates, I think an important part here is sort of this deferred charge-off effect. And so that's the dynamic we see going on in our business. We continue to feel very good about the credit performance. We're not giving guidance on predicting the level, but we continue to lean into our growth opportunities because the metrics we see are very solid. Andrew Young : And then with respect to the allowance, Ryan, I know I've talked a lot about the mechanics in recent calls, so I'll spare all of you the tutorial. But the first thing with respect to the allowance will obviously be allowing for future growth is an obvious contributor to where the allowance goes from here. But then it's really all about the outlook for losses and in particular, what we're projecting for loss rates a year out. So Rich just described a lot of the dynamics that are at play with our outlook for [ client ] losses. So depending on how all those factors play out, that's really going to have the biggest impact, especially as you look out well into '24. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : Rich, I would describe that I think one of the hallmarks of Capital One over the decades as almost a strategic optimism. When you look at opportunities right now and where your peers are deploying capital, where is your greatest strategic optimism? Richard Fairbank : My greatest strategic optimism, Richard, is in the card business. We've -- first of all, we've always been a big fan of the card business starting from the beginning of the company. It's not an accident that we chose the card business because we love the industry structure. We love the opportunity to leverage kind of strategies that we wanted to put in place, the information-based, technology-based strategies. And while that is something one can apply across all of financial services, it certainly has tremendous leverage in a business like the card business. So we've always loved the business. As you know, kind of, you've followed us for a long time, Richard, we -- just because we love a business, doesn't mean we constantly have our foot on the accelerator. So we very much look at the industry structure and then look at the marketplace and make our choices. We -- often, we end up zigging while others zag, as you have seen in the past. We feel very good about the opportunities in the card business for several reasons. I think, well, first of all, just the health of the consumer, just consumer credit is in a very good place. The consumer is in an exceptionally strong place. And I think that gives a foundation of strength even in the context of an economy that's got some concerning aspects to it. Then we look at the competitive environment, I think the competition is intense in card, but it is rational. We see people making credit choices. And just when we look at the competition, and this isn't always true in banking, but I think we see a rational industry making rational choices. And so I think the credit that is being delivered to the consumer is balance to the appetite, and so we feel good about the competitive environment. We look at margins and where they are. They are strong. The credit environment, as we talked about in my answer to Ryan Nash, credit losses are increasing. I think there's a catch-up sort of delayed charge-off effect. But when we look at the metrics, the metrics on recent originations, the metrics on our back book with respect to performance of existing accounts, credit line increases, we just see strength across the board. So we feel very good about that and we look at our marketing programs, and they continue to generate a lot of new accounts. And so pulling way up on that, we like the metrics, we like the results of our programs, and we like the marketplace in credit. And if I cross-calibrate to other parts of the marketplace. The auto business, even while we've been leaning into card, we have been -- had more of our foot on the brake over the last 18 months in the auto business for a number of factors, but probably the biggest one being what was happening on the pricing side and the difficulty in passing through increases in cost of funds. That aspect has normalized mostly in the market. The auto business has still some unique aspects to it that we got to keep an eye on used car prices, and they've been elevated. They're likely to fall over time. And so -- but all in all, we see opportunity maybe expanding a little bit in the auto space, but we'll have to keep an eye on that. But in the very recent sort of months, we've seen the opportunity to lean in a little bit more. And then on the commercial side of the business, obviously, our biggest focus has been on the office portfolio and Capital One, again, tends to take a different path than a lot of companies do. But we -- I think for a lot of banks, they tend to -- when they look at the credit environment when they see credit that is worsening in a particular sector, they tend to pull back on originations, which makes a lot of sense. We often see one more notch on the continuum, which is to look at the assets that we have and look from time to time at, in fact, selling those. We have -- over the last few years, we have actually unloaded something like -- this is -- well, something like $6 billion of loans. That's not an official -- Andrew is the one who gives the precise numbers. What I'm saying is several billion dollars of sort of exiting that we have done. Now in this particular case, we look at the market and see a lot of sustained stress in that market and feel that when we have an opportunity to relieve some of the higher stress aspects of that business, we took that opportunity. So pulling way up, you see at Capital One, we -- for some of our business, we have our foot on the brake and for other parts of the company, our foot is on the gas. But where I would leave you, the net impression I would lead you it is really on the card side, that we're really leaning in the hardest. Operator : Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : I wanted to start maybe with expenses. It has come in a little bit better than I think what we were expecting, they were down quarter-over-quarter. You mentioned -- you talked a little bit about returning to normal in your prepared remarks. And I was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. Was there a decision like to slow down on growth investments, pullback? Like, I guess, what changed just in terms of the expenses or the cadence of expenses through the year? Andrew Young : Typically, Mihir, I'll take that one if you're talking just Q1 to Q2. In the first quarter, we typically have seasonal effects to compensation when bonuses are paid, payroll tax issues. You see that in the ST&B, Salary Tax and Benefit line there. So that's really the largest single factor, not necessarily a fundamental shift in any trajectory. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. And then maybe just going back to the NIM conversation. I think you talked about some of the puts and takes in the near term. But I was curious just about company-wide NIM or compared to historical, right, I mean, it wasn't atypical for Capital One's NIM to be closer to 7%, high 6s. Do you expect you'll get back there? Or have something fundamentally changed in the business, whether it's the growth in the high balance transactors or something else where you wouldn't get back there? Andrew Young : Well, I don't think there's anything fundamentally different in the business, Mihir. I think there's a lot of question around what happens to consumer behavior when we talked about revolve rate in card and other things. And then also on the funding side, partially dependent on what the Fed ends up doing over an extended period of time where rates eventually settle out. I think those are all factors that could ultimately impact where the final resting place is for NIM, but there's nothing that is really fundamentally different across our book from where it was years ago. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So I know, Rich, you mentioned marketing following the typical seasonality this year, and still expecting it to ramp up in the back half, which makes a lot of sense. And I'm just wondering, when you think about where you want to spend those dollars, is it more on new account acquisition, spurring outstanding loan utilization, is travel a relatively easier one to pull at this stage? And I guess what I'm just wondering is, is there an opportunity to even get more return for your marketing dollars now versus maybe what you've had over the past couple of quarters given the need for people to borrow perhaps more than they had to a year ago? So just those are some of the questions that I had. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Betsy. Let me talk about the marketing, yes, thanks for commenting about the seasonality. I mean every year is different in terms of the quarterly patterns. But we pointed out this year is, it seems like a more normal year with the back half, with the more common back half, higher back half than we've had in some of the anomalous times during the pandemic. The marketing was flat compared -- in this quarter, was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 12% year-over-year. But I wouldn't draw really strong conclusions from that because as I already talked about, we're leaning into the marketing. It's just from a timing point of view of some of our marketing, it was just didn't happen to fall as much in this quarter. And let me talk about the opportunities that we see and why we're investing heavily in marketing, really, first of all, we just see attractive growth opportunities across our business. Particularly in the card business, we've continued to expand our products and our marketing channels. We're seeing very good traction. These opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology transformation that enabled us to leverage more data, access more channels, leverage machine learning models and provide customized solutions that continues to just generate very good performance, and we're leaning in to capitalize on that. So sort of category one is just the good opportunities that we see. The second thing that's behind our marketing levels is something we've been talking about for a long time, which is our ongoing focus on heavy spenders. And it was really back in 2010 that we declared a strategic push for heavy spenders. And we knew in looking at the business that, that's not a thing that we can go lean in one year, pull back another year. This is a whole part of the marketplace, which is about commitment. It's about building exceptional experiences, great products and the brand. So starting really with the venture launch way back in 2010, we've been leaning in hard there. But of course, it hasn't just been about flagship cards. It's been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and investing across really the digital experience, the servicing experience, the lifestyle and product experiences as well. And what's been nice about this is that we've and you've seen in our purchase volume growth, a lot of growth of purchase volume, but another strong manifestation of this is the rate of growth year after year has been higher at the higher end than the average. So we continue to get increased traction going up and up in the pursuit of heavy spenders. Now, of course, heavy spenders have much higher upfront cost of marketing, promotions, brand building. And hence, it's a big factor in why the marketing levels at Capital One, if you compare back to many years ago, they're sort of structurally higher but that's in pursuit of this really, I think, company transforming benefits that we're getting there. A third factor driving our marketing levels, Betsy, is our continuing investment in building our national retail bank. As you know, we have only a modest presence in terms of physical distribution. And so to get there, we lean heavily on our modern technology and a compelling digital experience and along with that, a sustained investment in marketing. So that's a bit about what's behind our marketing levels that you're seeing and the opportunities we see. And if we really look across those 3 sort of buckets, just the growth opportunities we see, the opportunities in building the heavy spender franchise and then the building of the national bank being sort of the one bank that's building a full-service bank without trying to do it via a branch on every corner, all of this marketing is the engine behind this, and we continue to lean into it and be very pleased with the performance. Betsy Graseck : And its growth rate expectations should be following similar patterns to the pre-COVID environment? Richard Fairbank : Well, let me comment for a second. Well, let me first say, we're not really giving growth outlook. The thing I really want to say about marketing is marketing drives the origination of accounts. The real growth of our card business comes really from balanced growth and also from purchase volume growth, of course. But those are not one-for-one things. But what we have been focused on since the founding of the company is building a company that has an organic growth engine focused on originations and leveraging the technology and analytical capabilities that we built. And so our -- when you see our leaning in hard to marketing. Think about that is the engine that's driving new accounts. And over time, those accounts really are, to your point, even though the timing is not one-for-one, those accounts are really the foundation for the continued outstandings and revenue growth of the company. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Andrew, I hate to do this, but I want to go back to the allowance coverage trends going forward. If we zoom into that complex calculation of removing previous and adding future quarters of net charge-offs. In your current forecast, do you have losses sort of rising through the end of next year? And maybe you could just touch on the new macro baseline and what the unemployment rate assumption is? Andrew Young : Yes. So the baseline assumption and our outlook focusing, I imagine you're looking mostly for unemployment rate. So we have it increasing from the 3.6% it is today to 4.3% at the end of this year and then moving higher in the 4s, but staying in the 4s through 2024. That compares to our assumption last quarter of, I believe, it was 5.1%. But remember that our models tend to use the change in unemployment rates or the rate of job creation, which we're forecasting to come down to nearly 0, rather than the level of unemployment. And so it's not just about those factors, too, in our allowance. We're also considering downside scenarios that are much more severe than that baseline. So when you take that into account to your first question around what are we assuming, I'm not going to give specific forecast. Rich listed out kind of the factors that we believe will create upward pressure on our loss rates in the near term, at least. And so we did assume that there's higher losses in the second quarter of next year than the quarter that we just left sort of mechanically, as I described this quarter's allowance. But where that goes from here is just so heavily assumption-laden focused on the back half of the year, I'd really focus your attention much more to delinquencies as the leading indicator to charge-offs, especially in the near term because that's where the economics ultimately are felt as opposed to the allowance that is going to move quarter-to-quarter based on assumptions looking many quarters into the future. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Rich, I asked this question to one of your competitors earlier. But can you just pinpoint what's exactly attractive about the growth you're seeing in card today versus in the past? They are also growing at a pretty rapid rate. And obviously, you guys have been very successful at growing this business over time, but the market remains competitive. You talked about the credit normalization. There's obviously a potential for economic challenges. I'm just trying to think through the risks. Richard Fairbank : So Sanjay, there certainly are things to be worried about. The economy is unusual and has aspects of a lot of strength and a lot of concern. The credit normalization, we all see it. And so I'm going to make the worry case just slightly here for a second, the credit normalization has -- credit is still at very attractive levels, but it still has an upward slope to it, and nobody -- well, we certainly don't feel in a position to predict exactly where that settles out. And so we'll have to keep that very much front and center. And the market is very competitive, absolutely. So at a time like this, we -- so -- well, on the strong side, I start with the health of the consumer. So let's just think about this because the U.S. consumer is a real source of relative strength in this uncertain economy. The labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year. And there are signs of cooling, but so far, they're playing out gradually without abrupt or severe job losses that we see in severe downturns. Another striking thing, the debt servicing burdens remain low by historical standards despite rising interest rates. Home prices have started to tick back up after falling for a while and we've talked a lot about consumers and their excess savings that they built up through the pandemic. And they still have some excess savings, although that buffer is shrinking. And for many consumers, I think it's been fully consumed by higher prices. The big negative, back to negatives, the big negative out there has been inflation and real wages have been pushed down since really over the last couple of years and consumer confidence, that's been pretty shaky. But on the whole, I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape. So then we also believe when the -- we have believed for quite a while, you remember in our conversations, even as the losses are rising these days, because we do believe that the deferred charge-off phenomenon is something that is very natural to occur, we're not alarmed to buy where losses are going. Then we look at our own metrics and if we -- obviously, we've talked about delinquencies. We've talked about charge-offs. We also look at payment rates and revolve rates. And I just want to make a comment about payment rates. I'm struck by the strength in payment rates. Throughout the course of the pandemic, payment rates increase, not only for us but across the industry. And more recently, very naturally, payment rates have drifted down from pandemic highs but -- and you can see in our trust metrics, the pretty whopping payment rates that's still there. I guess what I'm struck by is that payment rates not only overall for Capital One, which could definitely has a mix shift toward heavy spenders as potentially driving that. But even when we look by segment, we're struck by the continuing relative strength in payment rates. So that's a good guy. And probably the biggest factor that we look at is the recent originations, the vintage curve performance. And the overall level of risk that we're seeing so far in our new originations is consistent with -- certainly consistent with our expectations, but also on a comparative basis. When we look at the earliest delinquencies on our newest monthly vintages of originations, we see performance that is consistent with pre-pandemic risk levels in each of our major segments. And vintage over vintage, we're also seeing relatively stable risk levels over time. Now one thing I want to say, and Sanjay, you remember, we've talked about this. There's 2 ways you can -- this can happen. One is the sort of unmanaged and the other is the managed way. My favorite way is when vintage performance with the same credit policies as several years ago, when that is on top of the old things, the old originations from years ago, that's actually not the case on what we call a like-for-like basis. The recent originations have worse credit than they had years ago. Again, not surprising at all to us. We all along the way, have been managing reactively and proactively around the edges where we either see or would expect maybe performance to be not as good. And the -- and so we have trimmed around the edges in our originations. And so on a net basis, it is sort of just happens to be that originations these days are on top of where they were several years ago. So pulling way up and based on, for me, more than 3 decades of experience of doing this in the card business, the opportunities that we see and enhanced by a lot of technology innovations and things like that, we see it as a good time to keep leaning in. We have a very watchful eye on all those negatives that you and I talked about. But on a calibration basis, I would -- I like the opportunity. I just want to say one more thing, which you are right. A lot of times, we have leaned in when others are pulling back. As a general observation, most of the industry is leaning in. That gets our attention. It's not as sustainable often when that's the case. So we're going to watch it carefully. But that gave you a little window into how we're looking at this and the optimism that we feel at this moment. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : Yes. Rich, can you talk about what you're seeing on credit card spend growth rates recently in terms of the like-for-like account basis, I know it was sort of flat to down last quarter. And do you think that we'll continue to see moderation? Richard Fairbank : So let's pull up, first of all, our Domestic Card purchase volume was up 7% year-over-year. But that's -- to your question, Don, that's really powered by the growth in our customer base. When you look at spend per customer, this has moderated and is now generally flat from a year ago. And the moderation in spending appears to be broad-based. We've observed it across income bands and card segments. We've also seen it across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. By the way, it's not surprising at all that this would sort of level out. The consumer pulled way back in the pandemic, just an unprecedented amount of pullback and now -- and sort of has come roaring back on the other side. But I think for the individual customer, things are sort of settling out. So I think when we ask what would we wish for, I think this is a sensible -- like so often, I always say that's the most sensible constituency in all of the marketplace tends to yet again be the consumer. But overall, we think that spend moderation is the sign of a rational and healthy behavior on the part of the consumer. And then we match it with the payment rates, and those are, look, those are normalizing somewhat. The revolve rates are normalizing somewhat, but both the payment rate and the revolve rates on a segment-by-segment basis are still not there. They're not at the pre-pandemic levels yet, which indicates an underlying strength, at least on average, even when maybe at the margin, you're seeing some of these deferred charge-offs that are driving up credit losses. Operator : Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Our last question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Rich, I was just thinking about turns in the credit cycle. What are some of the mistakes that you think card issuers make and even lenders in general? And where do you look for the weakness in the overall space of lending to give you caution when you start to see that turns in the credit cycle? And I also have a follow-up. Richard Fairbank : So yes, it's -- I really appreciate the question, Dominick, because I've often said, we're not in a position, I wouldn't have any of you put any more stock or stake. I guess you investors put stock in, but I wouldn't put any particular stake in our ability to predict the economy. But the credit cycle and the economy are not the same thing. They're correlated, but I think that the credit cycle is the thing that we really focus a lot on because I think a lot of elements of it are pretty predictable. Obviously, it is influenced by and influences the economy. So let's sort of pull way up. We were in this extraordinary period no one has ever seen before in terms of the credit quality during the pandemic. And we enjoyed and our investors enjoyed the high returns that we made in that time. But some of you may remember my saying, be careful what you wish for, because with every passing month that this cycle is abnormally good, we will pay the price later on the other side of that causally because what -- and so if you get into the behavior, and it really links not so much at all to the behavior of consumers, it's really about kind of to your question, what happens to lenders, providers of credit in -- at this part of the cycle, especially in an extreme thing. And we saw alarming things happening during the most extreme periods during the pandemic. The most striking one to me was the absolute surge in FinTech lending, how much of it there was, who knows, because most of them aren't reporting to the credit bureaus so it's just a matter of trying to infer what's going on. But -- so there was a big surge in supply, particularly to subprime, which is where almost all FinTechs go after. And that was alarming to us. And we felt with every month that, that supply keeps coming, as I said earlier, there's a price to be paid. Then you look -- then we look at the context of overlay on top of that, the -- to your question about the common mistakes, what the FinTechs almost by definition were doing because I'm not sure what else they would do, is they were leveraging technology building models in a lot of cases, but the rearview mirror that they were looking into the data set their models had were the greatest credit economy in the history of lending. So that's a dangerous kind of data set for the models. It was exacerbated by credit scores that had drifted dramatically more, a lot of subprime customers moving into prime just by sort of the way scoring works and what was happening as a result of the savings rates going up for consumers. So the -- so with FinTechs, particularly but for all the players in the business, the danger of the rearview mirror, the danger of the misreading the credit risk of customers because they were artificially, their scores would be artificially good. By the way, in our case, we pretty much just intervened in our own modeling and created a way to assume worse than the data says. We also, in our case, put heavy reliance on data and modeling from way back in the last few decades that allows us to sort of get past that. So that -- it's primarily the overexuberance of lenders in the environment of a combination of a great rearview mirror and frankly, a lot of extra earnings, and feeling the ability to deploy a bunch of that into marketing. Now what's happened since then? I think this sort of great normalization has been a very healthy thing. It would be shocking if it didn't happen. But from a health of the industry point of view, I think it's a very good thing. Obviously, the FinTechs -- FinTech lending has gone way. Most of it is retreated significantly. I am struck -- my earlier comment as we watch very carefully the credit card industry, I think the major players seem to be pretty rational about the credit choices they make. And now for everybody with charge-offs rising and without leveling necessarily manifesting itself, I think it's bringing back the appropriate cautions in time for a softer landing here than might otherwise have been there. So those are some of the thoughts that we have and those are things to keep an eye on. One other thing that I just sort of seize a moment here on things that are on our mind because I always try -- to my goal here is to always give you a window into how we're thinking and what net impression do I want folks to come away with, as we look at opportunities and a thing that's very much on our mind is the CFPB efforts on late fees. And I just want to just comment on that because that it's a very important thing that's going on. The CFPB late fee proposal effectively reduces late fees by approximately 75%. And the CFPB is going after the fee that we believe is the most important fee in consumer credit business. Late fees provide a direct and clear incentive for customers to pay on time and avoid becoming delinquent and damaging their credit records. And a small late fee may not have that deterrent effect. Late fees are also a way that issuers can partially price for risk, and this enables greater access -- for consumers, greater access to credit and a lower cost of credit on average. A reduction in late fees is almost certain to reduce credit access to certain parts of the population. And the CFPB proposal is, of course, not yet finalized, and it could be subject to delays or changes due to litigation. But we have to plan for the potential of this becoming law early next year. And Capital One has pursued a strategy of offering very simple credit card products with limited fees and complexity. And ironically, the late fee has been an important part of our product structure because of the reasons that I cited earlier. If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our revenue, gradually resolving over time. And there are ways to mitigate the impact, but as a practical matter, those solutions will take several years to work their way through the portfolio. So as we pull up and I share with you how we're thinking of the business, we really like the opportunities in the card marketplace we -- for all the reasons that I've talked about, but we also need to really stare at this proposal that may become the rule of the land and I just wanted to share with you how we're thinking about that. And that's an important focus of Capital One. And our solutions to that will be very focused on finding solutions that are consistent with maintaining a winning customer franchise, and that's a thing that takes time to work its way in. Do you have another question, Dominick, you wanted to ask? Dominick Gabriele : Yeah. Thanks, Rich. I can't agree with you more on the late fee comments as well, especially access to credit, makes perfect sense. This one is not as interesting. I guess I was just looking for some help on the model. When you look at professional fees or professional service expense, it was down pretty big year-over-year while the salaries were maybe a little elevated versus seasonality. I was wondering if you brought some of those folks in-house or how to think about the professional services given that is some of the debt collection piece, I believe. And then was there a gain in the other noninterest income from the sold portfolio? Any help there would be great. And thanks for everything and the comments. Andrew Young : Sure. So I think you've got it right in terms of looking at salaries and benefits in professional services in conjunction with one another as we were making substantial investments in technology we were supplementing that with some third-party resources. We brought that down as we've been able to use our brand -- our recruiting brand to bring incredible talent into the organization. And so it's really looking in some ways at those 2 lines in conjunction with one another to get a sense for the kind of underlying overall labor trend. And then in other noninterest income, no, it's -- well, not specifically a sale, one of the biggest things in that creates some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation is agency income in our commercial business. So it's a little bit lumpy, but we saw some real strength in the quarter, and so that's what drove the quarter-over-quarter increase there. Jeff Norris : Well, that concludes our Q&A session and our call for this evening. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the conference call today, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. The Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer further questions you may have. Have a good night, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew? Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.8 billion, or $4.45 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4.5 billion were up 7% compared to the second quarter and 17% compared to the year ago quarter. Both period end and average loans held for investment increased 1% relative to the prior quarter, driven by growth in our domestic card business. Period end deposits increased 1% in the quarter, while average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits ended the quarter at 80% of total deposits. We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 4%, driven by both higher net interest and noninterest income. Non-interest expense increased 1% in the quarter, as higher marketing expense was partially offset by lower operating expense. Provision expense was $2.3 billion with $2 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $322 million. Turning to Slide 4. I'll cover the allowance balance in greater detail. The $322 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $15 billion as of September 30. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.75%, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. Relative to last quarter's assumptions underlying the allowance, the baseline forecast in this quarter for most key economic variables improved. However, we continue to assume several key economic variables worsened from today's levels. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $349 million. The coverage ratio was largely flat at 7.79%. The predominant driver of the increased allowance was the growth in loans. The positive impact from the modestly improved economic outlook was largely offset by the impact of replacing the lost content of the third quarter of 2023 with a 12-month reasonable and supportable period that now includes the third quarter of 2024. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $136 million. The improved economic outlook and a decline in loan balances drove the release. And in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $97 million. The build reflected the impact of rising interest rates and other factors on certain commercial real estate and corporate borrowers, including our commercial office portfolio. On Slide 17 in the appendix, we have included additional details on the office portfolio. I'll also note that in the third quarter, we completed the sale of approximately $900 million of loans from our commercial office portfolio that were previously marked as held for sale. The commercial -- the coverage ratio in the Commercial business increased by 12 basis points and now stands at 1.74%. Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 155%, up from 150% last quarter and 139% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter were largely flat at $118 billion. Higher cash balances were offset by a decline in the market value of our investment securities portfolio. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $45 billion, up about $3 billion from the prior quarter. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our third quarter net interest margin was 6.69%, 21 basis points higher than last quarter and 11 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by higher card yields, a continued mix shift towards card loans and one additional day in the quarter, partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13%, approximately 30 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets, common and preferred dividends and the share repurchases we completed in the quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows third quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. The domestic card business posted another strong quarter of year-over-year top line growth. Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 6% from the third quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $19 billion or about 16% year-over-year and third quarter revenue was up 15% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 31 basis points from the prior year quarter and remained strong at 18.24%. The decline was driven by two factors : First, loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter. This dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin; and second, charge-offs increased, so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue. These factors were partially offset by an increase in revolve rate. On a linked quarter basis, the revenue margin increased seasonally by 48 basis points. Domestic Card credit results continue to normalize from the historically strong results we saw during the pandemic, consistent with our expectations. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 220 basis points year-over-year to 4.4%. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 134 basis points from the prior year to 4.31%. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was essentially flat and the 30 plus delinquency rate was up 57 basis points. Both the monthly delinquency rate and the monthly charge-off rate are now modestly above 2019 levels. Our delinquencies are the best leading indicator of domestic card credit performance and the pace of delinquency rate normalization is slowing. Non-interest expense was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of '22 -- of 2022. Total company marketing expense of $972 million for the quarter was also relatively flat year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, marketing increased 10%. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation and our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. As a result, we are leaning into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We expect fourth quarter marketing will be seasonally higher. Slide 12 shows third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the third quarter, auto originations declined 10% year-over-year, driven by the decline in auto originations, consumer banking ending loans decreased about $4.4 billion or 5.4% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were essentially flat. We posted another strong quarter in year-over-year retail deposit growth. Third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $34 billion or 13% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 12% year-over-year and up 1% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 7% year-over-year driven by the higher rate paid on deposits and lower auto loan balances and margins. Non-interest expense was down about 6% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our National Digital Bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.77% up 72 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 5.64%, up 79 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was up 37 basis points, while the 30 plus delinquency rate was up 26 basis points, both of these linked quarter increases were better than typical seasonal expectations. Slide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were essentially flat. Average loans were down about 2%. The decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit. Both ending deposits and average deposits were down about 2% from the linked quarter, consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters as we continue to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Third quarter revenue was up 2% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 6%. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate for the third quarter declined 137 basis points from the second quarter to 0.25%. The second quarter charge-off rate was elevated by charge-offs we recognized when we moved the portfolio of commercial office loans to held for sale. We completed the sale of that portfolio in the third quarter. Slide 17 of the third quarter 2023 results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of our total loans. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.08%, up 135 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized nonperforming loan rate was essentially flat at 0.9%. In closing, we continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter. We posted another quarter of strong top line growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume and loans. The pace of domestic card delinquency normalization slowed. We grew consumer and total deposits. And we added liquidity and capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Turning now to operating efficiency. The third quarter operating efficiency ratio was particularly strong. Operating efficiency ratio can vary from quarter-to-quarter, driven by the timing of revenue and operating expense. We expect 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be modestly down compared to 2022. Pulling way up, our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. At our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. We remain well positioned to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thanks, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Amy, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Ryan Nash : Hey. Good evening, everyone. So Rich, you noted several times that delinquency normalization has slowed. It looked like September charge-off performance was better than we would have expected. But we are hearing from others that pressure is becoming broader, not just sub-prime, but it's also into prime. So can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing within your portfolio? What do you think about the pace of delinquency normalization? And do you have any line of sight when you think losses will inevitably peak? Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Ryan. So let's just pull up on the metrics here. Our third quarter domestic card charge-off rate was essentially flat from the prior quarter, up 2 basis points to 4.40%. Our 30 plus delinquency rate increased 57 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.31%. Both our losses and our delinquencies are modestly above their pre-pandemic levels. Now let's talk about sort of what's happening at the margin here. The trend of normalization in our credit metrics appears to be slowing. In August and September, the month-to-month movement in our delinquencies was essentially in line with normal seasonality for the first time since normalization began. We've also seen some stabilization in new delinquency entries, relative to normal seasonal patterns. So we are hopeful these stabilization trends continue. Now charge-offs, of course, are a lagging metric, so they have some months of catching up still to do. In auto, we have seen stabilization even longer. Our losses are modestly above pre-pandemic levels, but moving in line with normal seasonality for the past few quarters. So back to our card business for a moment. There's another stabilization trend that we see as well, which is our recovery rate. Our recovery rate had been falling for several years because of the low level of charge-offs through the pandemic. So we've had less inventory, if you will, to recover on. And this was a larger effect for Capital One than for most of our competitors because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average. And because we tend to work our own recoveries, so they come in overtime and not all at once, like in a debt sale. We've now seen the recovery rates stabilize, although, it remains at unusually low levels. Now recoveries, of course, don't impact our delinquencies, but they are a pretty significant factor when -- in our charge-offs and particularly when comparing our charge-offs to pre-pandemic benchmarks. Now another Capital One's specific point here. There's another factor sort of driving stabilization, but this is -- has been going on for a long time and that's the stability of credit performance in our recent origination vintages. So looking ahead, the economy is, as always a source of uncertainty. In our outlook, we still expect the unemployment rate to worsen over the coming year. And as always, we remain very focused on resilience in our underwriting and making sure that we build resilience, a lot of resilience into all of our choices. Ryan Nash : Maybe, Rich, as my follow-up question, so Andrew, you had highlighted that the domestic card allowance was relatively stable. And I think you gave three different factors. Maybe can you just remind us again what is included from a macro perspective in terms of unemployment? And if I take what Rich said regarding delinquency slowing and obviously, charge-offs are catch up a little bit. Do you think we're at the point where the replacement and the allowance is going to be less of a tailwind -- of a headwind going forward. And we can now finally have allowance more closely following -- the allowance build more closely following the loan growth? Thank you. Andrew Young : Sure, Ryan. So to your economic assumption point, I'll focus on unemployment rate, although recall that a whole lot more is considered a whole bunch more variables, but we are now assuming the unemployment rate moves into the mid-4s by the middle of '24 and basically hold there for a period of time. But it's not just the absolute level of unemployment, as we've talked about before, it's also the change that influences underlying credit performance. How that then plays through the allowance, though, like a number of factors are going into the allowance calculation. As Rich said, the projected loss rates are going to be by far the biggest driver. And as we've talked about many times, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of credit performance, particularly over the next couple of quarters. And I won't go through the reasonable and supportable and reversion process elements that we've discussed previously, but I will say beyond the credit forecast, it is worth noting that the allowance framework considers a range of outcomes and uncertainties, which are generally wider in periods of either worsening or improving transitions. So at the core of your question, even in a period where projected losses in future quarters may be lower than today and might otherwise indicate a release. We could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declined, at least in the near term as we incorporate the related uncertainty into the allowance. And so we'll go through our process as we do every year to take all of those factors into account and roll forward the allowance each quarter. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is open. Mihir Bhatia : Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I was curious in terms of the health of the consumer, I was curious if you're seeing trends at all diverge between higher FICO and lower FICO scores, whether it's on credit performance or spending as we go through the recovery? Richard Fairbank : Yes, Mihir. Thank you for your question. So let's talk about credit performance. When credit first started to normalize, we called out that this trend was more pronounced at the low end of the market, whether defined by income or credit score. And strikingly, those were the segments that had improved the most early in the pandemic. So this was not surprising to us. Later, we observed that normalization was becoming more broad-based. And in fact, for many quarters now -- for several quarters now, every segment was basically normalizing at about the same rate. In other words, if you look at for any segment where its credit metrics were relative to like its delinquencies, for example, relative to pre-pandemic every segment was kind of on top of each other, everything had caught up. Now we are seeing stabilization come more quickly at the lower end of the market. In fact, over the last few months, our delinquencies in these segments have essentially stabilized on a seasonally adjusted basis. And our upmarket segments are sort of just a little bit behind that. So now, I don't think this is necessarily a description of the marketplace per se. This is what we see at Capital One. Our performance has been assisted by some of the underwriting changes that we made over the past couple of years, especially in response to credit to what we anticipated would be the impact of credit scores inflating FinTech's flooding the market. So as we've been talking about really for a couple of years now, we -- in our originations and overall in our credit policy, we were trimming around the edges for things that we saw or risks that we anticipated, and this has contributed, I think, to strength and stability and performance that's now contributing to what we see here. In terms of spend, the spend is basically -- pretty -- when we look at spend per customer, this has really moderated after the surge of spending coming out of the pandemic. So year-over-year, I'm [indiscernible] an overall Capital One point. Year-over-year spend growth per customer has been roughly flat for several months. So the growth in spend that you're seeing in our metrics is really being driven by new account origination. Now with respect to the various segments, the spend on the -- at the lower end of the marketplace is certainly probably the most moderated, although, we -- it moderated first, we've seen spend growth across our segments. Sort of fairly moderated, but I'd say the biggest effect on the moderating side has been in the lower end of the market. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s quite helpful. And then maybe just turning to NIM very quickly. Can you just talk about some of the puts and takes on NIM in the near term, particularly on the deposit competition side. Any thoughts on where deposit betas go? What are you seeing from a competitive standpoint? Thank you. Andrew Young : Yeah. With respect to beta, as we've discussed in previous calls, there's really a couple of key factors that are impacting betas. The first is product mix. Sort of the rotation of customers across products. And then, the second is competitive pricing. And within that, I would include the notion of just deposit pricing lags that we've talked about. And so for us, the quarter-over-quarter beta with that lag effect was something like 160%. Our cumulative beta now stands at $57 million. And so that getting factored into NIM as we look ahead on that dimension, particularly assuming if rates do stay higher for longer, I wouldn't be surprised if there continues to be some upward pressure on beta at least in the near term, driven by those factors that I described, the pricing and product mix piece. So beyond that then, in the NIM, we have seen spreads widen a bit here and wholesale funding costs are up a bit. And I think Rich talked about suppression in card, but depending on the path of credit, there's the potential at least for increased revenue suppression. So I would lump all of those three things together as potential headwinds. But from a tailwind perspective, we can continue to see growth in card and particularly revolving card balances as a percent of the balance sheet like you saw this quarter. And then the other thing that I would note, even though cash balances remain elevated relative to historical standards, I think we will see it settle out at a level that's higher than pre-pandemic, but ultimately lower than where we are today as you look ahead over multiple quarters. So those are really the primary factors that I would say are at play with respect to NIM. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Your line is open. Arren Cyganovich : Yeah. Just touching on the last discussion on net interest margin. The card loan yields expanded, I think, 89 basis points and that was quite a bit higher than the base rate expansion for the quarter. You mentioned higher revolve rates, is that part of what you're seeing there? And how do the revolve rates compare today versus maybe where they were pre-pandemic? Andrew Young : Yeah. So part of it, Arren, is just said, if you're looking at yield as opposed to margin is you get a tailwind just from the Fed rate changes, but the other primary and larger factor than the Fed changes is, I would say, largely seasonality which does -- we typically see revolve rates in the third quarter just naturally be higher than they are throughout the year. And we also tend to see a bit more on the late fee piece there. So there is a seasonality dimension in terms of where we are with revolve rates going forward, I'll let Rich talk a little bit about the trends that we're seeing in the portfolio. Richard Fairbank : Yes, Arren. So overall, in our Domestic Card business, revolve rates are basically where they were. So for example, third quarter 2023 revolve rates right on top of third quarter 2019, but it's very sort of very different within segments. The place that the revolver rate is quite a bit higher is in our partnerships business because we have the Walmart portfolio. We didn't have before the pandemic pretty much everywhere else across our branded book revolve rates are a little bit generally speaking a little bit to quite a bit lower than they were before. But the net impression I would leave with you, so our branded book overall is somewhat lower and the partnerships have offset that. Arren Cyganovich : Got it. And then on the marketing, it looks like it was down just slightly year-over-year, still almost double where it was from a pre-pandemic perspective. Have you essentially hit kind of an -- almost a peak here in terms of marketing dollars and how do you think the expenses will go from there with respect to that? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Well, Arren, the -- on marketing, so just pulling up total company marketing was up 10% compared to the prior quarter and flat year-over-year. let's just pull up and talk about the big drivers of our marketing. First, we continue to really like the opportunities we're seeing in the market. Including additional -- the opportunities that we get in expanding channels and growing the number of card products we have, the benefit from our technology transformation that sort of is everywhere in what we do as we leverage more data. We're able to take advantage of powerful machine learning models, create customized better experiences for consumers. So that continues to have a lot of traction, and we are leaning into that. We also -- a very important part of our marketing spend and a thing we're really leaning into is our focus on heavy spenders. So when we think about our quest for heavy spenders, it really goes back to 2010 when we launched our Venture card, and that was the beginning of a strategic push that we have continued and accelerated ever since. And that involved more than just putting an attractive product out there. Heavy spenders, of course, to win with heavy spenders, we need great servicing, jaw-dropping customer experiences, of course, great value propositions. And this takes a significant investment in upfront promotions and in marketing and in brand building. And this is all about my observation, all the years of doing this business and watching players who succeed here and those who get less traction is very much about a sustained investment and the -- ultimately, the brand that one builds. So we're continuing to invest in -- also in building the properties and experiences to drive heavy spender growth at the top of the market. So these investments include our travel portal. Access to exclusive properties and experiences, airport lounges and Capital One shopping. And our sustained investment at the top of the market has helped drive momentum in -- overall in our spender business, but we've grown even faster with the heaviest of spenders and we very much like this business. In addition to the obvious spend growth we're enjoying, it generates strong revenues, has very low losses, low attrition and lifts the entire brand of the company. The final factor driving our marketing levels is our investment in continuing to build our National Bank. And of course, as we have a smaller branch footprint, our growth is powered by modern technology compelling digital experience, a cafe presence in heavily traveled locations across the nation and, of course, a sustained investment in marketing. So these are the really compelling opportunities that are driving our marketing levels and we continue to see great traction pretty much across the boards, and we continue to lean into these opportunities and it's an important part of the creation of long-term value for our shareholders. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Richard Shane : Thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. I'd just like to talk a little bit about the depository franchise. Obviously, there's been very strong growth this year in the consumer banking franchise, particularly on the deposit side. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape -- you started, Rich, you talked a little bit about the network, the cafes, the less concentrated branch approach. But can you describe what you're seeing sort of broadly in the market where you think you're gaining share? Richard Fairbank : Well, one of the -- thank you, Rick. One of the core strategic approaches of Capital One, it really defines the founding idea of the company and pretty much all the choices we've made sense is to look at the marketplace and the Tsunami forces that are driving such change in the marketplace and really try to discern with all the noise in these marketplaces. Where is it that -- where is winning going to be? What's the future of these things? And almost always, it's a question of how technology is driving change. And so in retail banking, we, of course, entered banking way back in the mid-OOs (ph) driven most importantly by a desire to transform the balance sheet of our company to get away from capital market reliance and get not just a deposit driven balance sheet, but an insured deposit-driven balance sheet, hence, the quest for a consumer deposit franchise. Now along the way, as a very important part of our strategy as well. We look forward to trying to get at the forefront of where the world was going to go over time with respect to retail banking. From a heavy reliance on branches and by the way, I want to say at the outset, I think branches will be an important thing in the -- in banking for as far out as we can see. But you just can't help but see the evolution from the branch on the corner to the branch in your hand and really over time -- sorry, to the bank in your hand, to over time, the bank in your life that's very digitally interactive and both reactively and proactively being there where a consumer needs it on a real-time customized basis. So that's where we have -- that's the vision that we've been working backwards from. So in that journey, the first step, of course, was building a national savings business that was absolutely central to our balance sheet strategy for the company. But beyond that, we have worked very much to build a not just a national savings business, but a national full service bank. And to do that, it's not just a matter of sort of offering checking accounts, but I think Capital One was in a unique position, having retail banks in -- branches in about 20% of the nation and have a lot of experience with retail banking. Our view was if we're going to win in National Banking, we actually have to digitize the entire customer experience and just about everything that you can get in a branch to be able to -- for customers to get that on a digital basis. So what we've done over the years is build a full service digital, national bank. And we -- then as we have built this, we have then leveraged the big customer base we have, the national brand that we have and really added to our marketing and everywhere in our strategy, the build-out of this national bank, and we're getting a lot of traction, nice growth and a lot of traction on the brand side as consumers realize that Capital One, even though the branches across the nation really is a full service National Bank. So that's been our strategy for years. We continue to -- it's an important thing that we lean into from a marketing point of view. But basically, our quest is to build -- continue to build a national bank without getting there by virtue of just lots and lots of acquisitions of branch-based banks. Thanks. Richard Shane : Thank you, Rich. A \u2013 Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Donald Fandetti : Yes. Rich, I was wondering, given your good trends in auto delinquency, are you sort of inclined to be leaning a little harder into auto lending or do you need to see something before making that decision? Richard Fairbank : Don, thank you for your question. It's funny. We have zig (ph) while others is zag for so long -- as long as I can remember in the auto business. And our strategy isn't just as zig, while other is zag, it's always to look at this marketplace and really objectively see where the opportunities are. This is a more volatile business in terms of our growth strategies, then the credit card business is because of the role that a dealer plays in the business in a sense, holding auctions at the dealership such that -- we -- our growth strategies are particularly sensitive to the credit and underwriting choices that our competitors make because it's sort of amplified in this auction-based environment with dealers really quite a contrast from the credit card business -- to the credit card business where certainly the competitive choices matter. But it's really still a one-on-one business with our customers and prospective customers. That's why you see so much more stability in sort of the marketing and the marketing sort of and the and leaning into the growth that you see on the card side. So as when you think about the last few years. So we've certainly had in the last five or six years, tremendous growth and traction in the auto business. And we -- our strategy was so powered by our technology that we've invested in the business, the data, the underwriting capabilities and the very deep relationships that we've been building with dealers. Over the last couple of years, we were concerned at what was happening with margins as they were pressured by interest rate increases in 2022 and early 2023, some competitors were slow to adjust their pricing. Now more recently, industry lending margins have largely normalized as interest rates have stabilized and many players, including late movers have continued to increase pricing. The other thing, of course, was watching very closely the credit side of the business. And we -- just as we did in the card business, probably actually more proactively and more significantly in auto, we trimmed back around the edges in anticipation of certain worsening and with concerns about score drift in, with respect to the data [indiscernible] from consumers. So that has -- and you've seen the data that where Capital One has pulled back quite a bit. Our outstandings have been shrinking a little bit. You also have seen the striking credit performance we've had and the stability now that is at least two quarters long in terms of what we\u2019re seeing on various credit metrics. So seeing the good metrics and seeing the marketplace, we\u2019re certainly on the lookout for opportunities, but I\u2019m not here to predict an acceleration, but we certainly do like the performance of both our front book and our back book at this point. Donald Fandetti : Thanks. A \u2013 Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. First question just on the adjusted operating efficiency rate. You've seen some nice improvements over the last two quarters. And I know, Rich, you talked about sort of the year outlook. I'm just wondering, if we could see this type of level or trends sustain itself into next year? Richard Fairbank : Sanjay, we're not going to be giving out guidance on -- at this point on where operating efficiency goes. We certainly are pleased with the progress that we've made over time in operating efficiency ratio even as we've continued to really invest in the business and we're starting to see -- we have these two competing things going on inside Capital One, both a real investment in technology and also at the same time, generating a bunch of benefits and efficiencies from that technology. So the net result of these two things has been -- we've been able to really make tremendous strides forward in technology and also get some efficiencies along the way. I wouldn't put too much reliance on any one quarter, you know these numbers kind of bounce around. But certainly, you probably noticed that in our guidance, we had guidance of flat to modestly down with respect to our efficiency ratio for full year 2023, and we took the flat part out, and we're now just at modestly down. So we continue to believe, over the long term that our technology transformation offers a lot of promise for operating efficiencies and delivering operating efficiency is an important part of, I think, the value creation equation for investors. I do want to say, though, at the same time, we continue to really see great opportunities in the business. We continue to still invest in technology to capitalize on even greater opportunities over time. And that's the story of our operating efficiency ratio. Sanjay Sakhrani : Perfect. Then I have a follow-up question just on the leaning into growth in card. Where exactly is that happening? I mean, obviously, you talked about adjusting the risk parameters, and that's obviously flowing through in the credit numbers improving. Is it more on the transactor side that you're leading into growth or is it balanced across all segments? I'm just curious sort of the implications on a go-forward basis? Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Yeah. Thank you. So we are finding traction across the spectrum really. So -- and we're leaning in across the spectrum. One thing I do want to say about growth, the outstandings growth if we really think about just the strength of loan growth -- for a while, the striking loan growth for Capital One and the industry was -- we all said, well, this is just reversing the pullbacks from the pandemic. But I think for us and for a lot of players in the industry, these loan numbers have blown past prior levels. And let's just reflect a little bit on what has sustained this. My view is, well, there's the Capital One effect. We continue to have significant new account growth, and that obviously powers a lot of overtime loan growth. Payment rates are coming down. Interestingly, they have come down quite a bit. But as a general statement, they're not down to where they were before. Part of that mix effect at Capital One because we've had a lot of traction on the spending side. But even within segments, if I were to generalize, payment rates, the payment rates are still higher than they were pre-pandemic. So again, inside that, there's partly a Capital One effect, but I think also sort of a strength of the consumer effect. However, the payment rates have come down and that somewhat and that has powered growth. And I think likely no one's going to be able to prove this, but I think there are inflation effects underneath the surface. When things cost more as long as consumer incomes stay up to where inflation is, you generally have some natural, I think, inflation effects that drive some of this growth as well. So we see a lot of strength there. And some of those are Capital One specific comments, I\u2019m making and several of those are really kind of industry points. A \u2013 Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good afternoon. On the -- back to the -- your commentary around the slowing pace of the increase in delinquencies that you're seeing in card and some of the stabilization that you're citing. I know you indicated that charge-offs should of course, lag that. Can you give us maybe some way to think about how long that lag could be? Is it a two to three quarter type of window that we're looking for losses to follow through on that front? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Well, I don't want to make a precise prediction on that. I want to first of all, pull up and say, when we -- the thing that we tell everybody to look at is, what we say is, what we look at is delinquencies because that is the first indicator, that's why we have been talking not just quarterly but really even looking at the last couple of months and seeing the sort of more stabilization on the credit card side, which is very encouraging. Delinquency basically customers go delinquent and ultimately charge off six months later. And so there is -- but sometimes they go faster, sometimes they go slower. And of course, lots of times they make their payments. But we're talking about these things being measured in over a couple of quarters. The relationship between the delinquencies and the charge-offs . Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes. I hate to re-ask this question, but I think a lot of investors want to make a fine point on this in the fourth quarter. Going back to Ryan and John's question about net charge-offs I think that perhaps what's holding back credit-sensitive financials is obviously the prospect of recession -- but Rich, everything that you've said has seen positive pace of delinquency rate normalization slowing, stability of credit performance in recent vintages. As we think about what happened in September in terms of the card charge-off rate and look at the quarterly charge-off rate in third quarter and second quarter. Is it fair to draw the conclusion that as we look forward to the fourth quarter net charge-off rate that given the stability of all the leading indicators that the charge-off rate will be mostly driven by seasonality rather than normalization, if normalization has stabilized for now? Richard Fairbank : Yeah. So Erika, thanks for your question. Let me say a few things. So let's -- first of all, one of the things that makes this already challenging business for everyone studying it, including those of us who live it every day, is the seasonality -- in the volatility, which a big element of that is seasonality. So let's just let's -- talk just a little bit about seasonality. Card and auto delinquencies tend to improve each year around the tax refund season and then they worsen gradually over the rest of the year. The second quarter is typically the seasonal low point for card delinquencies and Q4 is the seasonal high point. Card losses lag relative to delinquencies. So they tend to be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter. And now in the third quarter, so our domestic card delinquencies increased. So it's kind of interesting that we're talking about sort of a leveling -- a stabilizing kind of direction when we're actually looking at delinquencies for the quarter that went up 57 basis points on a sequential quarter basis. And that's versus a typical seasonal expectation of kind of -- sort of somewhere in the neighborhood of like 37 basis points. But -- so you can even see for the quarter that most of the increase that we observed was seasonal. But then that's where we've said. If you zoom in the month -- the months of August and September, the month-over-month movement is getting really close to just the normal seasonal trend. And so this is one of the early indications that the trend of normalization we've been seeing may be stabilizing. Now one thing I want to say, obviously, you hear bullish man in my commentary, I'm not here to just wave my arms and declare a turn. We have a couple of months of very encouraging data. We'd love to see more data where we have seen a couple of quarters where we've seen a longer stretch of data is in the -- more on the lower end of the card business, interestingly, as I talked about, and in the auto business. So that's where things have really kind of appear to have stabilized. Our upmarket card business is getting there a little bit not quite as -- not quite there yet. So I start by saying, we'd love to see a little more data to be fully confident of what we're seeing. The second thing, I want to say with -- then now to your question about charge-offs, first of all, what we see, especially in the months of August and September, you're not going to see that show up with stabilized charge-offs as soon as the fourth quarter because it really is a couple of quarters that -- to the earlier question that was asked, it's really a couple of quarters before the charge-offs performed sort of in line with the delinquencies. So we're not going to make predictions here, and I don't -- I just I always -- we're always very kind of try to be as clear as we can on what we see. We happen to see some pretty positive things here, but they can also be ahead fake and a head fake and not be as good as they appear. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Dominick Gabriele : Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. When you think about capital ratios and Basel end game and the need to build capital specifically for unused lines, how do you think about mitigating if at all, mitigating your unused lines and given your capital target of about 11% today, maybe you could just talk to us about the factor of Basel unused lines and the effect going over on your capital levels and the ROTCE target? And then I just have a follow-up, if you don't mind. Thanks. Andrew Young : Yeah, I'm going to come back, Dominick, because the last half of your question. I wasn't sure I followed it. But in terms of unused lines, one of our long-standing strategies has been to start people with smaller lines and allow them to grow. And so, I would say, I wouldn't expect a meaningful shift in that strategy solely in the service of risk-weighted assets. So overall, though, as you look at the risk weightings that have come out in the end game proposal. For us, in aggregate, recall, we're not in mortgage or trading. So looking at the net of retail and commercial, inclusive of the gold plating, those are largely fighting to a draw in terms of overall risk-weighting impact, specifically on the asset side. Like everyone else, of course, we're going to have an impact from the operational risk RWA. But I didn't quite follow the second half of your question around ROTCEs. Could you just repeat that for me? Dominick Gabriele : Sure. Sorry about that. I was just curious, if you basically had to hold more capital because it's my understanding that you would have to hold additional capital against unused lines versus just drawn lines now. And so I was just curious, if your capital ratio would have to rise and -- and if that would affect the long-term return on like return on in any way? Andrew Young : Got it. Yeah, sorry, I didn't quite follow the second half of it. That was what I was trying to explain in my answer is, the net of all of that ultimately ends up being a wash, the part where we will be holding more capital on the denominator side, strictly for the risk-weighting assets again, I should highlight that it's in a comment period, a lot of industry focus on it and well, particularly as it relates to the opt risk calculation, there could be material impacts on the final outcome relative to what's proposed. But taking what is currently proposed, the asset side specifically outside of the operational risk ends up being roughly a draw for us, and it's really just the operational risk that's going to require us to hold more capital. Jeff Norris : Dominick, you have a follow-up? Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jeff Norris : You there Bill. Bill Carcache : Can you hear me? Richard Fairbank : Yeah. Bill Carcache : Okay. Great. Thank you. Yeah. So I wanted to ask about the leaf fee proposal. The consensus view is that we'll get it very soon. It will be immediately litigated. Can you give us your view on the likely path that you would anticipate and possibly speak to any potential costs that might be associated with it? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thank you, Bill. So the CFPB's late fee proposal as currently contemplated would reduce late fees by approximately 75%. And while the CFPB's proposal has not yet been finalized, we expect the CFPB to publish a proposal soon, probably before the end of the year. Now once the CFPB publishes its final rule, we expect there to be industry litigation that could delay or block the implementation of this rule. And this litigation will likely delay the implementation of the rule until at least the second half of 2024 and maybe longer. If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our P&L in the near term. However, we have a set of mitigating actions that we're working through that we believe will gradually resolve this impact a couple of years after the rule goes into effect. These choices include changes to our policies, products and investment choices. Some of these actions will take place before the rule change takes effect many will come after the rule change takes effect. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : One moment please. Our final question is a follow-up from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Dominick Gabriele : Hey. Sorry about that. I think I got cut off. Can you hear me okay? Richard Fairbank : Yes, we can Dominick. Dominick Gabriele : All right. Sorry about that, guys. I was actually just curious on the quarter-over-quarter increase in domestic card yield. I know that there's sometimes some seasonality in the third quarter, and we've also had a lot of rate hikes in previous years around the third quarter. I was wondering if you could just walk us through some of the dynamics in the quarter-over-quarter increase in domestic card? Thanks so much. Andrew Young : Yeah, Dominick. I can't remember who asked it earlier, but just reiterating some of those points, I think you largely answered your own question, which is there is seasonality that in part is -- or is a function of the revolve rates driven by some of the dynamics, Rich talked about over the course of the year, we did see the Fed move. And then we also saw a bit of late fees, which I would lump into the seasonality dimension. And then finally, we had one more day in the third quarter, so day count in an absolute sense, not necessarily relative to peers, which I think was the nature of the question earlier, but at least in an absolute sense. Those are the big drivers of what drove the quarter-over-quarter yield. Jeff Norris : Well, thanks, everybody for joining us on the conference call this evening, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Investor Relations team will be here later this evening to answer any questions that you may have. Have a great evening, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew? Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon everybody. I'll start on Slide 3 of today's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $706 million or $1.67 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $4.9 billion or $11.95 per share. Included in the results for the fourth quarter was a $289 million accrual for our current estimate of the FDIC special assessment. Net of this adjusting item, fourth-quarter earnings per share were $2.24 and full-year earnings per share were $12.52. On a linked-quarter basis, growth in our Domestic Card business drove period-end loans up 2% and average loans up 1%. Period-end deposits increased 1% in the quarter, and average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC-insured deposits grew to 82% of total deposits in the fourth quarter. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% driven by both higher net interest and non-interest income. Non-interest expense was up 18% in the quarter. Operating expense increased 15%, with roughly half of that increase driven by the FDIC special assessment. The full-year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, improved 99 basis points to 43.54%. Provision expense was $2.9 billion, comprised of $2.5 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $326 million. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the allowance balance in greater detail. The $326 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to approximately $15.3 billion as of December 31. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.77%, up 2 basis points from the prior quarter, largely driven by a higher mix of card assets. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. Outside of interest rates, most of our economic assumptions are largely unchanged from the third quarter and we continue to assume several key economic variables modestly worsened from today's levels. In our Domestic Card business, the coverage ratio decreased by 16 basis points to 7.63%. The allowance balance increased by $336 million. The predominant driver of the increased allowance was the loan growth in the quarter. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance was essentially flat at roughly $2 billion. Coverage increased by 4 basis points to 2.71%, driven by a decline in auto loans in the quarter. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the coverage ratio declined by 3 basis points to 1.71%. The allowance decreased by $37 million, primarily driven by the charge-offs of office real-estate loans in the quarter. We have included additional details on the office portfolio on Slide 17 of tonight's presentation. Turning to Page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by $2.3 billion to about $121 billion. The increase was driven by a higher market value of our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by modestly lower cash balances. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $43.3 billion, down $1.6 billion from the prior quarter. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 167%, up from 155% in the third quarter. The increase in the LCR was driven by holding more of our cash balances at the parent company versus our banking subsidiary. Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our fourth quarter net interest margin was 6.73%, 4 basis points higher than last quarter and 11 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by a continued mix-shift towards card loans and higher asset yields, partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.9%, approximately 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Asset growth, common and preferred dividends, and the share repurchases more than offset net income in the quarter. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew. Good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows fourth quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Top line growth trends in the domestic card business remained strong, even with growth moderating somewhat in the fourth quarter. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 4% from the fourth quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $16 billion or about 12% year-over-year. Average loans increased 14%. And fourth-quarter revenue was also up 14% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 213 basis points year-over-year to 5.35%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter-end increased 118 basis points from the prior year to 4.61%. On a sequential-quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 95 basis points and the 30 plus delinquency rate was up 30 basis points. For the month of December, the charge-off rate was 5.78%, including a one-time impact of 15 basis points, described in a footnote in the monthly credit 8-K. Adjusted for this impact, the monthly charge-off rate for December would have been 5.63%. Pulling up on Domestic Card credit, we believe that normalization has run its course and credit results have stabilized. The 30-plus delinquency rate has been stable on a seasonally adjusted basis for a number of months now. Since August, our monthly delinquency rate has been moving in line with normal seasonality and at stable ratios relative to the same month in 2018 and 2019. And at this point, we have a pretty good window into January as delinquency entries in December indicate continuing delinquency rate stability in January. We've always said that delinquencies are the leading indicator of where charge-offs are going. Charge-off rate tends to follow delinquency rate by about three to six months. Based on the stability, we've seen in our delinquencies since August and extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and flow rates, we believe the charge-off rate is stabilizing now and settling out to about 15% above 2019 levels. I give this window, because investors have been asking for quite some time when will charge-offs level off. So this is the point where we see that happening, meaning charge-offs should move more or less with seasonality in the coming months. This window comes from modeling the flows in our delinquency buckets which have stabilized, and our recoveries which have also stabilized and started to rebuild. This isn't designed to be longer-run guidance but rather to indicate that charge-offs are finally moving more or less with seasonality over the near term. In the longer run, there could be additional forces such as potential pressure from economic worsening and potential benefits from the depletion of deferred charge-offs from the pandemic and recoveries picking up over time from increased inventory. Non-interest expense was up 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense. Total company marketing expense of about $1.25 billion for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year. Our choices in our card business are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the Domestic Card business. And in the fourth quarter, marketing also included higher media spend and increased marketing for franchise enhancements, like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. Slide 12 shows fourth-quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the fourth-quarter auto originations declined 7% year-over-year. Driven by the decline in auto originations, consumer banking ending loans decreased about $4.5 billion or 6% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis ending loans were down 2%. We posted another strong quarter of year-over-year growth in federally insured consumer deposits. Fourth-quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $26 billion or 9% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%, average deposits were up 11% year-over-year, and up 1% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth and gradually increase the percentage of total company deposits that are FDIC-insured. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 17% year-over-year, largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs. Non-interest expense was down about 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.19%, up 53 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 6.34%, up 72 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was up 42 basis points, while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 70 basis points. Both of these linked-quarter increases were in line with typical seasonal expectations. Monthly auto credit began to stabilize even earlier than domestic card credit results. On a monthly basis auto delinquency rate and charge-off rate had been tracking normal seasonal patterns since the first half of 2023 and continued to do so through December. Slide 13 shows fourth-quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked-quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 9% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 7%. The declines are largely driven by our continuing choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Reducing these less attractive deposits also drove the 14 basis point linked-quarter improvement in our average rate paid on commercial deposits. Fourth-quarter revenue was down 5% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was also down about 5%. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate for the fourth quarter increased 28 basis points from the third quarter to 0.53%. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.81%, up 73 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was down 6 basis points to 0.84%. Commercial Banking credit trends were largely driven by continuing pressure in our commercial office portfolio. Slide 17 of the fourth-quarter 2023 results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of our total loans. In closing, we continued to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter. We posted another strong quarter of top line growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume, and loans. Domestic card and auto delinquency trends were in line with normal seasonal patterns, a continuing indicator of stabilizing consumer credit results. We grew consumer deposits and total deposits. And we added liquidity and maintained capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Our annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments for the full year 2023, was 43.54%. In 2023, we saw incremental opportunities and made choices to grow revenue and tightly manage costs to achieve a 99 basis point improvement in our annual operating efficiency ratio. The actual improvement was better than the \u201cmodest improvement\u201d growth we had been expecting. Over the last decade, we've driven significant operating efficiency improvement even as we've invested to transform our technology. And we continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time. For the full-year 2024, we expect annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, will be flat to modestly down compared to 2023. Our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed CFPB late fee rule, assuming that rule takes effect in October 2024. Pulling way up, our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We continue to drive improvements in underwriting, modeling, and marketing, as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. And our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement, and enduring value creation over the long term. We remain well-positioned to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. So if you have any questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Amy, please start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. And, Rich, thank you for the color on the charge-offs. I know you cited the pluses and minuses from here, from stabilizing charge-offs. But I'm curious if you feel like the consumer positioning leans towards improvement here as inflation declines, real income growth has resumed. And should interest rates come down? This coupled with the recoveries could benefit the charge-off rate, correct? And I'm just thinking sort of how to think about the reserve rate going forward. Richard Fairbank : Yeah. So, Sanjay, yeah -- so first of all, my comments, I just want -- I wanted with my credit comments in my sort of extrapolated look at our delinquency buckets, I really wanted to share where our charge-offs are settling out, which is about 15% above 2019 levels. And we should also note, by the way, that in any year first-half losses are seasonally higher than second-half losses. So within any normal year, the first half is the peak. Now, as I said, we're not really giving longer-run guidance. But let's think about the dynamics about how things could go from here. From an economy point of view, we're certainly in a strong economy, unemployment is at a pretty remarkable place. So, I think if anything, unemployment could add more downside than it adds upside. Perhaps inflation has more upside than it does downside. But I don't have any more insight to those than anybody else does. I think, I also would want to kind of reinforce your point, there are two good guys that should play out over time. And we've been talking for a long time about the delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic. And when you think about that the pandemic had such a just absolutely unusual experience for consumers, with all of the stimulus and the forbearance and so on that, we certainly have believed that charge-offs that were otherwise going to happen at that time, some got averted permanently, but I think some got delayed. And so this phenomenon that we call delayed charge-offs, I think, it's not a really quantifiable effect, but I think it's very much been a part of what's happening with -- in the normalization and something that intuitively will run its course. And the other thing is recoveries. So recoveries -- our recoveries, while the rate per charge-off dollar remained strong, the number of charge-off dollars in inventory, thanks to the pandemic, were at a really depressed level. And so we have bottomed out there and they're starting to -- now inventories are starting to increase, of course, as credit has normalized and that should also gradually be a good guy. Also when I look at our origination strategy and the underwriting choices we make, these are consistent with longer-term losses that are lower than where we are now. So we consciously sort of focused our credit commentary to really focus on where things settle out. And then there is a list of forces that could work in either direction, but I think you certainly point out to some of the good guys. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, just a follow-up. Maybe, Andrew, could you just talk about the reserve rate on a go-forward basis and how we should think about it? Should it stabilize? Can it come down? And maybe just also on the NIM with rates coming down, how we should think about the movement over the course of the year? Thanks. Andrew Young : Sure. Sanjay, let me compartmentalize those two things, NIM will be a whole separate answer, but with respect to allowance. Well, let me first start with just a tactical housekeeping item, which is a reminder that in Q4 we have seasonal balances that quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore have negligible coverage. So the coverage ratio in Q4 is modestly lower as a result of that dynamic and it reverses itself in Q1, but again a real modest effect there. Longer-term though, projected losses are really going to be the biggest driver of coverage. And as we've said before, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that and Rich just provided a fulsome description of all of the forces at play there. So from a reserve perspective, every quarter we're just going to be looking at the next 12 months of projected losses with the first six more consequential in the calculation, but also far more predictable, given the visibility that we have through delinquencies. And then the remainder of that window really informed by economic assumptions, and then the reversion to the long-term average. And so over the last few quarters, things have played out consistent with or slightly better than what we've expected and you've seen the coverage ratio in card roughly stay flat. So, I think it's important to note that even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might otherwise indicate a release, we could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declines as we incorporate some of that uncertainty into the allowance, but eventually in a scenario like that, after a period of coverage stability like we've seen, you would see coverage coming down in the release of non-growth related reserves. Sanjay Sakhrani : NIM? Andrew Young : NIM, sure. There is a lot of factors at play with NIM and maybe I'll do the same housekeeping with NIM. Just to remind everyone that in the first quarter with one fewer day, we're going to see roughly a 7 basis points headwind there. But let me then also enumerate here the puts and takes to NIM. On the tailwind side, growth in card balances as percentage of the balance sheet and even within those balances possibly a higher revolver rate. Certainly a tailwind, and that's something we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And then also a lower cash balance, we've talked about this before, but cash balances today in total of $43 billion. I think the number is with about $37 billion at the Fed is quite a bit higher than pre-pandemic. I don't think we'll get back to where we were pre-pandemic but I would expect over time that, that will come down from today's level. So that would also be a tailwind to NIM. On the headwind side, even though the Fed has stopped moving up in July, we continue to see some deposit product rotation, and it creates a bit of upward pressure to the deposit betas. And then even if the Fed starts decreasing rates, we're going to see the assets reprice more quickly than the deposits. And the competitive environment in the backdrop of QT will potentially have an impact on betas on a downward cycle. So that would create a bit of marketing pressure. And then a couple of other things that I would just highlight as potential headwinds, the uncertainty around potential regulatory changes that could impact interest income as well as just the path of credit. You've seen suppression go up over the last few quarters, as losses go up, so that also creates some pressure to NIM. So, I know that that was a list of puts and takes, but I partially go into that level of detail to say, it's kind of hard to say where NIM is going to go in the near term, especially because the path of interest rates remains fairly wide at this point, but kind of gives you a sense of all of the forces at play. But over the much longer term, I would say there's nothing really structurally different about our balance sheet from where it was pre-pandemic, that leads me to believe that NIM will be materially different than where it was based on at least what we know today. Jeff Norris : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Ryan Nash : Hey, good evening, everyone. Andrew Young : Hey, Ryan. Richard Fairbank : Hey, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Rich, when I look you put about $4 billion of marketing expense for the second straight year and you continuing to drive strong growth, we're hearing about some others with a little bit of a more cautious tone on growth. So maybe just talk about, are you leaning in and do you expect marketing to increase, and really where you're seeing the best opportunities in the market and how are you thinking about growth looking ahead? Thanks. And I have a follow-up. Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thanks, Ryan. We feel very good about the opportunities in the marketplace, so we are leaning in, we're definitely leaning in. The -- you can see obviously, there was quite a lot of marketing in the fourth quarter, but we continue to see opportunities across the Board, especially in the card business. But -- so let -- just pulling up there a few key factors driving our marketing that we want to continue to emphasize. First of all, we're just really excited about the growth opportunities across our business. We're making -- we have over the last number of years, made some, what we call sort of adjustments around the edges and trimming around the edges. Lately, there is really even not a lot of trimming around those edges, we're in a very sort of stable place with respect to the business we're going after, the results we're getting, and the deal that we have to capitalize on that. And I think our technology transformation of course has really been beneficial, but it allows us to leverage more data and more machine-learning models to identify basically more attractive opportunities for investment and to create better and more customized solutions for customers along the way. So just the overall opportunities continue to be very strong. The second part of our marketing investment, of course, relates to our quest to win at the top of the market. And we've been going after heavy spenders now for almost 15 years and that needs sustained high levels of investment and you can see those out in the marketplace in flagship products, in groundbreaking experiences, like things like best-in-class digital customer experiences, really high level elite customer servicing, online travel portal, and -- in the intersection of risk management and the quest to go to the top of the market. The incredible importance of advanced fraud defense is to ensure that the card always works. And increasingly, we're also just rolling out exclusive services and experiences that aren't available in the general marketplace, such as airport lounges and access to select properties. So we continue to lean into growth here and obviously, that quest toward the top of the market involves quite a bit of marketing investment and a lot of upfront investment for annuities that are just wonderful long-lasting fabulous annuities. And the third vector of real marketing investment is our continuing efforts to build our National Bank. And just as a reminder, we have a smaller branch footprint, and so we lean more heavily on our technology investments, our digital experiences, our cafe network, and our brand and marketing investments to continue to organically build this National Bank. And we are really pleased with the traction there. And it's been a lot of years in the making, but we are definitely leaning in there and loved the results. So, Ryan, those are kind of a window into how we're thinking about it in the compelling opportunities behind across the board that we see and we are continuing to capitalize on the opportunity as we see it. Ryan Nash : Got it. And, Rich, if you put late fees aside for the first part of my question, you talked about stable to modest improvement which ex-late fees would imply continued improvement on the operating efficiency. Do you think we're back ex-late fees on a sustained journey of improving efficiency, like you were talking about before the pandemic? And then second, just how are you thinking about the timing of offsetting late fees? Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Yeah. Thank you. So the -- our story about efficiency, I think, has been a very consistent story for a bunch of years and I think a lot of companies drive efficiency by just continuing to cut costs on their way to greatness. And we certainly put a lot of energy into the cost side of our business, but really it's been about building a business model powered by technology and the customer experiences we're building to drive revenue growth and efficiency and both at the same time. And we've talked about how so much of this is powered by technology and we continue to see the benefits of that. So we -- at this, on the one hand, keep leaning into technology and keep investing there. And on the other hand, see a -- growing opportunities to drive efficiency as a beneficiary of the technology investments. So, pulling way up, while any particular year can be different from overall trends. We continue to believe that an important part of the value proposition with investors and the benefit of the years of investment we're making is to continue to drive greater operating efficiency. So, did you have a CFPB question? Yes. So let me turn, Ryan, to talk about that. So the CFPB's late fee proposal as currently contemplated would reduce late fees by approximately 75%. While the CFPB's proposal has not been finalized, we expect the CFPB to publish a proposal soon. And once the CFPB publishes its final rule, we expect there to be industry litigation that could delay or block the implementation of the rule. This litigation will likely delay the implementation of the rule until at least the second half of this year and maybe longer. You saw we talked about an estimate of October. If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our P&L in the near term relative to what our path would have been. However, we have a set of mitigating actions that we're working through that we believe will gradually resolve this impact, a couple of years after the rule goes into effect. And these choices include changes to our policies, our products, and investment choices. Some of these actions will take place before the rule change takes effect and a few are already underway, many will come after the rule change takes effect. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Your line is open. Arren Cyganovich : Thanks. I was hoping you talk a little bit about the auto business. You continue to kind of pull back a little bit from that side, thinking about how you're feeling about potentially increasing some originations. Still a healthy amount of originations at $27 billion this year, but just wondering when you might make a pivot there. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Arren. So, we've been cautious in auto for a couple of years now. We've noted over this period of time, a number of headwinds in the business. So -- but let's tally them up. Margin pressure from the interest-rate cycle, normalizing credit, vehicle values normalizing from their all-time highs, and affordability pressures stemming from the combined effects of elevated interest rate and still high car prices0. As you know we don't work backward from growth target and we remain disciplined in our originations, setting pricing and terms that we're comfortable with and then take what the market gives us. So back in 2022, we raised price, tightened our credit box at the low end of the market, and took other steps to manage the resilience of our lending. As a result, our run rate of originations has been lower than like two years ago. But as a result of our actions, we've been just very pleased with the performance of our auto originations. The credit performance has been really striking, which of course you can see. So even as vehicle values continue to normalize, risk on our most recent originations from 2023 remains below what we saw in our pre-pandemic originations, probably is the result of our actions. And vintage over vintage, that risk remains stable. The margins on new originations have improved as well, particularly over the last couple of months as interest rates have come down from their recent peaks. So we feel quite good about the performance of our auto originations. So we continue to adjust our strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risks. But of course, that's what we always do. But when we think about some of the headwinds, I think some of those headwinds are easing, and the results that we're seeing on our own books are really pretty striking and gratifying. So, that gives us a more bullish outlook, still with a note of caution. Arren Cyganovich : Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Rick Shane : Thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. Hey, Rich, you've given some framework for charge-offs into '24. One of the observations we would make is that delinquencies even through December on a year-over-year basis due are trending, are up on a year-over-year basis, even though that increase has slowed substantially. That suggests and very consistent with your description that charge-offs will continue to rise through the first half of the year. What I'm curious about is, given that delinquencies are still up 100 basis points or 115 basis points year-over-year in December, when we look into the second half of the year, I understand, seasonally, that they will be down. But would you expect the charge-offs in the second half of the year will still be up versus '23? Richard Fairbank : So, I think the best way to think about this is to focus on the most stable benchmarks. As our focus here is about stability, so we're really looking at what are the most stable benchmarks that we can anchor to. And that really leads us back to 2019, 2018. And so let me just sort of speak in that, sort of double-click a little bit into my comments on that. So our delinquencies are above pre-pandemic levels, but they've been tracking with normal seasonality for quite some time. And now, compared to 2019, since August we're running around 17% above the level for the same month of 2019. Compared to 2018, since May, we're running at around 13% above the level for the same months of 2018. And at this point, we have a pretty good window into January of 2024, as well based on delinquency entries in December and that looks like it's going to be another month of stability. So, we feel confident declaring that our delinquencies have stabilized. And of course, delinquencies are our best leading indicator of credit performance. Our charge-offs have been catching up to the stabilizing trend in our delinquencies over the second half of 2023. But at this point, what we're declaring here is that our charge-offs are leveling off as well. Now, there's more month-to-month volatility in charge-offs than in delinquencies by quite a bit. Because every data point of delinquencies includes five months of delinquency inventories. And of course, charge-offs is looking at the relatively small number that falls off at the end of the last bucket. And there was also some noise in the fourth quarter of 2019, that makes it less reliable as a charge-off benchmark. So, we actually think 2018 is an even better benchmark for our charge-offs, for comparing our charge-offs in this fourth quarter that just happened to a past stable year. In the fourth quarter, our net charge-offs were about 15% above 2018 levels. And of course, 2018 rolled into 2019, so that's an appropriate benchmark to look at as we head into 2024 and compared to 2019. Now when we look ahead, extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and recent flow rates, we conclude that our net charge-offs are stabilizing at about 15% above 2019, with of course some typical month-to-month volatility and normal seasonality. Now, of course, the seeds of this stabilization have been planted for quite a long time now and partly driven by the choices that we made back in 2020 and 2021. Coming out the pandemic, we were concerned about two trends. FinTechs were flooding the market, especially the subprime market with credit offers, creating the potential for credit worsening and adverse selection in our originations. We also anticipated that pandemic era stimulus and forbearance would temporarily inflate consumer credit scores and that these would revert over time. So, we tightened our underwriting in anticipation of these effects and we have continued to make adjustments at the margin since then. And the result has been striking, that with all the kind of changes, the normalization, all the noise over the last number of years, that there has been strikingly stable performance on our origination vintages. In our -- basically and our post-pandemic originations, each quarterly vintage for a given segment has been more or less on top of each other. And also, relatively consistent with pre-pandemic vintages. And over time, this just created a lot of stability that increasingly moved into our portfolio and it contributed to the stabilization of our portfolio credit trends. And as we've looked at this, we said these are very good shoulders to stand on, to have that much stabilization for so long. We of course all still waited to see exactly the manifestations ultimately of the portfolio stabilizing. Another factor contributing to stabilization is our recovery rate. And unusually low recoveries have been the largest driver of our overall charge-off rate running above pre-pandemic levels. And this is of course because of the very low level of charge-offs over the past three years. And therefore, we had a low level of raw material for future recovery. And by the way, just a Capital One point here, this is a larger effect for us and for most competitors because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average. And because we tend to work our own recoveries, so they come in overtime, not all at once like in a debt sale. And so, we\u2019ve recently observed that our recovery rate has stabilized and started to tick back up. And that's our -- and you know, and now that our recoveries inventory has started to rebuild, that's of course a good guy, although it's coming from a pretty low level. And this also contributes to our confidence that our overall loss trends have stabilized. So when you -- to your question where you at compared to 2023, what we've really done is really kind of anchor our benchmarking to the most stable years in sort of recent experience, 2018 and 2019. And since we've seen delinquencies and charge-offs stabilize relative to like quarters in those benchmarks, we felt the best language with which to describe where things are settling out, is to do it as a multiple of those two generally stable years. And so we are entering 2024 now with a real sense of stability and we've benchmarked where we are as a multiple of those two stable year benchmarks. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Maybe, Rich, just following up on that, I think that a lot of the marketing dollars in the card space have been spent, with the -- at the transactor business. But given that, that's -- that stability that you're talking about. And I assume the bulk of the dollars of loss, delinquency and loss are coming from kind of the lower end of the card spectrum. So does that mean that that's an area for expansion in 2024, like, how should we think about that? And I do have a follow-up. Richard Fairbank : Sorry, Moshe, are you saying, is what -- is the lower-end an area for expansion? Moshe Orenbuch : Yes. Richard Fairbank : So, we feel -- well, we feel good about all of our segments across the credit spectrum in card and also the relative health of the consumer. And you've known us for a long time, Moshe, as long as we have -- for the decades we've been talking together, you know that we have a long history of delivering sustained resilience and profitability at the lower end of the marketplace. And we -- let's just reflect on this for a second. If you're talking about subprime credit cards, this is a complex business that requires deep investment in information-based underwriting. And of course, we've spent decades developing and testing tailored product structures and sort of honing the analytical and the operating and underwriting and marketing capabilities to attract and serve this franchise, but also with the number one and two and three most important things to us has been resilient as we do this. And what's really been pretty striking is how consistent our strategy has been over the years, through the Great Recession and following that. And if we -- and we've talked about how the lower-end of the marketplace, whether you're talking, by the way, there's a whole -- when you talk about the lower end of the marketplace, obviously, we -- there is a whole part of the marketplace that Capital One doesn't serve. But in terms of the lower end of the marketplace that we serve, if you look at either income or FICO and look at the normalization that's going on, we've seen very solid curing in that part of the market. It in fact even started -- it cured a little bit earlier than some of the other parts of the market but the curing story, the leveling-off story we're talking about today is absolutely across the board. I do want to say though also, Moshe, relative to your point, you've had Fintechs who we were very concerned about flooding that end of the market. Some years ago, they certainly have massively dialed back. And I think that the continued -- when we see the success of our vintages, the stabilization, now the sort of stabilization overall of Capital One's whole portfolio and the dynamics in the marketplace, I think that we like the opportunities we see there, Moshe, and we will be leaning into that. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. And just as a follow-up, I mean, you've talked in the past about not just the financial impact of the late fee, but also its deterrent impact. So how do you think about that in terms of the resilience of that segment as we go forward post any changes to late fees? And maybe just as a side point, you did mention that you thought you could maintain -- improve the efficiency ratio even with the late fee. I mean, that just seems -- that seems like a -- like you\u2019d have to take a couple $100 million out of expenses to do that. So if there is a way to talk about what -- how that would happen, and tack that on to the answer, that would help too. Thanks. Andrew Young : So, Moshe, Capital One has pursued a strategy for many years of trying to create and deliver to the marketplace, strikingly simple products. Because we, from sort of a mission and strategy point of view, we believe so much in this, but -- and we've built a brand over having very simple products. And so things like, for example, on the banking side, no minimum balance requirements, no membership fees, and even no overdraft fees. So here we are a company that has really, really reduced the fees. But if we add one fee left, I think the fee we would most hang on to is the late fee. Because to your point, it plays a very important role in the deterrent value to a consumer. And an analogy that we sometimes use is a speeding ticket. I think that if a speeding ticket were -- let's say, we had an $8 speeding ticket, I'm not sure that our highways would be quite as safe as they are now because if we're really trying to deter behavior that we think is really consequential for people, that really is the role of the fee. We've been very active in giving alerts to all of our customers when the late payment due alerts, with the goal of trying to -- not trying to maximize late fees, but actually trying to maximize the on-payment performance of our customers. So, Moshe, this is a question that -- we've been worried about your question about the what could be the impact on credit performance of individuals and it's something that we're just going to have to. If this CFPB rule goes into effect, we're all going to experience together sort of this -- not controlled experiment, but we certainly mark us down for having a concern about that. But from a financial point of view, obviously, the late fees are an important thing on the P&L. And as I've talked about, we have created, I've said it many actions across different types of things from policies, products, pricing structures, investment choices to claw back the very significant economic impact. Some of those things are underway. Some of them just to mention it, by the way. By the time we get there when the rule is announced, some of the offsets are going to by then be into the run rate of the company and the majority will still be waiting to happen. With respect to the fourth quarter, the [\u201825] (ph) is the big full-year effect, obviously something coming in late in the fourth -- it's something coming in, in our estimate in the fourth quarter. It doesn't have as much impact on the annual efficiency ratio, but it still does have an impact. So, essentially, what's implied underneath it, is quite a bit of progress on the efficiency ratio, behind the flat to modestly down guidance that includes that fourth quarter effect. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Hi, thanks for taking my call. In the interest of time, given its late in the call, I'll ask my two parter all upfront here. First on the marketing side, I know you indicated you expect to continue to lean in on marketing this year, does that -- what does that imply on how you're thinking about full-year marketing expense? I mean, could that mean that you will see marketing come in above the $4 billion level that you saw this year or could it be stable or a modest decline? And then my second question is on the credit side, on the commercial real estate office CRE. I know you had some lumpy losses this quarter and some pressure still in criticized and non-accruals. If you could just give us a little bit more color there in terms of what you charged-off and your outlook on that front? Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Okay, John, thanks for your good questions here. We don't typically give full-year marketing guidance. And the reason is because, marketing depends of course a lot on the opportunities that we see when we get there. So what I wanted to just share in response to Ryan Nash's question is a continuation in the positivity that we feel both about the real-time numbers we're seeing of response and performance of our vintages and all of that. And then also the sort of more structural investments that we're making in the business, particularly with respect to the -- going after the heavy spenders. So, we don't have full-year guidance, but we certainly continue to like the opportunities that we see. Andrew Young : And then, John, on the office side, it's virtually impossible to generalize office, it is incredibly property-specific. We've talked in the past about us having a fair amount in gateway cities and having a mix of both A and B, C properties. But frankly, the decomposition matters a whole lot less than the individual properties. And so what we saw in the quarter was a little more than $80 million of losses tied to office loans. We continue to not originate there. Balances have come down to -- about $2.3 billion, I think, down about $150 million in the quarter. It's less than 1% of our total loans. But as we charged off in the quarter, we had essentially reserved entirely for that amount, and then we built back up a little bit for the remaining portfolio to maintain the coverage at around 13%. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Don Fandetti : Rich, you've made a lot of progress on heavy spenders. As you sort of look out, where are we I guess on that expense cycle? Are we sort of still looking at many years of acceleration or do you hit some type of level where there is some scale kicking in? Just trying to get a sense on where we are on that investment cycle. Richard Fairbank : Well, Don, it's certainly, I think the quest to the heavy spender -- to win in the heavy spenders of the marketplace, it will be a quest as far out as we can see. In the same way, it is for the players who -- the small number of players who are really going after that business. The key part of it is, we're getting more and more scale along the way. So you've seen over the years, the growth in purchase volume, what you don't see as is the purchase volume growth rates by level of spender. And it -- any segmentation we've been looking at, it monotonically -- the growth rate is monotonically faster. The more you go up, the -- toward the heavy spenders. So it's just indicating, we're getting a lot of traction there. So, I wouldn't want to say that we just have to do a blitz, and then we're kind of done with the investment. The way that scale is achieved is by getting more and more customers in a business where all the players in the business, even including the largest, continue to invest in that business. But we're really pleased with the traction and that's why we continue to invest. Don Fandetti : That's all I had. Thanks. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. I appreciate all of the very clear commentary on what you're seeing in credit. There is a view that if we'd had a mild recession and experienced the purging of weaker credits, that would have provided a clear runway for growth coming out of that. But instead, the environment we're in is arguably a little bit muddier and some would stay still late cycle. Could you speak to that dynamic, Rich, and whether that weighs on how you're thinking about growth from here in any way? And as a follow-up, I'll just ask it now for you, Andrew. Can you update us on how you're thinking about capital return from here? Andrew Young : Sure. Why don't I start? Bill, look, at this point, there still remains a number of uncertainty around capital, not the least of which is the end-game proposal. We're all aware there is been quite a bit of advocacy there and that there remains a fair amount of uncertainty of where the rule will land, including things like the impact of AOCI and phase-in and ops risk and other forces at play. So we are -- you know as much as we do, and we're waiting to see what the final rule holds there. But in addition to that, we're coming up on CCAR, we don't yet have the scenarios for this year. You look back at how impactful the scenario as well as the starting balance sheet is to those outcomes. You've seen our SCB fluctuate over the last four years, from I think 10.1% down to 7%, and now we're sitting here at 9.3%. So waiting to get a little bit more clarity of what CCAR will hold. And then in addition, we continue to see a range of outcomes in our own growth projections. And finally, just point to the economy, there is -- the consensus view is growing of a soft landing, but there is still quite a wide range of outcomes there. And so given all of those factors, we've chosen to operate for the last few quarters around 13%. We recognize that, when we feel like we're in an excess capital position, that returning it is one way to create value. And under the SCB framework, we have that flexibility to manage repurchases dynamically and we'll use that flexibility when we think it's prudent to do so. Richard Fairbank : Bill, comment on our continuing to lean in, given that some people might argue that the economic environment is late cycle, so it's certainly a great question. So there -- first of all, the bottom line is, we are continuing to lean in. Obviously we keep a wary eye out for things that could change. But I sort of start with the health of the consumer. I think the US consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy. And the labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year, really defining the expectations of many economists in the face of rising interest rates. Consumer debt servicing burdens remain relatively low by historical standards, again despite rising interest rates. Home prices are back and doing a bit better and are generally near all-time highs. In aggregate, consumers across all income levels still have excess savings also from the pandemic, although those numbers are declining. Inflation has moderated to the point that real wages are growing again after shrinking for almost two years. Student loan repayments, now they resumed in October, but there is the 12-month on-ramp period and a new income-driven repayment plan, which will significantly reduce payments for lower-income borrowers. So, on the whole, I'd say, consumers are in really quite good shape relative to most historical benchmarks. Then if we look inside our own portfolio, we still see higher average payments compared to 2019 by segment, by a really pretty sizable delta. We -- and then we then look at the marketplace. And you've seen in the auto business how at times we get alarmed by some of the practices or the pricing in the industry. And we pulled back in ways that we haven't pulled back in the card business. But I think we see a rationale and stable competitive marketplace, it's very competitive, but it's rationale and stable. And then most importantly, the results themselves. The -- our vintages just continue to come in on top of prior vintages. The trimming around the edges that we've done over the last few years have really I think allowed our results to have a stability to them that even has diverged from the sort of underlying, not as good performance of -- in the marketplace of things recently compared to the past, but we have that real stability. Then we see the leveling-off of our portfolio. And really we talk about our charge-offs leveling off at a level that -- like 15% above 2019. It's interesting actually that's net charge-offs, but gross charge-offs are leveling-off very close to the gross charge-off levels of 2018 and 2019. And actually, the thing that creates the differential is the lower recoveries that we've had for as a -- in the wake of the inventory of recoveries being so much lower inventory of charge-off debt. So pulling way up and seeing the traction in our business, the success with our brand, the things that for competitive reasons we don't share in the marketplace, but the traction on the tax side, in terms of enabling us to create better -- really unique customized customer experiences, totally customized underwriting. The reaching to marketing channels that we hadn't even tapped before. All of this is putting us in a position to continue to -- pulling way up, obviously in the credit business, we always worry a lot. But if I calibrate this relative to a lot of other times, I feel really quite good about this. And I actually said I felt a lot less good a couple of years ago. Because I felt that the pandemic, while, from a credit point of view, who couldn't like those credit results, I said, it actually is so abnormally good. The marketplace won't be able to help itself but create unusual practices, unresilient underwriting, et cetera. So, actually what we've had, if I can borrow the soft landing term from the economy conversations is kind of a soft landing, relative to the credit business, and landing is really quite the right word, relative to Capital One, which I think really as I've kind of declared today, sort of landed here. And I know some competitors still haven't fully landed, but pulling way up on this. I actually feel this is really quite a good time if I calibrate to all the times over the years in this exciting journey. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, great. Thanks so much for all the color on the call today. I just have two questions. Rich, what are you seeing you think that's making the net charge-off stabilize 15% above 2019 levels? Is there something in the consumer payment behavior that's changed? Is there something you think that shifted the consumer, in general, where the credit card industry may be seeing a higher through-the-cycle net charge-off rate going forward or for Capital One in particular? And I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much. Richard Fairbank : So, I actually believe that what we're really seeing here is a credit situation that's very similar to pre-pandemic. It is showing up right now and I'm going to speak through the Capital One lens. I think I'm not going to universalize for the industry. But as I mentioned in the -- to the prior answer there, that if you look at gross charge-offs, where they're settling out for Capital One, now this is Capital One that has done a lot of trimming around the edges over the last -- a fair amount of trimming around the edges. I think we also did a very important choice that I'm not sure was universe, it might have been an unusual choice. But when we saw the incredibly strong credit performance of consumers, much of it driven by stimulus and forbearance, we sort of became alarmed about credit scores, great inflation if you will, and essentially intervened in our models to normalize. So that we didn't get fooled by that. But yes, this is the -- and so as a result of that, we have stabilized. We're probably one of the first players to stabilize and we have stabilized at this moment at 15%, above 20% -- say, benchmark to 2019 levels. Already we said that number from a gross charge-off number is really sort of very close to 2019 levels. So the recoveries effect, which is a temporary effect that our recoveries are so much lower because they just don't have as much inventory of charge-offs to collect on. That's a good guy that should help over time. So, I think also as we've talked about and we've talked about ever since the pandemic sort of -- we started coming out the other side of the pandemic, we said there is another effect. Let's call it the delayed charge-off effect, that if you think about all those charge-offs that would have happened -- many of that would have happened in the pandemic, but didn't. Some of them may have gotten reprieved for the long run, but a bunch of others we certainly have felt are going to charge-off over time. And that is a temporary effect that we think has been playing out over this normalization thing. It's not -- we have ways that we try to measure it, but nobody can precisely measure this. But this is also something that leads to an elevation of charge-offs relative to probably what's an equilibrium. So if I speak from Capital One's point of view, our guidance was to guide you to the leveling-off. Because of the lower recoveries effect right now, that's leveling off at 15% above 2019. The underlying credit dynamics seem very similar to me, to what was there in the past. I think there, even as we keep a wary eye on the economy, there is some just sort of actuarial good guys making their way through the business and all the other things being equal. That can help the credit metrics more and more show that they're strikingly similar to what was there before the pandemic. So pulling way up, I don't think, and again, I'll speak, I don't think things have shifted. I think we're seeing some trends playing out, but for Capital One we're -- we feel great about where we have stabilized and we see really good -- a good assessment of our future.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich -- to Andrew, Mr. Young? Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter, Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $3.13 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter was a $42 million additional accrual for our updated estimate of the FDIC special assessment.  Net of this adjusting item, first quarter earnings per share were $3.21. Relative to the prior quarter, period-end loans held for investment decreased 2% and  period-end deposits increased 1%. Both average loans and average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits remained at 82% of total deposits. Pre-provision earnings in the first quarter increased 13% from the fourth quarter or 6% adjusting for the impacts of FDIC special assessments in both quarters.  Revenue in the linked quarter declined 1%, largely driven by lower noninterest income. Noninterest expense decreased 6% on an adjusted basis, driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses. Our provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion in the quarter, a decrease of $174 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by $57 million lower net reserve build, partially offset by an $83 million increase in net charge-offs.  Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We built $91 million in allowance this quarter, bringing the balance to $15.4 billion, an increase of less than 1% from the fourth quarter. The slight increase in allowance balance was driven by modest builds in our Auto and Domestic Card portfolios. Our total portfolio coverage ratio increased 11 basis points to 4.88%. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5.  Our baseline economic forecast modestly improved this quarter compared to what we assumed last quarter, which generally aligns with consensus. We continue to consider a range of economic outcomes in our reserving process. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance coverage ratio increased by 22 basis points to 7.85%. The increase in coverage was primarily driven by the denominator effect of the runoff of the fourth quarter's seasonal outstandings.  In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance increased by $46 million, resulting in a 7 basis point increase to the coverage ratio. The allowance increase was primarily driven by a higher level of originations in the Auto Finance business. And finally, our Commercial Banking allowance decreased by $7 million, primarily driven by portfolio contraction. Coverage ratio increased by 1 basis point to 1.72%. Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased to $127 billion, about $7 billion higher than last quarter. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $51 billion, up about $8 billion from the prior quarter. The increase in cash was driven by continued strong deposit growth in our retail banking business and the seasonality of our card balances. Our average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter remained strong and well above regulatory minimums at 164%. Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.69%, 4 basis points lower than last order and 9 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in NIM was largely driven by the impact of having 1 fewer day in the quarter. Modestly higher asset yields were mostly offset by higher funding costs in the quarter. Turning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.1%, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Strong earnings and lower risk-weighted assets more than offset the impact of CECL phase in dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $100 million of shares in the first quarter. Our repurchase activity in the quarter was impacted by blackout restrictions and daily purchase volume limitations related to the announcement of the Discover transaction. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows first quarter results in our Credit Card business. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Top line growth trends in the Domestic Card business remained strong in the first quarter. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the first quarter was 6%. Ending loan balances increased $12.9 billion or about 10% year-over-year. Average loans increased 11%, and first quarter revenue was up 12% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 5.94%, about 18% above its pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of 2019. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 82 basis points from the prior year to 4.48%. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 59 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 13 basis points. The linked-quarter delinquency and charge-off rate trends were modestly worse than what we would expect from normal seasonality. We believe this is largely driven by lower and later tax refund payments to consumers so far in 2024, relative to what we've historically observed.  Tax refunds are an important factor in credit seasonality. Each year, they drive an improvement in delinquency payments and recoveries starting in February. Our portfolio trends generally have a more pronounced seasonal pattern than the industry average. Last quarter, our view was that the charge-off rate was settling out about 15% above 2019 levels in the near term. That was based on an extrapolation of our delinquency inventory and flow rates over 3 to 6 months, and that was the horizon of our estimate.  If the trend of lower tax refunds sustains, it could raise the level of charge-off somewhat in the near term but this does not change our view that credit is settling out modestly above pre pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019. The continuing deceleration in the pace of credit normalization trends sometimes referred to as the improving second derivative supports our view. The pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the first quarter.  Domestic Card noninterest expense was up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023, with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense. Total company marketing expense of about $1 billion for the quarter was up 13% year-over-year. Total company marketing drives growth and builds franchise in our Domestic Card and Consumer Banking businesses and builds and leverages the value of our brand. Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation.  Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic Card business. And in the first quarter, Domestic Card marketing also included higher early spend businesses driven by strong new account growth, higher media spend and increased marketing for franchise enhancements like our travel portal, airport lounges and Capital One shopping. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our Domestic Card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks.  Slide 12 shows first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the first quarter, Auto originations increased 21% from the prior year quarter, a return to growth after several quarters of year-over-year declines. Consumer Banking ending loans decreased about $3.1 billion or 4% year-over-year, on a linked quarter basis ending loans were essentially flat. We posted another quarter of year-over-year growth in consumer deposits. First quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up just under $10 billion or 3% year-over-year.  Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 6% year-over-year and up 1% from the sequential quarter, powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 13% year-over-year, largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs.  Noninterest expense was down about 3% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The Auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.99%,  up 46 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.28%, up 28 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 20 basis points, while the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 106 basis points. The linked-quarter charge-off rate improvement modestly underperformed the typical seasonal patterns we've historically observed driven by the tax refund trends I just discussed. Even with the tax refund effects, auto credit performance remains strong.  Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 5% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 8%. The declines are largely driven by our continued choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. First quarter revenue was up 2% from the linked quarter. Noninterest expense was up about 6%. The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the first quarter decreased 40 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.13%. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.39%  down 42 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized nonperforming loan rate increased 44 basis points to 1.28%.  Commercial credit risks continue to be most pronounced in the commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of total company loan balances.  In closing, we continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter. We posted another quarter of top line growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans. Domestic Card credit trends continue to stabilize and Auto credit trends remained stable and in line with normal seasonal patterns. We grew consumer deposits and we added liquidity and maintain capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Over the last decade, we've driven significant operating efficiency improvement even as we've invested to transform our technology, and we continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time.  For the full year 2024, we continue to expect annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be flat to modestly down compared to 2023. Our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed CFPB late fee rule, assuming the rule takes effect in October 2024. The timing of the new rule remains uncertain. If the rule were to take effect at an earlier date, it would be a headwind to the 2024 operating efficiency ratio.  Of course, the biggest news in the quarter was our announcement that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Discover. We've submitted our application for regulatory approval and we're fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration. The combination of Capital One and Discover creates game changing strategic opportunities. The Discover payment  position Capital One as a more diversified, vertically integrated global payments platform and adding Capital One's debit spending and a growing portion of Credit Card purchase volume to the Discover network will add significant scale, increasing the network's value to merchants, small businesses and consumers and driving enhanced network growth.  In the Credit Card business, we're bringing together 2 proven franchises with complementary strategy and a shared focus on the customer. And we can accelerate the growth of our national digital first consumer banking business by adding the Discover's consumer deposit franchise and the vertical integration benefits of the debt network.  We will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11 years transformation across every business and the network, which will serve as the catalyst for innovation and enhanced capabilities in risk management and compliance underwriting marketing and customer service. Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create Consumer Banking and global payments platform with unique capability, modern technology, powerful brands and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and it offers the potential to create significant value for merchants and customers, and an unparalleled strategic and economic upside over the long term.  And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We'll now start Q&A session there. [Operator Instructions] Josh, please start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So Rich, maybe just start off on credit.  It sounds like you're running a little bit ahead of what you had outlined in the last quarter. But when you put aside the time the tax refund, maybe just talk about what you're seeing from the consumer? And do you think we've now reached the inflection where we can more closely follow seasonal patterns? And once the noise settles, do you think we're kind of back at that 15% level that you had outlined? Richard Fairbank : Thank you, Ryan. Look, I think that the story continues to be one of -- well, in terms of -- there's sort of the consumer itself. Let's just talk about the consumer for a second and then let's talk about Capital One's credit performance but just the health of the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer remains a source of strength in the economy. The labor market remains strikingly resilient.  Rising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing burdens relatively low by historical standards. And when we look at our customers, we see that they have higher bank balances than before the pandemic, and this is true across income levels.  On the other hand, of course, inflation shrank real incomes for almost 2 years. And in this high interest rate environment, the cost of new borrowing has gone up in every major asset class. And I think at the margin, these effects stretch some consumers financially. So -- but on the whole, I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative -- pretty strong shape relative to historical benchmarks. So in terms of Capital One's performance, we continue to see a settling out. We consider -- we believe that for Capital One, I can't speak for all card issuers but we definitely have seen what we think is sort of a landing.  And our -- so we feel very good about where the credit is. The point that I wanted to make about the tax refunds, let's just pull up for a second on that. The tax refunds are something that nobody knows for sure exactly what's behind seasonality but I think it's a -- we believe, a very important driver of seasonality. It's a bigger effect for us than other players because I think cash refunds just play a little bit bigger role in -- collectively across our customer base.  So the tax refunds in the very near-term effect credit performance, Ryan, what you're referring to the 15% guidance that we gave, that was not an annual guidance number that was saying, if we just extrapolate in the very near window of just what we see in terms of delinquencies and delinquency roll rates. That's where we would see charge-offs, and charge-offs tend to be higher in the first half of the year. So what we're doing is giving a window to the higher part of charge-offs for the year, and we were saying they were settling out looked like around 15% above 2019 levels.  Part of that -- and so basically, what I'm saying is that includes our assumptions about what happens with tax refund and the seasonality effect. As we can see in the government data, tax refunds are lower and later than by historical patterns. And so that affects our near-term credit performance. And actually, we often talk about, well, isn't the 6-month window basically once charge-offs start bubbling and going through the roll rate buckets we can pretty much see where charge-offs are going. Tax refunds actually affect the payment rates in every bucket.  So our point was in the very near term, it actually leads to a bit of a higher charge-off rate than we had guided to over that near window. But that doesn't change our view that credit has settled out but the 15% was not a guidance for the year. We haven't really given credit guidance for the year. What we're really saying is we have seen credit settle out but we wanted to just flag that both in the Credit Card business and in our Auto business while credit continues to be very strong, and you've seen things like really improving delinquencies, we just wanted to point out that in the very near term, relative to what we have seen in terms of historical seasonality and kind of confirmed by what we watch as the patterns of tax refunds, there is -- it's coming in lower and later. And we just wanted to flag that effect because it affects the very near-term numbers that we cited earlier. Ryan Nash : Got it. Maybe as my quick follow-up for Andrew. I guess, given Rich's answer, what does that mean for the trajectory of the allowance? It seems like we've heard a handful of other issuers talk about us being at the peak or maybe even coming down and potentially being below where it ended the prior year. Can you maybe just talk about what you think this means for Capital One, given your credit expectations? Andrew Young : Yes. Sure, Ryan. I'd like to say from my perspective that there's a simple answer but there's not. And then there's a host of things that are going to drive allowance from here, not the least of which is growth, but just focusing on coverage and assuming that's what others are pointing to. The first thing I'd highlight and I said in my talking points that fourth quarter had seasonal balances, they quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore, have negligible coverage, which we see every year.  So the coverage ratio this quarter up a bit from last quarter is really a result of that dynamic. But if you look at coverage ratio now, it's largely in line with the preceding quarters, I mean, the biggest driver as we look ahead, are the projected loss rates. And as we've been saying for a number of quarters, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that. And so every quarter, we're going to look out over the next 12 months and then the reversion from there. And we're going to take into account a range of outcomes and uncertainties. And so you've seen over the last few quarters, keeping the coverage ratio flat. I will note, though, even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might indicate a release otherwise, you could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declined as we incorporate the uncertainty of that future projection into the allowance.  And so eventually, the projected losses will -- when they're lower will flow through the allowance and bring the coverage ratio down as those uncertainties become more certain. And under that scenario, you would see a decline. But at this point, like I'm not going to be in the forecasting business of when that actually is going to take into account because, like I said, we really need to take the factor of uncertainty as we look ahead every quarter that we go through the reserving process. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Rich, if I could switch for a second to the Discover acquisition. There's been a lot of talk around deal approval, particularly focusing around potential antitrust issues within the Card business. And I was wondering if you could share your thoughts and perspective on that issue if you've heard anything from regulators but also just to hear how you are thinking about that issue? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thank you, Mihir. So we have filed our merger applications with both the Fed and the OCC and we are engaged with the -- sorry, with the DOJ as they, of course, play a key role in advising the Fed and the OCC on competition questions. We believe our applications make a very compelling case for approval. We believe strongly that this merger will increase competition among banks and credit card issuers and payment networks, and provide significant benefits for consumers, merchants and the communities that we serve. While some have raised concerns about competition, we believe that the facts in favor of the deal will be compelling.  On the network side, let's remember that we're not currently in that business. If the deal is approved,  we will still have 4 networks just like we do today but we will be adding new customers and scale to the smallest by far of the 4 networks and be able to leverage our technology talent and marketing capabilities to greatly enhance Discovery's competitive viability. Their market share was 6% a decade ago and sits at just 4% today. The significant investments that we are planning will provide substantial benefits for consumers and merchants as we've outlined in our regulatory applications.  On the Credit Card side, the regulators have found every time they've studied it that the credit card market is highly competitive and not at all concentrated. In fact, it's less concentrated today than it was 10 years ago. Consumers can choose from over 4,000 issuers, all able to offer products with similar capabilities. Imagine this, a card issued by a small credit union can be used every place that a card issued by a bank like Capital One can be used, anywhere in the world, that kind of level playing field doesn't exist in any other industry and certainly not in airlines or grocery stores or many of the others. There's a reason that we ask folks what's in your wallet. We compete not only with these 4,000 other issuers to gain your business in the first place but also with every other card you likely already own. Put another way, we have to compete every day for every single transaction because our customers can simply choose at any moment to use another card. And if they don't like the card they have, they can stop using it entirely or close the account or switch to another card with another bank, large or small, in minutes.  We also believe that the facts will show that there are no barriers to entry in the credit card business as thousands of current issuers and the new ones are forming all the time demonstrate. New and incumbent fintechs backed by significant VC funding are able to leverage the infrastructure of sort of credit card as a service players like Marqeta to achieve instant scale and high growth.  Also, any existing bank can choose where in the credit spectrum they play simply by changing their credit policy. Let's also remember that consumers can choose to use another form of payment entirely, cash, debit or buy now pay later, which has exploded onto the marketplace. New fintechs are entering the payments in small-dollar credit space every day all looking to take market share from traditional credit card players like Capital One. We faced this competition for years and we'll continue to face it in the future. It's powerful evidence of a healthy and fiercely competitive marketplace.  But we have been successful by focusing on the needs of our customers and offering credit card and retail banking products with the most straightforward terms and fewest fees in the industry. We're the only major bank where all of our deposit products come with no fees, no minimums and no overdraft fees. So pulling way up,  we believe the facts will show that this transaction is both pro-competitive and pro-consumer, bringing our best-in-class products and services to a broader set of consumers and small businesses and greatly enhancing opportunities and benefits for merchants. In the end, that is what we believe the regulators will use their very vigorous process to evaluate. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. That is helpful. Just turning back to the health of the consumer for a second for my follow-up. If you could just talk a little bit about the environment for card acquisitions, you did mention, I think, that the growth you see good growth opportunities in the card business. So wondering if you can expand on that. Maybe talk about just some of the puts and takes as you consider where to make those investments? Are there parts of the market where you're being more cautious given the environment? Richard Fairbank : Mihir, we are leaning in pretty much across the board in the card business, powered by a healthy consumer and the traction that we're getting in our business, we are really all parts of the card business are seeing very nice account originations, seeing good traction on the purchase volume side. And -- so it's very much a positive time for leaning in, as you see reflected in our marketing, as you see reflected in some of the growth numbers, and as I see in numbers behind the numbers that you see, just a lot of traction. And just -- let's just savor for a second, some of the things that are powering that are 2 things that I would flag is : one, the continued investment that we are making to win at the top of the market. And I think that not only affects our success at the top of the market but I really believe there's a lifting of all boats from those investments and that traction there.  Also we continue to just have a lot of success powered by our technology transformation, including not only the customer experience and some of the product capabilities that we're able to offer but really impacts on the whole way that we run the business and very notably on the credit and marketing side of the business, the ability to create mass customized offerings and real-time solutions just enables us to have more traction on the growth side.  Also, I just want to say that we also are pleased to see things picking up in the Auto business and also we continue to have a lot of traction on our national bank. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : Rich, I want to make sure I fully understand what you're describing in terms of credit. The framework is that charge-off rates will be about 15% higher than '18, '19 levels in the near term. But now with tax refunds, it might be a little bit higher than that, that over time, it will converge back towards slightly above '18, '19 levels. When I look at the delinquencies. And 1 of the things we've observed is that role from delinquency to charge-off is actually higher than it has been pretty much at any time in recent history. Does that suggest that delinquencies actually need to get back below '18, '19 levels to achieve that level of charge-off performance? Richard Fairbank : So Rick, there's a lot. First of all, let me clarify some of the things that you were saying weren't exactly I think as we intended to state them. So let me just -- so we talked about -- so yes, we talked about credit. We're saying credit settling out. We said in the very near term, where charge-offs are tend to be higher in the first half of the year. In the near term, based on extrapolation from delinquency buckets and roll rates we would expect them to settle out at 15% higher than pre-pandemic. That was a near-term forecast. That was not an annual forecast. And then you -- just to clarify your comments that, and over time, it will converge back to slightly above 2018 and 2019. I just want to say those are your words, not ours. We have not given guidance on full year charge-offs. We tend not generally to give guidance on full year charge-offs. But we very much like to give you the feel of how things are going.  So we are very much see credit settling out. You can see that the trends that continue on the second derivative of delinquencies, and that's a very positive thing. The -- there's another factor that affects charge-offs, which is recoveries. And the recoveries have been -- we've been saying for quite some time, recoveries are lower than usual because of the very low charge-offs we saw over the past 3 years. So that all else equal, pushes up net losses relative to pre-pandemic levels. And that impacts probably larger and more prolonged for us than for some of our competitors because we tend to have higher recovery rates than the industry probably as a result of our business mix and our strategy, and we tend to work most of our recoveries in-house rather than selling debt. So we see a longer tail of recoveries from past charge-offs than most do. So by the way, the recoveries, we had talked about recoveries. There probably sort of been at their bottom in terms of that brown out and over time probably heading in a more positive direction. But that also impacts the relationship between charge-offs, prepandemic and where they are today. So pulling way up, we don't have guidance for credit for the year. We continue to be very happy about charge-offs the way after years of -- after a long period of normalization, that charge-offs are settling out. We've given -- we just wanted to flag that the seasonality, let's just comment -- let's just pause for a second on the seasonality. It still remains to be seen whether the tax refunds are just lower end of story or whether they're later The key thing right now is they are lower cumulatively than they have been -- than they were pre-pandemic for this period of time. And what will take a look at is how it plays out from here to see how much was just later and how much was lower.  But what we're saying is, to the extent that it's lower than that impacts in the very near term the charge-off numbers that we had talked about before. But it doesn't change our view about Credit settling out. It doesn't change our view about very positively about the Consumer, about Credit performance, but it's just something we wanted to flag across both the Credit Card and Auto business. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : I guess back to the Discover combination, any update to your thoughts around the timing of the deal close? I know the Fed, the OCC just extended the comment period. And I know you put out there, you expect late '24, early '25. So any change in terms of your expectation around the timing of the close or any of the key financial metrics that you set out? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thanks, John. So let me comment on the Federal Reserve and the OCC extending the comment period. It's standard practice for the Federal Reserve to extend the comment period on bank mergers. We expected the extension and we don't take any signaling on our deal from the Fed's decision here. So with respect to the overall timing, the Fed and the OCC typically take several months to work through bank merger applications in consultation with the DOJ on competition questions and they engage frequently with our team along the way. And of course, that process is underway. And we continue to have the same views about the timing of all of this that we did at the time of the announcement. John Pancari : Okay. Okay. Great. And then separately, just regarding the -- your expectation on the CET1 front for a pro forma CET1 ratio of about just shy of 14%. Any change to that expectation? And any change to your thoughts around buyback activity in the near term? Could you remain active on that front? Andrew Young : Yes, John, with respect to the deal, I'll just say, as we talked about when we announced it, we, at the time, used a blend of consensus estimates of where we would have the CET1 at the time of close. There's a number of variables that are going to move between now and in legal day 1, not just the stand-alone performance of each of our companies but balance sheet marks, some of which are driven by credit and stock price. And so I'm not going to be in the business of sort of recasting every time a little number moves. But I will say our valuation of the deal considered a wide range of outcomes. And so we remain just as excited today about the financial and strategic benefits of the transaction as we did when we announced the deal.  With respect to our stand-alone repurchases, Capital Ones, I'll note that the agreement with Discover does not prohibit us from buying shares. I noted in my prepared remarks, we were blacked out for a period leading up to the deal. And afterwards, the SEC has safe harbor rules that limit the daily average amount of purchases we can do for a period of time after the announcement. So as a result of those limitations, Q1 had a pace that was less than what we've done in recent quarters. I will also just note that there's also blackout restrictions on repurchases during the proxy vote period. But again, outside of those blackouts, we're not prohibited, and we're able to continue repurchasing shares. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Moshe Orenbuch : Rich, putting aside the tax refund thing, I mean, yours -- we're sitting here looking you've still got what has been a somewhat persistently high inflation environment and the potential for increases in unemployment, given the nature of your portfolio, you've got kind of a lower end consumer and higher-end consumer. How do you think about that, those factors in terms of thinking about what type of charge-off level you're going to reach over some period of time, not a particular point in time, but over some point in the next year or 2, like where you think about that -- they driving a higher level of charge-off expectations? Or how should we think about that? Richard Fairbank : Moshe, so our -- I think what you're partly getting at is because we have -- part of our portfolio is subprime consumers, how do we feel about how they're performing and sort of in the context of an environment of higher inflation and so on. Let me just comment a little bit about the subprime consumer. In the global financial crisis, we observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions, subprime -- we saw that, but then we saw sort of everything move proportionately, in fact, subprime moved frankly, somewhat less proportionately than prime as a multiple, but obviously, all portfolios worsened quite a bit during the global financial crisis in the pandemic, subprime credit improved more and more quickly than prime but it also began to normalize more quickly, too. And of course, that's in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and then unwinding that over time. And subprime is, of course, not synonymous with lower income, although they are somewhat correlated. So on the other hand, so if we look at how they have been doing, the income growth from -- for say, lower-income consumers has been consistently higher over the past several years. And we have seen really quite -- other than the tax refund effect, which does show up more in our lower end part of our customer base than the higher credit end. Really, we have seen the subprime performance be very strong. It just worsened faster. And then on a proportional basis, everything caught up with it. But it frankly always seems to be a first mover, and it settled out, frankly, a little bit earlier than -- started settling out a little bit earlier than the rest of our portfolio.  So based on current performance, we feel very good across the credit spectrum. We also -- it certainly catches our attention when we see the inflation specter sort of become greater lately. So we have a real eye on that. As you know, we continue to look at the marketplace and trim around the edges and so on. But the net impression that I would leave you is we continue to feel very good about really the full spectrum of our customers, we continue to lean into the growth opportunities. We have, for some time, just been doing some trimming around the edges and just being a little tighter on the credit lines and things like that credit line increases. But the impression that I want to leave with you is that we are still pretty feel good about this marketplace and the growth opportunities there. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up question. You alluded to or Andrew alluded to the fact that you expect that late fee -- you can still kind of achieve your objectives from a efficiency ratio even with the late fee coming into effect. But could you talk a little bit about your thoughts about any mitigating efforts that you're planning or in the process of doing? Or is it something that you're going to try and use from a competitive standpoint to take share? How do you think about it? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thanks, Moshe. So let's just pull up and reflect on the fact that the CFPB's rule on late fees is scheduled to take effect on May 14. We are prepared to implement the rule on this time line, if necessary, but ongoing litigation efforts continue to create uncertainty on the ultimate outcome and the timing of the rule. As we've said before, when the rule is implemented, there will be significant impact to our P&L. We expect that this impact will gradually resolve itself within a couple of years from the implementation of our mitigating actions. These mitigating actions include changes to our policies, products and investment choices. Some of these mitigating actions have already been implemented and are underway. We are planning on additional actions once we learn more about where the litigation settles out. Ultimately, these mitigating actions will play through different line items in the P&L and will mitigate the impact of the late fee rule on our P&L within a couple of years of their implementation. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : Yes. Rich, can you provide your latest thoughts on auto lending? I know a lot of focus has been around cards, but -- and used car prices have been a little bit lighter recently as well as the tax issue. Maybe talk a bit about a potential pivot there. Richard Fairbank : Yes. So we're feeling very good about the Auto business. So let's just pull way up. Auto industry margins have recovered somewhat over the past few quarters. Our origination volumes in Q1 were up 20% on a year-over-year basis and a quarter-over-quarter basis, and we're pleased with that growth. Now there are still headwinds to the auto business. Affordability remains a concern due to the combined effects of high interest rates and still high car prices. And even as car prices have normalized significantly from their peaks, they haven't yet reached a new equilibrium. So we anticipated the risks in this business, tightening up credit back in 2022, I think, several quarters before some of our competitors. As a result, the performance of recent originations from '22 and '23 has been really strong and frankly, even better than our pre-pandemic originations. And vintage over vintage, that risk remains stable. And as margins have recovered a bit, we're seeing an opportunity to lean back in. So our years of investments in industry-leading technology and credit infrastructure have allowed us to remain nimble and enabled us to make targeted adjustments to our origination strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risks. So looking ahead, we remain confident in the business that we're booking and bullish about the opportunities for growth. So we continue to set pricing in terms that we're comfortable with and feel good about the opportunities that we see in the market. And after talking for really a couple of years about sort of dialing back. I think this is sort of a period where it's moving more into a leaning into it situation for Capital One. And we're, I think, very benefited by the choices that we made over the last couple of years and seeing very strong performance in our vintages. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Rich, I think your point on tax refund is clearly a very valid one. Interestingly, though, to your point on the second derivative, that's improved quite nicely even into March. And I think when I look at the tax refund stats now from the IRS, it seems like you've seen a catch-up in refunds and it seems like the average refund numbers have kind of come in line with last year, if not slightly higher. So I think those are improving, too. Is there a lag effect there? So like should we see that more pronounced if that's the case in April and May? How has been in the past? Richard Fairbank : Yes. So I can see that you're a student of tax refunds. Just think of all the areas of expertise that you've developed over the years trying to really get your head around this credit card business, things that neither you nor I thought we would really have to learn. Let me make a couple of comments here. So a key question is what are we benchmarking things too. So relative to -- if we talk about relative to last year, the things were even lagging relative to last year, and they've actually crossed over very, very recently crossed over the curve from last year, which I think you're referring to. But then last year really was somewhat of an outlier relative to pre-pandemic.  Now one might ask, well, why didn't we just used last year as the seasonality benchmark? Last year itself was an odd year. And from a credit point of view with all the normalization. It was hard to read things through the noise. As we watch the patterns this year, we're going to really end up comparing by the time it's done, how this year compares to last year and whether collectively this year and last year represent sort of a new seasonality that we have to modify relative to the past. I think it's premature on that. And relative to reading seasonality, it's really hard to look at last year's credit metrics just because there was so much normalization.  So we've had an eye on this. We have tended to stick with our seasonality benchmarks, which are developed over a number of years. And I think when this is -- when we're done with this period, we'll sit back and look at it and say, did we learn something about the business that where seasonality might be less magnified in a business like ours than it was before. I think it is too early to tell. But to your other point, even relative to last year, it has very recently crossed over in terms of tax refunds. And yes, to your point, these are things that themselves then have lag effects because people have to get the refunds then they have to make payments. So this is why very much we are flagging a phenomenon that is sort of in the middle of happening. And the key thing will be by the time it's done was the cumulative tax refund effect. And we're just kind of sharing with you as we go along.  And the reason I'm particularly leaning into this particular one is because last time we made a very near-term sort of extrapolation just from our windows of delinquency buckets about where the -- given that in a year, the high part of the year is in the first half of the year, we were just kind of saying in that high part of the year, where things were sort of settling out. And I wanted to give that a little bit -- we're not revising the number but just to say if the seasonality patterns are probably driven by the tax refund effect if it doesn't catch up to historical patterns, then in the very near term, the numbers will be higher than that in this very -- this window we're talking about higher than the 15% number that I said. Sanjay Sakhrani : Understood. Understood. The second derivative looked good nonetheless for March. Richard Fairbank : Right. So look, can I just -- I want to just seize that point. The second derivative continues to be strong. In fact, when you look at sort of all the card players, you can see the strength of Capital One's second derivative. There's another topic, so you didn't know when you were studying all that calculus that this would be at the heart of what you do. But -- so there's lots of good to pull from this. I just wanted to just clarify the tax refund effect, which I think has a little bit more impact on Capital One than certain other players and to point out that we actually think we see that effect in both of our consumer businesses. Sanjay Sakhrani : Great. Just one follow-up for Andrew. Just on the capital return question earlier. Can we step up the run rate relative to some of the last quarters as we look ahead? I know there's been a lot of volatility on some of the regulatory proposals on capital. But as we look ahead, I know there's no limitations but can we see a step up in the level of capital return relative to the past few quarters as we look ahead, given your capital levels today? Andrew Young : Well, there's 2 parts to that, Sanjay. The first is, given the transaction, we are in the process of submitting a new capital plan. So that's just a procedural piece. So once that new capital plan is approved, then we have unlimited capacity relative to the SCB in this intervening period, the amount that we repurchase is constrained to what we've requested. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Rich and Andrew, following up on your comments on Auto, how much of an advantage is your excess capital position? Are you seeing competitors who are capital constrained and perhaps can't take advantage of the attractive market conditions to the same degree? And then I'll just ask my follow-up now. As Capital One continues to grow, could you speak to your category 2 preparedness? Andrew Young : Yes, I'll start, Bill, with the -- Rich, do you want to do the... Richard Fairbank : Competitive dynamics in auto. Here my observation about the auto business is that it's still a very competitive marketplace. But when we see our opportunities to grow, we tend to zig a little bit while others zag. And so we sort of pulled back for a little while and others leaned in. And my point is really now I think we're leaning in and others are pulling back a little bit more. I hadn't really sort of analyzed it in terms of really capital choices really as much as just the very natural rhythms of the marketplace and some of the advantages that Capital One has by virtue of our choices that we made over the last couple of years. But we'll have to think about that. But I just think this is just very much sort of as you've seen numerous times in the past where there's a little bit of an inflection point for Capital One at a time that's a little different and occasionally in a different direction than the inflection points of others. Andrew Young : And then, Bill, with respect to category 2. Well, first, let me just note, we're going to be below the $700 billion threshold at closing and the trigger is really a 4-quarter average beyond that. So I just wanted to mention the specifics of what is going to trigger it. But within category 2 to category 3, there's really 3 big distinctions. The first one is losing the tailoring benefit for LCR and NSFR, and you can see based on the ratios that we hold there and our conservatism around liquidity. We feel very well prepared. The other 2, which are the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital and the DTA threshold going from 25 to 10. Those are both already included at least in what was proposed for the Basel III end game rules. We all know that those proposals are being debated and refined. But ultimately, we're looking at those 2 implications as part of the proposal anyway. And so we don't really see a big difference in the long-term implications, at least as we sit today, again, the proposal may take a different form. But from a planning perspective, those were 2 things that we already had our eye on. And so we ultimately feel well prepared all of the implications of either category 2 or the Basel III end game proposals if they were to go in as currently constructed. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And our final question comes from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Jeffrey Adelson : Rich, I just wanted to circle back on your comment about how you continue to kind of trim around the edges. I think last quarter, you were suggesting that the trimming was sort of abating after a number of years of trimming. But given your comments today about how you're continuing to lean in, how the U.S. consumer remains a strength of source, how are you thinking about potentially opening up the credit box a little bit more from here? And relatedly, does the pending deal with Discover factor into how you're thinking about allocating capital at all into more growth at this point? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Jeff. We -- the trimming around the edges is, of course, what we do all the time and reactively to not only what we observe in the marketplace but what we think may be coming in the marketplace. We are very much sort of in the same place we were three months ago when we've been talking about this. In other words, the trimming around the edges and the dialing back was a little bit more pronounced in the quarters during the big credit normalization than it has been as we see things settling out. And the drivers of that continue to be -- probably -- in addition to what I said about the consumer, very much also the -- observing our credit performance, not only just the overall portfolio performance but very much the performance of our originations.  And strikingly, our originations continue to come out generally on top of each other quarter after quarter. Obviously, that's lagged data that we're viewing but we're -- we've been struck by how long it's been and how consistently it's been that our originations have been generally on top of each other. And a lot of that comes from the trimming around the edges that we have been doing even as there's been some underlying a little bit sort of worsening of overall consumer credit metrics. So we're in a very similar place to where we were. We feel good about our credit performance and origination performance. We are leaning in across the credit spectrum.  With respect to the Discover deal, it's not really altering our origination strategy that's very much continuing as it was before. Obviously, we're very excited about the Discover deal. But I think that with respect to our own strategy it's really pretty much the same as it was before. Jeffrey Adelson : And I also wanted to just ask really quickly about the small business car strategy. I know you recently just launched that new Venture X business card recently. It seems like a really unique value proposition with the charge card component. Can you just talk a little bit more about the opportunity to drive growth there and maybe how that's going so far? Any early reason to the type of customers you're getting? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Yes, Jeff. So we launched the Venture X business card, broadly in the third quarter of last year, and we're pleased with the market response and the customer engagement so far. So Venture X business, much like our Spark cash plus card was developed to help business owners run and invest in their business with no preset spending limit, great travel benefits and elevated earn everywhere. And it's a great example of our business is leveraging each other's innovations because we've taken many of the industry-leading travel features of our consumer Venture X product and combine them with the business-grade capabilities of our small business offerings, including the flexible spending capacity that is designed for larger businesses. So we have been investing in our small business card program, and more broadly, to win at the top of the market for years. And this launch stands on the shoulders of all of that investment, it stands on the shoulders of our technology transformation and is another example in the continuing drive of Capital One to win at the top of the market across consumers and small business. So I appreciate the question and we certainly are excited by our continuing progress. Jeff Norris : Thanks, Rich and Andrew. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this evening and for your continuing interest in Capital One. Have a great evening. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And with that done, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew? Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $597 million or $1.38 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter were adjusting items related to the Walmart partnership termination, Discover integration costs, and an accrual for our updated estimate of the FDIC's special assessment. Net of these adjusting items, second quarter earnings per share were $3.14. Relative to the prior quarter, period end loans held for investment increased 1%, while average loans were flat. Ending deposits were flat versus last quarter, while average deposits increased 1%. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits increased 1 percentage point to 83% of total deposits. Pre-provision earnings in the second quarter increased 7% from the first quarter. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1%, driven by higher net and non-interest income, while non-interest expense decreased 4%, driven by a decline in operating expense. Our provision for credit losses was $3.9 billion in the quarter. The $1.2 billion increase in provision relative to the prior quarter was almost entirely driven by higher allowance. Included in the second quarter was an $826 million allowance built from the elimination of the loss sharing provisions that occurred within the termination of the Walmart partnership. The remaining quarter-over-quarter provision increase was driven by a $353 million higher net reserve build and a $28 million increase in net charge-offs. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We built $1.3 billion in allowance this quarter. The allowance balance now stands at $16.6 billion. Our total portfolio coverage ratio increased 35 basis points to 5.23%. The increase in this quarter's allowance and coverage ratio was largely driven by a build in our card segment. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our domestic card business, the allowance coverage ratio increased by 69 basis points to 8.54%. The substantial majority of the increase in coverage was driven by the impact of the termination of the Walmart loss sharing agreement. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance decreased by $23 million, resulting in a 5 basis point decrease to the coverage ratio. And finally, our commercial banking allowance increased by $6 million. Coverage ratio remained essentially flat at 1.74%. Turning to Page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased about $5 billion to approximately $123 billion. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $45 billion, down about $6 billion from the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by wholesale funding maturities, loan growth, and declines in our commercial deposits, partially offset by deposit growth in our retail banking business. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 155%, down from 164% in the first quarter. Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.7%, 1 basis point higher than last quarter and 22 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The relatively flat quarter-over-quarter NIM was the result of largely offsetting factors. NIM in the quarter benefited from the termination of the revenue sharing agreement with Walmart as well as modestly higher yields in the auto business. These two factors were roughly offset by the seasonal effects on yield in the card portfolio and a slight increase in the rate paid on retail deposits. Turning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.2%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was largely offset by the impact of dividends and $150 million of share repurchases. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement is 5.5%, resulting in a CET1 requirement of 10%. However, as we disclosed in our last 10-Q, the announcement of the acquisition of Discover constituted a material business change. As a result, we are subject to the Federal Reserve's pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows second quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the second quarter, our domestic card business delivered another quarter of strong results as we continued to invest in flagship products and exceptional customer experiences to grow our franchise. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 5%. Ending loan balances increased $11.1 billion or about 8% year-over-year. Average loans also increased about 8% and second quarter revenue was up 9%, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin for the quarter remained strong at 17.9%. The revenue margin includes a positive impact of about 18 basis points resulting from the partial quarter effect of the end of the Walmart revenue sharing agreement. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 6.05%. The partial quarter impact of the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement increased the quarterly charge-off rate by 19 basis points. Excluding this impact, the charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 5.86%, up 148 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.14%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. As a reminder, the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on delinquency rates. The pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the second quarter. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate excluding the Walmart impact was down 8 basis points and the 30 plus delinquency rate was down 34 basis points. Domestic card non-interest expense was up 5% compared to the second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher marketing expense. Total company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. Compared to the second quarter of 2023, domestic card marketing in the quarter included increased marketing to grow originations at the top of the marketplace, higher media spend, and increased investment in differentiated customer experiences, like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping. Slide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. After returning to positive growth last quarter, auto originations were up 18% year-over-year in the second quarter. Consumer banking ending loans were down $1.6 billion or 2% year-over-year and average loans were down 3%. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans were up 1% and average loans were flat. Compared to the year ago quarter, ending consumer deposits were up about 7% and average deposits were up 5%. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about 9% year-over-year, largely driven by higher deposit costs and lower average loans compared to the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 2% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.81%, up 41 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 5.67%, up 29 basis points year-over-year, largely as a result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs have been strong and stable. Slide 13 shows second quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 6% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 3%. The declines are largely driven by our continued choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Second quarter revenue was essentially flat from the linked quarter and non-interest expense was lower by about 6%. The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the second quarter increased 2 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.15%. The commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.62%, up 23 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate increased 18 basis points to 1.46%. In closing, we continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter. We delivered another quarter of top line growth in domestic card loans, purchase volume, and revenue and a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in auto originations. Consumer credit trends continued to show stability and our operating efficiency ratio improved. We had guided to 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustment to be flat to modestly down compared to 2023, assuming the CFPB late fee rule takes effect in October. And we're on a very consistent path with what we expected when we gave that guidance. If the implementation of the rule is delayed, that would be a tailwind to 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio. One thing that has changed is the Walmart relationship. Our partnership ended in the second quarter, which will increase charge-off rates, but have a positive impact on operating efficiency ratio. Including the Walmart impact, we expect full year 2024 operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments to be modestly down compared to 2023. We continue to lean into marketing to grow and to further strengthen our franchise. In the domestic card business, we continue to get traction in originations across our products and channels and our origination opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation, which enables us to leverage machine learning at scale to identify the most attractive growth opportunities and customize our marketing offers. We are also getting traction in building our franchise at the top of the market with heavy spenders. It is not lost on us that competitive intensity and marketing levels are increasing at the very top of the market and we know we have important investments to make. We continue to be pleased to see our investments pay-off in customer and spend growth and returns. And we're building and enduring franchise with annuity like revenue streams, very low losses, and very low attrition. In consumer banking, our modern technology and leading digital capabilities are powering our digital first national banking strategy, and we're leaning even harder into marketing to grow our national checking franchise, which has had industry leading pricing with no fees and industry leading customer satisfaction. Pulling up, marketing is a key driver of current and future growth and value creation across the company and we're leaning hard into our marketing investments. We expect total company marketing in the second half of 2024 to be meaningfully higher than the first half, similar to the pattern we saw last year. We are all-in and working hard to complete the Discover acquisition. Our applications for regulatory approval are in process and we're fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration. We continue to expect that we'll be in a position to complete the acquisition late this year or early next year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The combination of Capital One and Discover creates game changing strategic opportunities. The Discover payments network positions Capital One as a more diversified, vertically integrated global payments platform, and adding Capital One's debit spending and a growing portion of our credit card purchase volume to the Discover network will add significant scale, increasing the network's value to merchants, small businesses, and consumers and driving enhanced network growth. In credit cards and consumer banking, we're bringing together proven franchises with complementary strategies and a shared focus on the customer. And we will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11 year technology transformation across every business and the network. Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands, and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to create significant value for merchants and customers. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thanks, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Josh, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Rich, Andrew, just looking at the credit metrics, as Rich mentioned, it seems like the trends are pretty favorable. I mean, in most segments things are improving, if not stable. And then the U.S. card, there is an improving trend in that second derivative. I'm just curious how we should think about reserve rate going forward because I think even excluding the Walmart impact, the reserve rate went higher. Andrew Young : Sure, Sanjay. Well, let me start by covering this quarter's allowance and then I'll talk about the future. So in the quarter, as you said, first, we had the effect of Walmart, the $826 million build that we spelled out as an adjusting item. We also reserved for the growth we saw in the quarter. Beyond that coverage in card, as you referenced, grew, I think it was just over 10 basis points, which is a little over 1% of the allowance balance. And so, as part of that process each quarter, not only are we rolling forward our baseline forecast, but we're also looking at a range of macroeconomic and consumer behavior uncertainties, including things like the changing seasonal customer behavior we talked about last quarter. And so as a result, in this quarter, we increased the qualitative factors to reflect those uncertainties and that's what drove the modest increase in coverage this quarter. As I look ahead and talking conceptually here, but in a period where projected loss rates in future quarters are projected to stabilize and ultimately decline and might indicate a decline in the coverage ratio, I would say, you could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat for some period of time as we incorporate the uncertainty of those future projections into the allowance. And in a period where forecasted losses are rising, we're quick to incorporate those higher forecasted losses and also potentially add qualitative factors for uncertainty like you saw early in the pandemic, but I would say it is unlikely to be symmetric on the way down. And so eventually, the projected stabilizing and ultimately lower losses will flow through the allowance, particularly as the uncertainties around that forecast become more certain. But at this point, I'm not going to be in the business of forecasting when that's actually going to take place for us. Sanjay Sakhrani : Got it. And then, Rich, maybe you could just talk about the consumer and sort of the uncertainties there. Is there any discernible like change that you've seen since the last quarter in terms of the state of the consumer? We've obviously seen the spending trends sort of slow somewhat across the industry. But anything else to sort of point out? Richard Fairbank : Sanjay, I think what we see is something that's very stable. The U.S. consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy. Of course, the labor market remains strikingly resilient. Rising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing burdens relatively low by historical standards despite high interest rates. When we look at our customers, we see that on average, they have higher bank balances than before the pandemic and this is true across income levels. On the other hand, inflation shrank real incomes for almost two years and we've only recently seen real wage growth turn positive again. And in this high interest rate environment, the cost of new borrowing has gone up in every major asset class, mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. So we'll obviously keep an eye on that. And I think at the margin, these effects are almost certainly stretching some consumers financially. But on the whole, I think I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative to most historical benchmarks. And as our credit numbers came in five months [Technical Difficulty] I'm sorry. Can you hear me? Can you still hear me? You can hear me, okay? I just had some cross message coming in on my phone. But with respect to credit, we were very pleased with the credit performance in the quarter. We had talked a bit about the seasonality, maybe people want to ask question about that, but we saw basically pulling up, we see things settling out nicely in the card business and there things are very strong in the auto business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. You may proceed. Mihir Bhatia : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just turning to NIM for a second. With the Fed or at least expectations for rate cuts coming into view, can you just comment on the current backdrop for deposit competition? How do you -- and how do you expect deposit betas to trend during the early stages of the Fed rate cutting cycle? Richard Fairbank : Sure, Mihir. Like, what we've seen at least within our walls and you saw it as evidence of it this quarter in a quarter where seasonally you typically see a decline in deposit balances. Looking at H8 (ph) data, we saw a few -- I think it was $4 billion of growth. We've been quite pleased over the course of the last couple of years with all of the investments we've made over many years in building a deposit franchise and are certainly benefiting from that. And so with respect to the beta going forward, first, looking at what we saw in the upcycle here in the total cumulative beta that we've seen in this cycle this quarter, I think cumulatively it was 62% and so assuming that the Fed's next move is to bring rates down. It's hard to precisely predict what's going to happen to deposit costs and therefore betas, and in particular, the pace of those declines because market dynamics, competitive pricing actions, other actions related to companies looking to potentially preserve NIM, that's going to drive betas in the future cycle. But I think you get a pretty good sense for our pricing and mix based on what you saw in the upcycle and within that backdrop that I just described, that's going to influence what happens to our beta on the way down. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just switching back to the health of the customer overall. As you look across your portfolio, we've heard a little bit of talk about pull -- people pulling back, particularly on discretionary spend and lower income cohorts, etc. Is that a dynamic you are also seeing when you look at your customer base? And then relatedly, Rich mentioned how pleased he is with the progress you're making on the higher income side, if you will, on the big -- on the transactor in that high end transactor balance side. I was just wondering, how does that change your portfolio as you think about it like over the next few years, like as you grow that book further? Richard Fairbank : Yes. Well, thank you so much. Just with respect to spending, we see pretty proportional movements in discretionary versus non-discretionary spending, nothing really striking there when we look at the portfolio spending metrics. The spend per customer is really pretty flat. When you see spend growth at a company like Capital One, the purchase volume growth is really being driven by the new accounts. So things are really pretty stable, flat and stable, healthy, but pretty flat on a per-customer basis. With respect to the question about the gradual transition of our portfolio to a higher end customer, let me just pull up and talk about that. We have for decades been a company that sort of serves the mass market really from the top of the credit spectrum through to even down to some subprime customers. And we have continued very consistently with this strategy, probably the most striking thing though that's happened over the last 10 or 14 years, I guess, 14 years ago is when we launched the Venture Card. We have systematically leaned into going after the top of the market, not leaving the other behind, but really as an additive strategy. And we have continued through our marketing and through the products that we're offering to just keep moving higher and higher in terms of the target customers and the traction that we're getting. And by the way, we continue even as we're growing purchase volume overall, where we see the highest growth rates in purchase volume are as we go higher in the market. So we're very happy about that. And when we think about the portfolio effects that happened there, this is one thing that we see is that payment rates have along that journey gone up quite a bit at Capital One. And when we look to see our payment rates coming back to where they were pre-pandemic, they sort of -- they probably just aren't going to return all the way because that would be a reflection of the portfolio shift. We just in general have had the kind of mix shift that you'd expect with higher payment rates and a -- just higher levels of spend, higher spend rates in the business and that's been very successful. So -- but from an outstanding's point of view, it doesn't -- the top of the market business doesn't have that much impact on outstandings because these folks generally pay in full. So when you see the outstandings movements of Capital One, it's pretty consistently driven by the mass market part of our business. It's just that inside some of the portfolio, metrics are moving because of the mix shift toward more spenders. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed. Richard Shane : Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Look, given the breadth of your reach across the consumer income levels. Can you talk a little bit about sort of any patterns that you're seeing? We've heard, for example, some slowdown in spending for lower-income consumers. I'm curious, particularly you had made a comment earlier in the quarter about an increase in minimum payment rates. I'm curious if you're seeing anything in terms of payment behavior that we should consider by income level. Richard Fairbank : Yeah. Okay. So let's just pull up for a minute on just talking about how the subprime consumer is holding up. So, way back in the global financial crisis, we observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions. Subprime, also worsened less on a percentage basis than prime, but of course, it -- in absolute delta, it still moved more. In the pandemic, subprime credit moved more and more quickly than prime. It normalized more quickly and appears to be stable and appeared basically to stabilize sooner as well. And that's in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and forbearance on financial products and then the unwinding of that over time. And so subprime is, of course, not synonymous with lower income, although they're correlated and we saw these effects across credit both in talking about the credit spectrum and also the income gradients. So on the other hand, just a couple of other effects just on the credit side that have happened over the recent years. Subprime consumers have been subject to more industry credit supply, including fintech competition during and after the pandemic. So that's been something we've always kept a close eye on and worried about whether that was going to disproportionately impact the credit performance of subprime for customers. I don't really -- I mean, given the overall pretty strong performance in subprime, I think we haven't seen that effect too much. And another thing to point out is that income growth has been consistently higher for lower income consumers over the past several years and this is the opposite of what we saw during and after the global financial crisis. But while no two cycles alike -- are alike, I think again we're seeing that subprime consumers and lower income consumers again they're not the same thing, but they tend to move earlier, but not necessarily more than the overall market. Now when you -- let's talk a little bit about payment rates. So throughout the course of the pandemic, payment rates increased not only for us but across the industry. And more recently payment rates have drifted down from pandemic highs as the effects of stimulus have waned. And the payment rates generally we have seen this effect, so the effect that we've seen of payment rates going down relative to where they were, one to two years ago relative to their peak basically. In every part of our business, they have come down, but are still above where they were pre-pandemic. And again, I think part of that is the mix effect that we talked about in the prior question. There is a mix effect not only across our whole portfolio but even within the segments of our portfolio, we just had more emphasis on the spender side versus the revolver side internally. And so I think you see some of that showing up in the metrics. One other thing I want to say is that talk about your question about minimum payments. So we have simultaneously -- we're sort of seeing an effect where payment rates while they're going down, continue to be well above pre-pandemic levels, even as minimum -- the percentage of customers paying minimum payments. This by the way is not a subprime effect. This is a portfolio effect I'm talking about. The percent of customers paying minimum payments is also somewhat above pre-pandemic levels. Now, it seems a little odd to have both of those effects happening at the same time. But I think in many ways this is a very natural way that normalization is happening. And you've heard us talk for a long time now about what we call the delayed charge-off effect in consumer credit that so many customers got stimulus and forbearance that I think a lot of people who otherwise would have charged off were able to avoid that charge-off. Many, hopefully, we're able to permanently avoid that, but for some, we have believed it was more of a deferral of an inevitability and this phenomenon of delayed charge-offs, which can't be separately measured, we believe is a driving factor behind why credit has been settling out higher than pre-pandemic. Because I think there's just a delayed charge-off effect for some of these customers who otherwise would have charged off earlier. And that then would be consistent with a very healthy consumer payment rates generally even being higher than pre-pandemic, but there is a tail of consumers paying a higher percentage on minimum payments, and some of them going through a charge-off that might have otherwise happened a few years earlier. Richard Shane : Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Ryan Nash : Hey, good afternoon, Rich. So maybe to ask about marketing. So I think you\u2019re -- the guide that you provided said around $2.6 billion roughly of marketing spend in the second half. And you talked a little bit about the competitive intensity in the top of the market is increasing. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the increase in marketing is being driven by the -- investing more to acquire more customers versus competition pushing up the cost to acquire? And then just given what you just talked about around low end consumers, are you pulling back and else anywhere to cover the increased cost of acquiring? Richard Fairbank : Ryan, our -- yeah, our comments about the competitive intensity, let me just elaborate a little bit more about that. The card business is very competitively intense across the spectrum, it's been consistently intense. Competition has -- competition in things like rewards have certainly heated up over the last couple of years. And the thing that I was pointing out is just something that again is not something that is like the realization of the last month or so. It's a phenomenon we've seen from some -- for some time but it is striking which is at the very top of the market. We are seeing for the -- especially a couple of competitors that we have that most intensely play at the very top of the market, you can just absolutely see they are stepping up, investing more in lounges, in experiences, in dining, investing in companies, marketing levels, it's -- I'm sure all the investors can see it. We can all see it and they talk about it. And it's not lost on us that these are strong competitors and we certainly, have -- we already have had very important investment plans in these areas and we note that others are investing heavily too. So, but with respect to the -- let me just now kind of pull up now and just talk about the marketing sort of where we are from a marketing point of view. We continue to see great opportunities and really across our businesses, we remain very excited about the success of our origination activities, especially in our card products and channels and of course, what's happening in the bank. The two big areas that are driven by marketing spend. This continues to be powered by our technology transformation. And just to savor a little bit because we often point at that, why does the technology transformation help here? It gives us the ability to leverage more and more data and machine-learning models to identify the most attractive growth opportunities. And it allows us to increasingly tailor our solutions to -- down to the individual customer level to ensure that we're meeting them right where we are. So kind of the first point I would say and the key reason we're leaning into the marketing is, we are getting a lot of traction and that our tech transformation is certainly helping to power more opportunities. Secondly, we continue to expand on our success in building a franchise at the top of the market and with heavy spenders in this quest, while for years we've been talking about going after the top of the market every year as we get more traction, we reach just a little bit higher. These customers are very attractive. In addition to the obvious spend growth, they generate strong revenue, very low losses, low attrition, and the business helps elevate our brand really across the company. Now it's also something that we've known all along is that it's expensive and requires quite a bit of investment to build a business at the top of the market. In the form of upfront costs and also in the form of a sustained commitment to customer benefits and experiences and building a brand. So, yeah, you have early spend bonuses that are important cost of doing business that shows up in the marketing line item. Brand makes a huge difference and brand of course requires a long-term commitment to build. And as we continue to move up the market, we are moving increasingly into areas where consumers are looking for exclusive services and experiences that aren't available in the general marketplaces such as -- place such as airport lounges and access to select properties and iconic experiences. So we've seen at the top of the market our two biggest competitors really lean in here. And we -- when we certainly are leaning in as well, Ryan, I wouldn't -- there are some times I've seen over the years that marketing levels just rise and so you just got to market more and more and more just to hold your own. And I don't feel that we're in an environment like this. I feel that the -- certainly competitive intensity is increasing. But when we're talking about in general in the card business where competitive intensity is increasing a bit, and specifically with respect to these investments at the top of the market. These are just important things that we have to build to win at the top of the market, but we are very pleased with the traction we're getting, the economics of our heavy spender business. And so this is -- we just -- it's just not lost on us, a couple of our other competitors are very focused on the same thing. So we continue to lean into growth here, both in terms of upfront customer acquisition and our ongoing investment in brand and exclusive experiences and benefits. Now, let me now turn to the third part of our marketing story, which is our investment in building our national bank. So this has been a journey that we've been on for many, many years. When we bought ING Direct way back in 2012, we said this is going to be not only a great financial acquisition, but it's going to be a transformational strategic acquisition. Because now as a player with a significant branch network and a national direct bank, we have the building blocks to build a unique national bank. And that's what we're building, a digital first national bank. We've got smaller physical branch network. So we lean more on our cafe network, which is in cafes in 21 of the top 25 MSAs. Lean very heavily into our digital experiences and really importantly without a branch on every corner across the United States. The role for Capital One that marketing and brand play in building this national banking business is absolutely a central role. So we are very pleased with the growth that we're getting, the traction, the performance of this business and the opportunity just gets bigger when we think about in the context of the combined entity now joining force with Discover. So these are the compelling opportunities behind our marketing growth and we continue to feel really good about the success and the opportunities in front of us. And that's why we are leaning in very much into the marketing and specifically with respect to the rest of the year, why we pointed to. And of course, virtually every year at Capital One, the second half of the year has quite a bit more marketing than the first half. We pointed to the pattern kind of like what we saw last year in terms of proportional increases in marketing. Thanks, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Thanks for the color. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research Securities. You may proceed. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. Following up on your credit commentary, there had been an expectation among many investors that we would see peak charge-offs somewhere around the second half of this year, given the delinquency trends that you're seeing. Is that a reasonable expectation? And if so, it seems like your credit outlook has derisked somewhat given an improving loss trajectory, but higher reserve rate driven by qualitative factors. Is that a fair thought process? I'll just ask my follow-up as part of this. You mentioned, Andrew, that your capital return is subject to Fed approval, given the pending acquisition. How should we think about the pace of incremental buybacks as we look ahead through rest of the year? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Yeah. Bill, yeah, let me make a couple of comments on credit. Let me seize a moment in the spirit of Henry Kissinger who says, I hope you have questions for my answers. I -- let me just ask myself a question, so I can answer it because it's going to -- it's set the table for answering your question. Which you may remember last quarter, we pointed at tax refund patterns and said that there may be a new seasonality pattern emerging and it would be too early to call that but it was making it a little bit -- things were not following as closely on a month-by-month basis to some pre-pandemic delinquency patterns that our hypothesis was three months ago that we're seeing a tax refund effect. So let me just talk about that for a second and then Bill, I'll pull up and talk about just sort of what does this mean for sort of how I feel about where we are with respect to credit. So, the -- let's just talk for a second about how seasonality works. We've always seen seasonal credit patterns in our card business and our portfolio trend, they have in generally been more -- they've had more pronounced seasonal patterns than the industry average. I think that's because we have a higher subprime component and those customers are even more linked I think to the seasonal patterns associated with tax refunds, that would be our hypothesis there. Now the second quarter tends to be the seasonal low point for delinquencies and Q4 tends to be the seasonal high point for delinquencies. Card losses lag relative to delinquencies, the losses tend to be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter. Now, we believe that tax refunds, again are a significant driver of these seasonal trends. And tax refunds drive a large seasonal improvement in delinquent payments in the February, March time period, which then flows through to lower delinquencies in April and May and then to lower charge-offs. And tax refunds also drive a seasonal uptick in our recoveries. So the tax code actually new tax withholding rules went into effect way back in 2020. They were passed in 2019, went into effect in 2020, but the pandemic and the normalization since then have kind of swamped seasonality. So we haven't really got -- been able to get a really good read at it -- of it. So we've tended to benchmark to the seasonality of pre-pandemic like 2018 and 2019. But we've now had several more months to look at this pattern and we're seeing a pattern. Well, let me back up. What we've done is what we call de-trending of our credit metrics. So we in hindsight, take the trends out of them to the best we can, so we can see what the net seasonality effects are. And on a detrended basis, last year showed a seasonality with less amplitude on the high side and the low side than had previously been seen pre-pandemic. We assumed that was probably again a manifestation of the new behaviors going in with the new tax refunds. As we now have seen this tax season play out, the seasonality, the payment patterns have been very close to our de-trended 2023 line, so that we believe that we are seeing and it's very plausible, we are seeing a new seasonality. I just want to share that with investors. So later tax refunds and later and lower sort of -- lower the seasonal improvement in delinquencies. But we think the seasonal increase in delinquencies that we see in the back half of the year, likely will also be less pronounced going forward than it has been in the past. All of this by the way happens in auto seasonality but in an even faster, more concentrated way. So we -- what we see, we felt it was a little bit noisy. Last quarter when we were talking to you, we were finding each quarter things were coming in a little bit. I mean, the second derivative was still doing great things. But relative to our sort of close in expectations based on seasonality, things were a little bit off. With the revised seasonality, what we see is things very nicely settling out in card credit. And we feel very good about the last couple of months that came in relative to that new seasonality curve. So I think settling out is the real word from here. Given that from -- but to your question about peak, we're not really going to -- we're not giving really forward guidance about declarations at peak. But from a seasonal point of view, things should head down from here in Q3, and then sort of pop up around October. October is often a month, we tend to get just a little bit of an October surprise, so we'll keep an eye on that. But the other thing I just want to say about credit is our recoveries inventory is starting to rebuild and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time, all else being equal. And then other than the economy, I think the other real factor that's going to drive credit performance for us and other issuers in the next couple of years will be, what is the size of this delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic. Thank you. Andrew Young : Okay. And then, Bill, well, with respect to the derisk comment, Rich just provide a lot of color on our view of losses. I would just say, given the accounting rules, we forecast losses under a variety of scenarios and use qualitative factors for uncertainties around that. And I would say, therefore, like we are appropriately reserved for all of that. With respect to your question around repurchases, I'll just note, our agreement with Discover doesn't prohibit us from buying shares. The only restriction is that we'll need to be out of the market during the S-4 proxy vote period. However, we are not operating under the SCB. As I said in my prepared remarks and we laid out in the last Q, the announcement of the intention to acquire Discover did constitute a material business change. And therefore, like we did in this recent quarter, in the second quarter, we're subject to Fed pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. And so that's what's going to dictate the pace at which we repurchase until that process has concluded. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Don Fandetti : Yes. Rich, can you talk a bit about how you're seeing loan growth in auto? And also as banks potentially come back in, are you seeing or worried about spread or yield compression on new originations? Richard Fairbank : So, hey, Don, it's an interesting thing. We always seem to zag while others -- zig while others zag in the auto business. As we discussed in the last quarter, we have an optimistic outlook on the auto business. We're seeing a lot of success in the auto business and our investments in infrastructure are also reaping a lot of benefits for us. So just on the numbers, our originations grew 21% versus last year in Q1 and the trend continues in Q2 with 18% growth on the year-over-year quarter. And the loss performance has normalized and it's stable. We -- very importantly, we made -- intervened and made an adjustment for what we felt was credit score inflation that was happening during the pandemic. And so we pulled back in '22 and '23 by just in a sense, worsening the otherwise scores one would see under a belief that they were artificially inflated. And that enabled our vintages all through this period of time, '22, '23, and all through the normalization to perform very well. We like the economics of the loans were originated and we're very satisfied with the performance of the overall portfolio. So when we think about the headwinds in the business, interest rates remain high. And of course, that along with high vehicle values continues to pressure affordability. And auto, used car prices, which are still high relative to historical standards, they are probably in a position to gradually be coming down. So we'll have to keep an eye on that. For a long time, we were concerned about the margins in the business because competitors had not passed through higher interest rates into the cost of the auto loans. We pulled back quite a bit, Don, as you remember during that period of time. We have seen those margins basically return to where they were. So I think that's a pretty good sign there. So all things considered, with a watchful eye on used car values, we are seeing enhanced opportunities in the auto business with margins that have a good resilience to them and quite a bit improved relative to the period where we were raising the alarm bells a bit about what was happening to the effective resilience in that business. Thank you. Don Fandetti : Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And our final question this evening comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. You may proceed. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. When you talked about the increase in the reserve rate, not the dollars or the reserve, not the Walmart piece, but the reserve rate itself. Andrew, you didn't mention like mix of receivables. Is it -- has there been any shift towards mass market or subprime from super prime within the card business? Andrew Young : Not in any material way that would have a significant impact on the allowance, Moshe. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Okay. And just as a follow-up, Rich, given what's happened with Walmart and the pending Discover acquisition, could you talk a little about your thoughts on the partner or private label business kind of in the current environment? Like what are your thoughts now in terms of your existing contracts and the tendency to want to get new ones or any thoughts on that in this environment? Richard Fairbank : So, thank you. I think the -- well, the Walmart partnership is a very unique one, that I think there is not a lot to extrapolate to other partners on that. I think we've ended up in a situation there where we -- the loss share was a very good thing. So we're going to be carrying around loss rates that are something on the order of 40 basis points higher on our portfolio for that. So we'll have to just make sure we all see that, but we've got the full economics on the business increasingly that portfolio -- the portfolio we inherited is now very seasoned and the rest of it is the portfolio we ourselves originated. So we know it well. And I think that we feel very good about that. So the partnership business is a very partner-by-partner business. I think where people get into trouble is feeling they've got to drive to a certain scale. We all know scale matters in the credit card business and scale matters in the partnership business. But here's the thing, we have certainly learned over time how unique or how individual different partnerships are. And we've seen great ones, we've seen not so great ones. Here is Moshe, what we -- if I pull up on the patterns of what we most look for. It's first of all a healthy franchise, a company that is itself healthy and that's certainly a good sign. Now the credit card business does have a pretty good default structure whereby if a partner runs into trouble and can't continue, we inherit the portfolio, which now Walmart of course is a very strong company, but we're -- here's an example of inheriting a portfolio, where I think things are going to continue very successfully there. But the other thing that we really look for is what is the reason that the partner is driving this either co-brand or private-label business. Is it to -- is the -- on one end of a continuum is it\u2019s the sheer quest for profits? And on the other end of the continuum, it is having the card partnership at the -- as a centerpiece in driving a franchise. And the behaviors that a partner has, the incentives that get baked into programs, they tend to be very driven by where on that continuum one is. We've walked away from a lot of opportunities over the years where things were just too focused on the card partnership as sort of the means to drive profit for the partner at more so than a way to really build a franchise. But those are some of the patterns, there are always exceptions to every rules -- for every rule. But -- so we're still very much a believer in the card partnership business, but the key is, we're going to be selective and never knowing that it's an auction based business, that's the other thing. One has to really be willing to walk away when the price is right. So with that, those are my thoughts, Moshe. Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich, and thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Have a great evening. Operator : Thank you.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew? Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.8 billion or $4.41 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter were adjusting items related to Discover integration costs and a small downward revision to our FDIC special assessment estimate. Net of these adjusting items, third quarter earnings per share were $4.51. Pre-provision earnings in the third quarter increased 3% from the second quarter to $4.7 billion. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 5%, driven by higher net interest income. Non-interest expense increased 7%, driven by increases in both operating expense and marketing spend. Provision for credit losses was $2.5 billion in the quarter, down $1.4 billion relative to the prior quarter. The quarterly decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the second quarter's one-time allowance build for the termination of the Walmart partnership, a decline in the coverage ratio in card and a $40 million decrease in net charge-offs. Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We released $134 million in allowance this quarter, and our allowance balance now stands at $16.5 billion. Our total portfolio coverage ratio decreased 7 basis points to 5.16%. The decrease in this quarter's allowance and coverage ratio was largely driven by allowance releases in our Card and Consumer Banking segments. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, we released $66 million of allowance, which decreased coverage by 18 basis points to 8.36%. Our credit outlook has improved slightly as our confidence in the stability of underlying credit trends has grown, driving a modest release in allowance. In our Consumer Banking segment, we released $50 million in allowance, resulting in a 10-basis point decrease to our coverage ratio. The release was driven by strong credit performance and increasing recoveries in our auto business. And finally, our commercial banking allowance decreased by $14 million, resulting in the coverage ratio remaining essentially flat at 1.76%. Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased about $9 billion to approximately $132 billion. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $49 billion, up about $4 billion from the prior quarter, driven primarily by continued strong deposit growth. Our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 163%, up from 155% in the second quarter. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our third quarter net interest margin was 7.11%, 41 basis points higher than last quarter and 42 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The sequential increase in NIM was largely the result of three factors. First, we had higher card and auto yields. As a reminder, the card yield benefited from a full quarter impact of the termination of the revenue-sharing agreement with Walmart. The removal of revenue sharing increased the total company NIM by 12 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 22 basis points relative to the year ago quarter. Second, there was one additional day in the third quarter. And finally, we had a higher mix of card loans on the balance sheet. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.6%, 40 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Higher net income in the quarter was partially offset by the impact of dividends, loan growth and $150 million of share repurchases. As a reminder, the announcement of the acquisition of Discover constituted a material business change. Therefore, we continue to be subject to the Federal Reserve's pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows third quarter results in our Credit Card business. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the third quarter, our Domestic Card business delivered another quarter of top-line growth, strong margins and stable credit. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 5%. Ending loan balances increased $9.1 billion or about 6% year-over-year. Average loans increased about 7% and third quarter revenue was up 10%, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin for the quarter increased 43 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%. The full quarter effect of the end of the Walmart revenue sharing agreement drove a 51-basis point year-over-year increase. Excluding this impact, the revenue margin would have been about 18.2%. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.61%. The full quarter impact of the end of the Walmart loss-sharing agreement increased the quarterly charge-off rate by 38 basis points. Excluding this impact, the charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 5.23%, up 83 basis points year-over-year. The 30+ delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.53%, up 22 basis points from the prior year. As a reminder, the end of the Walmart loss-sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on the delinquency rate. The pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the third quarter. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate, excluding the Walmart impact was down 63 basis points and the 30+ delinquency rate was up 39 basis points. Both sequential quarter trends are consistent with seasonal expectations. Domestic Card non-interest expense was up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher marketing expense. Total company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the Domestic Card business. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, Domestic Card marketing in the quarter included increased marketing to grow originations at the top of the market, higher media spend and increased investment in differentiated customer experiences like our travel portal, airport lounges and Capital One Shopping. Slide 12 shows third quarter results in our Consumer Banking business. Auto originations were up 23% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our stable credit performance, which is the result of choices we've made over the past couple of years, puts us in a strong position to lean into current origination opportunities in the marketplace. Consumer Banking ending loans were essentially flat year-over-year and average loans were down 1%. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans and average loans were both up 1%. Compared to the year ago quarter, both ending and average consumer deposits were up about 6%. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 3% year-over-year, largely driven by higher deposit costs compared to the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 5% compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven largely by continued technology investments and increased auto originations. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.05%, up 28 basis points year-over-year. The 30+ delinquency rate was 5.61%, down 3 basis points year-over-year, largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs have been strong and stable. Slide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 2%. Average loans were down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were up about 5% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 1%. We continue to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Third quarter revenue was up 1% from the linked quarter and non-interest expense was up by about 2%. The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the third quarter increased 7 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.22%. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 7.66%, down 96 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate increased 9 basis points to 1.55%. In closing, we continued to post strong results in the third quarter. We delivered another quarter of top-line growth in domestic card loans, purchase volume and revenue. In the auto business, we saw year-over-year growth in originations for the third consecutive quarter and consumer credit trends remained stable. Our year-to-date operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments through September was 41.7%. We had guided to 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments to be modestly down compared to the 43.5% we posted in 2023. Our view included the positive impact from the end of the revenue sharing related to the Walmart partnership and assumed the CFPB late fee rule would take effect in October. Looking forward, we now expect the full year 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be in the low 42s. We expect a sequential quarter increase in operating expense in the fourth quarter, that will be roughly in line with historical patterns as we continue to invest in our technology transformation. And we are no longer assuming that the CFPB late fee rule will be implemented in 2024, given ongoing uncertainty around industry litigation. Our view of 2024 marketing has not changed. We continue to lean into marketing to grow and to further strengthen our franchise. In the Domestic Card business, we continue to get traction in originations across our products and channels. In Consumer Banking, we're leaning into marketing to grow our digital first national banking franchise. We continue to expect total company marketing in the second half of 2024 to be meaningfully higher than in the first half, similar to the pattern we saw last year and that includes the much higher marketing levels that we typically see in the fourth quarter. And turning to the Discover acquisition, we're working closely with the regulators as our applications continue to work their way through the regulatory approval process. Separately, Discover mentioned in their press release and on their earnings call last week that they continue to work in parallel with the SEC to resolve comments regarding their accounting approach for their card mis-classification matter. As soon as that process wraps up, we expect to mail out a joint proxy and a schedule -- and to schedule a shareholder vote most likely early next year. We remain well positioned to get shareholder and regulatory approvals and we expect to be in a position to complete the acquisition early in 2025 subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to enhance competition and create significant value for merchants and customers. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. Remember, as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any further questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Josh, please start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Ryan Nash : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Richard Fairbank : Hi, Ryan. Andrew Young : Hi, Ryan. Ryan Nash : So Rich, maybe to just start on credit. You obviously have lot -- you can see lots of different parts of the consumer market, high end consumer, subprime, prime, private label, different parts of auto. And you guys seem to be bucking the trend with really solid credit results, so I think some others aren't. So maybe can you just talk about what you're seeing across consumer and some of these different cohorts? And maybe what do you think it means for where losses could be headed in some of your main asset classes? Thanks. I have a follow-up. Richard Fairbank : Okay. Thank you, Ryan. So let me just pull up and just talk first about the health of the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer remains a source of relative strength in the overall economy. You know, think about this. The labor market remains strong. You know we saw -- we saw signs of softening in the first half of 2024 and the unemployment rate picked up a bit, but the most recent data points on unemployment and job creation have actually shown renewed strength. Incomes are growing in real terms and last month, we saw a significant upward revision of the savings rate. Consumer debt servicing burdens are stable relative to pre-pandemic levels and consumers have higher average bank account balances than before the pandemic. Now we see some pockets of pressure related to sort of the cumulative effects of inflation and elevated interest rates. And we are almost certainly still seeing a thing that we've been calling out for years, even really before it happened saying we think it inevitably will happen and but we won't fully be able to measure that. We won't be able to measure that along the way, but that is delayed charge-offs from the pandemic period. We should remember that millions of consumers who would have charged off under normal circumstances in 2020, 2021 and 2022 avoided defaulting, thanks to unprecedented stimulus and forbearance. And these consumers were on the edge, and they got a lifeline. But for some of them, their underlying vulnerability remains. So I believe that what we're seeing today is some catching up from that period of historically low charge-offs. So I'd say consumers on the whole are in good shape compared to most historical benchmarks, but I do think there's some pockets of pressure that will persist until we fully work through this cycle essentially of inflation and elevated interest rates and of course for an un-measurable period of time, the -- there will be, I think this delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic. So that's a comment, Ryan, sort of on the consumer generally. You said you had another question. Of course, I can get into Capital One's individual credit as well. But why don't I hear where you want to take this? Ryan Nash : Yes. And it would be helpful if you can comment on Capital One specifically, but maybe I'll throw another question for Andrew and you guys can handle both of them. So Andrew, obviously, there was a big beat on the net interest margin and the Fed has begun easing. I'm just curious if you could maybe just talk about the drivers and expectations from the margin -- for the margin from here. And just given you've historically operated in this kind of 6.8% or 6.9% range. But given the balance sheet -- the changing balance sheet dynamics, do you think we've sort of broken out of that range? Thanks. Andrew Young : Yes, Ryan. Look, as I think about the NIM in the near term, I enumerated the driving forces of what led to the increase this quarter. But in the near term outside of seasonal effects, we have one modest likely headwind, which as you can see in our disclosures, is that we're asset sensitive and so that will put a bit of pressure on NIM in the immediate term, but we also have one potential tailwind, I'll call it, and that is the pace of card growth relative to the rest of the balance sheet. And you've seen the tailwind to NIM all else equal over the last few quarters. Longer term, I think there's a few headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwind being again card even beyond the next few quarters, we've seen strong growth, particularly relative to the rest of our balance sheet. And I've highlighted in the past that our current levels of cash are likely above where we think they will eventually settle out. And if we were to see a steepening of the yield curve, that's also a good guide to us, all else equal. On the headwind side, I think there's a question of where betas go from here and there's a possibility that they could be slower or lower depending on a host of factors. We could maintain cash levels for some period of time at least, especially in light of the strong deposit growth we're seeing. And then always there's a little bit of a wildcard of the path of credit, right? And so if for some reason it stays elevated, the potential revenue suppression could be a headwind. But overall, I would say taking all of those factors into account, you've kind of seen the stability over the last few quarters prior to this one and the step-up here in the third quarter. And so I'll let you kind of weigh all of the headwinds and tailwinds that I just laid out for you. Ryan Nash : Thank you. Richard Fairbank : So, Ryan, let me just -- I talk generally about the consumer. Let me talk a little bit about Capital One, specifically what we see, and this is of course, partly because of what I just said about the consumer and some Capital One specific things as well. So in the Card business, we -- you know our delinquencies and charge-offs are consistent with normal seasonality now, and it's clear that our card credit has settled out. It's also clear that it settled out above pre-pandemic levels. And sort of there's three main reasons for this. First, we still have relatively lower recoveries compared to before the pandemic as a result of historically low charge-offs in the rearview mirror and therefore in our charge-off inventory. So our recovery rate per dollar of charge-offs has been stable, if anything, in fact a bit better than before the pandemic, but just the inventory remains below pre-pandemic levels. But it's rising, it's heading toward returning to the pre-pandemic levels. So this effect will diminish over the next few quarters, we would expect. Secondly, that we believe the cumulative effects of inflation and higher interest rates are creating affordability pressures for some consumers, particularly those whose incomes have not kept pace with inflation or have higher debt servicing burden. So we think that's a factor. And you know, to your point, I'm actually not making a point about the low end of the market, whether measured by income or credit score. Generally speaking, we've seen stronger relative income growth at the lower end of the distribution since 2020. And you know, customers with the highest debt servicing burdens tend to skew more prime than subprime. So -- and then, of course, the other factor, you know that we would point at as to why charge-offs are settling out above the pre-pandemic levels is the delayed charge-off effect that we think is still playing through. But just back -- if I could just throw in an industry point just for a second, I should have mentioned this probably earlier because this isn't really a Capital One effect. But I think that what we see in industry data is that post pandemic origination vintages are running at higher risk level than pre-pandemic vintages, probably because of inflated credit scores during the pandemic. And that's an industry point, not a Capital One point because and then here, Ryan, is when you mentioned that you're seeing Capital One credit, in some cases move differently from some of the industry trends. At Capital One, we anticipated these effects, related to some of the unusual things going on during the pandemic and particularly the -- what we might say is the great inflation of credit scores. So we tightened our underwriting back in 2020 and '21, when credit was the best we've ever seen. And as credit normalized, we continued to make adjustments where we saw pockets of rising risk, what I was saying along the way where we kept trimming around the edges. The result for Capital One has been relatively stable performance on our recent originations now for a long time, which are really running at similar levels of risk to pre-pandemic vintages. But I do think there is some underlying worsening in the marketplace that may be showing up elsewhere that some of our choices were able to offset. So pulling way up our credit results, we feel are strong and stable, driven by the choices that we've made through the pandemic and the post-pandemic period. And we feel very good about where we are and it's an important reason that we are leaning in, as you can see in terms of our originations in the business. I can talk about auto at some point, but maybe I'll wait for another question on that. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good evening. Just following up on credit, sorry. Just Rich, you had mentioned, maybe it was last quarter or the quarter before that we should start to see the credit, the delinquency improvements do better than seasonality. And I guess stabilized as you know, it's moving along with seasonality. Is some of that related to the stuff you were just talking about or do you still expect the improvement to be better than seasonality at some point? Richard Fairbank : Well, at some point, of course, you know, it can be a long time. But no, let me just say that I don't recall saying that we expected credit to be better than seasonality. I think what we have been saying over the last number of months is for a long time, we said credit is normalizing. We are on the absolute lookout for the very early signs of credit normalizing, which it should, where exactly it will normalize, who knows till we actually get there. And so way back to more than a year ago, starting interestingly in the lower end of the market, we were pointing out that we see the signs of credit stabilizing, of course, we all went down that ski slope of second derivative and that continues to, you know to be a strong effect. But these are all things, Sanjay, that are going on related to credit stabilizing. And we have not declared that we think, credit is in fact headed down from here. At some point, we can in another question, go through the potential, you know, case for that. I want to say one other thing though, you mentioned seasonality and I put a marker down last quarter about a potential seasonality, a change in seasonality patterns. And I'd like to just kind of seize the moment and comment on this because I think all of you that are watching the credit patterns on a monthly basis, it's really important that we talk about the seasonality benchmark to which to compare that. So let's talk for a moment about how seasonality works. Our portfolio in fact, tends to have more pronounced seasonal patterns than the industry average. The second quarter tends to be the seasonal low point for delinquencies and the fourth quarter tends to be the seasonal high point. Card losses lag relative to delinquencies, the losses tend to be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter. Now, we have always thought and still do that tax refunds are a significant driver of these seasonal trends. And tax refunds drive a large seasonal improvement in delinquent payments in the February-March time period, which flows through to lower delinquencies in April, May and then to lower charge-offs in the August-September timeframe. Tax refunds also drive a seasonal uptick in our recoveries. Now a few years ago, the tax withholding rules changed leading to fewer tax refunds and lower average refund payments. And the IRS was paying certain refunds later than before because of fraud-related issues that they had seen. Now, so we were watching all this, but there was so much noise in the payment data due to the pandemic that we were unsure to what extent credit seasonality patterns had changed. So in the first half of this year, as credit metrics settled out, we flagged that the combined effect of lower and later tax refunds as the more it settles out, the more we can sort of see these underlying patterns that we flag that this combined effect was likely affecting our near-term credit performance by delaying and muting the usual seasonal improvement that we see in the second quarter. But we didn't want to go to the highest mountaintop and declare that because we wanted to make sure we weren't explaining away credit numbers that in fact looked worse than seasonally what you would expect. We also at the time, you know, believed that we would see more muted seasonal increases in delinquencies in the third quarter on the other side of that effect. And we've now had several quarters to look at this and that experience has been confirmatory. And now that you know, we're in a sense, credit is coming in better than the old seasonal patterns. So we've seen both the worst side and the better side. I think we can pull up and really sort of declare this effect really seems to be happening. 2024 settled out with fewer refunds paid than before the pandemic and about 25% lower total refund volume in real terms. So what we're basically seeing and pulling way up is that seasonality, which has we believe is driven predominantly by tax refunds, as tax refunds become less of an effect, not surprisingly, in fact, we're seeing seasonality that has less amplitude to it. So that's, I think, the seasonality that we observe now and when we've done sort of a -- an adjusted look at last year, we definitely think that we see the new trend. By the way on the auto side, all of this happens in auto seasonality but in an even faster and more concentrated way. So I think I just wanted to share that with you. But I think what we've really been declaring here, Sanjay, is that it's -- there's just such a confirmation that, that credit is really settling out here. Sanjay Sakhrani : I mean my follow-up question would be the question you were looking for later. What's the path to normalization? And I guess for credit as well as the reserve rate, we're well above the levels we were in 2019, maybe you and Andrew can tag team on that one. Thank you. Richard Fairbank : So why don't I start, Andrew. So the -- we're really, really pleased with how card credit has settled out after, quite a period of normalization. So looking ahead, while we're not giving guidance on future credit, I just want to point out a number of forces that play out. So the one force, of course is this thing that we believe so strongly is there, but we can't measure it is the phenomenon of delayed charge-offs. If you kind of look at the area under the curve of all the charge-offs that sort of didn't happen, now we don't believe all of that area will play out over time. But if you look at the area below the curve and compare it to the area in a sense above the curve now, one can see that conceptually there could be still quite a bit of, in a sense delayed inventory that could happen. I just want to flag that effect. I think it's going to moderate at some point, but I think that effect will be with us from -- for some time. Another factor is the recoveries inventory that continues to rebuild and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time, all else being equal. And then the moderating of inflation, I think, is a good guy for card credit, but still high interest rates are probably a source of pressure at the tails for some consumers, especially those with higher debt servicing burdens. And of course, the economy will be a factor too, but those are just some of the forces I think are going to be at work as credit plays out here, Sanjay. Andrew Young : And then with respect to allowance, Sanjay, obviously, we'll be allowing for growth. So that's the starting point on a dollar basis. I suspect you are more focused on coverage. So let me talk in coverage terms. First, and just very tactically, as a reminder near term, in the fourth quarter, we typically have seasonally higher balances, and those balances just have lower coverage because of the high levels of expected payments. So all else equal, and I stress that point, but that would put downward pressure on coverage in the fourth quarter. But I -- in hearing your question, I think you're looking for a longer-term view. So first, the coverage over time is going to primarily be driven by our loss forecast and our confidence in those estimates. And so Rich just kind of shared, the things that we'll be looking for and what will ultimately be driving those forecasts. But how the allowance then plays out relative to that, I think it's important to note that even if we find ourselves in future quarters where our projected losses are lower than the projected losses in the current quarter's forecast, we might see only modest declines in coverage as we incorporate uncertainties related to those projections. But eventually the -- that lower loss forecast if and when it comes through theoretically flow through the allowance and bring the coverage ratio down as those uncertainties become more certain. And so the direction of travel in that scenario would be down. The pace and timing would obviously depend on a variety of factors. Because you mentioned though CECL Day 1, I guess I'll end, Sanjay, just as a reminder, one other call out using CECL Day 1 as a rough proxy for a through-the-cycle coverage assumption, it's important to note that embedded in CECL Day 1 was a law-sharing agreement with Walmart. And so with the termination of that agreement, the roughly 50-basis point impact to allowance coverage that we recognized last quarter, I just want to make sure that as you're thinking about CECL Day 1 excluding the Walmart effect that 6.5% roughly percent is actually more like 7%. Hopefully, that gives you though a sense of the direction of travel. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Terry Ma with Barclays. You may proceed. Terry Ma : Oh, thank you. Good evening. I wanted to touch on the auto business and ask kind of what you're seeing in a competitive environment and how you're thinking about growth going forward. You called out originations have been positive the last three quarters and it looks like loan growth is going to turn positive. I know you're still mindful of used-car prices. So should we expect more measured growth in auto going forward? Richard Fairbank : So yes, thank you, Terry. You know, our auto originations, as you say, they've been -- they've been growing now, I guess it's the last three quarters. And as we stated in our prior calls, in 2022 and in early 2023, we had anticipated risk and pullback on our originations. And even as the vehicle values have been declining, the credit performance on both our front book and our back book remains very strong. So additionally, just talking about some industry factors. Some of the headwinds that the industry has been facing with high interest rates and high vehicle prices are now easing as the interest rates have started to come down and vehicle values are down from their peak, although both of these remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. So interest margins are on our -- also very important, interest margins on our front book have increased and credit has stabilized and we're seeing opportunities to grow in a resilient way. So our strategy is to lean into areas that we like and that is supported by our very sophisticated underwriting and technology infrastructure, our data-driven decisioning as well as deep relationships with our dealer network. So looking ahead, we feel good about our auto business, and we feel we are well positioned to grow in a disciplined way targeting particularly what we think is the very resilient business. Terry Ma : Great. Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research Securities. You may proceed. Bill, your line is now open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. Following up on your NIM commentary, Andrew, if credit continues to trend in line or potentially better than normal seasonality from here, is it reasonable to expect revenue suppression would begin to serve as more of a NIM tailwind that would arguably overwhelm some of the NIM headwinds that you described in your earlier response? Andrew Young : Outside of seasonality, Bill, which is an important qualifier to that, but yes, to the extent that credit is coming down in an absolute sense, suppression is highly correlated with loss rates. So over a period of time, that's what we would expect to see. Bill Carcache : Thanks. And then also another follow-up for you, Andrew, on your reserve commentary. In prior quarters, qualitative overlays, it seems -- and please correct me if I'm wrong, it seems like it had the effect of preventing you from releasing reserves. Is it fair to conclude that this quarter's reserve release suggests you expect consumer credit conditions to continue to gradually improve from here to the point where, you know, that would support peak losses likely being -- or sorry, peak reserve rates likely being behind us at this point? Andrew Young : It's hard to think about the qualitative factors in isolation, Bill, because we look at the totality of the forecast and the economic backdrop. And that's just one albeit important but component of thinking about the allowance overall. So really the release this quarter was driven by the stability of underlying credit trends and just our confidence in those trends. So that's really the driver that led to this quarter's release. Bill Carcache : Thank you for taking my questions. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Don Fandetti : Hi, Rich, on the Discover merger, do you still feel like owning a network helps your position with regulatory approval? I mean, I guess the DOJ suit against Visa does validate that. I'm just trying to get a sense on whether or not you feel like your arguments are resonating with regulators and you have confidence in the deal closing? Richard Fairbank : So I think it's, you know, this is an unusual deal in the sense that usually there is, a player in a certain industry doing an acquisition of another player in that industry and certain -- certainly part of the consideration is looking at those aspects, but the very unusual part here is two things. First of all, one is such an important part of this acquisition is buying a network, something that we don't have. So we're not even in that part of the business. But then secondly, of course, it is, you know, an acquisition buying a position in an industry that is, getting a tremendous amount of scrutiny for how concentrated it is. And the network that we are acquiring, for example, on the credit card side has gone from 6% down to 4% share in recent years. And so certainly, we are making a strong case that to a regulator that obviously has shown they care a lot about competition in that marketplace that we certainly believe that this is a very pro-competitive in that sense. Of course, we also believe very much that on the credit card side, the deal is pro-competitive as well. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Richard Fairbank : Yes. And yes. Yes, go ahead. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heck with Jefferies. You may proceed. John Heck : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Most of them have been asked and answered. I'm wondering if you guys can maybe give us some color on spend trends, the built business volumes. We've heard that there's -- that the consumer is being a little bit more cautious and careful or responsible with their spending as opposed to reacting to some sort of weakness or concerns about the economy. And I'm wondering what your opinion is on that and how that affects your business? Richard Fairbank : So, John, thank you. The -- consumer spending has had a little bit of a wild ride over the past few years. So just to reflect for a second on this, at the start of the pandemic spend per customer plummeted, then it surged as consumers resumed their spending and it has since been settling out. Since the beginning of 2023, our spend per customer has remained largely flat overall, although it has begun to tick up in recent months. So the spend growth that you see for Capital One is really being driven by the growth in new accounts and the spending on those accounts. And then we see just a little bit of a tick up in the last few months. Just to -- while I know some people have kind of wondered if you double click into the spend patterns, you know, discretionary and non-discretionary spend have really -- the growth rates of them have been very stable lately. And in fact, the mix has been stable across incomes and FICOs and is in line with pre-pandemic levels. So we think things really have settled out in the -- in the card business with respect to spend. And when we -- it's really striking when we look at banking overall and pretty much the only industry that's really growing is the credit card industry and it's been a tough way to make a living in most of the banking product areas and that of course, I think, the credit card continues to be part of a very -- a very important and multi-decade macro trend with respect to the movement out of cash and checks and really into the incredibly convenient spending mechanisms of a credit card. So I think there's sort of a macro tailwind that continues to help the industry. And then I think for a lot of us companies, certainly a few of us companies like Capital One, our strategies are very focused. It's what I call a spend first strategy so that a lot of what we do, the choices we make on the marketing side, on the credit side and really the business we want to be has a spend first lean to it and that that's another benefit to our metrics. Thank you, John. John Heck : Thank you. Appreciate the color. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. You may proceed. Mihir Bhatia : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. And actually, just following up kind of similar lines as John's question about spending. Maybe just drilling down specifically on the venture ex-portfolio. And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about it. It's been in the market for a couple of years now. Just how much has it grown, how material is it to the overall card business? What are you seeing in terms of performance in that portfolio that's encouraging you to invest more in it. But just any additional details would be great. Thank you. Ime Archibong : All right. Thank you, Ime here. So we launched our Venture X card in late 2021, and we're very pleased with the market response and the customer engagement so far. This launch is, of course, a continuation in our journey that's been many years in the making to win at the top of the market and that journey started years ago with the declaration. And then we have continued to just sort of every year stretch a little higher and lean in to the momentum and the brand strength that we were getting in our market position to be able to keep growing. So Venture X was a very important milestone in that journey. And also, very important in that journey to win at the top of the market was the launch of our Capital One travel portal and the opening of Capital One lounges as well as enhancements to our customers' overall experience more broadly. So and I'm sure you saw that actually in the third quarter of last year, we then launched the Venture X business card and we're also pleased with the market response and customer engagement so far as well. So I guess the way -- while we don't give out the specific numbers on this, we continue to be very pleased with our quest to win at the top of the market and both of these Venture X products are getting a lot of traction so far. And as you can see, we're leaning in quite a bit. But again, what I want to say is, I think one of the mistakes that card companies sometimes make is to think about a quest to win at the top of the market related to we're going to launch a particular product with these features. I really want to stress that winning at the top of the market requires a sustained comprehensive effort to create experiences, access to things that are unique and sort of something to tell your friends about, lounges, digital experience, rewards, of course, and then a very important component of this is building the brand credibility to have -- be viewed as a premium player in that part of the marketplace. So all of that is what we're investing in. You've, of course, seen quite an increase in our marketing and a fair amount of that is in service of our continued quest at the top of the market. But I would leave this one observation with you as well is that while you see the overall purchase volume growth rate for Capital One, and when we -- when we break that data up by spend segment, basically the higher the spend segment, meaning the higher we reach up in the marketplace, the faster our growth rate is, which is a confirmation of the traction we're getting, but also not only in overall volume, but the traction that we're getting reaching farther up. Jeff Norris : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Haynes with Evercore ISI. You may proceed. John Pancari : Hi, it's John Pancari at Evercore ISI. I wanted to just ask on capital CET1 ratio at 13.6%. I wanted to get your updated thoughts here on how you think about buyback in that context. I know you had indicated that the Discover transaction could impact the pace of buybacks ultimately, but you still bought back about $150 million in the third quarter. So I wanted to get your updated thoughts there. Thanks. Andrew Young : Yes, John, look, there's a few forces at play that impact how we think about capital management. The first, of course, being the uncertainty around the end game rule. The re-proposal provided some high-level indications, but the devils in the details there, not to mention the uncertainty on implementation timing. And second, although it's been moderating, of course, there still continues to be a degree of macroeconomic uncertainty. But last and perhaps most importantly, we have the pending Discover acquisition. And so post close, we will need to run both our internal assessment of the needs of the combined company, but we'll also go through the Fed's CCAR process to come up with our view and the Fed's view of the combined capital need -- the combined company entity's capital need. So those are the reasons why we are operating at current levels and believe it's prudent to do so. And we've been at this $150 million a pace for a number of quarters. And once we are back under an SEB regime, we'll, of course have flexibility to return capital as we see appropriate and you saw in late 2021 and early '22 when we had excess capital, we were returning that at something like $2.5 billion a quarter in repurchases. So if we were to find ourselves in a similar position, we understand that returning excess capital is an important part of creating shareholder value and we have the ability to do so quickly, but I go back to the forces at play of why we're operating where we are right now. John Pancari : Got it. Thank you, Andrew. If I could just ask one more on the loan yield increase, up about 58 basis points this quarter, how much of that increase was the impact from Walmart for the full quarter? And was there any impact on the APR from any increase to the APR in response to the proposed CFPB late fee rule? Thanks. Andrew Young : And John, I just want to make sure I understand your question of the yields quarter-over-quarter, are you saying or like year-over-year yield on card, year-over-year yield in card is flat when you take into account the effect of Walmart. Quarter-over-quarter, it's really just the seasonality effect. There's the partial quarter of Walmart, but yield is really the seasonal effects and partial quarter of Walmart when you're comparing third quarter to the second quarter. John Pancari : Okay. Andrew Young : And then... John Pancari : Okay, thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Jeff Adelson : Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me to follow up on John's question there. Just on the late fee rule, I fully appreciate that things remain in flux at this point. But could you give us an update in your latest thinking and how you're potentially preparing for that with any offsets or mitigating actions? Have any of those actions been taken yet? And I get that you talked about taking a more mindful approach here. Just wanted to make sure that this is still the same approach you're taking or if there's anything else we should be thinking about in our models here? Thank you. Andrew Young : Thank you, Jeff. So at this point, we're waiting for industry litigation to play out to see if and when the late fee rule goes into effect. And we're not going to predict when that will happen. As we've said before, if the rule is implemented in its current form, it will have a significant impact on our revenue. But we also believe that the rule will have an impact on the marketplace, including competition, pricing, customer behavior, volumes, credit. The reality is that we have spent decades painstakingly building a customer first franchise with the fewest fees in the industry and extremely simple products. We believe that we've been rewarded for these choices with better growth, better attrition and better credit selection. Ultimately, we will work backwards from what preserves our customer franchise, our customer loyalty and credit resilience if the rule does go into effect. Relative to anything that we've done so-far, we -- really the only thing we've done is we did defer a few investments in anticipation of this rule being implemented. If the ruling never happens, we will likely go ahead and make these investments over time. Thank you, Jeff. Jeff Norris : Well, that concludes our Q&A session for the evening. Thank you for joining us on this conference call today and for your continuing interest in Capital One. Everybody, have a great night. Richard Fairbank : Thank you. Operator : Thank you.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead. Jeff Norris : Thanks, Josh, and welcome, everyone. And just as a reminder, as always, we are webcasting live over the Internet and to access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website, capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our fourth-quarter 2024 results. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew are going to walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and click on financials and then click on quarterly earnings release. Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled forward looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly reports that are accessible at Capital One's website filed with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew? Andrew Young : Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide three of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $1.1 billion or $2.67 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $4.8 billion or $11.59 per share. Included in the results for the fourth quarter were adjusting items related to discover integration costs and a legal reserve build. Net of these adjusting items, fourth-quarter earnings per share were $3.09. Full-year adjusted earnings per share were $13.96. We also had one notable item in the quarter, which was $100 million of accelerated philanthropy contributions. Pre-provision earnings of $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter were down 13% from the third quarter, driven by higher non-interest expense. The linked quarter increase in non-interest expense was driven by increases in both operating expense and marketing spend. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 2%, driven by higher non-interest income. Provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion in the quarter, up about $160 million relative to the prior quarter. The quarterly increase in provision was driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a larger allowance release. Turning to slide four, I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We released $245 million in allowance this quarter, and our allowance balance now stands at $16.3 billion. The decrease in this quarter's allowance was driven by releases in our Commercial Banking and Commercial segments. Our total portfolio coverage ratio decreased 20 basis points to 4.96%. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide five. The allowance balance in our domestic card business was flat. The coverage ratio declined 33 basis points, primarily driven by seasonal balances as well as favorable near-term credit trends. In our Consumer Banking segment, we released $131 million in allowance, resulting in a 22 basis point decrease to the coverage ratio. Vehicle values were stable in the quarter, resulting in an improvement -- improved recoveries outlook, which drove the release. And finally, our Commercial Banking allowance decreased by $130 million, resulting in a 15 basis point decrease to the coverage ratio. The release was primarily driven by the reduction in criticized loans and to a lesser extent by charge-offs in the quarter. Turning to page six, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased by about $8 billion to approximately $124 billion. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $43 billion, down about $6 billion from the prior quarter. The decline in cash was largely driven by seasonally higher card loans and funding maturities, which were partially offset by continued strong growth in our Consumer Banking business deposits. Our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 155%. Turning to page seven, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our fourth quarter net interest margin was 7.03%, 8 basis points lower than last quarter and 30 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter. The linked quarter decrease in NIM was primarily driven by lower asset yields, which were only partially offset by lower deposit and wholesale funding costs. Turning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier-1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.5%, 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by the impact of loan growth, dividends and $150 million of share repurchases. As a reminder, the announcement of the acquisition of Discover constituted a material business change. Therefore, we continue to be subject to the Federal Reserve's pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Richard Fairbank : Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows fourth quarter results in our Credit Card business. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. In the fourth quarter, our Domestic Card business delivered another quarter of steady top-line growth, strong margins, and stable credit. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 7%. Ending loan balances increased $8 billion or about 5% year-over-year. Average loans increased about 6% and fourth-quarter revenue was up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin for the quarter increased 55 basis points from the prior year quarter to 18.6%, largely driven by the impact of the end of the Walmart revenue sharing agreement. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 6.06%. The impact of the end of the Walmart loss-sharing agreement increased the fourth-quarter charge-off rate by roughly 40 basis points. Excluding this impact, the charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 5.66%, up 31 basis points year-over-year. And after 20 consecutive months of second derivative improvement, the 30-plus delinquency rate crossed into actual year-over-year improvement. The 30-plus delinquency rate at the end of December was 4.53%, down 8 basis points from the prior year. As a reminder, the end of the Walmart loss-sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on delinquency rate. On a sequential-quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 45 basis points. The 30-plus delinquency rate was flat compared to the linked quarter. Domestic Card non-interest expense was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Operating expense and marketing both increased year-over-year. Total company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the Domestic Card business. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, Domestic Card marketing in the quarter included higher media spend and increased investment in premium benefits and differentiated customer experiences like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping. Slide 12 shows fourth-quarter results in our Consumer Banking business. Auto originations were up 53% from the prior-year quarter. A portion of this growth can be attributed to overall market growth, while the remainder is the result of our strong position to pursue resilient growth in the current marketplace. As a reminder, our choices to tighten credit and pull back in anticipation of credit score inflation and declining vehicle values were still in effect in the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting in relatively low originations. These choices also drove out really basically they drove strong and stable credit performance that positioned us to lean into current marketplace opportunities and return to originations growth in 2024. With four consecutive quarters of origination growth in 2024, Consumer Banking loan balances returned to growth in the fourth quarter. Ending loans increased $2.7 billion or about 4% year-over-year and average loans were up 1%. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were up 2% and average loans were up 1%. Compared to the year-ago quarter, ending consumer deposits grew about 7% and average consumer deposits were up about 8%. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was up about 1% year-over-year. Growth in loans and deposits was partially offset by a higher year-over-year average deposit interest rate. Non-interest expense was up about 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, driven largely by the unique fourth-quarter items Andrew discussed, as well as increased auto originations and continued technology investments. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.32%, up 13 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.95%, down 39 basis points year-over-year, largely as a result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs have been strong and stable on a seasonally adjusted basis. Slide 13 shows fourth-quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were essentially flat. Average loans were down about 1%. Both ending and average deposits were up about 4% from the linked quarter. Fourth-quarter revenue was up 7% from the linked quarter and non-interest expense was up by about 5%. The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the fourth quarter increased 4 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.26%. The commercial criticized performing loan rate was 6.35%, down 131 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate decreased 16 basis points to 1.39%. In closing, we continued to post strong and steady results in the fourth quarter. We delivered another quarter of top-line growth in Domestic Card loans, purchase volume and revenue. In the Auto business, we posted growth in originations for the fourth consecutive quarter and the return to year-over-year growth in loan balances and consumer credit trends remained stable. Our full-year operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments was 42.35%, consistent with our guidance of the low 42s, even after incurring $100 million in accelerated philanthropy contributions. And turning to the Discover acquisition. The shareholder votes are scheduled for February 18th, and we continue to work closely with the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Department of Justice as our applications continue to work their way through the regulatory approval process. We remain well-positioned to complete the acquisition early in 2025, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands, and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to enhance competition and create significant value for merchants and customers. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Jeff Norris : Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. Remember, as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. And if you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Josh, please start the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Ryan Nash : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Richard Fairbank : Hey, Ryan. Andrew Young : Hey, Ryan. Ryan Nash : So Rich, delinquencies have been in line or better for nine straight months losses, and you talked about delinquencies now being down on a year-over-year basis and losses have sort of followed suit, but at a little bit of a slower pace. And you've outlined a lot of the reasons, deferred charge-offs, the press recoveries. But when you think about credit from here, just broadly, what are you seeing from the consumer and how are you thinking about loss performance as well as any other factors that could be impacting losses? And do you think we're on a downward trajectory from here? Thank you. And I have a follow-up. Richard Fairbank : All right. Thank you, Ryan. So let me start by just talking about the health of the consumer and then maybe I'll turn and talk about the credit performance at Capital One. So the US consumer continues to be a source of strength in the overall economy. The labor market remains strong and we saw signs of softening in the first-half of 2024, but in the second-half of the year, the unemployment rate has been stable and job creation data has shown renewed strength. Incomes are growing steadily in real terms as inflation settles out a bit. Consumer debt servicing burdens are stable near pre-pandemic levels. Consumers have higher bank account balances than before the pandemic. Now, of course, the circumstances of individual consumers and households are highly variable and so talking in averages doesn't always fully cover what's going on. We do see some pockets, as I've been saying for some time now -- we do see some pockets of pressure related to the cumulative effects of inflation and elevated interest rates among consumers whose incomes have not kept up with inflation or who have high debt servicing burdens. And of course, there's still some inflation pressure and longer-term interest rates strikingly have increased since the Fed started lowering rates in September. So we do see a bit of a disconnect between the average consumer and the folks closer to the margin. And you can see that, for example, in payment rates in our Card business. On the one hand, card payment rates remain on average meaningfully above pre-pandemic levels. And this is true overall and within each of our major customer segments. On the other hand, the proportion of customers making just the minimum payment is also running somewhat above pre-pandemic levels, which is consistent with our card delinquencies running above pre-pandemic levels. Now, I should add that we're seeing this minimum payment effect across the credit spectrum. I'm not making a point here about the low end of the market or even about subprime. In fact, if anything, the lower end appears to be doing relatively better at the moment. So just pulling up, I believe we're almost certainly still seeing some pandemic-related effects like delayed charge-offs from the period of unprecedented stimulus and forbearance in 2020 and 2021 and 2022, this effect is impossible to isolate, but we can infer it from our own credit trends and industry credit trends over the past several years. But sort of pulling up on the consumer. I think consumers are in good shape compared to most historical benchmarks. There are -- as we've been saying for some time, there are pockets of pressure that have to work their way through before levels can get down -- credit loss levels can get down to sort of pre-pandemic levels. But I think the consumer story is very consistent with what I've been saying for a number of quarters and it is very solid. So let me turn to Capital One Credit. Over the course of 2024, our card delinquencies have moved in line with normal seasonality with losses following about a quarter behind. Now as a reminder, earlier this year, we flagged that changes in the level and timing of tax refunds due to tax law changes were probably changing seasonal credit patterns in our Card business. We derived new seasonality benchmarks for card delinquencies based on post-pandemic performance. And those benchmarks have less amplitude in both directions than in the past. So we've now had a full year to look at what we were hypothesizing as the new seasonality benchmark and as we now look at the whole year, this experience is very confirmatory and we very much sort of believe that we've got the benchmark right. And when we first saw delinquencies settling out, it is clear that for -- really for the whole year now, we've been calling stabilization. We've not been declaring a peak or declaring that credit would improve from here, but we can now look at the whole year and see a really nice stabilization. In the fourth quarter, and again, you saw this in the monthly -- the month we just reported. We saw our delinquencies improve on a seasonally adjusted basis in the quarter for the first time since normalization began. And they ended the year slightly lower on a year-over-year basis. So that's certainly an encouraging sign. Looking ahead, we're not giving guidance on future credit, but over time, there are a number of forces that play out. Our recoveries inventory will continue to rebuild and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time, all else equal. Still, high interest rates will probably remain a source of pressure for some consumers, especially those with higher debt servicing burdens. And there still is, we believe, the phenomenon of delayed charge-offs and of course, this effect is hard to measure and certainly hard to forecast. But over time, it should play through, but how long it plays out, that's just something that is just a matter of speculation. I think we will eventually get back to the place where traditional labor market indicators are the main drivers of change in Consumer Credit. But that will still take some time. And finally, as we move into the new year, we'll keep an eye on the level and timing of tax refunds since we know these can materially affect seasonal movements in card credit. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for the color. If I can throw in one high-level follow-up. So Rich, efficiency improvement has been a hallmark of Capital One for the last seven or eight years, ex a small period during COVID. You recently talked about investments you wanted to make in the network once the deal hopefully closes at some point in the first quarter? I guess the question is, do you expect to continue to be on an efficiency journey, fully recognizing that the cost saves obviously make it easier, but just curious how you're thinking about efficiency for the consolidated company over the medium term, fully recognizing that there's going to be a lot of noise in the results? Richard Fairbank : So we look-forward to the completion of our deal and actually really getting inside the financials and the performance and all the details of the business. The businesses at this rather remarkable company Discover. But as we've talked about, when we look still from the outside, we see just a great opportunity there. And of course, we have said there are three areas that are going to need in continued investment when we think about virtually anything that all the strategic upside of this Discover deal, it's sort of all roads lead through three areas, kind of obvious areas of continued investment. And the first, of course, is compliance and risk management. And Discover has really been leaning into that and we, of course, are doing everything we can to prepare to continue to lean into that and we'll do whatever it takes on that front. Obviously, that's an investment. The second is we -- is network acceptance. We've talked about how struck we are and how struck we were to find out and confirm just how good the acceptance is in the United States for Discover. You can see, in fact, they've been putting some ads on TV sort of touting that and it's a very good story. And internationally, they've been investing there and focusing on where their customers travel and they've made a lot of progress there. When we look at our customer base at Capital One and where we would love to be over time in terms of being in a position to add more-and-more volume onto the Discover network, we think an incredibly important objective is to increase the depth and breadth of acceptance internationally, sloping the work, of course, working backwards where -- from where our customers and Discovers travel. So that -- that's going to be a multiyear thing that -- that's a very important strategic imperative, I think, for us. And then the third one will be building the network brand. We plan to keep the name Discover for the network. We think it's a great brand. And we're really happy with the underlying reality of where acceptance is. We know there are challenges in terms of consumer perception relative to those realities and we know also we need to, in fact, build the international reality and then the brand perception that follows that. So those are the three strategic -- the kind of obvious and strategic investment areas that we've been identifying really since the start of the deal. And back to your question about what do we think -- how do you think -- how do we think that fits in relative to efficiency ratio? We, of course, on the Capital One side have had a long -- decade-long journey of continuing to improve operating efficiency ratio and it's striking that improvement has come even as we have continued to really ramp up investment in technology. Now the way that paradox works is the technology is -- we're also investing more in technology and at the same time, getting all the benefits on the efficiency side, both in terms of growth and in terms of costs that come from such an investment in technology. So the engine that drives operating efficiency ratio strategically will continue at Capital One and it should continue it with the combined institution as well. Now then you ask, will the big three investment areas that we talk about, what will that do to operating? I think the -- we always at Capital One have strategic imperatives that we're investing in. I think the overall picture of how Capital One's tech journey helps pay -- one of the important ways investors get paid is through operating efficiency improvement. I think that story to me stays strategically intact even as we have new investment areas because we'll also have new areas to capture synergy and growth opportunities and things that really wouldn't have been possible for either of our companies alone. So thanks for the question. Operating efficiency is a really important way that we create value for investors. And in the long run, we continue to really see increased opportunities there. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Ryan Nash : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Terry Ma with Barclays. You may proceed. Terry Ma : Hi, thank you. Good evening. I wanted to follow-up on Credit first. It seems the trend that we've seen for the second derivative suggests there's room for that to continue to go lower. Is there some sort of framework to think about how much lower DQs can go -- can trend going forward? And is there anything in the near term that can cause the second derivative to inflect higher again? And I have a follow-up. Richard Fairbank : So Terry, yes, so thank you for the question. Obviously, well, since the founding of the company, we've always had our microscopes out looking at delinquencies because they're the single best predictor of credit of all the metrics. There are many metrics we watch, but that certainly is at the top of the list. And it is, I think, a really important -- it's certainly a gratifying milestone to where finally the second derivative cross the horizontal axis effectively and we'd certainly note that milestone. The first thing I would say about as we all get our microscopes out to look at trends on a monthly basis is to just talk about seasonality itself. And we don't publish a seasonality curve per se because there's no precise benchmark with which to do it, but we certainly like to guide our investors about how we think about that. Seasonality for Capital One has tended to have more amplitude up and down over the course of the year than most other card players. And one might ask, why is that? We believe that the biggest driver of seasonality, while there are several, the biggest driver of seasonality is tax refunds. And since we have a larger subprime book than most other players who really don't do subprime, those customers do tend to have higher seasonality in their credit performance than folks higher upmarket. So I think that's why Capital One has a greater seasonality effect. And for these customers in particular, tax refunds certainly in terms of the monthly flow of cash can end up creating something very nice that comes seasonally and some of that makes its way into payments. Now the changes in the tax withholding rules a few years ago led to fewer tax refunds and lower average refund payments. And the IRS was also paying certain refunds later than before. So that created a lot of noise, as I've been saying on recent calls. You'd think it would be easy to reestablish a seasonality curve, but while credit was normalizing so dramatically, it was sometimes swamping the seasonality effect. But we created sort of this detrended seasonal curve from 2023 to the best we could and that turned out to really be right on for 2024. If I were to pull up and kind of summarize what we saw in 2024. 2024 settled out with fewer refunds paid than before the pandemic and about 25% lower total refund volume in real terms. Delinquencies moved with our new post-pandemic seasonality benchmarks, which have similar timing, but if I were to summarize what this new curve versus the one we've had for many years, it appears to have about 35% to 40% less amplitude in both directions than in the past. By the way, just a note for a second on, auto, all of this also happens in auto seasonality, but in an even faster and more concentrated way. We tend to see auto delinquencies at their seasonal low in Q1 and losses in Q2. And this year that seasonal improvement was delayed a bit. So that's the backdrop for now talking about the credit performance that we see. If you start, Terry, with the sort of foundation that the consumer is in very good shape. The economy is in quite good shape overall, you know one would certainly feel there's sort of a gravitational pull toward even better credit in the business that is helped by the math associated with recoveries that our recoveries rate has been very constant, but the recovery inventory that we have had to collect on, it got very small in -- during the pandemic and that has been replenishing and so there's sort of a good guy gradually coming as recoveries fully restore. And then that really gets us to whatever effects there are of inflation, whatever effects there are on the consumers on the tails that are not in as good shape as sort of the averages that we all look at. And that's -- and what we see there is probably the way actually that the delayed charge-offs are actually playing out. They're probably playing out exactly through these consumers on the tail that are not -- they're still struggling at the margin. So the credit metrics are looking great. We have more solid benchmarks, Terry. The consumer is in a great place. But I think the sort of bigger picture phenomenon of delayed charge-offs that still has intuitively to play out and sort of these effects going on at the tail puts us in a position not to be declaring that things are headed down from here, but it's certainly positive indicators that we see at the margin. Terry Ma : Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just to talk about the auto business. You called out the loan book return to growth this quarter. Should we expect you to lean into that and see loan growth accelerate? And maybe can you just talk about the overall profitability of the loans you're booking today versus what you've seen historically? Thank you. Richard Fairbank : So we feel very good about the auto business. You know, the credit performance is really striking and in fact, let's just savor something that is I think an outlier relative to the industry. But our auto delinquencies have remained consistently below pre-pandemic levels and they've been lower on a year-over-year basis for the past two quarters. And so the auto business is -- when you -- there are many similar things about our card business and the auto business, but if you were to compare the two, the degree with which we sort of intervened in the business and trimmed credit around the edges, it might have been even more dramatic than the term around the edges, what we did in the auto business over the last over the last few years when we were worried about margin pressures in the business as prices were not being sort of past -- inflation pressures were not being passed through. So there were margin pressures, there were declining vehicle values and there was inflation of credit scores. So all of that led us to pull backend each of those have sort of -- have been resolving themselves. You asked about margins, the margins are sort of much more sort of normal in the business right now. The grade inflation on credit scores is resolving itself as credit normalizes. Vehicle values we'll have to continue to keep an eye on those. But pulling way up on the shoulders of a lot of the changes that we have made and the technology that we have massively invested in this business in underwriting and in originations and in our auto navigator platform, all of those put us in a position to feel bullish about leaning into auto. And I think we -- all the trends that we see on margins, credit and competition, we feel good about and that lines up to a story of leaning in on the auto business. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed. Rick Shane : Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Rich, you did a great job laying out the factors that have caused the historical relationship between labor and credit to weaken. And one of the factors you mentioned was the impact of rates. And that makes sense credit cards are one of the two largest classes of floating rate consumer debt. As we think about reversion to historical norms, should we expect charge-off rates to be structurally higher as long as interest rates are structurally higher or is it possible to get back to historic loss rates in a high interest rate environment? Richard Fairbank : It's a great question. It's interesting how all of us -- some of us were around doing similar things back when in -- well, Capital One, we hadn't even come up with the idea for Capital One back when inflation was really raging the last time around. So I think we would be speculating there. But I think, Rick, if we pull up and think about interest rates and their impact, we think about how higher rates as a thing affect consumer credit. So debt servicing burdens for consumers, of course, can get affected the higher rates as they work their way through consumer products gradually, but not immediately sort of make their way into higher debt burdens. So you have mortgages that tend to have fixed rates, auto loans have fixed rates. So you have time delays before interest rates make their way to more pressure on consumers, but still that effect obviously can continue. Most credit cards have variable APRs. So rising interest rates have tended to lead to somewhat higher minimum payments for consumers overall. But if we if we pull up, I think that if wages -- if things stabilize and wages tend to keep up with inflation, I would think on the Credit Card side, there's -- it is plausible that charge-off rates could be very consistent with what they've been in a lower ambient rate environment. I think it gets very challenging when they're suddenly in motion up, but if they stabilize, I'm just speculating here at a moderate level that's higher than they were for the last couple of decades. I think as wages sort of stabilize to make real incomes move the way they should, I would think that credit numbers could be very consistent with historical patterns. I think the biggest driver of why they're not right now, if I were to speculate, probably number one on my list is really the just unprecedented number of years of which charge-offs with all the government stimulus and the forbearance that so many consumers got a lifeline that those for whom that lifeline was a little more temporary in its benefit, some of those issues are still resolving themselves in terms of current charge-offs. It's always an interesting thing to just take a look at the area under the curve in credit losses for -- if we look back over the last number of years and look at where credit losses would typically have been versus where they were and you look at the area under the curve and ask yourself, well, what if all of that were delayed charge-offs? You still have a majority of that area under the curve that would still have to play out in terms of delayed charge-offs. Now we don't believe that anything close to all of the area under the curve would need to come on the other side. But I think if you know a one-sentence sound bite to me of why in such a benign environment, credit losses in businesses like credit cards are running higher than pre-pandemic. It is the delayed charge-off effect. And time should be our friend there that should resolve itself overtime. And there are a lot of positive factors behind that are putting sort of good gravitational pull in the right direction in this industry. Richard Shane : Thank you very much, Rich. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. You may proceed. John Pancari : Good evening. Just on the efficiency side, just a follow-up to Ryan's line of questioning. I know you've guided to an operating efficiency ratio in the low 42% range for 2024. Does this 42% range remain the case as you look at 2025 or do you see a change to the upside or the downside off of this level? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : So, we I think the operating efficiency ratio has really been -- hopefully our investors share our excitement that this 700 basis point improvement that has happened since we began our tech transformation in 2013 has certainly been a very good guy. There are multiple things behind that, but the biggest driver is the technology transformation. And even as we invest a lot, there are also ways to create savings, savings through reduced vendor costs, the really high cost of a lot of legacy technology, the benefits on the cloud and really the ability to then on the other side of the technology transform -- transformation sort of rebuild the company and how it operates on a foundation of modern technology. And so that's a journey that continues and so we see benefits there. I do want to say though also, you have -- we've had a lot of beneficial increase in the ratio in the last couple of years. And I wouldn't want people to just draw -- take the curve and say, wow, that thing almost looks like it's accelerating down. And you no, we don't give guidance in the short term. There are a lot of things that very important investments we're making in the business. But what I like to do is really just point out that when we stand back over a longer time frame and look at the journey of Capital One, this has been a journey for which the efficiency was never the objective function. It was one of the many benefits of a tech transformation, but it's very gratifying to see that continue. But I think the extrapolation from any one year to the next is not something that we would recommend. And so -- but it's a great long-term story. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thanks, Rich. And then one -- a quick second one. I assume this will be a pretty quick answer, but would be helpful if there's any -- have you changed -- made any changes to your expected deal metrics tied to the Discover deal, either the 15% or greater of EPS accretion in [\u201827] (ph) or the expense efficiencies or the timing of adding the $175 billion in purchase volume to the network? Thanks. Richard Fairbank : Hey, John. Yes, what I'll say is it's two independent public companies. We still are operating separately at this point, and there are a number of variables that have moved and will continue to move between now and legal day one. And so I'm not going to specifically comment on how any one of those variables or metrics are changing since the deal model. What I will say is we considered a wide range of outcomes across each of the line items and we continue to be comfortable with the estimates that we included in the deal model. We feel very good both strategically and financially about the deal today as we did nearly a year ago when we announced it. And so as we get to legal day one and put the marks on the balance sheet, we'll provide updates on the relevant metrics at that point. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. You may proceed. Mihir Bhatia : Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start first by just talking about NIM a little bit. You called out the Walmart impact this quarter. Any other call-outs for the quarter? It just feels banks have been quite disciplined about lowering saving accounts interest rates as the Fed has reduced rates? Do you think that continues or are you starting to see some demand for deposits or deposit competition ramping as we start contemplating loan growth here into 2025? I guess just related to that, if you could just talk about some of the puts and takes on NIM in 2025 that'd be great? Thank you. Andrew Young : Sure, Mihir. Well, let me start with just reminding everyone that the one thing for sure we know is that in the first quarter, we have two fewer days. And so that will drive a 15 basis point roughly decrease in NIM. But if I kind of pull up and think beyond day count and look at a longer term -- the longer term, a lot of the same forces that I've been describing for the last number of quarters as potential headwinds and tailwinds still exist today. So if you think about the headwinds, first of all, we're very modestly asset-sensitive. And so you'd see a small decrease in NIM if rates continue to decrease and you saw a little bit of that effect here in this quarter. And the other one, you bring up deposit beta, of course, in our rate risk modeling, we make assumptions around deposit betas. So to the extent that betas are lower or slower on the way down, we would be a little bit more asset-sensitive in that scenario. So those could be headwinds. But on the tailwind side, the steepening yield curve relative to forwards would be a good guy if that persists. But then probably the single biggest factor and we've seen this play out over the last number of quarters is the card growth and card becoming a bigger percentage of our balance sheet, all else equal is a pretty meaningful tailwind to NIM. So those are really the forces at play that I would highlight for you. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just turning quickly to capital return. You've been doing $150 million in buybacks last few quarters. Your CET1 is up to 13.5%. We understand with the deal, you have to get approval right for any capital actions. But the question is -- two-part question there is, A, is that approval keeping you a little conservative right now? And two, once the deal is approved, should we assume you'd be pretty aggressive in getting that down or would it probably fair to assume it stays elevated for a little bit even post deal as you get through the integration? Andrew Young : Yes. I'll wrap my answer to both of those questions into one for you, Mihir. First of all, just go without saying, but I will say it too, which is we clearly recognize that over the longer term capital return is a key component of shareholder value creation. And you've seen in prior periods, we've executed substantial share repurchases. But in the near term, our pending deal is certainly influencing our approach to capital in a few ways. As you said, we're still under regulatory pre-approval rules for each of our capital actions. And then second, we will need to run our own bottoms-up analysis as a combined company to just assess our view of the combined capital need and we continue to be two separate companies and therefore, don't have the ability to do that analysis until after close. And then third, we will need the Fed's approval to go back to operating under the SEB framework. So if I pull up from there, and put all of those together, I think it's likely we're going to stay at a slower repurchase pace until we resolve these factors, but after that, we'll have more flexibility. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research Securities. You may proceed. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. It was good to hear all the references to the Capital One Arena around the inauguration. I wanted to ask about your ability to better compete against the big banks in debit, assuming the Discover transaction closes as you expect? We know debit rewards for Visa, Mastercard issuers essentially went away after the force reduction in interchange under Dodd-Frank, but would reintroducing debit rewards be something that you'd consider given the greater flexibility that owning the Discover Network will afford you? Richard Fairbank : Hey, Bill. So obviously, a really key part of the deal is our excitement about getting the network and being able to add such a key dimension in vertically integrating our business. And we talk so much about credit cards all the time, the debit business is a really important one. And on little cat feet, Capital One has really been investing in our national banking business. So -- and by the way, having our own network will be valuable there and we'll be able to enjoy the vertically integrated economics of owning a network and the scale that comes of course from pulling Discover and a bunch of Capital One's volume together. Now, I just want to pull back and just talk a little bit about Capital One's Consumer Banking strategy, and therefore and debit is of course, right in the transaction business right at the heart of that. If you pull way up and think about consumer banking way back to when banks began, you had banks with branches on every corner. And then in the last 15 or 20 years, there have been the evolution of direct banks and they have been savings only, offering higher rates and they have no physical distribution whatsoever. And we, of course, also through our acquisitions, have acquired several banks with branches on every corner. And we also acquired the nation's largest direct bank, and I announced at the time of that acquisition, this is a great financial trade, but it is also a strategic game-changer for Capital One. That was back like 12 years ago. So since then, we have been very steadily, systematically, relentlessly and patiently if I could put so many adjectives on -- adverbs on that, pursuing a business model that actually doesn't really exist right now because we have those two endpoints. But what we're really trying to do is build, in a sense the Bank of the future. And we believe that Bank of the Future is not just a direct bank, it's also not a bank with a branch on every corner, it is a bank with thin physical distribution. For us, we've got branches, but then also in major metropolitan areas, we have put in cafes that are really basically less about coffee, but really more about being sort of a hybrid of a branch and a showroom for Capital One and a place people can go and understand Capital One is there to help them and get a sense for really what this company is about and how it may be able to help them live their life more effectively. So as we've been -- so this strategy has been about, if we work backwards from what we believe is the bank of the future. From a distribution point of view, that's thin physical distribution and highlighted by these Cafe showrooms it also -- a very central part of that is digital capabilities that enable something that's a very, very difficult thing to do, which is to take just about everything that can be done in a branch and make it available digitally. Now there are some things like safe deposit boxes we haven't figured out how to create a digital safe deposit box for your valuables. And there are a few things that just you can't get there on a digital basis. But what's -- but as we've looked at this, we said just pretty much virtually all the activities that people go to branches for, we want to be able to deliver to them through our thin physical distribution plus massive full-service digital capability. And that's what we've been building over these years. Additionally, it requires -- in order to generate business, we need great products and we've been the only major bank out there with no fees, no minimums, and even a recent move of no overdraft fees, and those better deals come from having built the -- in a sense superior economics that come from this sort of physical distribution light model. Now then you asked the question, so what will be our debit card strategy? We haven't completed the deal. We haven't fully gone in on the other side of exactly seeing, how things are working on the Discover side. But we are very pleased with the results that we're having with our current strategy, including our current debit card strategy. And we are investing heavily to continue to grow that business. You look at the significant increase in marketing over the years. One of the drivers of this is that Capital One is building a National bank organically and without a lot of physical distribution and to get there, it takes a lot of marketing. So I think the best way to think about it is Discover gives a shot in the arm and a boost to a strategy we've been pursuing for more than a decade and the best way to think about it, I think is picture just more of the same from Capital One with a little bit of an accelerator. Bill Carcache : I appreciate all the details, Rich. Thank you. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. You may proceed. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Rich, you talked about better growth in Auto and Card, you talked about the high-end cards. Talk about the non-prime businesses in both card and auto, given the improved credit, how you're thinking about growth in those businesses in the coming quarters? Richard Fairbank : Moshe, the word that I would use at the lower -- and the sort of lower end of the business, obviously, there are parts of the market below where we play. But if we sort of loosely call it at the lower end of the non-prime or subprime part of the marketplace, the word that I would use to describe it is stability and stability of -- let's look at the key aspects of that. On the consumer credit side, actually, the first part of our business to normalize really to settle out with respect to credit was the lower end of the market. That's been very stable. The -- our originations in that segment and really pretty much across our business, the originations are coming in on top of each other for years. So that has a stability there as well. Competitively, it's a very competitive part -- it's a very competitive part of the business that has many in addition to regular card players, many non-traditional players as well. So the competitive intensity is high, but we watch it very carefully. And so with the stability of performance and the strength of the consumer, we in both the card and the auto side of the business continue to lean in a very similar way that we have -- well, for card, it's just been very consistent for years. With auto, we kind of pulled back quite a bit in that part of the business and we're leaning in as we often have done historically. So we're leaning into both of them and we're really pleased with the stability and strength of the metrics that underlie those businesses. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow up, when you think about reserve levels, given that you are seeing or likely to see some improvement in credit losses kind of on a core basis or like-for-like. And it sounds like the growth is probably -- a growth that you have on the balance sheet is probably going to come in your lower loss categories, not the higher ones, thoughts about the reserve level as we move forward? Andrew Young : Sure, Moshe. So what's going to happen in future quarters starts with what happened this quarter. So I just want to reiterate a couple of the drivers of this quarter as a jumping-off point. As I said in the prepared remarks, your coverage was down 33 basis points by two things. The bigger effect being that we typically have seasonally higher balance -- balances in the fourth quarter that require very low levels of coverage and that denominator effect from those balances put downward pressure on coverage. The other effect was that the allowance we needed for what I'll call non-seasonal growth was offset by favorable observed credit performance. And so we added $0 of allowance balance to the numerator, but the non-seasonal growth impacted the denominator. And so in the first quarter, I just wanted to provide that backdrop to say the seasonal balances will run off and so there will be a corresponding upward pressure on coverage, all else equal from that effect. But beyond that, it's really going to come down to growth and our loss forecast and loss forecast specifically for the coverage. And to the extent that loss forecast improves, changes in coverage could be modest in the near term as we just reflect the uncertainty of our projections and the allowance. But eventually, the improved loss forecast is going to flow through the allowance and continue to bring the coverage ratio down as uncertainties become more certain. And so while the direction of travel would be down, the pace and timing is going to depend on a variety of factors, one of which will include the mix of businesses, as you say, but when it's denominated to the whole portfolio, the relative growth of different forecasted loss portions of the of the book aren't going to have material impact to coverage just given that the new originations as a percentage of the overall book in any given quarter is relatively small. And then the only thing I also want to remind you of is, I know our investors look at history as a potential guide for levels of coverage. And I just want to remind you that we called out the roughly 50 basis points of impact to coverage from the termination of the loss-sharing agreement with Walmart. So that created a step function change in coverage relative to our prior history as well. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Don Fandetti : Yes, Rich, your Credit Card purchase volume growth on a like account basis has picked up. I'm just trying to get a sense if this is a Q4 blip or are you thinking that the consumer is actually more confident here after the election? And are you seeing that same improvement in consumer and small business as well? Richard Fairbank : Well, we have -- if we think about our purchase volume, our growth in overall purchase volume continues to be driven by growth in our branded card customer base and the branded card includes both our consumer and our small business. The growth that you see and that we've seen for several years now is certainly a thing powering. It has been a strength in originations and some strength in originations at the higher end of the market. But the other way to think about your question is at a customer level, what you know, on a per customer basis, what's been happening to spend growth. And even as our spend metrics were growing over overall, the spend growth per customer in our consumer business have been largely -- they had been largely flat through 2023 and really the first-half of 2024. And then they started to pick up midway through last year and they grew further in Q4. And I don't have in front of me the small business card numbers. They're embedded in the numbers that I gave you. So the fact that we have seen spend per customer finally pick up here is striking, whether it will continue and exactly what's driving it is hard to say, but I did want to point out that positive trajectory as the year finished off. Don Fandetti : Got it. And Andrew, you touched on this, but your '24 vintage, can you talk a little bit about how you're feeling -- how you're seeing that shape up in terms of credit performance? I've seen some industry data that shows delinquencies are still pretty high for '24? Andrew Young : Yes, Don, why don't I take that. So recent originations in our card business, we continue to see stability in the performance of our originations. It's really striking here. We've been calling this out consistently over the past few years. Vintage over vintage, we're seeing mostly stable risk levels over time. And also striking is our overall front book of new origination vintages continues to perform in line with pre-pandemic vintages. Now when you compare with pre-pandemic vintages, you can't look at 2019 because 2019 very quickly got sort of corrupted by the pandemic. So we're looking at 2017 and 2018 when we make these comparisons. But from a Capital One point of view, I think this is this stability in origination performance and quarter-over-quarter and the consistency with pre-pandemic is the result of our intervention to deal with inflated credit scores and the high level of industry supplies that were flooding, particularly the subprime marketplace back there. So we trimmed around the edges and continued to very closely watch the origination vintages. And that has led to a sustained stability on the part of Capital One and some of our most recent vintages. Now again, we're still looking -- you've got to look like, six months in the rearview mirror to see much, but we continue to see some very positive results there. We also have looked at industry data that shows some gapping out in vintages over the last couple of years. So I think the industry effect is not probably consistent with what we have described. And if I were to explain why because I think they're very capable companies doing this. I think the -- I'm not sure that most of the industry adjusted for inflated credit scores. And we intervened on our models with a belief that the university was suddenly giving out As that should be Bs basically and so we intervened and then kept validating along the way. But for a while, we didn't have validation. We just intervened because we believed it was the right thing to do. So I think what we had -- what has been seen if you look at just overall industry originations is, as you say, some gapping out and I think that would be the biggest driver. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. I guess, Rich, just one more on the deal. Given the timeline that you've outlined earlier this year, is it fair to assume like everything is going pretty smoothly in terms of the regulatory approval process and there hasn't been any surprises? I'm also wondering sort of where you guys are in terms of the integration efforts and how much work has been done there? Richard Fairbank : Okay. Yes, so no, the approval process continues to move forward. We've made substantial process in the recent months. We remain actively engaged with the Fed and the OCC about our merger applications and it is the Fed and the OCC who ultimately decide on our merger application. Late last year, we received approval from the Delaware State Bank Commissioner, which we needed because Discover is a State Chartered Bank. We of course, had the big public hearing in July and that went very well, we feel. Earlier this month, of course, we finalized a joint proxy statement with the SEC setting up the February 18 shareholder vote. So that was good progress finally there. We are also engaged with the Justice Department as they play a key role in advising the Fed and the OCC on the competitive aspects of the deal. And we continue to believe that this transaction is both pro-competitive and pro-consumer, bringing our best-in-class products and services to a broader set of consumers and small businesses, and really enhancing opportunities and benefits for merchants as well. So pulling way up, it's certainly the deal process is a long labor, but we remain well-positioned to get approval of the deal early this year. And we are really proud of the work everyone is doing here and we look forward to getting this over the goal line. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Just to follow-up on a question Ryan asked some time ago on sort of when you put the companies together and the efficiencies, and sort of the investments that need to be made. I guess when you put the two companies together, the efficiency ratio actually goes down and obviously, there's a lot of synergies both on revenues and expenses. Do you think those are sufficient enough to sort of accomplish? I'm just trying the question again. Do you think those are sufficient enough to make all of the investments that you sort of outlined? Or do you think that there's others that you might have to make as you peel the onion a little bit when you have the company? Richard Fairbank : So, I don't think we're in a position to -- and it's not just because we want to be coy about it. We -- we're not in a different place than we were at the time we announced the deal. And we should point out that we are working really hard preparing for integration, but we are still separate companies and Discover is working incredibly hard and working on their compliance and I know they're doing preparations for integration as well and we certainly are. We're not getting an inside view of their numbers, their performance, their business model. So we're mostly sort of where we were at the outset. But if we pull up to your point, so Discover operated -- operates with a significantly lower efficient -- operating efficiency ratio than Capital One. That's certainly a good thing for the combined company. I think it is also the case that the -- I think Discover has had a heritage of probably less investment in certain areas than Capital One. And in a few cases, they're sort of making up for lost time there. But I think having not seen on the other side, we assume that there are some areas that we will -- and we've assumed this from the beginning, we're going to need to step-up the investments and obviously on the risk management side, there's a lot of investment to be done, whether it is how -- what ultimately needs to be done compares with what they're investing and all of that remains to be seen. We obviously had assumptions in our deal model about leaning in on that. But what we get is -- so there's going to be a lot of effects that are all pretty significant that just go in different directions. A company with an amazing efficiency ratio, a company that's probably underinvested in a number of areas that's relative to Capital One and we would shore up some of those investments. We also get a lot of synergy that comes from bringing overlapping businesses together. That's a very a strong effect. And then these three -- the investment areas, the three that we're pointing out, we are talking about investing in those at a level that's a lot different than what Discover has done traditionally. Obviously, the risk management one, we've all talked about that and they're leaning in hard now. On international acceptance, they certainly -- again I'm amazed with their not that great scale, what they've done, but we would expect to invest at a higher level than they have there and in terms of the network brand relative to -- I wanted to make a comment about the network brand and some of this other investment. It is -- we have sloped -- we have taken our card business and sloped the business that we think most naturally and easily can go to the Discover network and it involves folks that aren't big international travelers, for example. So we've sloped the work. There is -- we think it's very straightforward to move this business front book and back book business to Discover. And some of these investments that I'm talking about leaning into are particularly important for the longer-term opportunity of being able to move more business than what we put into our deal model. And again, in doing that, we would -- we sloped -- we took our whole customer base and imagine sort of sloping it in terms of what part of the business fits most naturally within the context of the capabilities and the brand of Discover's network. And then as we want to move more we're going to need the bar to be raised relative to acceptance in brand and that's why I think you know these other investments were talking about will be multi-year they'll be overtime and there'll be things that help the deal payoff even more so in the longer term. Jeff Norris : Next question, please. Operator : And our final question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. You may proceed. John Hecht : Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for fitting me in here. First question, just thinking about the mix of the overall consumer book. I mean, you've got some new cards like the Venture One and Quicksilver, and some of those are attracted to different demographic groups. And then you've got the subprime mix and then you've got auto. Where do we see just given kind of in-bound customer mix? Where do we see that going this year as a standalone business? And then, Rich, do you have any comments of what the total portfolio might look like assuming the combination with Discover? Richard Fairbank : Yes, so thank you, John. So we -- so let's -- let me take Discover just in a minute. So if you pull way up on Capital One for a long, long time, Capital One has been a sort of a full spectrum player. We have had -- for several decades, we have had a subprime business that is tailor-made for the information-based strategy we have because it's all about surviving and winning on the credit side of the business, but also in that business, we've also very, very much focused relative to others who play in the space to degree of exceptionally good deals. It's not just about sort of surviving on the credit side, but really giving great deals, helping people use credit wisely. And in fact, really, I think the deals that we're offering are very, very simple and profoundly better than a lot of the deals that are available in the marketplace. And so that business has -- is a very stable part of what we do at Capital One and we continue to lean into that. The -- probably the most dramatic thing that's been happening in the last decade in Capital One's card business is, as you referenced, the quest toward the top of the market and that is a journey that as far out as we can see, we will continue to lean into that because there is so much opportunity at the top of the market. And obviously, it takes a lot of investment, but the key indicator to us that when we stratify the segments of our business by spend levels, the part that's growing the fastest consistently year after year at Capital One is the heaviest spenders. And there's just so much upside north of where we are, we will continue to invest in that. Now if you stand back, just think about our Card business, while our subprime business has been going along and we keep leaning into that, there has been a gradual mix shift upmarket for the company. And even within each segment, within the sort of the subprime book, the sort of the prime book, and certainly the top of the market, there has been a gradual mix change with a spender first philosophy that permeates our business. So that's -- and some of that you can see in just some of the structural changes in the payment rates at Capital One. So I believe that what you see and what you have seen for numbers -- a number of -- for many years is a good prognosticator of probably how the future of legacy Capital One would likely go. Meaning, continued leaning in across the spectrum, but differentially an awful lot of investment toward the top of the market and the most growth opportunity there. Now we -- now let me turn to Discover. Discover, interestingly, has taken a very different approach than Capital One. While we have taken a very broad approach playing in all parts of the market, Discover has had a very focused strategy on the prime part of the business and they've done a very, very good job there and we certainly always admired them from the outside. So we will be bringing into our company a significant increase in that portion of the market, which probably differentially got a little less emphasis if anything. It's not like we weren't playing there, but if anything, we had a greater emphasis probably north and south of that part of the business. But so from a mix point of view, we certainly -- we will be bringing in a business that's very homogeneous relative to the very heterogeneous business that we have. And then on the other side of all of that, I think that we will -- if I were to summarize our strategy, it will be to continue. Everything we were doing is Capital One because we're getting a lot of traction in that, and then making very sure that we don't crush the butterfly of this beautiful business model that Discover has in the prime part of the market, but that we go in there and while, yes, integrating things like technology and some of the risk management processes and a lot of things, do everything that we can to make sure that we don't directly or even unwittingly sort of crush the really nice butterfly of what they do. And in that way, we hope to bring in a growth business that Discover has and add it to the very complementary growth businesses that Capital One has and collectively continue to try to get the best of both worlds, bringing along the way some -- better efficiencies and really bringing top technology to all aspects of the business. John Hecht : Great. Very much appreciate it. Thanks. Jeff Norris : Well, thank you everyone for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Have a great night, everybody. Richard Fairbank : Thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
