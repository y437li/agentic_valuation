Republic Services is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RSG. [Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. DelGhiaccio. Good afternoon, Mr. DelGhiaccio. Brian DelGhiaccio : Good afternoon, operator. Welcome, and thank you for joining us. This is Brian DelGhiaccio, and I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' first quarter 2014 conference call.

When events are scheduled, the dates, times, and presentations are posted on our website, along with instructions for listening to the live webcast of the event. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results and are proud of the way the Republic team responded to challenging winter conditions. Even though we lost approximately 3% of our route days in the central and east regions due to weather, we reported positive volume growth, positive yield in all lines of business, and generated strong cash flow to fund substantial cash returns to shareholders. Some of the financial highlights for the quarter include first quarter EPS was $0.43. Excluding the weather impact, adjusted EPS would have been $0.45. About half of the $0.02 weather impact was due to lost revenue opportunities and the remainder was due to increased operating costs. Adjusted free cash flow was $186 million, and it was in line with our expectations. This level of performance continues to demonstrate the strong cash flow characteristics of our business. Core price in the first quarter was 3.2% and average yield was 1.2%. Average yield was comparable to the first quarter of the prior year, even with a 110 basis point decline in CPI-based pricing. We continue to see strong core price contribution from the open market to offset lower CPI-based price resets. First quarter volumes increased 1.5%. Volume growth was concentrated due to C&D roll off, national accounts, and landfill special waste. Commercial service level changes were positive in the first quarter and increased sequentially. This is a continuation of a trend that began in 2013. We returned $226 million to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. This includes 3.9 million shares repurchased for $132 million. We still expect to spend approximately $400 million on share repurchases in 2014. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our multiyear initiatives that enabled us to execute our strategy. We are focused on managing the controllable aspects of our business by improving the quality of revenue, investing in profitable growth opportunities, and reducing costs. For example, during the first quarter, we launched My Resource, a customer portal that gives our customers online access to their accounts and our services. This expanded technology enhances our customers\u2019 experience by making it easier to do business with us. These capabilities further differentiate our service offering and increase value to our customers. We continue to improve service quality by consistently delivering on the promises we make to our customers. The goal is to build customer loyalty and improve customer retention. We grade ourselves using Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which measures the willingness of our customers to recommend our services. Our Net Promoter Scores have improved in five consecutive quarters. The investment made in acquisitions was $11 million. We acquired approximately $7 million of revenue at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 4.5x. These transactions consist of tuck-in acquisitions that layer in well to markets we already service. At the end of the quarter, we had $18 million of deals under letter of intent. 12% of our fleet is currently operating on natural gas. We expect that 14% of the fleet will be operating on natural gas by the end of the year. 57% of our residential fleet is now automated. 47% of our fleet has completed our One Fleet maintenance initiative. We remain confident that we can cost-effectively extend the use of our fleet by one year once the majority of our vehicles have been certified. We estimate that this will reduce future capital requirements by $200 million, spread over a 4 to 5 year period, beginning in 2015. Our initiatives remain on track, and we plan to launch other initiatives over the next several quarters, including the next generation of our ROI based pricing tool. I\u2019m proud of our achievements during the first quarter, and remain encouraged by the underlying strength of the business. I want to thank the entire Republic team for their hard work and execution. Glenn and Ed will now discuss the financial performance. Glenn? Glenn Culpepper : Thanks, Don. First quarter 2014 revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, an increase of $75 million from the prior year. This 3.8% increase in revenue includes acquisitions of 60 basis points and reflects the following three components of internal growth : pricing, volume, and recycled commodities. First, pricing. We had an average yield growth of 1.2%. First quarter average yield was consistent with the same period in the prior year, and in line with our expectations. Core price in the first quarter was 3.2%. Average yield in the collection business was 1.3%, which includes 2.7% yield in the industrial business and 1.2% yield in the commercial business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.4%, led by landfill and MSW, which increased approximately 2%. Fuel recovery fees increased 0.1%. Fuel costs increased approximately $2 million compared to the prior year, and decreased 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.96 in the first quarter from $4.03 in the past year, a decrease of approximately 1.7%. The current average diesel price is approximately $3.95 per gallon. Second, volumes increased 1.5% year over year. The collection business was positive 1.1%, primarily due to an increase in industrial volume. Growth in the industrial line of business was 3.1%, which includes C&D and other temporary activity, which was up approximately 6%. Growth in the commercial business continues to be positive, but modest at 1.1%. Collection volume also includes a 50 basis point decline in the residential business, primarily due to contracts lost in bid situations. We will only renew business if it meets our return criteria. The post-collection business consisting of third-party landfill and transfer station volume was positive 1.8%, which includes an increase in landfill special waste of approximately 14%. Special waste landfill volumes were lower in the first quarter of 2013, which created an easier comparison. Our landfill MSW volumes were down 1.6%. Our defection rate, which represents the annualized rate of customer turnover, remains stable at approximately 7%. Third, commodity revenue increased 40 basis points. The increase in commodity sales reflects both higher prices for recycled commodities and an increase in tons sold. Commodity prices increased 4.4% to an average price of $117 per ton in the first quarter from $112 per ton in the past year. This represents the average price for all commodity types across all regions. First quarter recycling facility volume of 558,000 tons was up 3.6% from the prior year. Most of the increase relates to additional national accounts brokered volumes. We closed five older recycling centers that we no longer operate or that were consolidated into other facilities. We intentionally rationalized recycling assets that did not meet our return criteria. Current average commodity prices are approximately $113 per ton. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased $12 million compared to the prior year, an increase of 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Most of the change relates to brokering recycled commodity volumes on behalf of our national accounts customers. The return on this business is attractive, since there are limited capital requirements. Now I will discuss year over year margin. First quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%, compared to 28.5% in the prior year, a decrease of 80 basis points. As Don mentioned, our business was impacted by the severe weather conditions in the first quarter, which reduced EBITDA margin performance by approximately 30 basis points. The margin impact mostly relates to an increase in operating costs, including labor, fuel, and utilities incurred as a result of weather. Additionally, we benefited from alternative fuel tax credits of approximately $6 million in the prior year. As we discussed on our last earnings call in February, this credit expired, which resulted in a 30 basis point EBITDA margin headwind in the first quarter of 2014. These margin headwinds are isolated to our first quarter performance. During the first quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $36 million or $0.06 of EPS related to an increase in estimated remediation costs at Bridgeton Landfill. During the quarter, it became necessary to upgrade the design and capacity of the [unintelligible] Treatment Facility, which will increase total construction costs. The impact of this charge was excluded from adjusted EPS in the first quarter and our expected adjusted EPS for the full year. Ed will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow, and selected balance sheet data. Edward Lang : Thanks, Glenn. First quarter 2014 interest expense was $87 million, which included $11 million of noncash amortization. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 39.8% of adjusted earnings, and in line with our expectations. Our effective tax rate of 33.4% in Q1 of the prior year was favorably impacted by closing our open tax years under audit. The change in tax rate was expected, but resulted in a $0.05 EPS headwind compared to our prior year performance. First quarter 2014 adjusted free cash flow was $186 million, which was in line with our expectations. Net capital expenditures during the quarter were $213 million. At March 31, our accounts receivable balance was $873 million, and our days sales outstanding was 38 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at March 31, and excess availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.5 billion. I will now turn the call back to Don. Donald Slager : Thanks, Ed. To conclude, our first quarter results keep us on track to achieve the goals and objectives we established for 2014, and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance. The fundamentals of the business remain strong, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of an improving economy. We built our plan assuming the positive momentum exiting 2013 would continue, and we believe underlying business conditions are improving as expected. We remain focused on managing the business for the long term and creating lasting shareholder value. Our team remains dedicated to providing superior customer service and executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and cash flow growth. We are committed to an efficient capital structure, maintaining our investment grade rating, and increasing cash returns to shareholders. Before going to Q&A, I would like to personally congratulate three Republic employees for being selected as this year\u2019s drivers of the year by the National Waste and Recycling Association. The three drivers are being honored for their outstanding customer service and safety records and were chosen out of 908 nominations from across the U.S. As this award is our industry\u2019s highest honor, I\u2019m proud that once again Republic secured all three of the coveted award categories. Congratulations Tino, [unintelligible], and Johnny. We look forward to celebrating your achievements with you next week at Waste Expo. At this time, operator, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Your final question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse. Hamzah Mazari : Just a question on volumes. Maybe you could give us a sense of any early read you have into seasonality. Are we going to see above normal seasonality based on what you\u2019re seeing in volumes today? I realize it may be a little too early. And then by the same token, maybe you could touch on how much landfill volumes were up as well, if I missed that. Donald Slager : I will tell you that Q2 we\u2019re off to a really good start in April, looking at a continuation of what we saw with specifically roll off C&D and special waste has been strong for us. So again, to your point, it is a little bit too early to judge seasonality. We usually like to have May under our belt before we can start to judge that. But we\u2019re off to a good start in April. As far as landfill volume overall, we had a strong C&D and MSW, but total landfill volume was plus 4%. But special waste led the way, as Glenn said, up about 14%. So we lost some MSW volume. We\u2019ve had some competitive losses, so about 1.6% decline over last year in trash coming into landfills based on competitive pricing. Hamzah Mazari : And just a follow up question. I think you\u2019re less than 3x net debt to EBITDA levered. There are a lot of larger assets out there that are private. I know historically you\u2019ve spoken about this steady $100 million tuck-in sort of acquisition diet. Could you maybe just comment on how comfortable you are in taking leverage up? I know we did that in the Republic-Allied deal. How comfortable are you in taking leverage up to what level to do something larger that makes sense? Donald Slager : Well, we\u2019ve always said I think our sweet spot is between 2.5x and 3x. So we\u2019d like to keep it there. We\u2019re right now at 3x. We do look at larger deals, and right now we are focused and have been on the small tuck-ins, because they come at the right multiple post-synergy and they also have less risk as far as integration goes. We do look at larger transactions, and we do have flexibility in our balance sheet to do things, whether we can do that using our revolver or if we had to flex the stock repurchase. We\u2019re just looking at it from what\u2019s accretive and what brings us the best returns. So if you look at our stock trading at 8.5, for us it kind of comes down to that. Would we rather spend 8.5x EBITDA buying into a company we know and love, that is Republic? Or do we want to put that money at risk? And we certainly aren\u2019t going to be paying 9x or 9.5x for EBITDA. So if we can buy good free cash flow at the right multiple, we\u2019re going to do that, and we\u2019re going to consistently look at larger deals. And they do come across our radar every now and then, but we\u2019ve got to be disciplined in our purchasing strategy. Glenn Culpepper : And the limit on our credit facility as far as the covenant test is debt to EBITDA of 3.5x, so again, we\u2019re an investment grade credit. Our credit metrics are consistent with that type of a credit rating, and the credit facility does have a limit in debt to EBITDA in order to ensure that type of a rating. Operator : The next question that I show comes from Derek Sbrogna with Macquarie. Derek Sbrogna : Just wanted to drill in a little bit here on the weather. The $0.02 impact, can you maybe talk a little bit more about where you see the lost revenue opportunities and also I know you framed out the three areas where costs have increased. If you could maybe provide some additional color on why those costs go up in poorer weather? Donald Slager : Well, weather specifically. We had some really severe weather in parts of the country that we normally budget weather in, places like Chicago and Detroit. But this was pretty harsh weather if you live there. We had brutal cold and we had snow day on day. And then we saw weather in parts of the country we don\u2019t normally budget for weather. We don\u2019t budget for snow in Atlanta and places like that. So when you have weather like that, we have two things happen. We have loss of revenue from garbage not moving to our landfills or us not hauling roll off loads from businesses that aren\u2019t operating. You have some pickup from the fact that some days you don\u2019t run your trucks. But then when you have to come back and pick up where you left off and make up for that lost time, you\u2019re paying a lot of overtime. And you have frankly, in some of the really brutal weather, things tend to break when it\u2019s subzero for many days in a row. You know, steel gets brittle and your maintenance costs go up, those kind of things. So again, I know we\u2019re not the only company out there beyond the waste industry that\u2019s had to talk about weather, and so we\u2019re not using that as an excuse. We just wanted to point it out, that we did have some impact. And frankly, a solid $0.02 from a half cost and half revenue loss, but I think that frames out the fact that we\u2019re really positive on the underlying fundamentals of the business units and as to the question I answered from Hamzah, we\u2019ve got a good start here in April, and we think the underlying fundamentals are strong. Operator : And maybe just one more. You\u2019ve seen a couple of consecutive quarters here of the strength in specialty waste. I know that there\u2019s been some easier comps, and maybe that business can be lumpy. But can you talk about the environment you\u2019re seeing in those markets and whether some of the pickup is really indicative of you guys winning business, or whether it\u2019s just indicative of a strengthening environment. Donald Slager : I would say it\u2019s new volume. We talk about how our business tends to lag the economy, both on the downside and the return. And we would tell you that as we see special waste volumes returning, it is an indicative sign of better economy to come. When companies are releasing bids for special waste cleanups, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve got confidence in their own capital budgets. And a lot of times, the special waste is land clearing for new construction, so that bodes well for what\u2019s to come. So we\u2019ve got a strong market in special waste and C&D, and we\u2019re just waiting for that to lead the way for a stronger return in commercial. Operator : Next is from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Corey Greendale : First, a question on the brokered recycling volume. I understand that that\u2019s [unintelligible] because of slow capex, but it is suppressing EBITDA margins, so it would be helpful to understand just what is happening without that in it. The 50 basis point decrease that I think Glenn talked about from that particular [unintelligible], is that the right way to think about this, that EBITDA margin would have been 50 basis points higher if it weren\u2019t for the growth in that business? Donald Slager : The national accounts brokered volumes would account for a 30 basis point decrease in our margins in the quarter. And the reason for it really is we\u2019re required to book the full amount of the revenue and the full amount of the costs, even though in many cases we\u2019re not even handling the product. And so it\u2019s really just a pass through, but we have to record both the revenues and the costs gross. Corey Greendale : And I know the dynamic kind of contrasting internal growth components, you versus Waste, there\u2019s nothing new, but because it was almost the sole focus of Waste\u2019s call earlier, I just want to ask. The fact that you\u2019re reporting better volume and lower on yield than Waste Management, how much do you attribute that to philosophy versus the markets you\u2019re in and do you expect that to change with this next generation ROI pricing tool that you\u2019re talking about? Donald Slager : That\u2019s a big question, so I\u2019ll give you some color. One, we don\u2019t focus primarily just on yield metric. There\u2019s a lot more to consider when you think about where you want to grow your business and how you want to balance price and volume. So we\u2019re trying to give both positive price and volume in our business, and of course we\u2019re focused on return on invested capital. So when it comes to where we\u2019ll walk away from business, we want to walk away from business when it\u2019s not profitable, when it doesn\u2019t give us an appropriate return. We want to retain business that gives us the appropriate return, even if it is a competitive bidding type of a situation. So we take two very different views. One in the post-collection business. We have consistently raised prices in the landfill business, and consistently let volume go that didn\u2019t meet our pricing expectations. Those landfills are expensive to own and operate, and we feel that they should carry a higher price component of growth every year. So as I said, we actually saw more defection in our landfill business in Q1, 1.6% volume loss, and all that volume loss because they found a better price somewhere else. So a little different view in the hauling side, as I said. In our commercial business, that density really matters, and it\u2019s a very profitable part of our business. So when we\u2019re in a competitive situation over a current customer, we\u2019re going to try to keep that customer if it\u2019s profitable and has the right return. Now, we\u2019re growing our rollup business, because that part of the business is starting to come back. And while some might argue that that part of the business has a lower return than other parts of the business, the fact is our job is to grow free cash flow and deploy capital at the appropriate terms. So we\u2019re growing that business, and we\u2019re getting both price and volume in the rollup system. So we\u2019re seeing margins expand because of the demand. So we think our team\u2019s doing a good job of balancing both price and volume. Remember that we\u2019ve got 7% defection in our business, so if we do nothing, our business shrinks 7% a year. And so we\u2019ve got to replace that volume. About half of that 7% is competitive. The other half is structural, but we\u2019ve got to replace that volume to stay flat. In fact, you\u2019ve got to replace that volume plus, in order to stay flat, because we\u2019ve had this conversation probably a number of times, Corey. If you\u2019re losing business for competitive price, you\u2019re losing it at a higher than average price, and if you\u2019re gaining business at market prices, it\u2019s generally coming in slightly below. So another thing to point out is I think our pricing\u2019s pretty strong. We have 3.2% core price, and that includes 4.2% in the open market. So we\u2019re out there pricing pretty consistently in the open market every month. And as you know, we really control that pricing movement from a corporate office, our pricing team working with the local divisions, pushing out those pricing programs month after month. You know, every market about a 12th of the market every month that we\u2019re reviewing customer cost and pricing and passing that into the market. So I think we\u2019re doing a good job. The think you mentioned about the new pricing tool, what that\u2019s going to do for us, it\u2019s a technology solution, frankly, that brings some better control and user friendliness to our frontline sales people so that we\u2019re going to try to work harder to control that point of sale pricing and help those sales people make better decisions at the front end. So a lot of the things that we\u2019re doing at Republic are focused in and around improving yield. And I would say it more improving the quality of revenue, and improving the decision making about how we quote business and how we prove to the customer that our value proposition is better. I spoke in my comments about customer service, about launching the user portal, the thing we call My Resource. So whatever we can do around here to improve that quality of revenue, that quality of the product to the customer, increase their willingness to pay, that\u2019s where we\u2019re living and breathing here. But we believe that you\u2019ve got to balance that volume and price growth. As long as you\u2019ve got a keen eye in and around a returns-based philosophy, we think it\u2019s the right thing to do for cash and ultimately for long term returns in the business. Operator : Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets, your line is open. Joe Box : Don, it sounds like you guys are getting pretty close to getting over the hump on One Fleet, at about 47% installed. I think comps get a bit easier in Q2 on the maintenance and repair side. Are you still thinking that mid to late 2014, One Fleet starts to pay for itself? Donald Slager : Yeah, when half the fleet is certified and no longer causing that cost [unintelligible] wave, we\u2019ll start seeing more and more benefits from the first half of the fleet. Again, improved productivity, less downtime, better customer service, driver engagement scores improve in the business. So we\u2019re still positive about the process. Again, this is a really big change initiative as we\u2019ve talked about, and it\u2019s kind of slow going, but the deeper we get into it, the more committed we are to it. It\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s going to pay us back. And then of course over and above that, just running a better business, having a stronger operation and a better customer service reliability, we\u2019re going to have that reduced capex over the long term. So we\u2019re committed to getting more out of our fleet and beginning to reduce capex in 2015 by $40 to $50 million a year over a four or five year period. Joe Box : No, I certainly get the benefits of it. Maybe just to dig into the numbers a little bit, and I get that Q1 maintenance and repair expenses probably were somewhat inflated by weather, but should we start to think about that year over year increase in maintenance from repair leveling off? Or even declining on a year over year basis? Donald Slager : Well, we\u2019ll just try to put it into the context of this. The three initiatives that we\u2019ve got going on in our cost and productivity are One Fleet, our C&D and our automation. They\u2019re worth about 100 basis points over a three-year period. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019d have you look at it, and we\u2019re going to have better science around this as we get into it, and ultimately we\u2019re going to get really good at understanding the efficient frontier of our fleet and tweaking our maintenance even further. But more of our stand today is that 1% across those three initiatives of operating costs over a three-year period. Joe Box : I just want to as one very high level question for you. It seems like there\u2019s been several states out there that have added recycling mandates recent, which I guess I find it a bit interesting, because at the same time you have waste firms like yourself that are pushing back and even rationalizing some recycling assets. So I guess what would you tell us? How should we think about reconciling the difference between what customers are saying versus what vendors are doing right now. It just seems like you guys are kind of moving in opposite directions. Donald Slager : I guess start with we don\u2019t think recycling is going away. We think it\u2019s core to our business and we recognize the customer demand. At the same time, we\u2019re in the business to turn a profit, and we need to expand our business services to meet customer needs as long as they bring the appropriate return. So again, Glenn mentioned that we\u2019ve rationalized a couple of assets. We closed a couple of facilities, because they weren\u2019t bringing us the proper return. It really is a market by market basis. So we\u2019ve got 240 markets across our 40 states. California is not going to change. They\u2019re going to continue to have very strong recycling goals, and they\u2019ve got teeth in those goals. Consequently, they\u2019ve also got a lot of money to spend in education and the recycling is much more a part of the social conscience there. There are other states that are similar to that. There are some states that have increased their goals, but they really haven\u2019t put any teeth around that. It comes down to regulation, it comes down to density, participation rates, and ultimately for us it\u2019s got to come down to, can we create a decent return? And in some markets, we think we\u2019ll be able to have a good return on recycling. In other markets, we won\u2019t. And consequently, we won\u2019t do it or we\u2019ll do it through a third party. In some cases, we have a network of third parties that we use their facilities and so forth, because we don\u2019t want to make that investment just yet. So we\u2019re just taking a very disciplined approach. I think it\u2019s a slow mover. It\u2019s probably moving a little quicker than it was 10 years ago, but I think our approach has been pretty rational. It seems that the industry seems rational today, and there have been some companies that grew from nothing in recycling over the years, but they don\u2019t tend to stick around very long. We look at this thing over the 10 year cycle, so when we make those investments we look at what are these commodities worth over the long term. Operator : Next comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey : A couple of questions. On the volume side, looking at your key geographies and the parts of the country where you weren\u2019t impacted by weather as much, was there a notable difference in volume trends there relative to the northeast/southeast during the quarter? Donald Slager : I think we had pretty good volumes kind of across the board, but the west did a great job for us. They didn\u2019t have weather. So our west region is Texas to California and up to Oregon/Washington. So not a lot of weather impact. Good economic recovery. We\u2019ve got a very good landfill network in the west. A good special waste quarter for us there, and if we look at those underlying trends there, and that\u2019s what gives us a lot of confidence in just the overall fundamentals of the business. So as I said, weather is kind of out of the way now. April is starting off very strong, and we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence going forward. Alex Ovshey : And then on the recycling side, there\u2019s been some volatility in the recycling paper commodity prices. They went up materially in March, and then we gave it back in April. Do you have any visibility into what recycled paper commodities will do over the next couple of months? Any thoughts around that? Donald Slager : I would just tell you flat. I wish I had a crystal ball, then I would know when to bet on the Bears again. But flat, I think, from our perspective. Alex Ovshey : That\u2019s fair. And just a last one from me. Can you update us on the Southern California market with Puente Hills now being closed for more than six months? Anything incremental and interesting there? Donald Slager : We have the closest landfill in the heart of the market. Consequently, we have probably the highest price landfill in the market as far as our rates and our rates to customers. So when that landfill closed, a lot of that volume went to Orange County. They took the volume at a reduced rate, built a transfer station there at La Puente. And we did not really benefit from any volume and any volume that we would get would come at higher rates to sort of work within our current rate structure. We\u2019re not looking at discounting there in L.A. to attract cheap volume. Operator : Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich, your line is open. Michael Hoffman : Service intervals, you alluded that you were seeing positive service interval changes. And then you shared in several of your answers areas like the western region and the volume trends. It seems through the breadth of the call so far there\u2019s this sentiment of just fundamental volume improvement occurring. And no hockey sticks, but just an overall trend that\u2019s moving in the right direction. Is that how I\u2019m supposed to interpret some of the things you said? Donald Slager : Yeah, I would say we\u2019re very positive. No hockey stick, that\u2019s important. Everyone would like to think that there\u2019s some inflection point, because everything\u2019s going to kind of happen at once. We don\u2019t see that happening. A lot of good momentum, albeit slow, we think, specifically for Republic. We\u2019re doing a lot of the right things. We\u2019re improving the core business, we\u2019re working on costs, we\u2019re working on our panel agenda, we\u2019re focused on the customer. We\u2019re doing a lot of good things to improve the business and the economy is responding better than it has in previous years. So a lot of good trends, and that\u2019s why I said we\u2019re comfortable in confirming our guidance. We\u2019re strong on the cash flow. We\u2019re buying back our stock. We\u2019re very positive on that, so all in all, we felt we had a really good quarter and we think we\u2019re going to finish the year right on track. Michael Hoffman : You have a 28.5% to 29% EBITDA guidance. So we\u2019re reaffirming that for full year 28.5% to 29%. So to do that, is your pricing covering inflation at this point? I\u2019m trying to figure that out. The price you report, are we covering inflation at this point? Your inflation. Donald Slager : Remember, we\u2019ve got to go out and get better price in the open market to do that. So I would tell you, we\u2019re comfortable with what\u2019s going on in our commercial open market business, our industrial business. Our residential business continues to be a drag for us. That\u2019s been a real low spot for us, the state municipal finance, the condition of those cities. We\u2019re taking a harder stand on some of these renewals. They want us to deploy more and more capital and if you look at some of these recent bids that have been on the Street, they want every kind of automation and every kind of recycling and the capital intensity is growing, but their willingness to pay is not. So we\u2019re taking a different position there. So we\u2019re going to have to work a little harder to get the cost recovery out of those residential contracts that are only giving us 1.5% CPI. But you know, we\u2019re trying to make up for it in other parts of the business. So we do think the pricing environment is improving subtly, not CPI, necessarily, but the open market. And we\u2019re going to continue to try to improve the quality of our products and services to earn more from the customers. Michael Hoffman : And that translates into disposal pricing as well? Donald Slager : Well, yeah, I\u2019m not so sure how much more we can do to improve our quality in the landfills for disposal customers. I think it just comes down to what\u2019s available in the marketplace. And we\u2019ve consistently raised our prices at landfills, and we\u2019ve consistently lost volume at landfills. So that\u2019s okay with us, because we think those assets are so critical. So over time, I think as I said probably many times, as the general consumer sentiment improves, as general volumes improve, I think competition behavior improves, I think that speaks well to pricing overall, and hopefully disposal pricing as well. Glenn Culpepper : And Michael, remember we discussed in the call that we had 60 basis points of margin headwind in the first quarter that will not recur during the rest of the year. So essentially what we\u2019re looking at is, with the current low CPI environment, flat margin performance year over year when you look at \u201914 full year compared to 2013. Operator : The next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk : Just to follow up on that, the 60 basis points of headwind, is that the remediation? Glenn Culpepper : No, that was the impact of weather. It was about 30 basis points. And in Q1 of 2013 we had a benefit of an alternative fuel tax credit which obviously goes through the fuel expense line. So the combination of those two items, the 60 basis points unique to the first quarter of this year and not rolling into the second quarter. Al Kaschalk : And Don, just on this whole pricing dynamic, and I appreciate some of the comments and responses you\u2019ve had here, on the landfill side, realizing the market is local, are you suggesting or implying that you\u2019re on average having trouble - maybe that\u2019s the wrong word - raising price at the landfill because it is deflecting volume away? Donald Slager : Well, we lost 1.6% volume in MSW at the landfill, and they were all pricing related losses. One specifically was a bid at a municipality, and others were individual customers. So we\u2019re going to continue to raise landfill prices. Again, landfills are expensive to own and operate. They need to be able to handle year on year price increases that cover those additional costs. And so we\u2019re going to continue to do that. We can\u2019t subsidize other people in the business by lowering landfill rates. Can\u2019t do that. And so that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve approached our infrastructure for many years and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. Al Kaschalk : And then on the volume side, I\u2019m sorry, I joined the call a little late, the number was what it is in the first quarter, but the trend here is a little bit more headwind in the back half of the year or comps relative to the back half of 2013? Glenn Culpepper : Our guidance for the full year on volume was 1.5% to 2%, so I would say we\u2019re tracking right within our expectations. Al Kaschalk : And then finally, it sounded like you said earlier that the open market pricing is trending up, not necessarily accelerating, but there\u2019s net improvement in the overall price environment? Donald Slager : Well, I think we expect it to continue to improve through the year. We\u2019ve relied, as we said at the beginning of the year, when we gave guidance, we\u2019re going to have to rely on the open market to carry a little bit more pricing than it did last year in light of the low CPI environment in the rest of our index business. And we think that\u2019s going to be the case. As I said, we\u2019ll get 4.2% core pricing in the open market as a component of that 3.2% core. So we\u2019re consistently out in the market looking to improve the quality of revenue. Some of those through pricing actions for existing customers as well as the pricing structure that we\u2019re using to bid on new business. Operator : The next question comes from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli. Tony Bancroft : Quick question on any update with municipal contracts? I saw the news with the Los Angeles last week. Anything there as far as new trends or color there? Donald Slager : No. Are you talking about the City of L.A., on Puente? Tony Bancroft : The Los Angeles contract, where they decided to break it up into I think 11\u2026 Donald Slager : Yeah, they\u2019re going to franchise that. So we\u2019re involved in that process. There\u2019s a limited number of sections of the city that you\u2019re able to win. We\u2019re going to be a part of that process. We expect that because of our capability and the location of our landfill that we\u2019ll fare okay in that process. And it\u2019s a little ways away yet, but we\u2019re knee deep into it, and that\u2019s all I can report for now. But we\u2019ll keep you updated as we get a little further down the road. Operator : And I am showing no further questions at this time. Donald Slager : All right, thank you, operator. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment, and dedication to operational excellence in creating the Republic Way. Thank you for spending time with us today, and have a good evening.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter results, which include strong revenue growth, margin improvement and substantial cash returns. Our 2014 business plan assumed industry fundamentals would continue to improve, which we have seen in our year-to-date performance. Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to achieve the financial guidance we established for 2014. Some of the financial highlights include : second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.51. The second quarter benefited approximately $0.01 due to a slightly lower tax rate. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $247 million and in line with our expectations. This level of performance includes approximately 60% of our projected full year capital expenditures. Core price in the second quarter was 3.1%, and average yield was 1.4%. Average yield increased sequentially due to stronger pricing in our open markets. The restricted portion of our business continues to reflect the relatively low CPI environment. Second quarter volumes increased 2.6%. Volume growth was concentrated to C&D roll-off, permanent industrial, National Accounts and landfill special waste. Commercial service change levels were positive in the second quarter and increased sequentially. This is a continuation of a trend that began in mid-2013. We returned $217 million to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. This includes 3.6 million shares repurchased for $124 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares for $256 million. We expect to spend approximately $400 million on share repurchases in 2014. Our Board recently increased the quarterly dividend to $0.28, an increase of approximately 8%. This is consistent with our historical practice of raising the dividend in the mid- to high-single digit range. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. We are focused on managing the controllable aspects of our business by improving the quality of revenue, investing in profitable growth opportunities and reducing costs. For example, during the second quarter, we begun rolling out our next-generation, ROI-based pricing tool known as Capture. This tablet-based tool standardizes the quote-to-proposal process, enables better controls at the point-of-sale, improves the efficiency and effectiveness of our sales force and provides a better experience for our customers. Additionally, we continue to implement priority-based selling, or PBS, our new standardized sales process. PBS focuses on delivering stronger, more effective interactions with customer segments that value our service and are willing to pay for enhanced offerings. Both Capture and priority-based selling were designed to work together on the same cloud-based platform to integrate the process of identifying the right type of volume growth at attractive prices. We expect a full rollout by the end of 2015. Last week, we launched the My Resource mobile app, an expansion of our customer's online account management tool. The My Resource app allows customers to schedule a pickup, view their service schedule, receive holiday schedule reminders and push notifications including weather-related service alerts and to pay their bill. These capabilities further differentiate our service offering and increase value to customers. The year-to-date investment made in acquisitions was $55 million. We acquired approximately $28 million of revenue at post-synergy EBITDA multiples of 5x. These tuck-in acquisitions layer in well to existing markets. Regarding our fleet, 13% is currently operating on natural gas, 67% of our residential fleet is now automated and approximately 1/2 of the fleet has completed our One Fleet Maintenance initiative. We remain confident that we can cost-effectively extend the useful life of our fleet beginning in 2015. We estimate this will reduce future capital requirements by $200 million, spread over a 4- to 5-year period. I'm proud of our achievements during the second quarter and remain encouraged by the underlying strength of the business. I want to thank the entire Republic team for their hard work and execution. Glenn and Brian will now discuss our financial performance. Glenn? Glenn A. Culpepper: Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2014 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $114 million from the prior year. This 5.4% increase in revenue includes acquisitions of 60 basis points and reflects the following 3 components of internal growth : pricing, volume and recycled commodities. First, pricing. We had an average yield growth of 1.4%. Second quarter average yield was up 20 basis points sequentially and in line with our expectations. Core price in the second quarter was 3.1%. This consisted of 4.2% in the open market and 1.4% in our restricted business. Average yield in the collection business was 1.4%, which includes 2.4% in the industrial business and 1.7% in the commercial business. Average yield in the post-collection business was also 1.4%, led by landfill MSW, which increased approximately 2%. Fuel recovery fees increased 0.2%. Most of this change relates to an increase in the rate charged to recover fuel costs. Fuel costs increased approximately $5 million compared to the prior year, but decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.94 in the second quarter from $3.88 in the prior year, an increase of 1.4%. The current average diesel price is $3.89 per gallon. Second, volumes increased 2.6% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.9% primarily due to an increase in industrial volume. Growth in the industrial line of business was 6.3% and includes C&D and other temporary activity, which was up 9.6%. Volume in the commercial business was up 1.3% and residential was down 1%. The decline in residential was primarily due to contracts lost in bid situations. We will only renew business if it meets our return criteria. The post-collection business, consisting of third-party landfill and transfer station volume, was positive 5.2%, which includes an increase in landfill special waste of approximately 19%. Special waste volumes -- landfill volumes were lower in the second quarter of 2013, which resulted in an easier comparison. Our landfill MSW volumes were flat with the prior year. Our defection rate, which represents the annualized rate of customer turnover, remained stable at approximately 7%. Third, commodity revenue increased 60 basis points. The increase in commodity sales reflects an increase in tons sold, partially offset by a decline in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices decreased 2% to an average of $108 per ton in the second quarter from $110 per ton in the prior year. Current average commodity prices are approximately $111 per ton. Second quarter recycling facility volume of 626,000 tons was up 13.2% from the prior year. Most of the increase relates to additional National Accounts brokered volumes. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased $13 million compared to the prior year, an increase of 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Again, most of the increase relates to additional National Accounts brokered volumes. Now I will discuss year-over-year margin. Second quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4% compared to 27.6% in the prior year, an improvement of 80 basis points. The change is made up of a favorable decrease in SG&A expenses of 90 basis points, partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in cost of operations. The reduction in SG&A expenses primarily relates to $17 million of legal charges recorded in the prior year. Second quarter 2014 SG&A expense was in line with our expectations at 9.9% of revenue. The change in cost of operations primarily relates to increases in transportation expenses, subcontract costs and cost of goods sold, partially offset by favorable reductions in direct labor and risk management expenses. The increase in transportation costs primarily relates to growth at landfill special waste where third-party transportation was used to deliver the volume. The increase in subcontract costs and cost of goods sold primarily relates to growth in the outsourced portion of our National Accounts business and recycled commodity volumes that we've brokered on behalf of our customers. The favorable reduction in risk management expense relates to a reduction in ultimate claim costs. Our risk group has been able to favorably settle claims as compared to the actual -- actuarial reserves recorded. Finally, the improvement in labor primarily relates to the mix of volume growth. The increase in landfill special waste and outsourced National Accounts has very little incremental labor. I would like to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data. Brian Delghiaccio : Thanks, Glenn. Second quarter 2014 interest expense was $87 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 38.5% of adjusted earnings in the second quarter and 39.1% on a year-to-date basis. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% in the second half of the year. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $247 million, which was in line with our expectations. Net capital expenditures during this period were $482 million or approximately 60% of our projected full year spend. Free cash flow can fluctuate by period due to the timing of capital expenditures, cash tax payments and working capital. At June 30, our accounts receivable balance was $933 million, and our days sales outstanding was 38 days, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7.1 billion at June 30, and excess availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion. I will now turn the call back to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Brian. To conclude, our second quarter results keep us on track to achieve the goals and objectives we established for 2014. We remain comfortable with our full year guidance of adjusted EPS of $1.93 to $1.98 and adjusted free cash flow of $675 million to $725 million. The fundamentals of the business remain solid and trends continue to improve as expected. We see strong open market pricing, which is offsetting lower CPI-based resets; organic volume growth driving margin expansion in our large container industrial and landfill businesses; service level increases in our small container commercial business; continued progress on our multi-year initiatives to mitigate cost inflation in the business; and a healthy pipeline of accretive acquisitions. Our team is dedicated to providing superior customer service and executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and cash flow growth. We remain committed to an efficient capital structure, maintaining our investment-grade rating and increasing cash returns to our shareholders. At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question does come from Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Hamzah Mazari : Just a question on volumes. Don, maybe you could comment on if you saw above normal or normal seasonality in volumes during the quarter. Historically, you folks have raised guidance at Q2 the majority of time. Is -- do volumes -- do commercial volumes need to get better for you to raise guidance or -- any commentary around volumes and sort of your reiteration versus raise of guidance, which you've done historically most of the time. Donald W. Slager: I'll start with your first question. I think seasonality was normal. So we're pretty confident in the trajectory of the business. Our estimates -- the guidance as we entered into the year, we expected to see the economy improving and we're seeing that. We thought we would see it approved -- accrue first in the C&D business, and we're seeing that both in the landfill and on the roll-off side of the business. We expected that open market pricing would be stronger and we would actually move more strongly in the open market for price to offset some of the pressure we're seeing in the municipal side of our business. So most of that is happening pretty consistent with what we expected. So we're comfortable with the range of guidance for the rest of the year, and we'll update you further when we get to Q3. Hamzah Mazari : Okay. And just a follow-up question on the margin side. You've talked about a 100 bps expansion from CNG, fleet automation and the One Maintenance initiative. Is -- could you give us a sense of -- is that front-end loaded? Is that going to be pretty linear going forward? And longer term, as most of the margin expansion, should we expect that to come from price given that, over the last few years since the downturn, you've taken out a lot of costs and you were already pretty lean to begin with? Donald W. Slager: Thanks. It's a great question. Yes. The 3 operating initiatives : Fleet -- One Fleet, CNG and automation, we said, is going to be 75 to 100 bps of operating margin improvement over 3 years. And think about that being probably more mid- to back-end loaded because it takes a while to get these things up and going. And as you know, the One Fleet initiative has a lot of front-loaded costs to get through that initiative and get it rolled out. But we're on track, and we're very happy with the results we're seeing there. As far as the margin, yes, we've said all along that it's going to take price in excess of normal inflation. And so that CPI headwind has been hurting us over the last couple of years, but we've kept the margin strong. We think, as CPI normalizes again, and we think it will, that we will continue to see margin expansion and we're going to hopefully see continued strong pricing in the open market. So we're comfortable with the guidance. We think the margins have held up nicely. And we think, over time, as CPI improves and pricing improves along with it that we can push the margins a little higher. Operator : Our next question comes from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Corey Greendale : Don, so it sounds like the tone of business is improving. You got what sounds like a nice benefit -- a year-over-year benefit from special waste in the quarter. Can you help us think through how sustainable that is and what the internal growth assumptions are baked into your reiterated EPS guidance? Donald W. Slager: Yes, I'll let one of these other guys talk about the internal growth assumption baked in. I'll talk to you about the special waste. The bulk of the special waste year-over-year improvement is coming out of event-driven job, so soil, in which to me that business is a little bit lumpy. But we've got a good pipeline of special waste that we're looking at for the future quarters. So we think that's going to be consistent throughout the rest of the year. And the good news there for me is that, that soil clearing -- or that soil removal tends to be kind of a precursor to construction, land clearing. And so, we just think it's another positive sign of economic growth and potentially more construction. So we think that's a good thing. And then, our E&P business held up pretty well as well. We do receive some material from a various number of drilling sites at our landfills. So that has been pretty consistent for us as well. Glenn A. Culpepper: Going forward, Corey, the special waste has grown for the last 4 quarters in a row and the last 3 have been double-digit growth rates. So we expect growth in the second half to be muted because we have tougher comparisons there. It really took off in the second half of 2013. And so, from here on out, the comparisons on special waste will be tougher. Corey Greendale : And applying that to the overall guidance, Glenn, so we should expect the volume growth to be more muted in the back half? So I'm talking about overall volume growth, not just special waste. Glenn A. Culpepper: Overall, yes, we're sticking with our guidance of 1.5% to 2% volume growth for the full year. Donald W. Slager: Yes. So the volume's there, it's just a comp against last year. That's all. Glenn A. Culpepper: Yes. Corey Greendale : And just one more, if I could, on the -- what commodity price assumption are you baking into the guidance? And how -- what's the EPS impact of -- if you are baking in lower commodity prices versus what you might have assumed at the beginning of the year? Glenn A. Culpepper: Yes, it's relatively flat, Corey. So remember, in the beginning of the year, we were guiding to the full year of $110 per ton. And in the second quarter, we were right at about $108, so relatively in line with where we thought we'd be. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Levine with Imperial Capital. Scott Justin Levine : So drilling down a little bit more on the impact of index-based pricing. I know most of your resets, a large chunk of them, occur here either midyear or in Q3. Should we expect, based on the inflation information to-date that you're seeing a step-down, step-up? What should we be thinking about the index side of the business going forward based on past inflation rates? Glenn A. Culpepper: Yes, Scott, the inflation rate in 2013 CPI was 1.5%. So we would be seeing a bigger impact of that in the second half of 2014. So we'll be stepping down. Now, the more recent CPIs have been in the 2% range. We'll see where that goes for the remainder of the year. But if we get a higher CPI for the rest of this year, we'll see that impact in 2015. Scott Justin Levine : Understood. And as a follow-up on the cash flow. The dividend raise here, I think, in the last couple of years has been a step-up in terms of rate of increase from years prior. Can you help us understand a little bit how you think about that from a payout ratio perspective and thoughts on what you would favor, either the dividend or the buyback going forward based -- or following against the dividend increase here today? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So, one, we're not managing to a yield goal, and we think that the payout ratio that we have today is pretty consistent and will stay pretty consistent through time. We've said now for many years that we think the business, as it grows, can support a dividend increase in the mid- to high-single digit year-over-year. So think of a 6% to 8% kind of dividend increase year-on-year. That's pretty consistent with our 3- and 5-year CAGR as we look at the business today. And that's the way to look at it. We think this balanced approach of free cash flow, having some availability to grow the business through acquisition and then spending the remainder on that kind of split somewhat evenly between dividend and buyback is the right way to go, and that's what we're committed to. Operator : Next question is from Derek Sbrogna with Macquarie. Derek Sbrogna : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing on the residential side. I know in the past you've talked about this kind of being a drag and the customers wanting to see -- wanting to get more out of the service provider without a willingness to pay. Has this stalled at all -- or do you still foresee this as being a drag as we go forward here in what seems to be an improving environment? Donald W. Slager: Well, the main drag on residential overall is the CPI piece. If you think about our overall business, our industrial business is performing very well, growing units, growing revenue per unit, expanding margins. Our commercial business volumes are modestly increased, margins kind of remained flat. We're looking for the more service increases to develop as we can start to sort of build density into that business. The residential line of business has been our drag. Some of that is just CPI, and we're going to work our way through that. Some of that is the customer demand for increased services. But I would say that we feel better about it today than we did 6 months ago. Anecdotally, we're seeing a little different behavior out there. I think people are being a little more stingy with their CapEx. These are very expensive contracts to get involved in. Fully automated trucks, 3-cart systems, CNG. The capital outlay for resi contracts is large. And so, we've stepped back a little bit, too. And so, we're looking -- as Glenn said in his comments, we're not going to do business unless it's for the right return. And so, we're pushing back a little bit. And I think, anecdotally, our team would say that the environment is probably improving slightly from that perspective. It hasn't shown up in the numbers yet. But as CPI improves and haulers understand the full cost of running these contracts, I think, overall, the pricing and the reset environment will improve, too. Derek Sbrogna : Okay, great. And that's actually a good segue into a follow-up in terms of ensuring that business meets a good return. Can you maybe provide a little bit more detail on the next-generation ROI-based tool? Just kind of where you are in the roll-out process, how it differs from the prior version? And then, maybe more specifically, if this is being managed at a corporate level or at a field level? Glenn A. Culpepper: Yes, great. So the one thing that's very much the same is it's ROI-based. So the old tool that we've used for years was a lot more manual, more sort of spreadsheet-driven. This is a cloud-based software that we, frankly, administrate from the corporate office. And so when we talk about having better control of the pricing decisions at the field level, that's one of the main benefits. So we're very focused here on quality revenue. How do we -- as we grow revenue, as we grow volume, how do we grow quality of revenue, quality of units. And so, we've got a lot of transactions happening out there everyday. We've got this 7% defection. We have to replace those units in the market through new-new growth or competitive growth. We want to make sure that every new unit coming into the system is priced at the very best level. And so this tool is, as I said, a tablet-based tool or an iPad-based tool that our salespeople can go to the market with. It allows them to basically enter the customer's data to segment the customer, understanding what kind of a customer they are and what they might be willing to pay for. It helps them make better decisions. It helps them be more efficient with their -- making their sales calls. And actually, as I said on the call, it actually improves the customer experience. So all of that is aimed at improving quality of revenue and improving the efficiency of our sales force and then ultimately still improving the experience for our customers. So we're pretty excited about it. We're through a couple of markets. Right now, we've done the pilots to basically get the system rolled out and initiate the training, kind of tweak it a little bit and we're going to be rolling it out, as I said, through the end of 2015. A lot of that will be done this year. But having it rolled out and then having it fully utilized and all the training completed and having sort of that Rule of 78 start to work for you because this is really aimed at the replacement of the 7% defection, the new sales so to speak. So -- and then, we'll use the tool to price service increases and decreases as well. But it puts all the power in the salespeople's hands to be more efficient, but it puts the control in our hands here. So we set pricing parameters at corporate with the assistance of our local management teams, but we have the ability to set thresholds and benchmarks. And when we make adjustments here, basically, because it's a cloud-based system, those adjustments can basically -- and those new pricing limits and thresholds can be instituted in the field virtually overnight. Operator : Next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel (sic) [Wunderlich]. Michael E. Hoffman: In the gory details in the margin data, there is, in fact, a positive move in labor and fuel. Am I overreaching when I say that you're starting to see here some tiny little benefit from all this work in automation and CNG and One Fleet? Donald W. Slager: No, we're seeing the benefits. I would tell you that, as we look at the quarter, June looked better than the first 2 months of the quarter as related to those 2 line items you mentioned. So we're anxious to see those things kind of flow into July and into Q3. But the system is working. We're seeing the benefit. We are facing -- the fleet complexity has increased pretty dramatically as we've been buying all these CNG trucks and automated trucks and all the new clean diesel technology over the last several years. That's impacting us a little bit. So that's one of the benefits of having One Fleet out there, is it helps us maintain that more complex fleet better than we would have without One Fleet. So we're on track. As I said in my comments, we're going to come over the hill here and we'll see the benefits in the business not only in those 2 line items, but we'll see driver productivity, we'll see driver morale and turnover impacted positively. We'll see better customer service as a result. And then, ultimately, we're going to get this fleet benefit as we very methodically and intelligently get more life out of our fleet. So we're feeling pretty good about it. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. And then -- I can't remember who was framing this, but I have this sense I should think about first half versus second half and if you sort of have an average revenue growth of, call it, mid to upper 4% in -- for that first half, the second half clearly is slightly lower because CPI has come down, volume comp. But is there -- so I'm kind of trying to understand the gauge of that. I mean, is it sort of 50 basis points? And then, the other question in that is if this trend in volume is coming through in service upgrades, is the scope of your rollbacks starting -- are they narrowing, too? So maybe there's -- that's a cushion as well. I'm just trying to understand the combination of all those pieces. Donald W. Slager: Yes. I'm not sure that -- there's a lot of moving pieces there. I'm not sure that we can give you the exact first half-second half split. I would tell you that the trajectory is right. That things are improving and obviously, the CPI's second half headwind but -- and you got something to add there, Brian? Brian Delghiaccio : Yes, I was just going to say [indiscernible] so, Michael, if you kind of take a look at our guidance, right, on the yield side, we're guiding to 1% to 1.5%. And year-to-date, it's been 1.3%, right? So you can kind of look at that relative to the overall range. And same thing on the volume, year-to-date volumes have been 2.1%, and our guidance for the full year is 1.5% to 2%, right? So while there might be in particular on the volume, as I mentioned, again, tougher comps in the second half, you can still see, given the fact that half of the year is already done, it's not a substantial change, if you will, in trajectory given that half -- like I said, half of the year is already in the bag. Michael E. Hoffman: And the rollback issue? Are we getting narrowing or less pressure -- I mean -- rollbacks aren't as big as they used to be? Donald W. Slager: Yes, I would tell you that we're doing a better job year-over-year on extending business prior to it going to bid. And I would tell you that when we do have to roll back, it's probably similar to last year. But -- and I would tell you, anecdotally, I think it's improving. But again, we're talking about resi, right? We're talking about municipal resi contracts. And again, that gets influenced not only by CPI, but it gets influenced by municipalities getting healthier. So as the economy improves and our tax base improves, that whole dynamic is going to improve with it. And that's what we would expect to see going forward. Operator : Next question is from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : Question for you on the cash flow guidance. It implies, call it, $430 million to $480 million in the back half, which is up pretty nicely versus last year. And I get that your cash flow is typically back-half loaded. But can you maybe just walk us through some of the pluses and minuses that give you the conviction that you're going to hit that full year cash flow? Glenn A. Culpepper: Yes, sure, Joe. If you look at last year, our cash flow in the second half of '13 was over $400 million. And then, when you look at CapEx for the full year, our CapEx is going to be lower than 2013. But through the half year, we spent more on CapEx in the first half. So we are going to have a decline that's pretty significant on CapEx in the second half of the year. Joe Box : Okay. So that's the biggest good guy on the list. Anything on the minus side that could detract? Glenn A. Culpepper: Well, if our profits stay where they are, we'll pay a little bit more in tax. But there's also some other good guys on the working capital side. So overall, we're comfortable in maintaining our guidance of the $675 million to $725 million. Joe Box : Got it, got it. I do want to dig into the 13% recycling volume growth just a little bit more. Glenn, I know that you said earlier that the bulk of that came from National Accounts. But can you maybe just quantify what National Accounts and then maybe give us a sense of where the rest of the growth is coming from? Glenn A. Culpepper: Well, it's almost all National Accounts and the biggest piece of that is volumes that we're brokering for National Accounts customers. That accounts for almost all of the increase that you see there. So again, this is one of those sort of, kind of skews the margins a little bit. We get a fee to manage that volume because we already have 4 million tons of our own volume that we're managing and recycling, right? And so, we got people that do this for a living for us. And so, when we have National Accounts that need their old corrugated containers managed, they do the baling and we basically broker a company to come in and move that material and take it to an end destination, one of our mills. And so, we just get a small fee, so kind of a pass-through thing. It kind of skews our margins. But it's, on an ROI basis, good business. So we'll do that for customers when they need that service. Operator : Next question is from Charles Redding with BB&T. Charles E. Redding: Just a quick follow-up on the National Accounts piece. Could you just remind us of the increase there for the quarter? And then, is it generally fair to assume that, that's going to be much less cyclical than special waste? Donald W. Slager: Yes. Well, National Accounts, I guess, is less cyclical than special waste unless you have a large win or loss. Overall, we focused more of our effort here recently on the sort of mid-sized to small national accounts and have spent less time worrying about or chasing the large national account because, quite frankly, they tend to be less profitable and they have a harder time creating customer loyalty. So I would expect that to be less lumpy over time. But National Accounts is a good business for us. We're committed to it. We've got a reasonably sized portfolio that we're growing in mostly, as I said, in the smaller regional kinds of accounts, et cetera. And the only thing that really kind of skews our numbers in National Accounts is when we have to subcontract services in markets that we're not in or when we do this recycling broker -- brokerage that it makes the margins look a little bit strange. But I would tell you that, again, on an ROI basis, the business we're bringing up working National Accounts is producing good returns for us. Charles E. Redding: Okay. And are there factors there aside from labor that really move the needle in terms of margins, or is it mostly labor in terms of just having that subcontracted? Donald W. Slager: With National Accounts, again, when we do the hauling ourselves, these accounts fit right into our network, into our density. And when we have an inordinate amount of a customer's locations outside of our footprint, then that changes the overall margin because of the subcontracting portion. So again, as I said, good margin -- a low margin but high return when you factor all that in. Operator : Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Albert Leo Kaschalk : I joined a little late, so my apologies. But I wanted to drill on this cost of operation inflation and the growth in revenue. And it still seems to be -- I'm assuming there's a difference that's about 40 basis points, costs have gone up 5.5% and revenue went up a little over 5%. So is that mix -- is that not getting enough traction yet on the cost savings program? What -- it seems like there's a little bit of a struggle here. And I would have thought you would have gotten a little bit of benefit given that we've comp-ed the CPI hurdle that we've been talking about for a while. Glenn A. Culpepper: I think, Al, if you look at our cost of operations, and this is in our 8-K, in 2013, it was $61.6 million. And this quarter, it's $61.7 million. So it's pretty even. And as we said in there, we've had quite a bit of growth in our National Accounts and in this brokered business where the margins are thin. So you've had some increased cost of sales from that, increased cost of sales from the commodity brokerage-type business. Overall, the costs have only gone up 10 basis points. Albert Leo Kaschalk : On basis points, I agree. But on dollar-wise, it's up quite high. I understand. Donald W. Slager: Yes. We've got a little bit of fuel, too, a little bit of fuel drag there as well, Al. Albert Leo Kaschalk : Right, all right. Just one other comment and then I have a follow-up. Just make sure when you get over that hill that all this repair and maintenance work keeps the trucks having their brakes. No pun intended but -- on the commodity side, I understand where prices are as we sit. But can you remind us, you're central region more Chicago-based export market, is that fair? And I think you just have a tradition of using the period closing rate to incorporate into future guidance, is that fair? Donald W. Slager: Yes, that's what we've done. Our guidance for the full year is $110. And right now, the average is about $111. And that's all regions and all commodities. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Holly. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you for spending time with us today, everyone, and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Republic Services conference call for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our third quarter results which were in line with our expectations. Revenues increased approximately 5% with a balanced mix between price and volume growth. During the quarter, we continued to profitably grow our business by focusing on attracting the right types of customers, differentiating our service offering and improving our service quality. We completed high-quality accretive acquisitions and have already exceeded our full year goal. And we remain focused on managing cost, improving productivity and leveraging our cost structure. We made great progress towards achieving our annual goal, and we are pleased with our third quarter performance. Some of the highlights include third quarter EPS of $0.52, which was in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $433 million. This level of performance includes 84% of our projected full year capital expenditures. Core price in the third quarter was 3%, and average yield was 1.4%. Average yield was consistent with our second quarter performance even with a step-down in CPI-based pricing. We continue to see better open market pricing to offset the CPI headwind. Third quarter volume increased 2.1% and was concentrated to event-driven waste streams. This level of performance was strong given the tougher prior-year comparisons. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $560 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This includes 8 million shares repurchased for $279 million. We expect to spend approximately $400 million on share repurchases in 2014. During the quarter, we continued to implement our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. For example, we continue to rollout Capture, our next-generation ROI-based pricing tool, and priority-based selling, our new standardized sales process. Both initiatives are focused on our open market commercial and industrial businesses. Capture and priority-based selling were designed to work together on the same cloud-based platform to integrate the process of identifying the right type of volume growth at attractive prices. We continued to make tuck-in acquisitions that layer in well to our existing markets. Year-to-date, we have invested $111 million to acquire $57 million of revenue at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 5x. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of Rainbow Disposal on October 1. This high-quality franchise business complements our Southern California operations. Regarding our fleet. 14% is currently operating on natural gas, 68% of our residential fleet is now automated and over half the fleet has completed our One Fleet maintenance initiative. I'm proud of our achievements during the third quarter and remain encouraged by the underlying strength of our business. I want to thank the entire Republic team for their hard work and execution. Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial performance. Chuck? Charles F. Serianni: Thank you, Don. Third quarter 2014 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $99 million from the prior year. This 4.6% increase in revenue includes acquisitions of 70 basis points and reflects the following 3 components of internal growth : pricing, volume and recycled commodities. First, pricing. We had average yield growth of 1.4% and core price of 3%. Core price consisted of 4.1% in the open market and 1.2% in our restricted business. Average yield in the collection business was 1.5%, which includes 2.1% yield in the industrial business and 1.8% yield in the commercial business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.3%, led by landfill MSW, which increased approximately 2%. Fuel recovery fees increased 20 basis points. Most of this change relates to an increase in the rate charge to recover fuel costs. Fuel costs decreased approximately $2 million compared to the prior year and decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.84 in the third quarter from $3.91 in the prior year, a decrease of 1.8%. The current average diesel price is $3.64 per gallon. Second, volumes increased 2.1% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.5%, primarily due to an increase in landfill and industrial volume. Growth in the industrial line of business was 4.9% and includes C&D and other temporary business, which was up 7.4%. Volume in the commercial business was up 1.1% and residential was down 60 basis points. The decline in residential was primarily due to contracts lost in bid situations. We will only renew business if it meets our return criteria. The post-collection business, consisting of third-party landfill and transfer station volume, was positive 4.1%, which includes an increase in landfill special waste of approximately 16%. Our landfill MSW volumes were up 1.8%. Our defection rate, which represents the annualized rate of customer turnover, remained stable at approximately 7%. Third, commodity revenue increased 20 basis points. The increase in commodity sales reflects an increase in tons sold, partially offset by a decline in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices decreased 2% to an average price of $115 per ton in the third quarter from $117 per ton in the prior year. Current average commodity prices are approximately $108 per ton. Third quarter recycle volume of 569,000 tons were up 4% from the prior year. The increase relates to additional National Accounts brokered volumes. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased $7 million compared to the prior year, an increase of 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Again, the increase relates to additional National Accounts brokered volumes. Now I will discuss year-over-year margin. Third quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.2% compared to 29.5% in the prior year, a decrease of 130 basis points. A majority of the change can be explained by 3 line items, most of which relate to onetime benefits in the prior year. First, landfill operating costs increased 60 basis points. In the prior year, we implemented a low-cost solution at one of our remediation sites, which resulted in a onetime benefit. Second, risk management costs increased 40 basis points. Risk management costs were approximately $12 million higher than our expectations during the quarter or 50 basis points due to a few large claims. On a year-to-date basis, risk management costs were 2.1% of revenue in both the current and prior year. Third, SG&A expenses increased 40 basis points related to a bad debt recovery in the prior year. SG&A expenses were 10.1% of revenue during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, which was in line with our expectations. Of the 3 expense line items I just discussed, risk management created the largest variance to our current year margin performance. Excluding the 50-basis-point increase, EBITDA margin would have been 28.7%. All other cost changes represented 10-basis-point improvement in margin. I would like to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data. Brian Delghiaccio : Thanks, Chuck. Third quarter 2014 interest expense was $87 million, which included $11 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 37.1% of adjusted earnings in the third quarter and 38.4% on a year-to-date basis. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $433 million. Net capital expenditures during this period were $678 million or 84% of our projected full year spend. Free cash flow can fluctuate by period due to the timing of capital expenditures, cash tax payments and working capital. At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $955 million, and our days sales outstanding was 38 days or 26 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at September 30, and availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion. I will now turn the call back to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Brian. To recap our 2014 year-to-date performance, I am very pleased with our results and the progress we made in profitably growing the business and achieving operational excellence. Most of our business lines are performing well and showing strong year-over-year gains in revenue, EBITDA and margin. The one area of our business that continues to lag is residential. The residential line of business has the highest concentration of pricing restrictions, and therefore, the most exposure to low CPI-based resets. While we don't control CPI, we are focusing our efforts on the things we can control to improve our residential business. Specifically, we've reviewed all contracts to ensure we are realizing the full revenue potential for each contract. We identified underperforming contracts and are not exercising options to extend those without a price increase. We are working to convert new contracts to waste-related indexes versus headline CPI because they better reflect our cost structure. And we are designing and launching priority-based selling for our municipal business segment in 2015. We will continue to offer high-quality services and products to our residential customers but must earn an appropriate return to deliver those services. In our earnings release, we updated our 2014 financial guidance that provided a preliminary outlook for 2015. We expect to finish the year with adjusted EPS of $1.93 to $1.94 and adjusted free cash flow of $675 million to $690 million, both are within the guidance range that we provided you in February. We are midway through our 2015 planning process. Based on early reviews of the budget and assuming current business conditions, our 2015 preliminary outlook is : EPS of $2.02 to $2.06. This represents mid- to high-single digit earnings growth compared to our expected 2014 performance. And adjusted free cash flow of $725 million to $750 million. This represents mid-single digit to low double-digit growth compared to our expected 2014 performance. This outlook includes the benefit of extending the useful life of our fleet, partially offset by investments in growth opportunities and technology. Consistent with prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February of 2015. We look forward to delivering on our promises to our key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. For our customers, we strive to provide the highest level of customer service. We are committed to developing differentiated and superior products that enhance the customer experience. For the communities we serve, we remain devoted to delivering safe, convenient and cost-effective solutions while being good stewards of the environment. For our employees, training and developing our people is a priority. We strive to be the employer of choice. And for our shareholders, we remain committed to creating a long-term shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and free cash flow growth while improving return on invested capital. I would like to thank the entire Republic team for their contributions that have allowed us to meet our 2014 objectives and positioned us well for future growth opportunities. At this time, operator, we'd like to open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : So I recognize that the 2015 guidance is preliminary, but can you maybe just walk through some of the high-level assumptions like price, volume and maybe recycling? Donald W. Slager: Now you know what, Joe, again, we're -- it's preliminary outlook, and we're going to give you detailed guidance in February like we do all the time. We're in the midst of the business planning process as we speak. We're just taking a look at current trends in the business. As you know, things in the business don't change rapidly. You understand the current CPI environment. You understand how the business works. And we're taking that current trend, kind of building it out into '15, setting goals for the field and understanding what the business can produce. So that's where we're at, and we'll give you more detail as we have it in February. Joe Box : Okay, I can appreciate that, Don. Let me try it from another angle then. I mean, obviously, we've got guidance and planning set for 2014. So Chuck, you highlighted the 3 cost buckets that could potentially be somewhat onetime in nature, but just optically looking at 4Q guidance and what it implies, it does seem to imply that maybe some costs remain elevated. Can you maybe just talk to some of the areas that we should be aware of for 4Q? Charles F. Serianni: For 4Q or -- the year-over-year, if I look at the year-over-year, let me answer that. Right now, we had originally guided to 28.5% to 29%. We're trending a little bit down from there. But keep in mind that we've got about a 20-basis-point headwind because of commodities. We've got a headwind of about 10 basis points due to insurance, and we've got about a 10-basis-point headwind because of weather. So if you'd take all of those into consideration and add that back to the 28.1% that we're at right now, we end up being kind of on the -- within the guidance that we had given at the beginning of the year. So in terms of Q4, I don't see any significant changes in our EBITDA. Brian Delghiaccio : One other thing to consider there, too, Joe, is that most of the things that Chuck outlined were actually prior year items that were onetime benefits in 2013 that just anniversary-ed, right? So when you talk about it in the current year, the cost that was an increase relative to our expectation was just an insurance item. So to Chuck's point, x that, when you kind of take a look at our year-to-date performance, we're kind of in line with what our original expectations were from an overall EBITDA margin performance. Joe Box : Appreciate that. And one last one for you. Don, in the release, I think you mentioned that you guys have the ability and the intent to complete some larger transactions. I haven't seen that before. I'm just wondering if that's foreshadowing something or if there's any change to your acquisition strategy? Donald W. Slager: No, Joe, and I think we've always said, look, we set our sights on $100 million spend. We look at a lot of deals to spend $100 million and do that intelligently. This year, we had a few more deals in the pipeline. And then, of course, on top of that, the Rainbow Disposal acquisition came into the market and we were able to successfully complete that. So we've got the capacity. We always say we want to keep our financial flexibility. Important for us to keep our investment-grade rating, keep that financial flexibility. We want to keep some powder dry so that when there's a good deal in the market, we can take advantage of it. That's exactly what you saw us do with Rainbow. Operator : Next question is from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Albert Leo Kaschalk : I want to -- can you add some additional detail behind the insurance, either I missed in your prepared remarks, or why is that elevated? And just start from there, please? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So Al, our actuary reviews all open claims every single quarter. So when you think about that process of every quarter, it can introduce a little bit of volatility. But if you take a look at where we were through June, we were actually performing more favorable than our original expectations, and we expected that to continue. What we had was a handful of claims that we saw some increased development on in the third quarter. That was the $12 million that Chuck called out in his notes. But when you take look at a year-to-date basis, both in the current and prior year, both are running at about 2.1% of revenue. So what I would just say is that when we were standing there at Q2, expected the favorable development to continue, and we saw it go a little bit backwards in the third quarter. Albert Leo Kaschalk : Great. And then just another housekeeping item. The $0.01 or so in bad debt provision, is that legacy? Is that -- what is that related to, please? Donald W. Slager: Yes, that was a bad debt recovery that we actually realized last year. And so that when you look at the EBITDA margins year-over-year, that creates a headwind for us. But there was something that happened last year, recovered from last year. Albert Leo Kaschalk : Okay. And then I want to focus in terms of the core business. And I mean this genuinely here. Don, you had said the residential business continues to lag and the commercial and industrial, I guess, maybe you can comment on that whether that's in line with your expectations. But if I take a step back and look and add in some of the adjustments, it doesn't feel from the outside that the conversion rate on the margin is perhaps where it could be, should be and probably not where you wanted it to be. So are there additional areas that maybe you can highlight for us that maybe still remains a struggle, absent price? Donald W. Slager: Yes, so let's back up a little bit further from that first, okay? So we have a backdrop where CPI has been averaging 1.6% for 5 years. And over that time, in total, a 1.6% doesn't get our costs recovered just through inflation, right? So obviously, we battle back every year with productivity measures and other things to improve our costs. I would tell you that with that 5-year low CPI environment and pretty steady inflation, we've done a good job running the business and managing the core business, but essentially holding our EBITDA margins flattish. And as Chuck said, if you take out some of the nonrecurring items, they're actually flat to better. So let's start with that. So that's what we've been working ourselves toward is improving the business in that low CPI environment. Again, as I said in my comments, CPI really impacts us in the residential business. And so to say it as clear as I can, the resi business is just a stinker right now. We've been dealing with these price rollbacks. It's a high capital-intensive business, and it's one of the reasons we're really tackling it and focusing in on it. If we step back and look at the other LOBs, we're actually doing very well. And when we do the netting of all the sort of individual issues, the growth that we're seeing in the business is coming in at a good margin. We are seeing the right growth in our commercial business, albeit slow. We've been bragging about the industrial business growing now for several quarters. That's continued in Q3. Finally, starting to see a little bit of life in MSW volumes at the landfill after many, many quarters of 0 to negative. So the rest of business is performing pretty well, and we think frankly very well in light of the macro environment. It really is this residential business that's been dragging us backwards. So, yes, let me just give you a couple of issues or a couple of details. We've talked about permanent industrial being up 5.3%. And in Q3, it was 5.6% up in Q2. Temp was up 7% -- over 7%. So in pricing, it's 4.8% in temporary roll-off. So we're managing that core business as it's recovering. We're getting more volume growth. We're getting price per unit growth, and we're getting some margin expansion. And now we're starting to see that in the commercial business. So again, it's early in the commercial. We thought it would be stronger by now, but it's positive and getting better. So we're not sure the trend is occurring as quickly as we like or it's probably as much as you would like, but it's happening. It really is residential for us. So I'm sure all of my guys listening on the phone right now are hard to work and figuring out how we're going to improve residential. Albert Leo Kaschalk : Okay. Throughout the call, maybe you could comment at some point on the opportunity or the progress on the waste-related index pricing that could help you down the road and when that could start to benefit? Donald W. Slager: Yes, let me comment on it. So I think that's your fourth question, but that's okay, Al. It's early. It's early. Here's the issue. I think the industry used headline CPI or some version of that in the residential business, gosh, as long as I can remember, and I've been doing this for 35 years. So we've always had that in our resi municipal business. And even in the municipal side of the landfill business, we've used that kind of an index. It worked for us just marvelously for decades because the 25 and 50 average of CPI is over 3%. And as we've grown our business and built density and done acquisitions and everything else we've done to build the business over that period of time, CPI never gave us any heartburn. It was a nice annuity business. Well, again, now we've had this really strange 5 years of averaging 1.6%. And if you step back and we'd go back in time, 4 years ago, we were probably expecting CPI to right itself. And every year, there's been sort of this sort of hint or promise that it could improve and it just hasn't. So we finally had to say, \"Look, enough is enough,\" and CPI isn't a fair way for those municipal customers to view our business and so we've looked at alternatives. And so if you look on the BLS, one of the components of the CPI basket is an index called water sewer trash. And we've been working on introducing that index to customers. We've done it in a very small way. We've done it successfully in a few small -- I would say very small type municipal contracts with some success. And we're actually using our industry association in things like SWANA and so forth to begin to have a conversation about what's reasonable and fair for cities to expect out of their waste hauling companies, and 1.6% CPI isn't the ticket. So it's going to take a long time to get that in the business, but the good news is, we're on it and we're working the system. And that's the expectation that my team has. And hopefully at some point, you think maybe the industry would support and catch onto it and do it as well because it's not good for anybody, and it's not good for the city because the city doesn't want to have a partnership with a company that's as important as a waste company to keep its streets clean. That's going to be constantly moving backwards in its profitability, or at some point, go upside down. So we have to -- we've got to right it and the gross operating margin in that business has shrunk because of this situation, and we've got to change it. So early stages. Hopefully, we can comment more on as we go through year-by-year and hopefully, we could see some kind of a shift in -- an industry shift as well. So that's it. But -- so we're not sitting on our hands, and we're not just whining about it. We're controlling things we can control, Al. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Levine with Imperial Capital. Scott Justin Levine : So a couple of questions. Firstly, special waste volumes are very good in the quarter. I'm wondering if that's project-specific, how the pipeline looks in general, we can see this type of growth continue or what's behind it? Donald W. Slager: Yes, it's pretty broad-based. We don't have any really, really big, big projects to report, and that's the good news. A pretty strong growth. Most of it is soil-related. So contaminated soil, which I always look at that, Scott, and think that's a good sign of construction and development to come when they're doing land clearing and taking off the soil it means that they're going to build something new at an old site. So hopefully, that continues to fuel construction for us into the out years. So again, broad-based, and we think the trend should continue forward. Scott Justin Levine : Got it. And as my follow-up, maybe a little bit of color or update on One Fleet. I think you said more than 50% of the fleet is there. Are you guys running positive on that? And should we be thinking about that as potentially a margin contributor, a needle moving margin contributor and/or a free cash flow contributor to the positive in 2015? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So it's moving a little slower still than we'd hoped, but we're more committed to it than we ever have been. So let me give you a couple of comments. First and maybe foremost, it is going to contribute to us spending $40 million less next year on truck capital. So as we said, we're going to aged our fleet and extend the useful life of it to the tune of $200 million capital savings over 5 years starting in '15. So we're committed to that. And in the One Fleet divisions, we're seeing very good results. So let me give you a couple of stats. Maintenance cost per engine hour in One Fleet divisions has improved by 1% to 2%. Driver productivity in One Fleet sites has contributed approximately $2.5 million to productivity in '14. One Fleet divisions have 30% fewer unscheduled repairs and 25% higher truck availability or we'd call fleet reliability. So we think that's going to convert to what we would think as a lower driver turnover rate, higher employee satisfaction at some point, more customer experience and improved customer experience because our fleet's up and running, and we're servicing the customers better. So we're very, very focused here on how we can take care of our customers from a service delivery perspective and a differentiation perspective, so we can improve the quality of revenue. And our technician turnover's lower, substantially lower at One Fleet sites and it's really hard today to find good diesel technicians. And so all of those things are real. The divisions that we're in now that were converting to One Fleet, it's a lot of heavy lifting, and those divisions are probably costing us a little more than we thought they would going into Q3 and 4. But it's going to come around and at some point, this sort of backlog of workload is going to be behind us. We're going to anniversary that, and we're going to get those benefits. We're going to get all those other softer benefits I just mentioned, Scott, and we're certainly going to be able to extend the life of the fleet in a very methodical and thoughtful way without interrupting the business, and again, improving the service quality all along the route. So we're going to get it done and just again, it's just harder than we imagined. But it's the absolute right thing for the business. And we've got to think beyond the quarter, right? We're never going to be at Republic a slave to the quarter or a hostage to consensus. We're going to have to run the business for the long term and do the sustainable right thing for the business. Operator : Next is Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey : A couple of questions. So first on the volume, just looking at the big picture. It's a pretty solid number in the third quarter. And I say that because last year in the third quarter, you had a nice strong number as well. So you were able to deliver a nice number again in what I would say a tough comp. And so a 2-part question there. I mean, does that imply that sort of the economy and the construction markets are sort of in a cycle where we can continue to expect sort of a 1% to 2% volume number out of Republic going forward? And the second part to that, is the volume number you guys are reporting, is that really what you're seeing in your end market or is there some market share gains that is helping benefit your volumes right now? Donald W. Slager: Yes, so again, we're not giving guidance for '15. We are seeing good and steady volume growth. Again, the business grows, as you know, through population growth that fuels housing information, fuels business formation. So as long as those dynamics continue, we'll benefit from it. Housing starts are still well below the 25- and 50-year average. So could it improve from there? It could, but we're not seeing that yet. We're -- I would tell you that we're getting our fair share of organic growth, and we're replacing the business that we're losing. So again, we've got the 7% defection every year. More than half of that is competitive. So we replace that business. We're doing a good job of replacing that volume, albeit at a lower average rate, and so there's that churn issue that impacts us. But we're getting the volume replaced, and we're getting our fair share of new organic growth. That's really our goal. On top of that, we've got to replace those units at a slightly higher rate than we have historically and that's really our focus with things like Capture and priority-based selling. We're really hyper-focused on, internally, what we call quality revenue. Again, as I said to Scott, really focused on the customer service delivery and on everything on that end, but we're also focused on the selling processes, that point-of-sale decision making that we're doing to make sure that we're signing on those new customers at higher rates year-over-year. So the things we are doing are going to continue. If the macro environment continues, you'll get kind of more the same. And but the same thing is true with CPI, right? We don't have any indication in '15 that CPI is somehow going to magically get better. And it's an 18-month lag for CPI to work through our system. So you can sort of factor that commentary into why we're giving you this 2015 preliminary outlook. Alex Ovshey : Got it, Don. And just on the pricing side. So going back to the point around potentially changing some of the residential contracts and what index they're linked to. I mean, is there any timeline you could provide around when we should expect enough progress so it would move the needle on the bottom line? And the second part to that question, I'll turn it over. You have some really big residential contract out there. I mean, where is it in the Q in terms of actually going and speaking to the folks who are responsible for those contracts and potentially changing the index structure there? Donald W. Slager: Well, look, one, it's lumpy, right? The contracts in that business are generally 5 years. So one, we're not going to have 100% success rate. Let's be fair. We'd like to think over time, if the industry itself determines that the water sewer trash index is a fair way to go, and we can start to get cities to believe that is true, then it can maybe get some traction. But it's a 5-year process to work through the entire book of business. It could've been a bit longer because we've got some contracts that are 7-year contracts, right? So -- and some even longer than that. But I think the bigger franchise type agreements, the contracts are longer. However, I would say this that those contracts they tend to be more like real true public private partnerships, where we really are extension of the city and maybe because of the great job we're doing and so forth, we might have some opportunity to deal with that. So look, it's going to be a long road. But there's nothing I'm reading that's telling you that CPI is going to get better in a year or 2. There's a lot of commentary out there that informs our thinking that it could be this way for some time, and we just decided we can't wait anymore for CPI to right itself. So the decades that we've benefited from CPI, we don't know when that's going to come back. So everything else that we're doing to improve the business, Capture, priority-based selling, improving the customer experience, all of the work we're putting into trying to drive a higher quality of revenue, extend customer loyalty and earn the price increases year-on-year, we're going to continue to do that. And if CPI comes back, then that'll be a wonderful thing, and it looks to be icing on the cake for us. Operator : The next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli. Tony Bancroft : Just a quick question on the pricing dynamics on the street. We've heard from your competitor's recent calls talking about holding yield and pricing. I just want to sort of get your view what you're seeing out there, if that's what you're seeing or something different? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So look, our view hasn't changed. Let me start with that, right? So the price volume discussion is always kind of a bifurcated discussion and people sort of get lost in some of the commentary that companies are sharing. We have -- again, a big part of our business is restricted, limited by contract to CPI. Again, not whining about that. It is just what it is. I can't go in and magically change that. What we've said going into '14 is that we would go into the open market that didn't have the restrictions stronger to offset some of the pricing that we've lost in CPI. And we've done that this year. And the open market has held up very nicely. Our open market core price is substantially better than our average, okay? So the core market, meaning, or the open market, meaning open market commercial small container business and open market industrial. So that -- part of that's construction and part of that is permanent business. So that open market has held up well. So if you look at the pricing dynamic in that market, it's done okay. It could be better if the landfill pricing was moving. And that's the thing that doesn't get enough discussion. The fact is, again, Republic has done a very deliberate job of moving landfill prices forward. You've heard me talk about the fact that we've, year-on-year, lost landfill volume. It's the first quarter in I don't remember how many quarters, but maybe 10 or 12, maybe 16, I have no idea, that we've actually seen positive MSW volume growth. And that's just kind of keeping pace now with sort of normal -- some of the construction -- some of the other growth that's in the market. But that's really the issue for us is what will happen with landfill pricing going forward. We're going to continue to do what we do, and we'd like to think that as the market gets better, as the economy improves, that we could see landfill pricing moving at a more solid rate to support the underlying economics of supply and demand in the business. The other thing, obviously, is we've got a big presence in these markets. We tend to be #1 or #2 in size, and market density does drive margin and hold margin, and we don't want to get to a point where we're seeing gaps develop in our density. So replacing that 7% defection every year, trying to do it better than before using these new tools and training that we've talked about now extensively. And so back to my opening comment, I'll close with that. We haven't changed our tune on landfill pricing certainly and on price volume overall. Tony Bancroft : Got it. And I know you spoken about, you always talk about $100 million of M&A and looking at tuck-ins inside your markets, is there any update or what would it be, what would it take to go outside your market, what would you be looking at for there? And are there any -- you said you're always going out in the market and looking. Are there any possibilities that have come up recently or -- that you are interested in? Donald W. Slager: Well, I'm just going to -- we're going to stick with our $100 million general goal. There are some opportunities out there that you people are probably aware of, some big deals in the market that private equity deals coming back to market. We generally look at everything, Tony, in the marketplace, but primarily, we like the tuck-in business because it comes at the lowest multiple, post-synergy. It comes at the lowest risk of integration because we already have management and facilities and infrastructure in place. And as it relates to the Rainbow Disposal Company, that was just a really high-quality asset that was in an adjacent market to where we already were, and we felt that, one, that the assets were great and the management team there was outstanding, and some of their infrastructure can actually benefit us going forward in the surrounding market. So we're going to continue on the same pace. So I know I said this earlier, but I'd say it again. It makes sense for staying focused on tuck-ins in around that $100 million pace, and then it makes sense for us to look at other opportunities and when they're available and we can get good-quality assets with the right price to take advantage of that just like we did with Rainbow. So we'll continue to take that stance going forward. Operator : Next is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Edward Hoffman : Housekeeping question for all of us, if you would. What's implicit in your earnings guidance for a tax rate? Charles F. Serianni: We're not -- Michael, this is Chuck. We're not giving that level of guidance right now. Obviously, we'll get into a lot more details when we give full guidance in February. Just keep in mind that our rate in 2014 is 39.5%. Michael Edward Hoffman : And there's no reason that's going to change, right? Charles F. Serianni: Yes. We'll give more guidance in February. Michael Edward Hoffman : Okay. For whatever it's worth, guys, some of that kind of knowledge would be helpful. Well that doesn't get into real guidance. So you've got to have some assumptions in it. Year-over-year, 4Q, you're going to have about a 200-basis-point margin difference. Are there -- what are the onetime, nonrecurring that we should be aware of? Donald W. Slager: Michael, we didn't give Q4 margin guidance, though. Michael Edward Hoffman : Well, it's implicit in your full year guidance. Donald W. Slager: Right now, we're saying that year-to-date, they were at 28.1% on our EBITDA guidance. Michael Edward Hoffman : Right. And a year ago, you were 30.3%. Charles F. Serianni: Right. We called out some of the factors that were included in our year-to-date numbers, including commodities, weather and insurance, when you adjust for that, we're writing the range of the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. So... Michael Edward Hoffman : So that's the point. Those numbers are in the fourth quarter as well. That's what I was trying to get at. It was of last year. We got the same call-outs there. Charles F. Serianni: Yes. And remember, Michael, in the last year, in the fourth quarter, which we had called out that we did benefit from some favorable environmental adjustments that were more prior-year items, which brought the margin up above our original expectations. So again, when you kind of take a look at what we've expected for this year, we knew that those things would anniversary out. Michael Edward Hoffman : Right. That's what I was trying to get at. And then, Don, you have talked about in the past, you did share the $200 million in CapEx spread over 5 years, but you also talked about 75 basis points spread out over 3 or 4 years of improvement as a result from automation productivity CNG One Fleet, how do you feel about that today? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So look, we're getting the benefits from automation on the productivity side. We're getting benefits from CNG on the fuel side. The maintenance benefits are coming a little harder than that. As I said earlier, the One Fleet initiative is the right thing to do. It's coming a little slower than we'd like, and it's costing us a little more in this quarter, and in the remaining quarter of the year than we may be expected. We also have some other things going on in there. So again, as you know, Michael, I mean, there's a lot of mix in this business. You've got a lot of geographical mix. You've got a lot of line of business mix. There's a lot of puts and takes. And the one thing we found as we've dug deeper into the maintenance initiative is fleet complexity. So these emission standards from the '08 and '10 and '14 engines are driving cost up on those trucks. We really weren't anticipating that when we went down the road with One Fleet. And -- but the fact is we're probably spending more time than any company out there really understanding our fleet dynamics and try to drive fleet cost out and anniversary-ing some of these costs. But there are some things like that, that are masking it. The fact that the CPI resets in the resi business, where again most of our automated fleet is working, that has not helped us. So we're committed to those initiatives. We're going to continue to roll them out and see them through. And there will be a day when we anniversary some of this bio-wave [ph] cost in maintenance, and it'll flat line and then we'll have the benefits throughout other parts of the business. Operator : Barbara Noverini with Morningstar. Barbara Noverini : So in reviewing your residential contracts, we've talked at length about the challenges CPI-based pricing on the solid waste side, but can you comment a little bit about the profitability of your residential recycling programs now that commodity prices are kind of holding at these relatively low levels. How are you looking to improve this part of your residential business as well? Donald W. Slager: Well, Barbara, the review that we're doing with our all of our residential contracts include recycling as well. So we're constantly looking at improving the recycling line of business through making it more efficient at our sorting facilities. Part of what we're doing through collection methodology by getting efficiencies there. And when we do look at residential -- or I'm sorry, recycling contracts, we tend to look at sort of 10- to 15-year returns in average using sort of an average market price. So they're not performing as well as we'd hoped, but again, all things are cyclical. So we're using all the learnings that we're putting into this now to bid new contracts and we will just get better through time. But the -- it's not the recycling part of the residential business that's dragging us down. It's the overall CPI environment for, again, in that line of business that's almost 30% of our total collection business. So it's a big chunk of our business that is weighing down the other components of the business that are actually operating pretty well. Barbara Noverini : Sure, got you. Do you guys have any leeway to put forth a processing fee or something like that? I know some other competitors in the industry have been talking about this. Donald W. Slager: Well, things like contamination and performance criteria sort of a normal part of these contracts. So we do our best to hold anybody who is delivering material or producing material for these contracts to their end of the bargain. So it's -- you can't just break a contract in the middle of a contract and introduce new features or new penalties. If they're not in there generally at the beginning, you don't get to pull those triggers, and that's the issue with municipal buyers. They like to have a fixed-price, month-to-month throughout the course of the contract and only onetime a year do they want to open it up to some kind of a standardized index that you don't have to argue about, and that's the way they've walked for decades. And that's probably not going to change much except for the fact that we can get them focused on a different type of index that's more fair to a waste hauler like Republic Services. And overtime, just continue to move through that book of business and improve it. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Great. Well thank you, Holly. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you, all, for spending time with us today, and have a good and safe evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Republic Services conference call for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which were in line with our expectations. The Republic team continues to execute on our long-term strategy, designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, while continually improving return on invested capital. Some of our financial highlights for the quarter in full year include, fourth quarter adjusted EPS, was $0.50. This result includes a $0.02 benefit from the extension of CNG fuel tax credits. Full year adjusted EPS was a $1.96 and adjusted free cash flow was $709 million. Both performance metrics were in line with the full year guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.2%, and average yield was 1.7%. This is our highest level of average yield in the last four years. Fourth quarter volumes increased to 1.6%, volume growth continues to be concentrated to construction and demolition waste. We returned approximately $780 million total cash to shareholders during the year, which represents a cash yield of 6%. This includes 11 million shares repurchased for $400 million. We finished the year with total shareholder return of 24.7%, the highest level in the solid waste industry and well above the SNP 500 average. Throughout 2014, we discussed our multi-year initiatives that enabled us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity, and reduce cost. I will now recap our progress made during the year. 14% of our fleet is operating on natural gas. During 2014 we added seven CNG fuelling stations, and now operate a total of 36. We increased the automated portion of our residential fleet to 69%, from 66% in the prior year. During 2014, we certified 14% of the fleet under our One Fleet maintenance program. Approximately 60% of our fleet has been certified since inception. Some of the benefits we are seeing in our One Fleet divisions include, 1% to 2% lower maintenance cost per engine hour, 2% greater fleet reliability, 20% fewer unscheduled repairs, and 50% lower technician turnover. We continue to make investments in recycling facilities to improve productivity, and increase capabilities while rationalizing underperforming assets. We closed seven older recycling facilities that were not earning an adequate return during 2014. We invested $231 million to acquire 132 million of solid waste revenue, at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 5.6 times. This includes the acquisition of Rainbow Disposal, a high quality franchise business that complements our Southern California operations. Additionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tervita, LLC for approximately $485 million. The acquisition of Tervita provides a platform to expand our presence in the US, ENP waste sector, and unites an experienced high quality workforce with the Republic team. We believe the ENP waste sector provides attractive long-term growth opportunities, and leverages our expertise in waste handling recovery in disposal. The assets are well-positioned with approximately 80% of the revenue generated in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Permian basins, we expect the deal to close this month. During 2014, we entered or we heightened our focus on our customers to differentiate our service offering, build customer loyalty, and increase willingness to pay. For example, we launched the My Resource customer portal, which gives our customers online access to their accounts and our services. Over 500,000 customers have enrolled to date. We\u2019ve launched the My Resource mobile app, an expansion of our customer\u2019s online management tool. The app allows customers to schedule services and receive push notifications using a mobile device. We implemented the tablet-based Capture pricing tool, which creates a more professional sales experience, and helps realize better pricing levels at the point of sale. This rollout is complete in 17 of our 20 areas. And we launched priority based selling, or PBS, which enables us to identify end segment customers buying priorities, and attract customers that are willing to pay for enhanced offerings. We expect that PBS will be fully implemented by the end of 2015. I\u2019m proud of our many achievements during 2014, which are reflected in our strong performance. Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on the residential business. Last quarter we discussed the actions we are taking to improve performance. Since then we have engaged many of our municipal customers and made good progress. Most of our municipal partners were on a pricing mechanism that is fair to both parties, and understand low CPA space resets, and that kept pace with cost increases over the last six years. We had continued to educate municipalities and expanded the use of industries published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, than more closely aligned with our structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index, and the garbage and trash collection index. We are very early in the process, but remain encouraged by our initial results. The remainder of our business continues to perform well, and is generating strong year-over-year increases in revenue and EBITDA. Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results, Chuck? Chuck Serianni : Thank you Don. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50, which excluded Bridgeton related mediation - remediation charges of $0.32, and divestiture related cost of $0.04. During the fourth quarter we recorded a charge of $191 million, primarily related to the Bridgeton landfill. The charge primarily relates to additional cost to operate, maintain, and replace equipment to the end of the post closure period. We were able to make better assessment of future costs now that the Leachate management facility is operational. And operating costs stabilized on equipment that was upgraded in prior quarters. The charges accrued upfront, because this is a closed site, but the cash will be spent over the next 35 years. Fourth quarter 2014 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $84 million over the prior year. This 3.9% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.6%, and acquisitions of 1.3%. The components of internal growth are, average yield growth of 1.7%. Average yield in the collection business was 1.9%, which includes 2.9% yield in the industrial business, 2.1% yield in the commercial business, and 90 basis points in the residential business. Average yield in the post collection business was 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%. Core price, which measures price increases, net of rollbacks to our same store customer base was 3.2%. Core price consisted of 4.3% in the open market, and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business. Our volumes increased 1.6% year-over-year. The collection business was positive in 1.8%, primarily due to an increase in industrial volume. Growth in the large container industrial business was 4.8%, and includes C&D and other temporary business, which was up 6%. Volume in the small container commercial business was up 1.2%, and residential volume was relatively flat. The post-collection business was up 60 basis points and included landfill growth of 1.4%, partially offset by decline in transfer station volumes of 1.3%. Within landfill, MSW was up 2.1%, C&D increased 5.5%, and special waste grew 50 basis points. We expected special waste growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, due to a tough comparison in the prior year. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 20 basis points. Most of the change related to decline in the cost of fuel. Fuel cost decreased approximately $22 million compared to the prior year, which includes a CNG tax credit of $10 million. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.58 in the fourth quarter, from $3.87 in the prior year, a decrease of 7.5%. The current average diesel price is $2.83 per gallon. During 2014, we increased the amount of fuel we recover through our fuel recovery fee program. Currently we recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs, additionally 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged, using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel, results in a $1 million change in operating income. Since diesel cost decreased significantly over the last two months, we expect to realize a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter of 2015. This relates to the timing of our fuel recovery fee adjustment, which tends to lag the change in fuel expense by one to two months. We assume diesel prices remain at the current price of $2.83 per gallon in our 2015 EPS in free cash flow guidance. We expect a favorable impact to EBITDA margins in 2015, since both revenue and cost will decline by a relatively equal amount. Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales reflects a decrease in tons sold and the decline in recycle commodity prices. Commodity prices decreased 2.5%, to an average price of $113 per ton in the fourth quarter, from a $116 per ton in the prior year. Fourth quarter recycling volume of 568,000 tons, was down approximately 5% from the prior year. Most of the decrease relates to underperforming facilities we closed during the year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $4 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Current average commodity prices are approximately $95 per ton, this is down approximately $20 per ton from October prices, which we used to provide our preliminary outlook. This results in a $0.06 headwind to 2015 EPS if prices remain at current levels. We are taking actions to raise prices for recycling collection services, and adjusting rate rebates to our open market customers in response to lower commodity prices. We know our customers value, the high quality recycling services that we provide and we must earn an appropriate return to deliver those services. Before I move on, I\u2019d like to summarize the impact in changing fuel and commodity prices on our 2015 guidance, and reconcile the difference to the preliminary outlook we provided last October. The impact of lower net fuel and lower recycling commodity prices, results in a $0.04 EPS headwind consisting of a decrease of $0.06 due to lower commodity prices, and an increase of $0.02 due to the timing difference of our fuel recovery fee program. Accordingly, the lower end of our 2015 EPS guidance is $0.04 lower than our preliminary outlook. This assumes recycled commodity prices remain at current levels. The high-end of our 2015 EPS guidance is only $0.02 lower than our preliminary outlook. The high-end considers the impact if commodity prices return back to $115 per ton beginning in the second quarter. Excluding fuel and commodity, our 2015 EPS and free cash flow guidance is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided. Now I will discuss changes in margins. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1% compared to 30.3% in the prior year, a decrease of 220 basis points. Most of the change relates to favorable items in the prior year, which included 160 basis points from one time environmental and risk insurance savings. The remaining 60 basis points change primarily relates to an increase in legal accruals of 50 basis points, and the timing of incentive compensation accruals of 50 basis points. And these are partially offset by a benefit from CNG tax credits of 40 basis points. On a full year basis our EBITDA margin was 28.1%. I\u2019d like to point out a couple of line items. Maintenance cost increased 20 basis points, compared to the prior year. Most of the change relates to increased vehicle complexity and cost to refurbished vehicles and containers to support volume growth. We continue to see higher cost to maintain newer engines, due to enhanced emissions controls. SG&A costs were 10.3% of revenue, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Most of the change relates to an increase in incentive compensation expense and an adjustment to bad debt expense in the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of our cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data. Brian? Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks Chuck. Fourth quarter 2014 interest expense was $88 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 38.4% of adjusted earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year. In 2015 we expect to return to our statutory effective tax rate of approximately 39.5%. The increase in tax rate together with the exploration of CNG tax credits results in a $0.06 EPS headwind in 2015. Full year adjusted free cash flow was $709 million. This performance includes a cash tax benefit from the extension of bonus depreciation of approximately $45 million, partially offset by a capital pull forward of $25 million. At December 31st our accounts receivable balance was $930 million, and day sales outstanding was 38 days or 26 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately 7.1 billion at December 31st, and availability under our bank facility was approximately 1.6 billion. I will now turn the call back to Don. Don Slager : Thanks Brian. Before I open up the call for questions, I will provide our 2015 financial guidance. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.98 to $2.04. This performance represents mid to high single-digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.06 headwind from tax related items, and $0.04 headwind from net fuel and commodity. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of $710 million to $740 million. This performance represents mid to high single-digit growth after excluding the cash tax impact from the exploration of bonus depreciations and impact from net fuel and commodity. We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes average yield of approximately 1.5%, volume growth of 1.5% to 2%, contribution from acquisitions of 1.5%, a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1%, and a reduction in recycled commodity revenue of 50 to 100 basis points. We anticipate EBITDA margin of 28% to 28.5%, our 2015 EBITDA margin guidance is consistent with our slightly up versus, or slightly up versus our 2014 performance. Most of the expected improvement relates to the impact of lower net fuel. 2015 net capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $855 million, this level of spending includes a $40 million benefit from cost effectively extending the useful life of our fleet, offset by growth capital of 35 million, infrastructure development of 15 million and investments in technology of 10 million. Our 2015 guidance does not include the pending acquisitions of Tervita LLC, which we anticipate will close this month. We expect to maintain our 2015 full year EPS and free cash flow guidance after the deal closes since integration cost and infrastructure development expenditures are projected to offset the contribution from the acquisition in the first year. This is consistent with the expectation we provided when we announced the deal in December. Well onto our business fundamentals and strength of our assets has not change. We will continue to manage the business to create long-term shareholder value in 2015, we will remain focused on executing our strategy which is designed to profitably grow our business through organic growth opportunities and acquisitions, gain pricing power through differentiation and superior service delivery, improve productivity and reduce cost through our fleet faced initiatives. Generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, and continually improve return on invested capital. And increase cash returns to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. We look forward to delivering on our promises to key stake holders including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. For our customers we strive to provide the highest level of customer service. We are committed to developing differentiated and superior products that enhance the customer experience. For the communities we serve, we are the go to resource for delivering safe, environmentally friendly and innovative solutions that make communities better. For our employees, training and developing our people is a priority. We strive to be the employer of choice. And for our shareholders, we remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and free cash flow growth, improving return on investment capital and increasing cash returns. I would like to thank the entire Republic team for the contributions that have allowed us to meet our 2014 objectives, and positioned us well for future growth opportunities. At this time operator I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joe Box : So 1.5% to 2% volume growth, that looks pretty good for 2015. Can you maybe just walk us through by activity or at least directionally give us a sense of where you see that coming from? Don Slager : Sure, well again, the bright spot in volume for 2014 has been concentrated to construction and demolition. So we think those trends will continue through 2015. We did start to see, at the end of 2014, a little bit of MSW volume activity pickup in our landfills. We haven\u2019t yet really seen much activity of real growth in our commercial business. We don\u2019t have much of that baked in really in \u201915, but that\u2019s maybe where the upside lies, if we can start to see some of the broader economic recovery start to impact our commercial business. It\u2019s directionally good, but we haven\u2019t seen the uptick that we\u2019d hoped so far, but somewhere out there on the horizon for us. Chuck Serianni : And one of the ways to look at it too Joe is, if you kind of look at our full year performance this year from a volume perspective, it was 2%. So next year being 1.5 to 2, really kind of a continuation of what we saw on \u201814 with the exception, when you kind of take a look at special waste, special waste was pretty strong this year, really coming off of a really low comp from the prior year. So again, that would probably be the one difference, it\u2019s expressed as far as the rate of growth, rather than that relatively consistent with \u201814. Joe Box : I appreciate that, and I guess I thought that Don you would have mentioned maybe the commercial business is a little bit stronger. And I think you mentioned last quarter it was up 1.8%, this quarter it was only up 1.2%. I guess I\u2019m a little surprised to not see that sequentially ramp. Is there something out there, whether it\u2019s pricing or just markets that it could be holding that back? Don Slager : Yeah Joe, I\u2019m sure you got the 1.8, I\u2019m looking at Q3 of \u201814 was 1.1 in volume growth. So we picked up a little bit in Q4. Yield in commercial was 1.8 right in commercial Q4 sort of Q3. So it\u2019s again its trending well. Again, part of this is - our focus is in improving yield, right? And improving the quality of the sale and reducing churn and those things, so we're really focused there, but we think the continued volume in commercial will look consistent with what it is and wouldn\u2019t spend. And that again, if we see broader improvement, then we\u2019ll be the first to talk to you about it. Chuck Serianni : Yeah Joe just to give an idea, the commercial volume has been ranged down between 1.1 and 1.3 for the last five quarters, with an average of 1.2% for the full year. Joe Box : One last one and I\u2019ll turn it over. Do you guys think that this complete fall off in recycling prices could potentially be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back here? I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is, if this could actually be a positive, it might be the impetus to structurally improving this business. I know you guys have closed a couple of facilities but do you think that this might cause a broader base industry rationalization, or just the opportunity to go back to clients and break a restructure contract? Don Slager : Well it is I would tell you, first of all, this is being impacted by really broad global macro issues right, so you\u2019ve got this issue reports compounding that, but you\u2019ve got supply and demand issues are global. You\u2019ve got China economy, you\u2019ve got all that going on. We\u2019ve not seen a precipitous fall like this in quite some time. Over the long term we think it probably comes back. Keep in mind that recycling is a core offering for us, it\u2019s something that, it\u2019s a product our service that our customers want to buy. I think they value it more, probably then sometimes the industry thinks it does or they do. So we're going to look at opportunities, certainly to price our commodities in our recycling services in the open market. As you can imagine, we've already adjusted our tipping rates at our facilities in the open market. We've got a number of really long-term contracts with large municipalities that we're bound to deliver on through the remainder of the term, we\u2019ll do that. We will continually look to your point Joe, for ways to structure things better, but just generally municipalities are not built to accept the risk of commodities, commodity market, so we've got to figure out a better way to do that. Operator : The next question comes from Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Al Kaschalk : I just want to press further on C&D waste. Don could you just maybe share, given your footprint, is this broad-based? And are we still climbing along with retail occupancy rates or starts on housing in terms of this activity? Don Slager : Yeah, so it is broad-based and we're seeing this growth year-over-year and consistent quarterly growth across the entire company. We now, we've seen volume growth, we've seen pricing growth right? So temporary pricing is up, almost frankly as much as the volume is up. So we are growing units across all of our geographic areas and we're growing price per unit as well. So the demand is there, we've put a lot of our equipment back to work. Chuck made the point that we spent a lot of maintenance expense this year, giving us more - put back from service. So we think it\u2019s going to continue. And remember, I mean your household formation still not at the 50 year average. So we think over time, it could get back to that but I think we\u2019ve got a pretty solid plan for \u201815 and that we\u2019ll see this sort of continued volume as we saw in \u201814 in C&D. And of course we've seen at the landfills too, which again very, very broad-based. So I think I\u2019ve touched before, we don\u2019t really track our halls between residential and commercial, it\u2019s not that meaningful to us. We track more between sort of permanent and temporary, that\u2019s what the meaningful statistic is in our business. Al Kaschalk : And the point being there is that the temporary number has been strong, but it\u2019s also been better than price? Don Slager : Yeah absolutely right, so when you think about almost 5% price per unit through all basis across the business, that\u2019s pretty strong. Chuck Serianni : Again we would expect that, and we've been talking about this for a year. This is what we would expect right as volume demands come back, we would be able to get our fair share of the growth naturally because our footprint is so strong. And that we\u2019d be able to price for accordingly and that\u2019s what we've done. Chuck Serianni : Yeah in the Temp business in the fourth quarter the halls were up 5.6% and the pricing was up 4.8%. So you are getting double-digit organic growth in that portion of the business. Al Kaschalk : The other question I had and sort of two-part, but given what\u2019s happening with diesel prices or transportation costs etcetera. Two things, one, do you expect or have you started to see any benefit in the residential side of the business maybe production on consumption, and then therefore waste generation? And then secondly, can you speak to the dynamic that may occur as a result of lower diesel prices by private companies or competitors in the market that theoretically should get more aggressive on price. Is that out there as a concern, how would you respond to that? Don Slager : Okay, so first of all right, you know that our fuel, we basically have a natural held hedge built up into our operating model with our fuel recovery fee and then our fuel hedges. So you\u2019re structural through his remarks, we're not going to see much of a benefit for dropping fuel prices. So that\u2019s that, as far as consumption goes, well the average consumer because of spending less on fuel, spend more in the economy. I think maybe over the long-term, I think I saw some stature today that said that people are pulling back a little bit because they\u2019re not sure that this low fuel environment is going to last very long. But it lasted long enough and it looks like a structural shift then maybe people will start pulling some of their, the cash back to work in the economy, that would certainly be good for us in the small container and landfill business. So we\u2019ll see what happens with that. As far as what it does competitively, certainly the small companies that don\u2019t have fuel recovery fee, that don\u2019t have this path through mechanism. They are experiencing, today, sort of an immediate improvement in their operating expenses. If they\u2019re really smart, they\u2019ll hang onto that and realize that this fuel environment may not stay over for very long. And they won\u2019t just get it back in their pricing. That would be the smart way to look at it. If, at the same time, our customers are experiencing price benefit from us because we have this fair first mechanism that as fuel goes up, we share the risk, and as fuel goes down we share the benefit. And so our customers are seeing some pricing relief on their bills which I think positioned us pretty well with the customer as a contract as a part of that\u2019s being fair. So we have not heard of any irrational competitive behavior because of fuel issues at this point. I don\u2019t know that, I expected - it\u2019s not keeping me up at night Al. I think overall with dropping fuel prices, our customers probably feel pretty good. We\u2019re doing a good job for them and we\u2019ll continue to adjust their pricing as necessary with other inflation. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Baumgarten of Macquarie, your line is open. Adam Baumgarten : Just a question, how should we think about the capacity for additional acquisitions and share purchase, given that\u2019s your way to deal? Don Slager : Well we gave guidance that we were thinking about $100 million of spend again this year, in and around tuck-ins in the core space. There may be some opportunity to spend some acquisition of dollars in and around the ENP space over time. But basically you can figure that we\u2019ll spend another 360 million this year on share repurchase right, 100 million on tuck-ins. We\u2019ve certainly got the debt capacity to do that, of course we\u2019re going to pay dividend again, and we consistently raise the dividends through time. So our same balanced approach the cash utilization is part of our strategy for a long time, it\u2019s part of the value that we create for our owners, that really hasn\u2019t changed. The degree of acquisition is somewhat limited by the pipeline, we\u2019re willing to do quality deals. We\u2019re not going to buy companies that haven\u2019t been around for a long time with good assets. So that\u2019s - that focus hasn\u2019t changed. The 360 Adam is actually the amount remaining on our authorization, so we intend to complete that in 2015. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel, your line is open. Michael Hoffman : I hope I\u2019m going to be able to get this question out correctly. So I\u2019m trying to reconcile the cash flow from guidance at the beginning of \u201914, what you did and where bonus - because you didn\u2019t think there was going to be any bonus depreciation when you gave us guidance last year at this time. And at the end of the year we have it. But I\u2019m trying to understand, what\u2019s the delta between the 709 and the original guidance? Is it $20 million, and so X bonus depreciation you came in at 689, that\u2019s still within your range, it was a god number, and bonus depreciation helped by $20 million? Chuck Serianni : Michael you\u2019re right. This is Chuck. You\u2019re right on with that. But let me just walk through that just in case others on the call don\u2019t follow it. So free cash flow, we reported 709 for the year, you\u2019ve got a benefit from bonus depreciation of $45 million. And then we\u2019ve got a $25 million offset to that, because we pulled forward our capital to the year, which gives us to 689 on an adjusted basis. And that falls actually on a high-end of the range in our guidance that we gave in October, of 675 to 690. Michael Hoffman : That\u2019s cool. And then what is - is there any bonus depreciation in the 1555 to 1585 cash flow from aps? Chuck Serianni : No, no, actually Michael, it reverses in \u201815, so when we think about free cash flow for 2015, you actually had a negative because the bonus depreciation of $25 million. And that\u2019s offset by the $25 million of pull forward capital that we have, the capital that we pulled forward into 2014. So that ends up being a neutral on 2015. Michael Hoffman : Special waste trends, I get you had a tough comp in the fourth quarter, but are you starting to see special waste coming from non-residential sort of type activity that could suggest that - well it might not be in your guidance. And 1.5 to 2 seems like a good number for volume, to me, but if non-res construction starts showing up, maybe that number gets stronger, and a leading indicator would be special waste? Chuck Serianni : Yeah, special waste has been strong for us. You\u2019re right, we\u2019re seeing a little bit more of that activity, it\u2019s probably too early to call it, but you\u2019re exactly right. When we see more and more of the kind of lane clearing jobs that are precursor to industrial and commercial development, it\u2019ll bode well for that part of the business, but also construction volumes at large. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Redding of BB&T, your line is open. Charles Redding : Where do you peg the current differential right now between CNG and diesel? I guess has this dislocation impacted any kind of plans for CNG fleets then? Don Slager : I would say the difference between the two is probably about $1 right now. And that doesn\u2019t have an impact on our long-term plans. We still think that the movement into CNG makes sense, so we\u2019re going to continue that initiative. Chuck Serianni : This year, the CNG trucks that we\u2019re purchasing will be delivered into facilities where we\u2019ve already got the infrastructure, where we\u2019ve already set up the fuelling stations. As you know, that\u2019s a big part of the investment when we convert fleets over. So, we won\u2019t be putting in as many new CNG filling stations as we have over the last couple of years. We\u2019ll just continue to bring density to the fleets where we already have the investments made. Charles Redding : And then maybe you could just speak a little more to overall trends on the residential side. What are you seeing here, and are you seeing any, I guess, projected pullback and spending class, or perhaps any regions that are stronger than others, at least with respect to residential? Don Slager : No, I guess the most exciting trend that we have going on in the residential, is that we\u2019ve been converting some of our residential customers to the new waste index or industries. And so we\u2019ve got, of our total revenue, call it $700 million to $900 million of residential business that\u2019s not typical five year contract. So these might be anything from a nature way to a - call it a large city, but a typical five year contract in that business. And so $700 million to $900 million of total angle revenue. We\u2019ve already converted about 70 million of that revenue to one of the new industries. So giving the mark of CPI and it\u2019s going to take some time to work through the remainder as contracts come due. But we\u2019ve been at that now for a couple of quarters, making pretty good progress. So the people we\u2019ve been talking to so far have been pretty open to that idea. We have been successful everywhere of course, but we\u2019re going to continue to move down that road. That\u2019s probably the most compelling thing that\u2019s going on for us, residential, where most of our focus lies right now. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James, your line is open. Tyler Brown : So Chuck, thanks for the help on the recycling expectation. So can you give us a little bit of color on your composition of your recycle basket? Maybe by type, say fiber, glass, plastics, etcetera, etcetera? Chuck Serianni : Well, fiber makes up about 70% of our overall recycling, the rest of it is made up of, as you mentioned, glass. And various plastics and aluminum molds for another metals. Tyler Brown : Is, plastics bigger in that mix? Chuck Serianni : It\u2019s probably about 5% or so, of the mix. Tyler Brown : And then Don, I\u2019m kind of curious, can you give us a little bit more color on Capture? I think you said 17 of 20 areas, I assume that\u2019s the preponderance of your sales people. Is that a good way to look at it? Don Slager : Yeah, that\u2019s right. We\u2019ll get the other three areas completed here pretty soon, but we just need to get it done by the end of the year. Tyler Brown : So, bigger question. Where does that really attack in average yield? Is that designed to go after gross price, is it about reducing rollbacks, or is it about narrowing the loss to gain spread, or is it kind of all of the above? Don Slager : Yeah, so when you think about churn, think primarily of the business loss versus business gained. So again, we review and adjust pricing on every customer throughout the year, in what we call our RPM process, so 12 monthly buckets basically. Ever customer gets reviewed because we have cost inflation, even net of our productivity gains and everything else we do to improve the business. We saw cost inflation, we better recover that. So everyone gets adjusted, there\u2019s some negotiation, there\u2019s some rollbacks, there may even be some losses of customers. Some of those are due to pricing, some of those are due to just competitive behavior. Every once in a while we make a mistake and don\u2019t give the service that we need to give, and customer will leave for that reason, fewer and fewer of those let\u2019s say. But as we\u2019re replacing those customers that we lose, and remember, we\u2019ve got about a 7% defection rate in our business, every year 7% of customers leave us for some reason. We replace those customers. Well the Capture tool is designed really at the heart of that. So as our sales reps are out in the marketplace calling our new accounts, are these maybe new from competition, there may be new, brand new businesses springing out of the ground. We want to make sure at the point of sale, for those new accounts, that we've got better controls in place to get the very best pricing in that situation. So Capture allows our sales people want to be more efficient, they cover more ground. They can see more customers, two when they get in front of the customer, they can do a better job of understanding and segmenting that customer, understanding their needs, that gets tied right into the PBS selling initiative we call [indiscernible] [00:43] selling. So between the PBS training and the Capture tool, we think our sales people now are better equipped to go in and get better pricing on those new customers, by doing a better job of understanding what\u2019s important to them, and what they are willing to pay for. That also again, it makes it more efficient and makes the sale, it makes actually the experience better for customers, because it\u2019s a tablet-based tool, we can show the customer their sample invoice. And we can get a customer signature on the tablet for their electronic service agreement. The whole process just gets tighter and better. And we've got better control, so it\u2019s a cloud-based software. So if we want to raise prices in Denver tomorrow, tonight we can make price adjustments to the actual price sheets that the sales people use. And tomorrow they could be selling at higher prices with very stringent guard rails and limits on their authority and what decisions they can make in front of the customer, so that was a mouthful, but does that help you Tyler? Tyler Brown : No that\u2019s great color. So I mean as of to date, are you seeing any reduction in churn and or the gap between loss to new business narrow? Don Slager : Yeah, so we look at average selling price of new customers, it\u2019s kind of on the per unit basis, is one of the ways we do that. You think about average yield in our, average yield at our commercial business in Q3 was 1.8% and Q4 was 2.1%. This is largely focused on the open market commercial and open market industrial business. It\u2019s not necessarily that municipal business, it\u2019s not the residential subscription business. It\u2019s those two big open market verticals for us, and we're seeing improvement. We're getting great feedback from the field, great feedback from the sales team, makes their jobs a little easier. And so it\u2019s the right thing to do, we're excited about it. We're going to rollout these next couple of areas, and then continue to move forward from here. Tyler Brown : Okay, that\u2019s great. And then if I can squeeze one maybe last one in. So clearly residential has been a big drag just given CPI. And you noted some great success on the new industries, some great data actually that you gave. But how should we think about this business longer term. I mean to me it\u2019s probably one of your lower ROIC businesses. Would you look to retrench if you really don\u2019t have any pickup in CPI and or success on the new industries? Don Slager : Well we're having success, again, we're not going, I wouldn\u2019t advise you to extrapolate that success easily, it\u2019s very difficult work. The business we have - has an ROI that\u2019s above our whack, I mean so its returning positively, it just has fallen off from where we've come from. And so look, we went through a really tough recession, these municipalities faced with these municipal pensions that we\u2019re failing, faced with the tax basis crumbling, property taxes and all the rest of it. Economy has been battling back, you see all those metrics in the economy, we've been good Republic private partners these municipalities. We did the right thing by trying to help them right size their cost in sort of the time of trouble. We're frankly not willing to go any lower because we can\u2019t, and it\u2019s time for us now to expect lower fair and reasonable pricing mechanism in our contracts going forward. The other thing remember is, four years ago when we were first living for the first couple of years in a slow CPI environment, nobody thought, nobody I talked to thought CPI was going to stay low. Now, back now four years ahead of that, where we are today and no one really believes that, no one see\u2019s CPI normalizing to its 25 year average above 3%. And everyone sort of agrees on the fact that the CPI\u2019s been manipulated. So we can\u2019t live in that environment. And so we are moving forward, as I said, within new industries. We're not going do business or take new business that doesn\u2019t meet our return criteria. And we intend to improve this business over the long term. And we\u2019ve got some good traction so far. Tyler Brown : All right, perfect. Great stuff, thanks Don. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Ovshey : Don, on the CPI point I think over the last couple of months, because it was actually, I trust, lower probably partly due to the decline in energy. Are you anticipating any potential headwind from CPI in \u201815 or is it going to be potentially more of an issue for the company in \u201816 if it stays at these levels? Don Slager : You got it right, we\u2019ve got that sort of 12 - 18 month lag on CPI, that way it works to our pricing, and it\u2019ll be more of a \u201816 event for us. So we're hoping that these low CPI\u2019s are being forecasted. Start to bump up a little bit at the end of the year, but for \u201815 we won\u2019t have much impact from it. Alex Ovshey : Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then on the closed acquisitions in \u201914, can you talk about what the expectation is for contribution to EBITDA from those acquisitions in \u201915. And I know you talked about - synergy acquisition of the pull, how long could it typically take to accomplish the synergies? Chuck Serianni : This is Chuck, so most of these acquisitions are relatively small, but probably in the $2 million to $3 million range. And I would say that we can get them up to kind of the company\u2019s current margins relatively quickly. So they\u2019ll perform at pretty much at post synergy levels in \u201815. Alex Ovshey : Appreciate that Chuck. And then just last question from me, you spent some time talking about some of the new customer service tools that are out there. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s early, but do you think that you could potentially reduce the churn rate in the business as a result? I know that the 7% number we always talk to, but is part of the goal with these in your customer service tools, that number potentially comes down, are you seeing any progress at all on that front? Chuck Serianni : Yeah, the tools we talked about, the PBS and the Capture, really are focused at bringing our new business correctly. We think about defection, the 7% of the business that we lose, the way we\u2019re focusing on that Alex, is really through all of our customer service metrics. So we track across the entire company at every division, we track miss-pickups, we track service commitments, we have got a number of service commitments that each of our general managers makes to customers in each of our divisions. We know what their adherences of those commitments. We also use something called net promoter score, which we\u2019ve talked about in the past. And we get direct feedback from our customers, every one of our markets. And how they feel about our service and whether or not they would recommend us to somebody else. So we focus on those customer metrics to understand how we\u2019re doing in servicing our customers and how they value us. And basically, we\u2019re trying to drive all of those metrics up, because we want to extend customer loyalty right? We want customers to come with us, we want them to stay with us, because we\u2019re a great service provider and then we meet their needs, and we handle all of that for them right? That\u2019s our tagline; we\u2019ll handle it from here. So we\u2019re working on that, and can we get perfection down from 7%? Well it used to be 10, we brought it down to 7 and we\u2019ll see where we go from here. We do our best, we know our service metrics are improving, miss-pickups are down, service commitments are up. And our net promoter score has improved dramatically since we introduced it. So we also brought customer service metrics into our compensation programs for our general managers. So everyone has got some skin in the game now to improve the customer experience for each and every one of our customers. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking to get that done. Operator : That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks. Don Slager : Thank you, Sheila. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence, and creating the Republic way. Thank you for spending time with us today, and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Republic Services conference call for today. Thank you for participating.

Republic Services is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, RSG. Today's call is being recorded. And all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a question and answer session following Republic summary of quarterly earnings. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. DelGhiaccio. Good afternoon, Mr. DelGhiaccio. Brian DelGhiaccio : Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. This is Brian DelGhiaccio, and I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' first quarter 2015 conference call.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our strong first quarter results which were in line with our expectations. The Republic team continue to execute on our long-term strategy which is designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, expand margins and continually improve return on invested capital. Some of our financial highlights for the quarter include, first quarter EPS was $0.49 which included a $0.02 benefit from the timing of our Fuel Recovery Fee. We anticipated this benefit as part of our full year guidance provided in February. Adjusted free cash flow was $241 million which was in line with our expectations. EBITDA margin was 28.9% and represents a 120 basis points improvement from the prior year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relates to the net impact of fuel and recycle commodities. Core price in the first quarter was 3.7% and average yield was 2.1%. This is our highest level of average yield in over four years. First quarter volumes increased 1.9% with positive contribution from all of our collection and disposal lines of business. We returned $194 million total cash to our shareholders during the quarter. This includes 2.3 million shares repurchased for $95 million. We have $265 million remaining on our existing share repurchased authorization which we intent to complete during 2015. We continue to make progress on our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity and reduce costs. By the end of the first quarter 15% of our fleet was operating on natural gas. 69% of our residential fleet was automated and 64% of our fleet was certified under our One Fleet maintenance program. Additionally all of our markets are now using our capture pricing tool. We have trained and implemented our priority based selling program or PBS in approximately 60% of our markets. We expect PBS to be fully implemented by the end of the year. And finally over 700,000 customers are enrolled in our customer portal called My Resource. On February 13 we closed the acquisition of Tervita LLC. The assets provide a platform to expand our presence in the U.S. E&P waste sector and united experience high quality work force with the Republic team. We are still early in the integration process but it's going well and is expected. In summary, our strong performance in the first quarter was in line with our expectations and keep us on track to achieve the full year guidance we provided in February. Consistent with prior practice we will update our full year guidance on our Q2 earnings call in July. Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on our municipal business. We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, then work closely aligned with our cost structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index, and the garbage and trash collection index. During the quarter we converted an additional $40 million of annual revenue and now we have over 300 contracts representing $110 million of annual revenue using an alternative index. We are still early in the process but very encouraged by our initial success. We continue to offer high quality services and products to our municipal customers. But must earn an appropriate return to deliver those services. Converting to alternative indices, together with our actions we are taking to improve the performance of our municipal business, it will take several years to realize the full impact given the long term nature of these contracts. Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results. Chuck? Chuck Serianni : Thanks Don. First quarter 2015 revenue was approximately 2.2 billion, an increase of 92 million over the prior year. This 4.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.3% and acquisitions of 2.1%. The components of internal growth are average yield growth of 2.1%. Average yields in the collection business was 2.5%, which includes 4.1% yield in the industrial business, 3.2% yield in the commercial business and 70 basis points in the residential business. Average yield in the post collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 2%. Core price, which measures price increases, net rollbacks to our same store customer base was 3.7%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.8% in the restricted portion of our business. Our volumes increased 1.9% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.7%, primarily due to an increase in large container industrial volume. Growth in the industrial business was 3.9% with relatively equal contribution from the ferment business and temporary C&D holes. Volume in the small container commercial business was up 0.8%, and residential volume was positive 1.1%. The post-collection business was up 3.9% which is comprised of landfill growth of 4.2%, and transfer volume growth of 3.3%. Within landfill, MSW was up 5%, C&D increased 10% and special waste grew 3%. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 70 basis points. The change relates to the decline in the cost of fuel which decreased approximately [$15 million] dollars compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.92 in the first quarter, from $3.96 in the prior year, a decrease of 26%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. Currently we recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in operating income. We realized a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter due to a timing difference between our fuel recovery fee revenue adjustment in fuel expense, which tends to lag by one to two months. We do not expect this benefit to continue in future quarters. Finally, commodity revenues decreased to 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 17% to an average price of $97 per ton in the first quarter, from a $117 per ton in the prior year. Current average commodity prices are approximately $96 per ton, First quarter recycling volume of 580,000 tons represents growth of approximately 4% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions volume were down 5% and below our expectations. This was primarily due to congestion at the West Coast ports. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Now I will discuss changes in margins. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.9% compared to 27.7% in the prior year, an increase of 120 basis points. Most of the improvement relates to changes in net fuel and commodity which added 90 basis points. The remaining 30 basis points change primarily relates to reduction in risk insurance expense as a result a favorable claims development in continued improvement in safety related performance. SG&A costs were 11% of revenue, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. This change includes acquisition related cost and integration expenses associated with recent acquisitions which included approximately 30 basis points of expense during quarter. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of our cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Brain will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow, and selected balance sheet data. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks Chuck. First quarter 2015 interest expense was $89 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 39.4% which was consistent with our full year guidance. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was 241 milli and in line with our expectations. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of working capital. At March 31st our accounts receivable balance was $930 million and day sales outstanding net of acquisitions was 38 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately 7.6 billion at March 31st and availability under our bank facility was approximately 1.7 billion. I will now turn the call back to Don. Don Slager : Thank you, Brian. To conclude our first quarter results, put us right where we thought we would be, I am proud of how the Republic team continued to execute our strategy and our strong performance reflects their hard work. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. At this time operator, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question today. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. The first question comes from Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Ovshey : Couple of one's for you on the pricing side, so the 2.1% yield is a nice improvement relative to last year. Can you talk about how you see the trajectory for the balance of the year because I believe in the second half their maybe some negative impact of the reset of CPI. Do you think we can stay above this 2% level for the balance of the year? Brian DelGhiaccio : No Alex, we\u2019re sticking with our guidance as we said in our prepared remarks, we think that average yield should still be somewhere around the one year guidance we gave. There is couple of things happening in Q1, first of all we\u2019ve got a little softer quarter last year to compare to, so that kind of flows through our results here, you got to keep that in mind, Q1 of last year was impacted negatively by weather and other things. We also have had increasingly better pricing on a consecutive basis over the last four or five quarters and so as we get through the year the comps, the pricing are going to get a little more difficult because we have been improving average yield consistently. So that\u2019s going to be coming up on us. And then lastly we got a lot of pricing actions out there in Q1, specifically in and around recycling. As you know we were hit pretty hard with commodity sale prices and we\u2019ve taken some pretty serious actions for pricing in the field specifically in and around recycling customers and that\u2019s all showing up in that yield. Alex Ovshey : And then just on Tervita, now that we\u2019re into '15, can you provide an update on what you expect the revenue contribution could be from Tervita in '15? Don Slager : Yes, so we think it is just going to be right where we thought it would be for the most parts, had a little tour itself for us, but again we've only owned it for six weeks, we\u2019re really happy with the assets. We have seen, I know everyone sort of read about all of the rig count dropping faster than we expected. We\u2019re seeing a little bit of softness, we anticipated some of that softness in our pro forma, in our budget and our guidance and the place we're probably being seen the weakest part in net business is the solids control piece of the business, as coming a little softer than expected and that\u2019s really got much more of a lower margin associated with it. So I think the real performance of that business as going to be pretty much on track what we expected. As far as call it cash flow on EPS. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Redding with BB&T. Your line is open. Charles Redding : Just wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit more on the commercial side, in terms of trends what you're seeing container waste is going to be like? Don Slager : Yes, so the container waste are up a little bit, service increases are up but not dramatically. I would tell you what we\u2019re seeing in the business is continuing a broad recovery. Again, we saw it first in the construction demolition and we've talked about that for a year. We\u2019re starting to see a little bit of that improve in and around the commercial business and we\u2019re seeing it frankly in some of our MSW at the landfill as well. So a broader recovery pretty good solid recovery across all regions, but not a spike just kind of a steady improvement. Charles Redding : Do you get any sense of slowing or pressure come on the industrial side, if we think about domestically speaking the pull back in industrial production. Are you seeing any of that right at this point? Don Slager : As Chuck said, we\u2019ve got really solid performance both on the permanent side of our industrial business as well as on the temporary side, pretty strong performance. Now remember that\u2019s we\u2019re going to have some headwind as we go forward on a year-over-year basis because again we\u2019ve been improving that segment of our business pretty consistently quarter-by-quarter. So it's going to be more difficult as we go through the recovery to maintain some of these high growth numbers because of the comps. I mean we would expect to continue to grow but just maybe not at the same rate. Charles Redding : That's great, appreciate the color. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James, your line is open. Tyler Brown : Hey Don, so just, would love to get some color on Capture and PBS, so you know looks like you guys are virtually rolled out on Capture maybe PBS has got a little bit more to go, but it seems like you're getting some traction there, but any data points you could share around the impacts there and maybe through low churn or maybe that spread differential between lost and new business? Don Slager : So, I won't give you the exact numbers Tyler, but I can tell you that where we've rolled out Capture and where they've been at it the longest, the price per unit of new sales are compared to last year are improving, the Capture also comes in handy and the PBS training comes in handy with retaining business, so reducing net churn from a lost business and better negotiating skills with customers on potential reduction of rates when that's necessary, that's improving. So we're seeing impact maturing which we expected, we're seeing higher rates on new business as expected and we don't have, we've got it rolled out everywhere as you'd imagine that the divisions that had it rolled out earliest have got better compliance and adoption rates and it's the ones that have been through more recently, still need to work on that, but we're continuing to improve that and by the end of the year we'll be very solid across the entire company both with Capture, PBS will be rolled out and of course we have enhanced our CRM tool, so those three things together make the sales organization much more effective, much more efficient, much more professional. And we\u2019ve got the controls in place that we need to further improve churn and new pricing and new sales as well. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect, that's a good color. So you know again, nice quarter here and it seems like again the pricing side maybe has got a little bit of momentum there but it still seems that maintenance and repair really hasn't seen a lot of leverage from One Suite, maybe I'm missing it and that's very possible here but when would you expect kind of that unit cost inflation on the maintenance and repair side to maybe moderate or maybe even turn negative? Don Slager : I'm going to let Chuck give you the numbers in a minute but let me just give you the color again. You know at the divisions that have been [indiscernible] longest, we've seen reduction in some pretty important metrics. Lower engine cost per hour, we've seen better fleet reliability, measured is less downtime. We've seen lower tech turnover, pretty hard to find diesel techs these days so the maintenance shops that have one fleet installed are better placed to work for those techs, all will be positive metrics. So we know it\u2019s working and I'll let Chuck talk a little bit about how some of the margins, the mix have impacted what you're looking at. Chuck Serianni : So Tyler, you know it's important to note that the impact that net fuel and commodity and commodity has had on the margins overall. We said that it was a 90 basis point improvement in the EBITDA margin, but it has a similar impact in terms of the cost margins, the impact on labor is about 30 basis points. When you look at the impact of that revenue going away, and the impact on maintenance is probably about 10 basis points. The other thing I would note is that it also has had a negative impact on our SG&A as a percentage of revenue to the tune of about 20 basis points, so you're seeing that included in the numbers that you're looking at in our press release. Tyler Brown : Okay, yes, that's great. And then Don if I can squeeze kind of a left field question here, but I am very curious about this, so there's been a lot of talk in some of the transportation rags about a Federal highway bill that may add a size and weight provision, which would allow for heavier trucks and I'm just curious if you guys have ever looked at this or maybe contemplated any potential savings from any big changes on size and weights? I guess maybe thought of another way, do you guys typically cube out or weighed out your transfer trailers. Don Slager : Yes, we generally weight out the transfer trailers, these are 52 foot trailers now, really mega capacity, so we work within the compliance of the current regulations for gross vehicle weight, generally speaking we max out the weight before we max out the space in the trailer and the same thing in our hauling fleet, our collection fleet. They can generally handle more weight than which is allowed under the regulation, so we live within the regulations today, we haven't looked a lot at what refining those would do for us. I don\u2019t know where that bill at or how much traction it's got but we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time on that Tyler. Tyler Brown : As left field, I was just curious, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets, your line is open. Joe Box : A question for you on your residential business, if I just use the 552 million that you give in the release in terms of revenue, you're looking at about 2.6% growth rate in that business and if my model is right that looks like it's the highest growth since the last cycle. Can you maybe just put some parameters around that growth, are you seeing any changes within the organic growth rates there or is it some of the small tuck-ins just starting to add up. Chuck Serianni : One thing Joe to remember too as well is that that's going to include acquisition growth as well, so when you think about things like you know the Rainbow franchise and some of those things that we acquired, so it's not just organic growth, it's also going to include acquisition growth as well. Joe Box : Yes and that\u2019s why I was asking if you could just flush out maybe the difference between organic and inorganic, I mean have you seen any sort of change in the growth rate for just the organic component? Don Slager : I would say as far as unit growth within current contracts, we haven\u2019t seen any real surge there, that business tends to be a little lumpy because these are generally in the residential business five-year contracts they have [indiscernible]. We do have a couple of new contracts from organic growth in the mix today. But we budget every year for a little bit of new business and some loss business in that contractual base. Joe Box : So it sounds like probably no inflection point from new home formation or anything like that though? Don Slager : Not in the ordinary. Joe Box : Relative to the SG&A, I think Chuck you call that earlier that there was some integration expense that was included in the SG&A. I'm curious what a decent run rate for the salary side is, should we expect about 30 basis points of headwind over the next couple of quarters, I know you\u2019ve got some additional integration with Tervita is that a decent run rate? Chuck Serianni : We\u2019ve said -- we\u2019ve got some continued headwind with Tervita with acquisition type cost. I think overall for the year we expect that SG&A as a percent of revenue is going to be a little bit of in excess of 10%, but I would tell you that longer term for the company we feel that 10% of revenue is a comfortable spot for us in terms with our SG&A. Don Slager : Yes and the other thing to remember Joe is that the impact of lower fuel recovery fee and lower commodity prices that doesn\u2019t have a cost offset in SG&A. So as a percent of revenue that gives us about 20% increase as a result of the decline in those revenues. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open. Michael Hoffman : I am trying to get my hands, I count that your recent guidance in the middle of the year, but you got off to a pretty good start. There is a couple of numbers that I'm like okay, this is to do weird things in the second half of the year if I am holding one and a half price, it feels like it\u2019s got to walk itself up to some. And then you had a 2% to 2.5% revenue growth rate, but that was before Tervita, so I got to assume that number has got to change anyway, right? I'm struggling with -- you're not changing your outlook not even sort of being a little more optimistic about we feel really good about the outlook. Don Slager : Yes, so let's say this, we feel good about what\u2019s going on in the business I think our comments reflected that. We got some good things going on, our initiatives all have traction, we completed the rollout of capture, we\u2019re on track with their other major initiatives, we talked about some of the broader base recovery, we\u2019re seeing in MSW the landfill, commercial business starting to tick up a little bit, all that\u2019s good. Tervita is going along fine, little headwind there. Again we\u2019ve -- this was pretty much what we expected when we gave you guidance only two months ago. There are some anomalies and remember that we -- even though we had to take pretty big hit year-over-year in our guidance from standpoint of recyclables, we\u2019ve actually -- they are actually weaker than we planned and you see that there in the numbers. So we\u2019ve got that as the headwind remaining on the year and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen there just yet. So we still have to overcome three more quarters of a pretty tough recycling commodity market. We are getting traction in the programs. Remember last Q1 was pretty weak with the adverse weather, so this quarter is a fairly easy comp, again we got the $0.02 from fuel that\u2019s going to go away. So we had a good quarter and solid quarter. We\u2019ll take all the credit for that, but it's just too early to talk about year-end at this point. And again as we get through the year remember we\u2019ve been growing and improving price every quarter sequentially in the past four, five quarters and so as we go through the year and comp the last year, those comps are getting little tougher on year-over-year growth, so just keep that in mind. Michael Hoffman : Are you retaining more of the price that you're putting in the street this year than you were last year? Don Slager : We are, we\u2019ve gone out with a little more pricing in the open market and we\u2019ve also gone out pretty strong with price increases this year in the open market to our recycling customers because the market hasn\u2019t held up and to remember this, we already know about what our price is going to be in our restricted base, that is what it is and we\u2019re trying to combat that with the new indices. And again having some pretty good traction there. So I can\u2019t predict today what the open market is going to do into Q3 and Q4. I would like to think that it's going to hold up fine as it did in Q1, so we\u2019re going to continue to maintain the kind of level of actions we\u2019ve taken in Q1. We\u2019re not going to relax our pricing position and we\u2019re going to continue to expect more from the tools. But lot of extra price you see there is coming from open market actions and a lot of it coming from the recycling business. And we can\u2019t go back and price that again, that was sort of a one type step up. Michael Hoffman : You got to clean up the difference between the commodity and what you're charging. Don Slager : That\u2019s right. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks. Don Slager : Thank you, Sheila. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you for spending time with us today, and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Republic Services conference call for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

The Republic team continued our strong start to the year and delivered another solid quarter. We achieved higher levels of core price and average yield, profitably increased volumes, made continued progress against our multiyear initiatives, and reported earnings and free cash flow growth. We continue to see positive momentum in our business from successfully executing our strategy and a steady improvement in solid waste trends. Some of our second quarter and year-to-date highlights include : second quarter EPS was $0.54; the second quarter benefited approximately $0.03 due to a lower tax rate; year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $410 million, which was in line with our expectations; second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3%, which was consistent with the prior year and our full-year guidance; core price in the second quarter was 3.8% and average yield was 2.4%. The sequential improvement in yield performance reflects an increase in the level of pricing, a favorable reduction in rollbacks, and an improvement in the impact from churn. Each of these components of average yield has benefited from our revenue enhancing initiatives. This is the second straight quarter of reporting average yield in excess of 2% while growing volumes in excess of 1%, which clearly demonstrates our ability to grow both price and volume simultaneously. Second quarter volumes increased 1.1%, which was broad-based geographically and included positive contribution from our collection and disposal lines of business. The year-to-date investment in solid waste acquisitions was $116 million. This includes our normal tuck-in transactions and approximately $80 million of consideration for a life-of-site agreement to operate the Sonoma County landfill and transfer station network. We commenced operations of Sonoma County on April 1 of this year. The integration of Tervita is going well and on track with our plan. Performance has been short of our original expectations due to a sharper decline in the rig counts and drilling activity, but we remain pleased with the people and the quality of the assets. We are well positioned to take advantage of a recovery in this business. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 5.1 million shares repurchased for $205 million. We have $155 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization, which intend to complete during 2015. Additionally, our board recently raised the quarterly dividend to $0.30, an increase of approximately 7%. We continue to make progress on our multiyear initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably growth our business, enhance the customer experience, further differentiate our service offerings, and reduce costs. Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our capture pricing tool. 75% or our sales force has been trained on priority-based selling, or PBS. We expect PBS to be fully rolled out by the end of the year. Nearly one million customers has enrolled in the My Resource customer portal and app. And finally, we have approximately 350 contracts with more than $150 million in annual revenue that now use an alternative index for the annual price adjustment. We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices that more closely align with our cost structure. Regarding our fleet, 15% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas, 70% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 70% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program. With respect to our recycling business, average recycle commodity prices remain below the 10-year average, which continues to put pressure on our results. Most of our recycling business is performed on behalf of our municipal customers under multiyear contracts. As these contracts come to term, we are focused on renegotiating terms that contain the elements most important to us, including increasing processing and service fees that allow us to recover our costs and earn a reasonable return, and implementing a commodity revenue share mechanism that fluctuates with commodity markets, but also incentivizes customers to send us clean and valuable material. We expect it will take several years to realize the full impact of our efforts, given the long term nature of these recycling contracts. In the open market, where we do not have the same contractual limitations, we have already taken the following three actions : first, we increased rates charged for recycling collection services to be more in line with solid waste services; second, we increased amounts charged for processing materials at our recycling facilities; and finally, we adjusted the rebates paid to third parties for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. We believe that improving the profitability of the recycling business ensures its sustainability, which benefits the environment, our shareholders, our customers, and the communities we serve. In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We are raising our full-year financial guidance as follows, based on our expected outperformance for the year. We now expect diluted EPS to be in a range of $2.02 to $2.05; our original guidance was $1.98 to $2.04. We now expect adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of $720 million to $745 million; our original guidance was $710 million to $740 million. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck? Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $82 million over the prior year. This 3.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.7%. The components of internal growth are as follows : first, average yield growth of 2.4%. Average yield in the collection business was 2.9%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business, 4.4% yield in the large container industrial business, and 1% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 0.9%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.4%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks, was 3.8%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.9% in the restricted portion of our business. Second, our volumes increased 1.1% year-over-year. The collection business increased 1.3%, which includes positive contribution from the commercial business of 0.5%, the industrial business of 1.9%, and the residential business of 1.8%. Our commercial volume performance of 0.5% includes a 30-basis-point decline due to not renewing select national accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 0.6%. Landfill was up 0.9%, which includes positive contribution from MSW of 4% and C&D of 1.9%, partially offset by a decline in special waste of 2.1%. Special waste volumes were up 0.8% excluding the decrease in same-store E&P waste streams. The sequential decline in our volume performance from the first quarter was expected, since we had a tougher comparison in the prior period. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 150 basis points. The change relates to a decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.85 in the second quarter from $3.94 in the prior year, a decrease of 28%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in annual operating income. Finally, commodity revenue decreased 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 11% to an average price of $97 per ton in the second quarter, from $109 per ton in the prior year. June commodity prices were approximately $100 per ton. Second quarter recycling volume of 655,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 5% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were down approximately 6%. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Overall, we've experienced greater than anticipated headwinds from our recycling business, primarily due to recycling collection. Within recycling collection we are receiving less than anticipated rebates for materials delivered to third-party facilities. The lower rebates, which are recorded as part of our recycled commodity revenue, reduced second quarter EPS by approximately $0.01 compared to our original expectations. We recognized this headwind and implemented additional price increases in the open market to help mitigate the impact. This pricing action explains some of the sequential increase in core price and average yields compared to our first quarter results. Our material recycling facilities performed in line with our expectations. Now I will discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3%, which was consistent with the prior year. Margin expansion from the solid waste business, which includes lower fuel cost, was offset by the impact of lower recycled commodity prices and E&P waste services. Our E&P waste business includes transition and integration costs from our recent acquisition of Tervita. There was a 250 basis point reduction in revenue due to a decline in fuel recovery fees and lower recycled commodity prices. As a result, certain cost line items increased as a percentage of revenue. This was most prominent in the larger cost categories. For example, the decline in fuel recovery fees in commodity revenue resulted at an increase in labor of 40 basis points, in maintenance of 20 basis points, and in SG&A expenses of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The remaining increases in these three cost categories primarily relate to the mix of volume growth and integration costs. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Second quarter 2015 interest expense was $92 million, which includes $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 36.3% in the second quarter and 37.8% on a year-to-date basis. The lower tax rate in the second quarter reflects a $0.03 benefit from favorably settling certain tax matters. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% in the second half of the year. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $410 million and in line with our expectations. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter based upon the timing of cash taxes and working capital. Now I'll turn the call back over to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks Chuck. In closing, we continue to see a broad and sustained recovery in our solid waste business. Improving fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, have resulted in EPS and free cash flow growth and margin expansion. I am proud of how we continue to execute our business plan, and our strong performance reflects the hard work from the entire Republic team. We continue to manage the business to create long-term value and remain focused on executing our strategy. At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. First question will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon guys. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, so Chuck, you kind of hit on this, but it looks like the overall EBITDA margins were roughly flat if you take in totality, and I guess that doesn't really jive with the 2.4% average yield. You know, I would expect to see some margin expansion with pricing over 2%, especially when you are growing volumes and fuel falling. My hunch is that Tervita kind of mixed away some of the good things in core solid waste. Is there any way that you could isolate or give us some numbers around what the core solid waste margins did? Charles F. Serianni: Yes, sure Tyler. So quarter-over-quarter, solid waste, which includes yield obviously, was up about 60 basis points, so very solid growth from that portion of the business. You know recycling, as we have talked about, was a headwind of about 30 basis points. And then E&P, obviously Tervita, including integration costs, is a negative about 30 basis points, and that's what gets you to kind of flat year-over-year. Patrick Tyler Brown : Excellent, very good. And then I also, I kind of want to \u2013 I get it that about 50% of your market is in the restricted piece, and let's call it 50% in the open, and I know 60% of the restricted is in CPI, but actually I want to ask about the other 40% that isn't tied directly in with CPI, but it is \"restricted.\" So can you kind of help us understand what we should expect core pricing trends to be in that bucket as we move out to 2016, and what really moves that piece of the business? Donald W. Slager: All right, so let's put the pieces together, right? So half of our revenue is restricted, half of it is open market. Of the restricted piece, we say 60% of that is tied to some kind of an index, right? We will come back to that. The rest that's restricted is, it might be a fixed price increase, it might be not tied to an index but have a 2%, 3%, 4% increase already built into the contract. And those might be large industrial accounts, they could be national accounts, things like that. So you know, what moves the pricing in that part of the business is just our further commitment to pricing intelligently our business and knowing when to walk away from business. You know we mentioned, Chuck mentioned in his results that \u2013 or in his comments that one of the things that impacted volume was some loss of some national account business and some broker business that we define as non-regrettable. So, you know, we're going to continue to look at business, and all customers aren't created equally. So the capture tool, the PBS training that we talked about, all those things are proving valuable throughout our business, we are going to continue to move price. We think now with what we've been seeing that price for the full year will be closer to 2% based on all of these actions. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. So that restricted piece that's not tied to CPI doesn't necessarily move in sympathy with CPI, its actually fairly independent? Okay. Donald W. Slager: It is somewhat independent, and again there are many different versions of contracts within that bucket, but we're basically taking our same sort of core philosophy on pricing throughout our business. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Levine with Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Scott J. Levine: Okay, good afternoon guys. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Scott. Scott J. Levine: So I guess you mentioned use of these revenue enhancing initiatives kind of driving some of your ability to get price and volume and better rate than you guys have I think over the last few years. I was hoping you might to be able to elaborate on that a bit more. The pricing metrics in particular over the last couple quarters have been surprisingly good. Is there anything going on in the marketplace that is driving this, or is it more internal in your opinion? Donald W. Slager: No, I think there's a lot going on. Let's talk first about our efforts, right? So we have put an incredible focus on customer experience, on service delivery, on our fleet initiatives, so our fleet is more reliable today, our customer delivery is better, we think we're extending customer loyalty, and we think we're earning that price increase more easily from our customers. So that's at work. I think we are easier to do business with than we were a year and two years ago. So we are increasing the value proposition, that's part of it. We are going out with higher price increases. We've got more confidence in earning that price increase, or asking for little higher price in the open market and getting it. Specifically also on the recycling business in the open market, with the way that recycling commodity prices dropped pretty quickly in the first half of the year, we went right to work on pricing that open market recycling business, and as we said in our comments, we've moved the prices up substantially in that segment. So that's driving it. Certainly when there is volume growth in the marketplace, market dynamics change. Generally speaking, I think competition is less likely to go out aggressively for competitive waste streams when they are getting waste streams organically. So I think that's happening, I think that's just sort of normal supply and demand kind of activity that happens in a marketplace. We are using our tools, right? So capture is rolled out to all of our areas across the country. That gives us \u2013 it makes us more efficient in talking to customers and calling on new accounts, it makes the selling process better and more desirable and enjoyable for our customers, and it gives us better pricing control at that point of decision. So that's happening, that's helping affect churn. And then PBS, tied to that training, we're also have refined our sales compensation plans, et cetera. So there's a lot of work inside the company that's doing that. Again, a normal growth environment organically would be a better market to get price in. And then obviously on the municipal side of the business, we talked about moving a portion of that business to the better index, and so every quarter now we've reported an increase in moving more customers to the new index that's more in line with our cost structure. We are going to continue that hard work, and over time we will move the needle consistently and basically kind of re-imagine how we price municipal customers, because we have to have an index that's fair. So it's a mouthful, but all those things working together for the greater good here. Scott J. Levine: Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. And as my follow up, I guess here, so, with the dividend hike I have that equating to about, I don't know, 55% to 60% of your free cash flow target for this year. I know you are buying back stock so that share base comes down, but you know that, coupled with the fact that you guys are spending little bit more on acquisitions last year and on pace to do so again this year, is there any thought we should have in terms of what kind of guides the thought process on the dividend, which I know is a board decision, but are you guys comfortable? I don't know where the leverage sits today, but maybe just a little bit more color around that? Charles F. Serianni: You know, we are certainly comfortable with the leverage where it's at today. And you know, keep in mind also that we are going to be growing the EBITDA of the company. When we think about dividend growth, we think about growing dividends in line with our growth in free cash flow, so that's something that's very, very comfortable for us. You know, a 7% growth in the dividend this quarter is right in line with our five-year CAGR, and it's obviously something that we are all very comfortable with, that the board's very comfortable with. Donald W. Slager: Scott, we expect the leverage to continue to drop through the course of the year to sub-three. We anniversary some events, the business continues to perform and grow as Chuck said, so we are very comfortable with the leverage. And we do a very in-depth discussion with our board every year on our financial policies and cash allocation. We had a very big discussion with our board this week on the dividend. We always had that kind of holistic view of cash for acquisitions, cash for dividend and for buyback. And so we'll continue to do that, and we think this is right sort of balanced approach to efficiently return cash to shareholders. And the question was do we have confidence; we wouldn't have done if we didn't have confidence in it. Scott J. Levine: Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is now open. Michael E. Hoffman: Thank you very much for taking my questions Don, Chuck and Brian. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman: Hi guys. On the operating leverage of the business, when I think about Chuck's comment that there was 60 basis points of leverage on solid waste but it's offset by 60 basis points from recycling E&P, how do I think about that tracking into the second half? Is the 60 on the E&P and recycling kind of going to be a constant, but the solid waste should have some acceleration, maybe running towards 100 basis points? Charles F. Serianni: I think it's going to be relatively consistent, Michael, over the course of the remainder of the year. I don't see the headwind \u2013 we are not forecasting the headwind in recycling to go away anytime soon, and we're certainly not calling for an upturn in oil rigs. We don't see that anytime real soon. So I think that that headwind's going to consist \u2013 stay consistent. I would also say that we feel very comfortable with the increase in solid waste, and we think that we're going to continue to benefit from the initiatives that Don had talked about, as well as our continued focus in on driving up our yield. Donald W. Slager: Yeah, so Michael I'll add to that. I look at that as upside, right? Because the underlying business, the majority of our business, our solid waste business, is performing very well, and we've got these two components, right? Recycling is 9% of our revenue, commodity sales is about half of that 9%, and then our E&P business is less than 2% of our overall business. So we've got these two sort of micro verticals here that you know are fairly volatile. But we are confident that they'll return; we're bringing more focus to the recycling space than we ever have. So as we get those businesses to come around and the broader macro environment improves, that's just sort of added fuel to an already very well operating and performing core business. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay, so just so I make sure I understood it \u2013 this isn't my second question, operator... Donald W. Slager: Oh, I think it is, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman: Then, well just so I \u2013 so the 60 stays 60 as the headwind, 3Q, 4Q, but the 60 that was solid waste should improve \u2013 maybe it's 70, 80; 80 goes to 90, 100, 3Q, 4Q, that's the way to think about it based on what you all have just said? Donald W. Slager: Yeah, well if you think about it, one of the big points of \u2013 that when Chuck mentioned the headwind from E&P integration, some of the integration cost is going to taper down, right? And then obviously as you know, you've followed this business a long time, there's a lot of moving parts in mix, geographical, business mix, some of the cycles of pricing, and as we said, we expect pricing to be more like 2% for the full year now. But yeah, I mean it's \u2013 we think the underlying performance of the business improves from here. And we've got to continue to do same things we've been doing. We've got to continue to have success in moving to the new index in the municipal business, and it's going to depend a little bit on the macro environment, a little bit on the market dynamic. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. And then on the underlying volume trend, should we see a year-over-year improvement in the second half relative to the first half, as the drivers of this continue to improve? Residential construction, non-residential construction, it turns into more volume in the cans, the whole bit? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, I think based, Michael, on where we are right now and what we see in the future, you know we feel comfortable with the volume for the year up about 1.5%. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Donald W. Slager: So to your point on more volume in the cans, we are seeing some pretty good trends in service increases, less decreases. We didn't talk about that in our comments, but that's all continues to trend very well. But again, as you know, we've all thought this thing was going to recover quicker than it did, and so I want to temper you know everyone's excitement. I mean we feel really good about the business, we are very proud of the team, but let's see how things, let's see how the market and the macro issue sort of comes around in Q3. Michael E. Hoffman: Perfect. Well, nice job in the quarter. Thank you for everything. Donald W. Slager: Thanks Michael. Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question will come from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joe G. Box: Hey, guys. Charles F. Serianni: Hey, Joe. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Joe. Joe G. Box: Don, could you just put some figures, or maybe at least some color, around the reduction in rollbacks and churn that you alluded to earlier? Donald W. Slager: Yeah, we can do that. You want to give him some stats, Brian? Brian M. DelGhiaccio: Joe, if you kind of take a look at each of those components right, so we talk about, call it gross price, what we're going out to the market with to our customers, as well as the impact of rollback, and then obviously that impacted churn. And if you kind of take a look at the sequential improvement in yield from 2.1% to 2.4%, each of those components had a relatively equal contribution. So think of it like 10 basis points each getting better sequentially from each of those three components, that is basically the way that you compute average yield. Joe G. Box: Okay, understood. Yeah, interesting that you guys are actually capturing a greater percentage of that, whereas it looks like one of your competitors is capturing less, which might be a mix issue. But maybe switching gears for my follow-up, Don, I get the $0.01 hit from commodity prices sold. I'm just curious how you view that. Is it theoretically possible that \u2013 or is it positive that your third-party MRF vendors are actually doing away with rebates now? Does it suggest that maybe there's some momentum in the industry to pushing back on recycling, and theoretically this business can be structurally improved? Donald W. Slager: Yeah, it's theoretical, yes, right. So I'll tell you what's happened historically, when we've seen down cycles in recycling is just about the time the market starts to sort of revolt and raise prices and maybe constrain some service, the volume \u2013 or the commodity prices bounce back, and then the market doesn't really change very much. So the fact that this has been so steep, and I would say sustained, probably we've had great luck with moving prices forward in the open market, which says frankly, customers are willing to pay almost as much for recycling as waste. And then we've done a lot of customer insight work in our marketing group here, and customers are telling us that, it's important. If it's really important to them, they're willing to pay for it. So customer demand should accompany willingness to pay, and that's our view. Now in the \u2013 the open market's one thing, because the contractual obligations that we have with customers are different and shorter term. A lot of our recycling is done with municipalities; those are longer-term contracts, as I said in my comments. Those will take longer to turn, but I'll guarantee you this, our team here, our recycling group, our operating group, our sales team, our pricing team, all working very diligently together to think about how we are going to, as I said re-imagine the recycling business here of the future, and our view is that it's not going to be the same way it occurs today, it just can't be. And so, the overarching point there is, if we want recycling to really truly be sustainable, sustainability can't happen without consistent profitability. It's just impossible. And so we've got to find a new way to make the model truly sustainable, therefore sustainably or consistently profitable. That's again a mouthful, but it's what we're working on. We're still committed to it, because our customers want it, and as I said, if they really demand it then that should be accompanied with willingness to pay. Joe G. Box: Appreciate it, thank you. Donald W. Slager: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Layne (34:43) with First Analysis. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. Donald W. Slager: Sure Charles F. Serianni: Hey Ken (34:50). Unknown Speaker : Let's see, just a little bit more on the pricing side again. It looks this was the second quarter where average yield came in above 2%. I just want to see if you have any view or expectations for the remainder of the year? Donald W. Slager: Yeah, we are not going to give you quarterly expectations, because I've said I think pricing will look more like 2%, the original guidance we gave you was 1.5%. So all these things coming together, again the tools being deployed, you know, the benefit of organic growth, all the things I mentioned earlier, yeah, we think we'll continue to see that kind of pricing for the reminder of the year. You know, we do have a couple of things on the forefront here, the comp gets a little bit tougher in the second half for the year, we have some one time pricing actions that we took in the second half of last year that don't happen again in 2015, but all-in we think pricing will be a pretty good story for us from here out through the end. Unknown Speaker : Sure, thanks. That's helpful. And then I guess switching gears a little bit, more on the recycling side, are you expecting sort of any improvement in the back half of the year, just given some of the recent stabilization in the commodity pricing environment? Donald W. Slager: No, the guidance we've given you assumes that recycling stays flat, commodity sales just stay flat from here for the remainder of the year. If it takes a bounce, that will be a little bit of upside for us. Unknown Speaker : Sure, sure, okay. Great. Well, thanks guys, and good job. Donald W. Slager: Thank you. Charles F. Serianni: Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Ovshey : Thank you. How are you guys? Donald W. Slager: Good Alex, how are you today. Alex Ovshey : Good, Don, thanks. On the cost side, so just looking at the details that you provide, so buckets like labor and related benefits, maintenance and repair, SG&A, I think of those as relatively fixed, and so buckets where you should have leverage on when volumes start to really pick up. And just looking at the year-over-year change on those costs, it sounds like they are up almost in that high single-digit range. So just on those buckets, can you just talk about why we are seeing that kind of inflation there? May be zoning in on the repair side, where you have one fleet happening, I mean I would think at some point those costs are to start to level out for you? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, you know, so Alex, you've got to keep in mind also what I said during my comments, that you've got a 250 basis point reduction in revenue, and that reduction in revenue is driving an increase in those costs, in terms of a percentage of revenue. So if you \u2013 some of the lines items that you called out are some of the larger cost categories. So in terms of labor, that's about 40 basis points of the overall increase. It's about 20 basis points on the maintenance side, and just for reference it's 20 basis points on the SG&A also. So you got to take that into consideration when you're looking at the basis point increase year-over-year. The other thing that we need to take into consideration is the mix of business year-over-year. As we've mentioned, the volume increases that we got have really been focused in on the industrial business and on the residential business, and there's not as much \u2013 our ability to leverage those costs isn't quite as great as some of the other cost categories. Donald W. Slager: So remember too, we've got acquisitions year-over-year, we've got volume growth, and as it relates to maintenance specifically, we pointed out a couple of times before, while we're very pleased with our One Fleet initiative, and it's exactly the right thing to do, when we started that program we did not see some of the fleet complexity coming our way. So we do have some cost increases coming from the new cleaner engines and some of that. So \u2013 and I'll just remind everybody, we didn't talk about it here on the call, but one of the paybacks on One Fleet is the \u2013 aging the fleet in a methodical fashion and getting that CapEx savings that we've talked about a number times; one-time $200 million savings, plus the ongoing benefit of running a fleet that's about a year older, which is about $15 million a year in CapEx. So maintenance specifically is \u2013 we're getting a great payback on that. Charles F. Serianni: One finer point also I think on the labor side to keep in mind, is that we did call out some integration costs this year, and that's obviously included in the labor numbers. Brian M. DelGhiaccio: Yeah, and Alex just to put some numbers around the acquisition and volume growth that Don was talking about, our acquisition revenue is up 2.7% year-over-year, and volume's up 1.1%. So when you add those types of revenue, it's going to come along with it, costs, and so when you're just looking at cost change expressed as a percentage year-over-year, you've got to include those revenues as well. Alex Ovshey : Yeah, okay, I appreciate everybody's thoughts there. And then in the filing, the 8-K, you do break out an E&P waste services revenue number; I think it's $27 million for the quarter? So is that essentially the Tervita revenue that you're reporting? Charles F. Serianni: Yes, that's Tervita; that's primarily the Tervita revenue. Alex Ovshey : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Al Kaschalk : Good afternoon, guys. Brian M. DelGhiaccio: Hello, Al. Al Kaschalk : Hope you're all doing well. I want to focus on core price for a minute, and I joined a little late so I apologize if \u2013 I know you had 3.8% for the quarter; I am not sure what it was in the first quarter. But my question is driven at the open market piece, and in particular if the volume trends are favorable, why we should not expect that number, that contribution of open market pricing, to be better going forward? Or is that the real reason why guidance is being lifted? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, I think what we're saying is that we are lifting guidance because of the favorability that we're seeing right now in our solid waste business. You know, what I called out before is a 60 basis point increase in margin year-over-year due to the solid waste business. Keep in mind also that if you kind of look at our increasing guidance overall, a good portion of that increase is really due to the solid waste business, and \u2013 which is primarily yield. Donald W. Slager: Yeah, and it's being offset by a couple of things; we called out the commodities. We called out some of the headwind from E&P. But you are right, the core business is operating very well, and as we turn around these two very small parts of our business, although obviously volatile parts of our business, that will all come in behind it, so... Al Kaschalk : Great. Donald W. Slager: You're on the right track. The business is doing very well, Al. Al Kaschalk : No, I hear you. And I guess the question that \u2013 the follow-on to that would be at some point we'll start to see that in terms of the EBITDA margin. I know there's number of moving parts and we need that restricted portion to get north to 2% to give you some help? Donald W. Slager: Well, another way of saying it, right, is if recycling hadn't cratered on us, and E&P hadn't dried up, right, our margins would have been up 60 basis points. So that's it. Al Kaschalk : Just a follow up I guess; one of your competitors articulated, probably for the first time, their affection for another price index as well, and I know you've talked about it's a slow process, but can you give any more insights in terms of how that's going? I know it's a process, but in terms of the realization of the new index on the customers? Donald W. Slager: Right, so we've said that approximately, what, $2.4 billion of our business is that, again, that 30%, right. So it is restricted to some type of index. What we've been talking about lately is about $800 million of that piece is the smaller municipal contract, generally residential only, call it a five-year contract. So that $800 million, that's the first piece we've been working on to move to a new index. We've now moved $150 million of that business, $150 million of the $800 million, to a new index, that's confirmed. Still working on the balance. And as you would expect, logically, when we try to change how this occurs with our customers and within the market, we will start with smaller contracts, and having good success. The remaining $1.7 billion is larger contracts and franchise agreements that tend to run a lot longer than five years, and also include oftentimes commercial, small container, large container business. So, we're up to $150 million out of the targeted $800 million. We're progressing every quarter. We don't know how far it will go, we're certainly making strong arguments and frankly successful arguments for it, and we'll continue to do it. Again, the overarching issue here is, in these kind of public-private partnerships they've got to be mutually beneficial; it's unrealistic for our municipal partners to expect us to settle for an index that doesn't adequately cover our inflation. So we've got to cover our inflation net of productivity on a consistent basis. That's reasonable, it's fair, and that's one of the reasons we're getting it done. The fact that there is this water-sewer-trash index, something we can point to that's been in use now for what 15 years or whatever, is helping. And so, it's too early to tell how long it's going to take and how far it's going to go. I can tell this, we're not going to stop pushing. And that's \u2013 we'll update you every quarter as we go through time, but that's certainly helping and will certainly show some benefit into next year. Al Kaschalk : Just in terms of the customer feedback, maybe you don't want to share, but I guess if it's helpful for them on their side of the equation, there would seem to be reasons that the acceptance rate would be high going forward? Donald W. Slager: Yeah, so it's fair, it's equitable and in some cases it's helpful for them, especially those municipalities that have their own sewer and water infrastructure that has been struggling to keep up with the pace of inflation. Frankly, we weren't the only ones that didn't know that this sewer, water \u2013 water-sewer-trash index existed, so we're shedding a lot of light on that. And so again, progress continues and we're hopeful and confident that we'll have another positive update for you as we go through the year. Al Kaschalk : Thank you. Operator : That will conclude the question and answer session. I will turn the conference back to Don for closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Well thank you, Gabrielle. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, their commitment, and most of all dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you for spending time with us today, everyone. Have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Republic Services conference call for today. Thank you for participating.

When events are scheduled, the dates, times, and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Don Slager : Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our third quarter results represent another solid performance by the Republic team. We continue to successfully execute our plan resulting in improved pricing, positive volumes, and growth in earnings and free cash flow. We are realizing the benefits of our strategic initiatives while capitalizing on the steady improvement in solid waste trends. Some of our third quarter and year-to-date highlights include third quarter EPS was $0.53, and year-to-date free cash flow was $603 million. Both performance measures were in line with our expectations. Third quarter EBITDA margin was 28.1%, which is consistent with the prior year. Year-to-date EBITDA margin was 28.4%, which is in line with our full-year guidance. Core price in the third quarter was 3.6% and average yield was 2.5%. The sequential increase in yield performance reflects an improvement in the level of churn. We define churn as the revenue per unit difference between new and lost business. Third quarter volumes increased 60 basis points. Our collection volumes increased 1.1%, which continues to demonstrate that we can grow price and volume simultaneously. During the quarter, we invested $24 million in tuck-in acquisitions at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of approximately 5.5 times. We remain on track to invest approximately $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions this year. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $600 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase since the beginning of the year. This includes 7.4 million shares repurchased for $298 million. Our Board recently approved a $900 million increase to our existing share repurchase authorization and extended the term through December 2017. We continue to make progress on our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our Capture cloud-based pricing tool. 90% of our sales force has been trained on priority based selling or PBS. We will be fully rolled out by the end of the year. We are seeing very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform. Approximately 1.1 million customers have enrolled in our My Resource customer portal and mobile app, significantly enhancing our customer interaction and connectivity. And finally, regarding our municipal business, we have over 400 contracts with approximately $200 million in annual revenue that now use an alternative index for their annual price adjustment. All of these revenue enhancing initiatives are designed to improve the customer experience and further differentiate our services from the competition, which adds value to our offering, builds customer loyalty, and increases willingness to pay. Importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these initiatives as evidenced by our fourth straight quarter of sequential pricing improvement and highest level of reported average yield since 2009. Regarding our fleet, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 71% of our fleet is currently automated, and 74% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program. Turning to our recycling business. We remain focused on converting to a fee-based model with a more equitable commodity revenue sharing mechanism. This allows us to recover our costs and earn a reasonable return on capital deployed while reducing earnings volatility from fluctuating recycle commodity prices. We\u2019ve advanced this initiative and are making progress. For example, we met with most of our municipal customers whose processing contracts are coming to term in the next 24 months. We are educating them on the economics of recycling and the need to transition to a more durable model. To give you some context on why this is achievable, we recently were successful in transitioning one of our largest municipal recycling contracts to a fee based processing model. This customer values our recycling services and wants to ensure the viability of recycling for their community. Additionally, we remain purposeful when renewing existing contracts or considering new business opportunities. In situations where the customer is unwilling to consider more equitable terms, we are simply choosing not to participate. It will take time to realize the full impact of our efforts since most of our recycle business is performed on behalf of municipal customers under multi-year contracts. But we remain committed since recycling is a core component of our business. We believe that improving the profitability of recycling ensures its sustainability, which benefits the environment, our shareholders, our customers, and the communities we serve. Chuck will now discuss the financial results. Chuck Serianni : Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $76 million prior year. This 3.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions 2.4%. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield growth of 2.5%, average yield in the collection business was 3.2%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business, 4.4% yield in the large container industrial business and 1.6% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1%. Core price, which measures price increases that are rollbacks, was 3.6%. Core price consisted of 4.7% in the open market and 1.8% in the restricted portion of our business. Second, our volume increased 60 basis points year-over-year. The collection business increased 1.1%, which includes positive contribution from the industrial business of 2.5% and the residential business of 1%. The commercial business was flat with the prior year. Our commercial volume performance includes 40 basis point decline from non-regrettable losses of select national accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, decreased 1.1%. Landfill decreased 1%, which includes positive MSW volumes of 3.3% and C&D at 6.2%, offset by a decline in special waste volumes of 6.7%. Approximately half of the decline in landfill special waste relates to events driven jobs and the rest of the decline relates to a same-store E&P volumes. It should be noted that we had very tough comparison in the prior year since we accepted a record level of special waste in the third quarter of 2014. Now, fuel recovery fees decreased, next, fuel recovery fees decreased by 150 basis points. The change relates to the decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $35 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.63 in the third quarter from $3.84 in the prior year, a decrease of 31%. The current average diesel price is $2.50 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs to our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in annual operating income. Finally, commodity revenue decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 15% to an average price of $99 per ton in the third quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $96 per ton. Third quarter recycling volume of 673,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 20% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 5% primarily due to an increase in lower margin compost sales. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat to the prior year. Now I will discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1%, which was consistent with the prior year. Margin expansion in the solid waste business of 50 basis points was offset by the impact of recent acquisitions of 30 basis points and lower recycle commodity prices of 20 basis points. The 50 basis point expansion in the solid waste business consisted of lower fuel costs of 50 basis points and price in excess of cost inflation of 20 basis points, which was partially offset by a change in business mix of 20 basis points. The change in business mix results from volume growth in our collection business offset by volume declines in our higher-margin landfill business. The change in landfill volumes exclusively relates to decline in special waste tons. During the quarter, we saw margin expansion in all of our solid waste lines of business with the exception of landfill. Given the fixed cost nature of the landfill business, a decrease in volume generally results in a decline in margin. When looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fee in sale of recycle commodity revenue. For example, the 2.1% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 30 basis points, repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points, and SG&A expense of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Third-quarter 2015 interest expense was $92 million, which includes $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 38.6% in the third quarter and 38.1% on a year-to-date basis. During the quarter, we reported an insurance recovery of $50 million or $0.08 of EPS related to our closed Bridgeton landfill. We removed this benefit from our adjusted EPS performance for the quarter and full-year financial guidance. Now, I will turn the call back over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Chuck. Before closing, I would like to discuss the 2016 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release. We are currently midway through our annual planning process and based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions, we project the following. EPS of $2.13 to $2.17, which includes a $0.03 headwind from a non-cash increase in our effective tax rate. If you exclude the tax rate headwind, EPS would be projected at $2.16 to $2.20 or 6% to 8% growth from the midpoint of our 2015 EPS guidance. Adjusted free cash flow of $790 million to $810 million. This represents 8% to 10% growth over the midpoint of our 2015 free cash flow guidance. I want to remind you that approximately 30% of our revenue is restricted based on CPI. Given the low CPI and low recycled commodity price environment, we believe our projected earnings and free cash flow growth is strong and reflects the benefits our strategic initiatives are delivering to offset headwinds that are outside of our control. Consistent with prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February 2016. To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. As a result of improving fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, we expanded solid waste margins by simultaneously growing price and volume. We made meaningful progress on structurally changing recycling contracts and the use of alternative indices in our municipal customers. Generated earnings and free cash flow growth keeping us well-positioned to achieve our full-year 2015 financial guidance. And added $900 million to our existing share repurchase authorization demonstrating our commitment to increase cash returns to shareholders. As we look forward, we expect this positive momentum to continue into 2016. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders including our customers, our communities, employees, and of course, our owners. We will remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. At this time, operator, we will open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, speakers our first question is from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Al Kaschalk : I want to just focus on the volume collection story. I think 1.1 in the quarter, 0.6 volume I think overall reported. How is that trending in terms of \u201916? Not so much from a guidance standpoint but just from an end market, tough comps, easy comps, because what was very clear is that your residential side was up at least it was positive. I can\u2019t say so much for your largest competitor on that front. Don Slager : Before we, I\u2019ll give you a little flavor for \u201916. Of course, we\u2019re not going to give guidance. But first for \u201915 for the quarter, it was good volume growth. Remember there were a couple of issues in that. One is the year-over-year comp on special waste. Last year, as Chuck said, in Q3 we had a record special waste quarter so still had a strong quarter in special waste in 2015 and the pipeline is still robust just had a tough comp there. And also we said in the comments, we kind of walked away from some business. It\u2019s a non-regrettable losses in around national accounts and some our broker portfolio, so that was an up size event in the quarter of this year. So we frankly look at our volumes in C&D and in our large container perm business, the manufacturing business. As we said, as we roll to the year sequentially, we see the growth come down just because the comps got tougher but we still saw plus 2% growth in those lines. And as we\u2019ve said all along, our growth is heavily dependent on household starts. Good special waste flow, good construction business leads to business formation and more broad recovery. So for 2016, we\u2019re expecting positive growth to continue and of course when you look at our year-over-year guidance that we did provide, our preliminary outlook of pretty strong cash flow growth, you can hopefully see that we expect that trend to continue in \u201916 for us. Al Kaschalk : Great. And then if I may, my follow-up. I couldn\u2019t help but to notice on the expense side of things, maintenance and repairs up as a percentage of revenue, I think 60 basis points, year-to-date up above 40 relative comparable period. So is there anything going on there in terms of with automation related maintenance, sort of this integration of the trucks? Are there any operational issues that are coming, inefficiencies that maybe spiked that a little bit, at least on a relative analysis? Don Slager : No, I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s any kind of inefficiencies. Let me explain it this way. You\u2019re right. The maintenance costs increase year over year about 60 basis points. So as we think about that, about 20 basis points relates to the reduction in the fuel recovery fee in the commodity revenue. About 10 basis points is the mix of business that I discussed earlier, so that\u2019s the higher collection portion of the business and the lower landfill business. And about another 20 basis points then is increasing complexity associated with the fleet, which we\u2019ve been talking about for a while now. And so keep in mind, we\u2019re about 75%, 74% certified on our One Fleet initiative. We are closer to 90% actually rolled out that last sort of 15% hasn\u2019t been certified yet. We\u2019ll have One Fleet completed mid next year and start to realize all those benefits. As we said, we\u2019re beginning to very methodically extend the useful life of the fleet. We\u2019ll do that over the next, continue to do that over the next three or four years. So we\u2019re very happy with our fleet initiative as it\u2019s paying off. We think we\u2019re going to have the most reliable fleet in the industry here. By the time we roll this One Fleet completely out next year, and we\u2019ll be well-positioned to deal with the fleet complicity issues as they come. So and again really the issue in the margin is the mix stuff that Chuck described. Chuck Serianni : And Al, a good portion of that complexity is really the compliance with the new emission standards that really began in 2008, and there\u2019s been a couple of generations of those engines but as you add more of those engines post 2008 and you have to comply with those enhanced emissions control, that\u2019s basically what we're talking about with enhanced complexity. Al Kaschalk : So that should start to ease off the burden, I should say should start to see less of an impact, I guess? Don Slager : Yes. And then of course there is an impact, there\u2019s a cost impact while your rolling out One Fleet change, right, and when everyone is certified and running under the new standards, then we\u2019ll get to bow [ph] away the costs when that starts to dissipate and go away as well. Operator : Thank you. Scott Levine, Imperial Capital. Your line is now open. Scott Levine : I think, Don, you mentioned an improvement in churn is kind of a factor behind the improvement in yield there. Wondering if that\u2019s indicative of a broad trend, you\u2019re seeing momentum, just a little bit more color with regard to that aspect as the yield figures continue to surprise the upside this year. Don Slager : Well first of all, everything we\u2019ve been doing around the tools we\u2019ve talked about, right. We\u2019ve talked about rolling Capture out, which is our cloud-based tool, and our tighter sales force now is using the Capture tool, so we\u2019ve got as we said, the goal there was to get much better control at the point-of-sale in the decision-making process. Also making that sales team more efficient and effective. The PBS training, we've talked about extensively. Really targeting more successfully customers that have more willingness to pay and have more sort of interest in value. That's all happening. We're actually going out with a little more price because we think the customer base is willing to take it and we frankly think our service levels have increased. Through fleet reliability, lowering turnover, improving customer commitments, and so on and so forth. So we think all of that happening from the efforts that we're undertaking as well as, frankly, the markets rational and there is some positive growth in the market and even the more irrational smaller competitors tend to be more rational when there is some positive organic growth. So I think all of that together is giving us a better answer in churn but we think certainly some of it is based on the efforts we've made to be more focused in that area. Scott Levine : Got it. And then as the follow-up, I guess, you talked about special waste being a negative here, I guess a portion of that is the weakness in the energy services in Tervita, and a portion of it maybe is kind of the more traditional special waste business. Can you elaborate further as to maybe the profitability and how that might compare in the MSW side of your landfill business, and should we expect that non-energy portion to come back in the fourth quarter? Or might that continue? Maybe a little bit more elaborate in the energy, or I'm sorry, the special waste pipeline in general. Don Slager : Let separate the two. Let me first start by saying that the E&P business is 1% of our revenue. Okay, so that's really not the tail that's wagging the dog here. Our special waste year-over-year comp was tough because our \u201814 special waste was a banner year. But we still had a very good a quarter in special waste. We've got a full pipeline. So our special waste sales team is very confident that we're not seeing a slowdown there. So we think that special waste is good. As far as E&P goes, you read the papers, right, so I don't know that we're going to have a big recovery in Q4. There are -- we're hearing bits and pieces of good news and some new wells being drilled and so forth out there, but I think we'd like to believe it gets a little better from here. But again, it's a very small part of our business. So that's really not the headline, Scott. Scott Levine : Got it. So with regard to the volume trajectory here in the fourth quarter, not asking for explicit volume guidance but special waste it sounds like expect a continuation from Q3 and then trends in the traditional business should be healthy with a good pipeline? Don Slager : Yes. So what we're seeing right now, Scott, is probably volume growth of about 1% for the year. Scott Levine : Got it. Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you, speakers our next question is from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Your line is now open. Corey Greendale : I was thinking about the trajectory on yields so understand CPI has a headwind next year but you've got more volume in the market which helps and you've got the full year of your priority based selling so can you just help us think through of how you're thinking about what yield looks like next year? Don Slager : Yes. So, we're not going to give you yield guidance. Let me start by saying this. You know what portion of our portfolio is based on CPI. We're going to have a headwind just on CPI alone next year, year-over-year of about $0.04. Okay? We're going to overcome that headwind because of all the other things that we're doing in the business. We talked about all of the other issues that we're doing around priority based selling, Capture, all the rest of it, and again, we think volume will continue to be decent in 2016. So I can't give you much more toward \u201816 than that. We're going to give you detailed guidance in February. Just think about that overcoming CPI with about a $0.04 headwind but still a pretty strong EPS performance in that range I gave. Corey Greendale : Hey and then this is also sort of a guidance question so hopefully you can answer this one. But first of all, the 2015 guidance, you raised the cash flow from OPS guidance. What's driving that? And then related to that, the 2016 the free cash flow guidance, growth is above the high end of EPS guidance growth. Can you just talk about what's driving that, if it's CapEx or working capital or cash taxes or something? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, hey Corey, this is Brian. So if you kind of take a look, there's kind of a little bit of a push and pull there so we are anticipating spending a little bit less on cash taxes in 2015, and that was offset by a slight increase in capital spending and the two basically offset each other. Corey Greendale : Okay. Then for 2016 is the fact that free cash flow growth is expected to be higher than EPS growth, is that driven by cash taxes or CapEx? Brian DelGhiaccio : It is. It's actually being driven by bonus depreciation. So you get less of a reversal than in 2015, excuse me, in 2016 than we did in 2015. Corey Greendale : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you speakers our next question is from Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Alex Ovshey : Couple of one\u2019s for you. So first on the shift of customers from CPI to alternative indices, so that\u2019s $200 million now. I forget exactly over what time period that is. It sounds like about a year. Is that the sort of peace we should be thinking about? The goal is about $200 million per annum in terms of shifting from CPI? And just on that $200 million, that debt shift, out of the gate, what sort of impact does that have on pricing? Chuck Serianni : So Alex, it\u2019s probably a little bit too early to still unfortunately to give you a cadence because again as you can appreciate, some of this depends on the size of the contracts that are coming to term, it depends on how frequently we\u2019re opening contracts in the mid-term of a contract. Many of these changes have happened while the contract is still in place for the opening contracts for other reasons, things like service increased levels and those kind of things. So it\u2019s going to depend on that pace. It\u2019s also going to depend on basically frankly the market at large and how broadly it\u2019s accepted. I think we proved in that it can happen and we started this a little over a year ago in earnest. And so we\u2019re real happy with the progress. This $200 million is remember on that $800 million municipal vertical and so we\u2019re call it a fourth of the way through that. And then we\u2019ll be tackling some of the larger contracts that are in that other $1 billion plus of municipal business. At the same time, of course, we\u2019re tackling the recycling fees. So there\u2019s a lot of conversation happening with municipal customers, but we think we\u2019re making good progress and we\u2019ll just keep informing you as we go and we\u2019ll be baking we think that trend is into our guidance and we have got it baked into what that preliminary outlook is for 2016 currently. Alex Ovshey : Got it. And on the recycling side, can you elaborate a little bit more what a fee-based model is. Is that essentially getting paid for the service and then only sharing in profits on top of what the actual cost to profit the material is? Don Slager : That\u2019s it. If you\u2019re looking for a job, we can put you right on the front line convincing those customers just like you just did, right. So we need to have our cost of capital covered in the fee based. It basically is a more fair value sharing arrangement. It gives the municipality much more upside. It certainly drives them to produce a better quality volume, right, less contaminate which is important to the overall value of the material when we sell it. And it just can put excess from downside. But as I said in my comments, municipalities that we want to recycle, they want real sustainability. They want the durability of a program for the consumer base, for their ratepayers and this is a fair way to do it. So we made a pretty major switch in one of our largest if not the largest contract we have, and that\u2019s a good place to start. And we\u2019ll continue to work through the system as we go forward. Alex Ovshey : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And just two quick ones from me. In terms of industrial volume, a lot of talk about parts of the industrial economy that are weakened. Obviously, some way, shape, or form it\u2019s related to energy, and not direct energy has softened. So anything you guys see in the industrial vertical that gives you pause around volumes looking forward? Don Slager : No, not today. I think again we\u2019ve got continuing in our overall business, strong price in industrial, we call industrial perm, which is in container manufacturing, strong price and volume, over 5% price in our temp which is our construction part of that large container vertical. You probably see a little less activity in some of those economies, local economies where energy was booming. There\u2019s certainly less infrastructure being developed than there was a year ago. That was a good headline story as we came out of the rut. But the rest of the country is holding up really well. So those are pretty broad-based numbers. Alex Ovshey : Got it. Okay Don. Thank you very much. I will turn it over. Don Slager : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Joe Box with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Joe Box : So you picked up 4.7% core price in your open markets, which looks pretty solid to me. I\u2019m just curious how you guys feel about your price position in those open markets. Are you meaningfully above the market? Are you in line? I guess what I'm trying to understand is if you have the ability to raise your pricing at a similar trajectory or even higher next year to offset that $0.04 CPI headwind. Don Slager : The open market has consistently performed for us over the last couple of years, and we\u2019ll continue to test the market, Joe. With the tools we have now, as you know, we can somewhat control the pricing activity, the price increase activity here from the corporate center using a process that we internally call RPM. So every month we\u2019re looking at a portion of the customer base. It give us the ability to try to understand what price elasticity looks like in a given market. It allows us to put out an offer accordingly. We will continue to use that process of service pretty well. So what we think the pricing for next year is baked into the preliminary outlook we provided. Again, we'll give you a much more detail on that in February. But all systems seem to be go and the tools are working. The systems in place are working. The broader market is holding up well. The open market is performing well for us. As I said, a pretty rational market overall. Those are the things we need to see and as I said so many times, as long as organic growth continues, even the smaller callers tend to have more rational behavior around pricing when they're getting some measure of organic growth. So, those will continue. I think next year will shape up pretty well for us. Joe Box : Understood. Thanks. And actually just a follow-up on pricing. Maybe just your current picture. You mentioned earlier a step-up in price just for your service overall. I'm curious if that's across-the-board or is it more concentrated in any particular business? Don Slager : Well I think it's pretty strong overall. Again, I just said we got 5% price in our 10th business which is construction. That's pretty strong and open market small container is probably frankly one of our strongest. So yes, there's no one market that stands out as, no one part of the country that stands out in my mind as doing much better than any other part. It's pretty broad based which to me gives me a lot of confidence. Joe Box : Got it. One quick follow-up, if you don't mind. Just relative to the free cash flow guidance for next year, do you guys have any CapEx savings baked into from One Fleet or is that more of a 2017 type item? Chuck Serianni : No. Absolutely. We've got One Fleet CapEx savings baked in of about $40 million, which is consistent with the savings that we saw in 2015. Keep in mind that what we talk about in terms of One Fleet is $200 million of savings that we're going to realize over the course of the next four or five years or so. Operator : Thank you speakers our next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is now open. Michael Hoffman : Let me follow-up on the free cash just so I haven't actually confused myself listening to all the questions and answers. If I understood Chuck's comment, there will be less cash tax paid because BD winds down incrementally and will you in fact spend less in absolute dollars in capital spending? Don Slager : No. Chuck Serianni : No. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So there's no benefit to capital spending in free cash flow, if I wind is back, if it's 8 at the midpoint, I can walk it back to ex, the cash tax issue its 5.6 from good old operations? That's a way to think about it. So there's free cash flow growth driven by the underlying business ex the cash tax. Chuck Serianni : Absolutely, Michael. Don Slager : You said it, Michael. Michael Hoffman : All right. That's what I wanted to make sure I understood. And then the churn comment I thought was interesting because -- am I wrong in thinking that churn has -- there's all kinds of interesting knock on consequences when churn is coming on and whether what is driving it down or things that happen as a result of being driven down. One of the biggest meaningful issues is that you don't have so many missed stops and missed stops are about the fleet breaking down, and so while we may see R&M up and everybody is wringing their hands about it, it clearly has introduced a more reliable fleet which just helps to lower the missed stops and all of those things that happen. Is that right? Don Slager : That is right. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Don Slager : We said it at the very beginning when we launched One Fleet. We are a fleet-based operation. We are the eighth largest location fleet in the nation. Whatever it is, 75% of our revenue comes from our collection business. And we make our money with trucks and very important that we have total fleet reliability. One Fleet has been about that, improving reliability in the fleet which we think improves employee engagement. It improves driver turnover. It improves service levels. It improves our brand on the street. And so on and so on and so on. It affects everything we do. So that's why we poured ourselves into One Fleet. It also allows us to methodically extend useful life of the fleet. Again which now we're second year in a row, now we're taking benefit in doing that. Again, very methodically over a four to five year period. Not just flipping a switch but with a better fleet overall. So yes, it runs through the organization. Again, churn is the difference in revenue per unit between gained and lost business. Michael Hoffman : Right. Don Slager : That's simple, right? So we're also selling new business at a higher rate than we were last year. So if you signed up with us last year, you would maybe pay the slightly lower rate per unit and now we're selling more value where you're paying a higher rate per unit. So we watch that as well. So we\u2019re addressing it fundamentally in the operations through being a better service provider, creating a better customer experience, and we're doing it through our sales efforts and all of our tools and then sort of our centralized controls on RPM, et cetera. All those things got to work together to really drive churn in the right direction. Again as I said, the fact that the market is rational and there's organic growth, that certainly helps our cause. Michael Hoffman : Right. And the other secondary benefit of that is all of those service issues, everybody is happier, coupled with good volume, underlying good volume in the market means you are keeping more of the price you are going to the market with. That\u2019s\u2026 Don Slager : That\u2019s absolutely right. We\u2019re going out with higher prices to the customer and a rollbacks are less. So we are keeping a higher percentage of a higher number. And again, it\u2019s a big business with a lot of moving parts and we\u2019ve got to do a lot of things right every day but all those efforts are showing up in churn. Michael Hoffman : Right. Okay. So I\u2019ve always thought of garbage as evolutionary, not revolutionary. The evolution here is the steady reliable improving trend in the right direction. Don Slager : There you go. Michael Hoffman : Okay. One thing. Special waste, I get the comp in the third quarter. Is there a rollover of any of that into the fourth quarter? So I\u2019m just thinking about how to gauge my year-over-year trend. Chuck Serianni : No. I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s as much rollover. We heard that some of the jobs that were scheduled to take place in the third quarter might have gotten pushed but we\u2019re thinking that they\u2019re probably more pushed into the first and second quarters of next year. So I would say, Michael, there\u2019s not a lot of rollover into the fourth quarter this year. Don Slager : But the fourth quarter comp for us is maybe a little tougher than norm to your point. We had this record year in Q3 last year. We had a pretty strong Q4 in special waste last year. But then normalizes after that. Michael Hoffman : Got it. Don Slager : The report in from the sales team is not that the pipeline is drying up, just that we probably gave them too big of a goal. Last year, we had this record year so we tend to put the goals out there, but we still feel pretty confident that the special waste is not drying up. It\u2019s continuing and next year\u2019s trend will be pretty solid. Michael Hoffman : And to hit the 1% for the full year, 4Q would be up sequentially. It has to be. Chuck Serianni : Or relatively consistent with, Michael. Michael Hoffman : Okay. All right. Thanks. Chuck Serianni : You bet Michael. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question is Tony Bancroft with Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open. Tony Bancroft : Taking into account all that you had in your prepared comments regarding the recycling and the answers you gave in the previous questions, can you still give us sort of a give me an overall what's like a realistic long-term goal for the percent switchover? I mean is it 100%, is it 50%, can you give me, what\u2019s the appetite for or the attitude of a customer in that capacity? Don Slager : If all of our customers are listening in all of my sales organization is listening, the long-term goal is 100%. Because frankly, again, you can\u2019t have a business model that doesn\u2019t return your cost to capital. Okay. And our recycling business today is improving because we\u2019re improving operating costs. Because we\u2019re shutting facilities. We\u2019re actually investing in some facilities where we have good public/private partnerships who are willing to pay for recycling. But we\u2019re going to change the model because we\u2019ve got this macro thing going on with China. We don\u2019t how long it\u2019s going to last but that\u2019s the new norm. We can\u2019t live in that norm. We\u2019ve got to live in a different world and that\u2019s the conversation we had with a large customer that we described. So that gives me great hope that we can do it. We certainly have the appetite to do it and we\u2019re not going to have a business that doesn\u2019t return its cost to capital and give us good earnings results. On the new indices, it\u2019s the same thing. A $0.04 headwind next year because CPI is going to knock us on our can so we can\u2019t live that way. We have about $0.03 for every dollar of revenue around here goes to pay people, right. We are a people intensive business. We are a capital intensive business and got to replace truck\u2019s containers, got to pay your people well if you want to attract the best people, and those people expect earnings increases and the last I checked healthcare is not getting cheaper, right, so CPI doesn\u2019t cut it. If you are a business owner out there and you\u2019re willing to live with 0.5% price increases in your contracts, you\u2019re going to be sad by the time you get to the fifth year of your contract. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been living through. So we\u2019ve found other ways around it now. We finally said enough is enough last year and we started to move the index out and a lot of people said it couldn\u2019t be done. The market wouldn\u2019t go for it. We now have got 25% of that market vertical converted. And we\u2019re not stopping there. It\u2019s just a matter of the pace. And again, we\u2019re going to make the appropriate returns for our owners in this business. We don\u2019t have to haul everybody\u2019s garbage. We just have to haul garbage for people that want good quality service for a fair price. Tony Bancroft : And then switching over to M&A for the back end of the year here. Could you go through maybe what the pipeline mix might be? I know that you said E&P is obviously only a small part of the business but what that would potentially be and then in the traditional solid waste side. Don Slager : Most of it. Most of it\u2019s going to be traditional solid waste. Some of those tuck-ins come with a little bit of recycling along with them, so we take that along with it. There may be in the NPS at out there two. If you could buy it right now but everyone is scared of it. We still think it's a good business through the cycle. We think it's going to come back over time and we're going to be happy with it but like the assets we own, like the people that we have in that business. We'll be selective but there might be a little bit of that. Again, that's not going to be the headline, Tony. The tuck-ins in the solid waste business come with very low risk, very high return. Again, as I said, low multiples net of synergy and our ability to integrate those is very, very quick. So we go from purchase date to with 120 days basically collecting the money and seeing the synergy benefits. So that's where we're going to play. Tony Bancroft : Right, and then just in that solid waste side, any potential $75 million ones like larger tuck-in or are they all going to be sort of small? Don Slager : No, we don't see them on the horizon right now. There's really nothing out there that's really of that size that's interesting. They tend to be very small. But as we always say as a qualifier, we try to maintain a very flexible financial position. Even with this new upsized stock authorization we got from our Board. We have the flexibility to buy a little more if we want and if something of size comes on the market, we'll be able to take a good strong look at it. Tony Bancroft : Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : [Technical difficulty] Our next question is from Charles Carter from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Charles Carter : Good afternoon. Chuck, to go back to comments about kind of the solid waste margin expansion of 50 bps year-over-year, you said there was also a 20 basis point headwind from recycling, and then I think you also pointed out a 30 basis point headwind from, I didn't catch that one. A - Chuck Serianni. Yes, so the 30 basis point headwind in addition to that was from recent acquisitions including integration costs associated with those acquisitions. Charles Carter : Okay. And then, are you able to parse out what Tervita did? How that factored into the margin? Chuck Serianni : Yes, so when we think about that 30 basis points I just talked about, I would say the majority of that is Tervita. Charles Carter : Okay. Thank you. And then my next question is, given where diesel prices are, fuel and kind of the sub $50 per barrel oil environment we're in, is this kind of altering your CNG investments at all? Or how is that changing things in 2016 versus say 2015? Don Slager : You will see it's just like we did in \u201815. We geared more of our purchase around CNG vehicles to facilities that we already had made the infrastructure investment in, right? So the goal is once the infrastructure is in place to convert the entire fleet at that local division to CNG. We saw less investment in new infrastructure around CNG in \u201815 and \u201814. We're still going through that calculation in \u201816 but we think CNG still is an overall sort of good investment. Remember, we are only converting to CNG for our replacement vehicles. We've got to buy whatever it is, 1,000 trucks a year as the old ones roll off, and we're replacing those in some cases with CNG. So we\u2019re not going out and accelerating our fleet purchases just because natural gas is a good deal. So we like almost everything else we do, we sometimes get criticized for kind of taking the slow play on it but very slow, methodical, logical, and as the market shift moves, we think overall that's the right approach and you'll see more of that in CNG next year and we've taken some parts [ph] to recycling. We never jumped all in with both feet. We just kind of moved forward in the recycling business in a methodical way. Charles Carter : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have questions today. I will now turn the call back to Don Slager for any closing remarks. Don Slager : Well, thank you, Tori. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, their commitment, and of course all your dedication and excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you for spending time with us today. Have a good evening, and be safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Republic Services conference call for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences, when events are scheduled, the dates, times, and presentations are posted on our Web site. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Don Slager : Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which exceeded the upper-end of our financial guidance. As a result of successfully executing our strategy, the Republic team delivered higher levels of pricing, reported positive volumes, grew earnings and free cash flow, improved return on invested capital and increased cash returns to shareholders. During 2015, we made significant progress on our multi-year strategic initiatives. These initiatives are designed to profitable grow our business, enhance the quality of our revenue, improve the customer experience and reduce costs. Regarding our market position, we invested $193 million in tuck-in acquisitions, nearly 2 times our original goal. The transactions completed in 2015 represent annual revenue contribution of approximately $143 million at a post synergy EBITDA multiple of 4.3 times. And we acquired U.S. assets of Tervita, these assets serve as a platform acquisition in the E&P waste sector, with attractive long-term fundamentals and opportunities for future growth. Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our Capture cloud-based pricing tool. And our entire salesforce has been trained on priority-based selling. Our sales program is designed to identify and to track customers that are willing to pay for our higher value service offerings. Additionally, we now have over 500 contracts with approximately $250 million in annual revenue that use a waste-related index for annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and had consistently run higher than CPI. Most importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these revenue enhancing initiatives. During 2015, we reported our highest level of average yield in over five years. Regarding our customers, we continue to see very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform. For example, approximately 1.2 million customers have enrolled in My Resource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity. And we launched click-to-buy capabilities in approximately 50% of our residential subscription markets. Click-to-buy addresses the evolving needs of our customers\u2019 buying preferences and provides a lower cost sales channel. Our customers see the difference in our products and services, which is reflected in our customer satisfaction metrics. Our Net Promoter score, which measures customers\u2019 willingness to recommend Company\u2019s products and services improved for the third year in a row. And finally, regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operate on natural gas, 72% of our residential fleet is currently automated and 78% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program, up from 60% a year ago. These initiatives require investment, but the payback is compelling and our financial performance reflects the benefits we are seeing. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50, which exceeded our expectations. Full year adjusted EPS was $2.06 and adjusted free cash flow was $830 million both exceeded the upper-end of our guidance. Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.4% and average yield was 2.2%. Average yield exceeded 2% in every quarter during 2015. Fourth quarter volumes increased 90 basis points this is the 11th consecutive quarter where we have grown price and volumes simultaneously. We returned $808 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during 2015. This includes approximately 10 million shares repurchased for 409 million. We finished the year with total shareholder return of 12.4%, which includes stock appreciation of 9.3% and dividends of 3.1%. Our TSR performance exceeded the S&P 500 average by over 8 times. We made substantial progress in 2015 and are proud of our strong results and many accomplishments, but we have more to do. Last month, we announced the realignment of our organizational structure by combining two layers into one. This included the elimination of our three regions, the consolidation of 20 areas into 10 and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We are reinvesting back into our 10 area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles which puts resources closer to our business and our customers. Additionally, we are investing in our customer service capabilities and are in the process of consolidating over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers. The new state-of-the-art facilities and technology will enable better levels of customer service across several touch points including voice, email, text, social and live chat. The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making in our customer focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. Our ability to make these organizational changes is a natural evolution and logical next step for our Company. As a result of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls, we are further leveraging our scale to continually improve our service offerings. Additionally, we are able to maintain our high performance business culture with field management retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility. We call this approach the Republic Way, which we believe is the best way to create durable operational excellence and lasting value for all our stakeholders. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck? Chuck Serianni : Thanks Don. Fourth quarter 2015 revenue was approximately 2.3 billion, an increase of 61 million over the prior year. This 2.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 90 basis points and acquisitions of 1.8%. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield growth of 2.2%; average yield in the Collection business was 2.7%, which includes 3.1% yield in the Small Container Commercial business, 3.8% yield in the Large Container Industrial business and 1.5% yield in the Residential business. Average yield in the Post-Collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1.5%. Core price which measures price increases net of roll backs was 3.4%; core price consisted of 4.4% in the open market and 1.7% in the restricted portion of our business. Second, our volumes increased 90 basis points year-over-year; the Collection business increased 90 basis points, which includes positive contribution from the Large Container Industrial business of 2.8% and the Residential business of 40 basis points. The Small Container Commercial business was flat with the prior year. Our Small Container Commercial volume included a 40 basis point decline from non-regrettable losses of select national accounts and work performed on behalf of brokers. The Post-Collection business made up of third-party landfill in transfer station volumes increased 1.8%; landfill increased 2.1% which includes positive MSW volumes of 5.5% and C&D of 8.2%, offset by a decline in Special Waste volumes of 2.1%. The decline in Special Waste relates to same-store E&P volumes. Special Waste volumes excluding E&P waste streams increased 1%. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 170 basis points, the change relates to a decline in the cost of fuel which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.44 in the fourth quarter from $3.57 in the prior year, a decrease of 32%. The current average diesel price is $2.01 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost through our Fuel Recovery Fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to the decrease in recycled commodity prices. Average commodity prices for all materials at our recycling facilities decreased 16% to an average price of $95 per tonne in the fourth quarter from $113 per tonne in the prior year. Excluding glass and organics average commodity prices decreased 14% to an average price of $108 per tonne in the fourth quarter from a $126 per tonne in the prior year. We believe excluding glass and organics is a better way to report average commodity prices, since they are low value waste streams and can skew the average price per tonne. Our sensitivity to changing commodity prices has always excluded the impact from glass and organics. Again I want to remind you that a $10 per tonne move in recycling commodity prices results a $0.03 annual EPS impact. On our Web site we posted the three year history of average commodity prices including and excluding glass and organics. Fourth quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tonnes, represents the increase of approximately 14% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 3%. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was relatively flat with the prior year. Now I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.2%, which was down 80 basis points from the prior year. The change included a 50 basis point increase in SG&A expenses, primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation and investments and initiatives. And a 30 basis point decline in EBITDA margin from lower recycle commodity prices. With respect to higher SG&A costs, the increased incentive compensation expense was due to financial outperformance during 2015. I also want to remind you that we expect the cost savings from the realignment to offset the investments in initiatives beginning in Q1, 2016. On a full year basis EBITDA margin was 28.1%, an improvement of 10 basis points over the prior year. Margin expansion in the Solid Waste business of 90 basis points primarily due to lower fuel costs and pricing in excess of cost inflation, which partially offset by the impact of acquisition of 40 basis points and lower recycled commodity prices of 40 basis points, when looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees and the sale of recycled commodity revenue. For example, the 2.2% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 40 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Fourth quarter 2015 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 34.3% in the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the year. In 2016, we expect to return to our statutory effective tax rate of approximately 39.5%. The increase in our tax rate resulted in $0.08 EPS headwind in 2016. Full year adjusted free cash flow was $813 million. This performance includes a cash tax benefit from the extension of bonus depreciation of approximately $65 million. We expect bonus depreciation will provide a cash tax benefit of $30 million in 2016 resulting in a $35 million year-over-year cash tax headwind. Now I will turn the call back to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Chuck. Before I open the call up for questions, I will provide our 2016 financial guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.13 to $2.17, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided last October. This continues to demonstrate the stability and predictability of our business. Our expected performance represents high single-digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.08 headwind from the increase in our effective tax rate. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of 820 million to 840 million, which was upwardly revised from our preliminary outlook due to the extension of bonus depreciation. This performance represents mid to high single-digit growth after excluding the change in cash taxes. We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3%, which includes average yield of approximately 2%. We believe this level of pricing is strong given the 30 basis point headwind from lowest CPI-based presets. Volume growth in a range of 1.5% to 1%, we expect our volume trajectory to be relatively consistent with our full year 2015 performance, with the exception of residential due to known contract losses. Residential volumes are expected to be slightly negative. Contribution from acquisitions of 1%, this relates primarily to tuck-in acquisitions and the rollover impact from 2015 transactions. And a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1%, due to lower diesel prices. We anticipate an EBITDA margin of approximately 28.5%. This represents 40 basis points of margin expansion over our 2015 performance. 2016 net capital expenditures are expected to be $900 million or approximately 9.5% of revenue. This level of spending includes a $60 million benefit from cost effectively extending the useful life of our fleet, as a result of our One Fleet maintenance program. This is in addition to the $40 million of capital we saved during 2015. We anticipate investing $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions and we expect to return approximately $820 million of total cash to shareholders through $420 million of dividends and $400 million of share repurchases. I would like to thank the entire Republic team for their contribution that allowed us to meet our objectives and positioned us well for future growth. During 2016, we will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders and remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. At this time operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question today. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Al Kaschalk : I want to focus if I may on the volume guidance in particular I think broader thoughts for that the sector could grow about 1% to 2% in '16, maybe with some of these headwinds you are seeing in the broader economy that would have been a little bit too aggressive, but did you address the 50 basis points to 1% increase that you are looking forward in particular how large was the residential drop contracts that you lost? Don Slager : Well, it's actually a couple contracts right, so this is just normal in our business Al and let\u2019s focus on residential for a second. We have made a lot of noise around the fact that the residential business has been the weakest for some time, the residential business some of those contracts again have CPI resets which don\u2019t really work us for us over the long-term. We have been very good public private partners with our residential customers, and we ultimately need to have contracts that work for both parties and so we are booking a very strong approach, if you are trying to get these contracts switched to a new index which we only talked about doing that successfully. And there are some contracts frankly that just don\u2019t work for us and so we are going to continue to be focused on return on investments, so the residential business can be a little bit weaker in '16 as a result of that. And again there is -- we have got so many contracts in total do we have in residential contracts it is thousands of them right. So that\u2019s just the nature of the beast and that is going to be a little lumpy from year-to-year. The underlying economics we think are good, right. So you think about how we always talk about the fact that its population growth driving household formation and really is a critical metric in our business. If you look out at household formation it is strong, it prompts us to continue to remain strong as far as we are growing so that\u2019s good for us. The Special Waste business looks pretty solid that\u2019s a good indicator of a good economy and we have seen pretty consistent growth in even our landfill MSW business over the last year. I mean so I think we are in pretty good shape. You reported on the year 4 plus percent growth in MSW landfill which -- that is actually nice to have across the business. So we will continue to look for that and then with the capture tool and PBS we\u2019re being very selective about the kind of growth we\u2019re getting. And as I said in my remarks, that we are in the 11th straight quarter where we had both positive volume and pricing growth, and we think that\u2019s the magic where we get both end and we continue to get both end into the future and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused that\u2019s going to deliver the margin that\u2019s going to deliver the cash. Al Kaschalk : If you slice the volume overall and I guess my question is a little bit more macro driven. But historically we\u2019ve known that C&D has been a big beneficiary to the RSG/Allied network. How would you look that and say from either a manufacturing side, or what concerns should we think about and shareholders be aware of in terms of slower economy, what that may impact and in particular in what manufacturing verticals, how much are you exposed there? Don Slager : Well, first let\u2019s step back from all of that and remember, I mean we tend to lag right so when things go up and down we kind of lag a little bit. But when we talk about our Large Container Industrial perm business that\u2019s mostly construction, it's a large container tank. When we talk about industrial large container perm industrial is kind of a misnomer because that includes a lot of commercial retail business, a large multifamily office buildings, hospitals anything that requires large container. Only a portion of that perm large container business is truly industrial right. And we\u2019ve continued to see strong performance in that permanent business both price and volume. So we\u2019re not concerned about that segment of our business. Operator : Our next question is from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Ken Wang : This is Ken Wang on for Corey. So just thinking about the incentive comp increase that you mentioned and looking at the labor cost as well which looked like they were up about 6% year-on-year. Was the incentive comps increase something that also had an effect on labor cost, just given the increase? Don Slager : No, the incentive comp increase really occurred all in the SG&A line and that was due to the financial outperformance that we had during 2015. And obviously as we look at SG&A cost in 2016 we\u2019re not expecting that to repeat. Ken Wang : And then in terms of the labor cost being up 6%, what was the driver there? Don Slager : Sure, so keep in mind that 40 basis points of that is due to reduction in the fuel recovery fee and commodity revenue, so it is really revenue based and then the other 20% is really due to acquisitions. Ken Wang : Okay, that\u2019s helpful\u2026 Chuck Serianni : Yes, so Ken when you think about revenues, because you\u2019re just looking at the straight dollar increase. Don Slager : Is that right the 6% you\u2019re just taking a look at dollar-to-dollar is what you\u2019re looking at? Ken Wang : Yes, that\u2019s right. Don Slager : So I mean remember you got to think about there is normal inflation in the business and then when you think of on a full year basis when you look at our volumes, it's been heavily weighted to the Collection portion of our business. So there is a volume element to it. And then you have to look at the total amount of acquisitions that we\u2019ve completed during the year. Right so you add the three up together from the revenue perspective, because remember within the revenue you\u2019ve got the reduction from fuel recovery and fee and commodities, it does nothing to your labor cost. So you got to look at the revenue change exclusive of those and basically what you\u2019re seeing is a similar increase in labor expense, expressed as a percentage. Ken Wang : And just one quick follow-up, do you have any comments on any changes you\u2019ve seen in competitor behavior, anything you\u2019re seeing either from large competitors or small competitors? Don Slager : No, I would say really no change over what we saw at the end of last year. Generally speaking more broadly speaking, you know that we feel pretty good about sort of the rational behavior in the market generally. There is always A market or two, there is always a local competitor or two doing something, maybe making a bad decision or having debt -- actually they are making investment here and there. But overall, we\u2019re not concerned about it. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Levine of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Scott Levine : So, last year I think you lowered off of your preliminary guidance for 2015 due to recycled commodity prices dipping here you\u2019re affirming the guidance. Just kind of wondering any appreciable changes in any of the assumptions or drivers beneath the surface of your business from 3Q to 4Q? Or is it really kind of status quo and no meaningful change in any particular area here? Don Slager : No, actually there has been a change. I mean we look at our outlook and then look at our guidance right now. We\u2019ve got about a $0.04 decrease due to commodity prices, so pretty a significant decrease since we gave outlook. But we\u2019ve been able to offset that by lower fuel cost and also through other improvements in the business and that's what allowed us to keep our guidance consistent with our outlook that we provided in October. Scott Levine : And as a follow-up, in your capital allocation plan for '16 have you outstanding free cash by a bit here you've come off to pretty active years for M&A just looking for your confidence level maybe that you can continue this out spend free cash flow and then grow the dividend and then still remain comfortable with where your balance sheet leverage is? Chuck Serianni : Yes, we're very comfortable with the balance sheet leverage, so right now we're at 2.9 times, when we look at our capital allocation both in terms of dividend and share repurchase it\u2019s right in line with the free cash flow and they are still having the capacity that we need in order to pursue acquisition so we're very comfortable with the capital allocation strategy and very comfortable with being able to continue to increase our dividends in the future. Don Slager : Yes, Scott this is Don, as it relates to the M&A right, we can talk about the pipeline of tuck-ins, we've got a pretty good handle we think on what is out there as it relates to tuck-in opportunities, but these larger opportunities that really drove the over I'd say that over spending but it's like we spend more in M&A last year those are lumpy right, those come to the market once in a while, so we don't really see, we don't have visibility to any of those today as we look at '16. And again we're always focused on first and foremost the tuck-ins in our current markets in our core business and that's what gives us the better return and lower risk et cetera, but it's just that we always want to maintain right strength in our capital structure, so that if the right thing does come along for us we've got the flexibility so we're very focused on that. Operator : Our next question is from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hi Don, I want to talk about what I'm going to call your own idiosyncratic pricing story, so at this point, Capture has rolled out, everybody is through PDS, my resource has got increased penetration and I assume all of that would drive better customer loyalty. So given all that can you give us any metrics maybe even just directionally about maybe churn or spread between your lost business and going forward would we expect to see the gap between core price and average yield narrow? Don Slager : Well, let\u2019s backup, first of all right, it's a pretty big denominator right, so if we talk about taking the faction from 7% which it\u2019s been the faction have been at an all time double-digit high, in the past we've got it down to 9, 8, now 7 it's been consistently 7 for some time. Driving that down to 6 would be quite a feat but we're focused on extending customer loyalty and perhaps that the faction is really competitive the other half is what we call structural business to close and things move offshore et cetera. We are really-really focused in on the quality of services we're delivering to our customers through meeting our customer commitments which is internal metric and then also Net Promoter score which as I said in my comments we have improved the Net Promoter score every year for three years so -- and we're very-very active in trying to understand how our customers think about us and then we brought forward not only better quality of service delivery but a better way of doing business with us through our digital platform. So, all those things are driven to improve the customer experience and then on top of that the tool set you described around PDS, Capture and also frankly the improved CRM tool that our team uses today makes them one or more efficient, more effective but also helps them to get basically the price for new selling to improve. And that's what is happening with what we're seeing with price, with yield and with churn. That churn which is essentially the difference between business gained and business lost right the net difference has continued there to narrow, that has been a big part of our pricing story and we're going to continue to focus on that as we go through the years. The combination of all those things working towards, again extending the loyalty, reducing churn which ultimately means lower inflection and creating what we call internally rolling this effect right and then PDS is directing our sales teams at customers that we believe are in the segments that are more likely to buy value and less likely to be only priced customers. So, everything we've been talking about over the past couple of years is getting rolled out as we've been working for the greater good and it is reflected here in our best pricing ever in 2015 or in a long time it has been going on you know. And 11 straight quarters for both pricing and volume growth and as I said with another question, we're going to be focused on the right growth, right, targeted profitable unit growth. So, we're seeing it and then we're seeing market expansion, we're seeing good cash flow as a result, so that's as you called it what idiosyncratic right that is the word. Tyler Brown : Chuck do you want to understand a couple of the underlying assumptions in the guidance. So, first off are you guys assuming about a $10 decline in commodities, is that right? Chuck Serianni : A $10 from yes from what we actually saw in 2015, that\u2019s right. Tyler Brown : Okay, and then are you expecting Tervita to contribute more or less EBITDA? Chuck Serianni : It is going to be about the same, what we got is a little bit of a headwind associated with drilling activity and we are going to make that up through productivity gains and through the anniversarying of some integration costs. Tyler Brown : Okay. And then lastly just do you have specifically what you are kind of expecting for open versus restricted market pricing? Chuck Serianni : No, and you got to take a look at the performance Tyler I mean it's a similar level of performance in 2016 as we saw in 2015 with the exception of the step down in CPI-based pricing. But you can probably expect similar level of contribution. Tyler Brown : Okay all right that\u2019s perfect, thank you guys. Don Slager : And a subset of muni that we converted to a better index set right. Operator : Our next is from Jeff Volshteyn of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Volshteyn : When we look at your congressional funding for infrastructure that was surpassed last year, there is a fair amount of enthusiasm about new conversations and new projects in infrastructure. Does that impact -- I mean do you think about that market as potential opportunity for you, does that impact your business in over the next so let\u2019s say three to five years? Don Slager : It doesn\u2019t make a huge impact when you think about that infrastructure build funding roads and bridges. We do work for customers who build roads and bridges but that doesn\u2019t generate the same kind of waste volume that comes out of stack homes and multi-family homes and skyscrapers right. The weight that comes from building a site is not some things like expedition and point of concrete. But things like putting up starts and dry wall and permitting and installation and ripping those kinds of things generate waste for construction. So roads and bridges we have some containers at along some of these building sites but unfortunately for us we don\u2019t get to pull them very often. Jeff Volshteyn : Just a few clarifying questions, on the reorganizational announcement or restructuring what is the timing of it through 2016, are there certain quarters where it is going to be more impactful? Don Slager : Well let me start and I will let Chuck talk about how the numbers roll-in but reorganization is complete, right. So the reorganization is complete the organization is function under the new model and so basically we have the absolute lower cost of organization functioning today net of the onetime severances and relocations that some of the relocations have to occur over the next couple of months. Chuck Serianni : So what we are saying is that the savings that we are going to receive from the realignment. Will really start in February and that\u2019s about $20 million or so, that\u2019s going to be offset by additional investments and initiatives, primarily due to our customer resource centers. So that will be an offset within our P&L. We are also going to have about $35 million of restructuring charges, $25 million of that are associated with the realignment that Don just talked about, a lot of that should be frontend loaded so more towards Q1, Q2. And then about $10 million of that associated with the customer resource center, that\u2019s going to be more spread out through the year. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : I have the sense that solid waste\u2019s operating leverage is a little bit matched by similar noise that happened throughout the year, if you were to strip away Tervita, how do you think about the solid waste profitability trend through the year and coming into 2016? Don Slager : Michael let me start by going through some of the numbers, so if we just reconcile the EBITDA margin from '14 to '15, 2014 was at 28% and we got about 90 basis points of margin expansion this from the solid waste from the base business, a lot of that due to pricing above cost inflation and lowering that fuel. Now that was offset during the year by the recycling business which ended up being about 40 basis points, and by acquisitions of about 40 basis points. So to your question, you eliminate the cycling and you eliminate the 40 basis points from acquisition it gives you a better idea of where we think the true margin potential is of the business of the base business. Michael Hoffman : Okay that\u2019s very helpful. And then within the cash flows sort of discussion, you finished this year's cash flow from operations with a nice healthy 18.4% of revs that is a nice healthy increase year-over-year, and really there is a nice deferred tax from tax furnace depreciation that -- but your guidance for next year looks like you are retaining a lot of that, it's still over 18% so it's you might want it down a little bit year-over-year it's still over 18 which is up on a long-term basis so is that a sustainable permanent trend here now, you\u2019re 18% or better CRC of ops going forward? Don Slager : Yes, we would say that that is we believe that to be sustainable Michael going forward. We think about growing free cash flow on an annual basis somewhere in the mid to high single-digits is something we feel comfortable with and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing this year if you exclude the impact of bonus depreciation on both \u201915 and \u201916. Michael Hoffman : And you are -- and I think I misunderstood your commentary or I didn\u2019t understand it. The 65 million was in \u201915 December and 30s in 18 so \u201916, is that what you were saying? Don Slager : That\u2019s right. Yes, that\u2019s right Michael, that\u2019s right. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Chuck Serianni : And Michael maybe another way to think about this as well is that if you take a look at the 2016 guidance right for free cash flow of 820 million to 840 million, even though there is a $30 million benefit from the expense of the expansion of bonus depreciation, if you look at the in-year impact, right so from all prior years together with what was just extended, it's still a net negative in \u201916 to the magnitude of about $20 million. So if you want to kind of think normalized, you would take that guidance and add $20 million, that\u2019s a normalized level of free cash flow as bonus depreciation never existed at all. Don Slager : Right so think about it your first question the underlying waste our business expanded 90 basis points again forget about some of the other noise. But the cash flow point you made is right on it and as you always say you get proper cash. You think about what we\u2019ve done in the business to shift the pricing to offset cost. We still got some good cost initiatives underway certainly the reorganization and CRCs are part of that. And ongoing improvements still in our product set and in our customer service overhang and so I continue to drive willingness to pay. So we\u2019ve shifted a gear here and now we\u2019re funding with some of those improvements funding the next wave of initiatives and so on. So I mean we think we\u2019re going to continue to do that year-on-year and at some point in the future there will be other waves of initiatives that we talk about still, just going to leave you so much more time. But we think we\u2019ve turned the corner on it. Michael Hoffman : And just so I understood Brian\u2019s comment about what you were saying I think was the 813 less the 65 you\u2019ve normalized that it would still be plus 20 and then that grows to 830 would be the midpoint less 30, so it's still showing growth that\u2019s the point you\u2019re making [Multiple Speakers]. Don Slager : No, no I guess what I was saying Michael is that you just take the 2016 guide of 820 to 840, okay if you take a look at the in-year impact of bonus depreciation that we\u2019re going to see due to the reversal of prior years in \u201916 together with the in-year benefit from the extension, when you take the net impact of that, that\u2019s still a net negative $20 million to free cash flow or $20 million in higher cash taxes then that bonus depreciation never existed at all. So the notion of kind of what normalized would be in a normal tax environment it\u2019d be closer to 840 to 860 not 820 to 840, that\u2019s what I was saying. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew Buscaglia : So, on your fleet savings programs, the 72% automated at 78% maintenance program. Do you expect those to be pretty much complete by the end of this year? Don Slager : No the -- we\u2019ll have the let\u2019s take them one at a time. The automation right is focused on the residential part of our business going from multiple individuals working on accrue to single operator vehicles right. So, we\u2019ve moved that number up 2% or 3% a year. I think last year we converted what 200 or 300 routes to the single operator. So that\u2019s just been ticking up that thing will probably max-out somewhere at about 80% I\u2019d like to think I\u2019d give you a little better but some neighborhoods or some contracts just can\u2019t quite get there, so it's going to continue to tick up year-on-year until we are fully automated. The One Fleet initiative is going to be complete this year with all of our divisions being fully trained on One Fleet and then they\u2019ll be certified some of them will still be in the certification process into the venue next year. But we\u2019re seeing the benefits of the most mature sites that we talk about generally accruing the business so the longer these divisions are on the One Fleet program the better they perform. And not to mention right obviously the extension of the fleet the useful life of the fleet which has been a very methodical over our process and as I said in our comments we\u2019re continually taking advantage of that and as a result and our CapEx this year is only about 9.5% of revenue. Chuck Serianni : That\u2019s right. So just put a final point on that and we had -- we are expecting a $200 million capital savings associated with the One Fleet program, $40 million of that we actually obtained in \u201915 and we\u2019re expecting another $16 million benefit in 2016. Don Slager : And we originally said it would take four to five years to fully roll that out, so we'll take advantage of the extending the life. Andrew Buscaglia : And then switching gears on the volume side, can you talk a little about your expectations specifically on the commercial volumes I know they were flattish this quarter, what are you seeing, are you expecting '16 for that segment? Don Slager : Yes, we would say generally flat and we've got a couple of things going on in there. We have -- back in my comments earlier about more disciplined -- internal discipline on our end around price and volume, finding that right balance, really using the tools, the Capture tool et cetera, we as talked about in previous quarters the fact that we parted with some non-profitable national accounts business and we're going to continue to be very certain in our actions around that and we've also walked away from some broker relationships, those are third-parties who don't own trucks, they don't own containers, they don't own landfills, they have no risk, they bring no value to the customer and we've had some relationships there that we've had to part ways with and we're going to continue to be very selective of our partners and that will impact our commercial small container growth in '16 and in '17 frankly. But I mean we will continue to be flat at least for '16 and ultimately as our product continue to improve and everything else we'll get our fair share of growth and that's the thing we always say is what 240 markets , 42 states, we're in number one or number two market position, and about 93% of those as growth is there we get our fair share of growth and we want to focus that share on -- again customers who are in the right segments who value our quality and rolling effect. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Feniger of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : You got into EBITDA margins up 40 basis points, can you just walk us through some puts and takes on what's helping you really expand that margin in a very tough CPI backdrop? Chuck Serianni : Sure, let me put a little bit of color first of all on fourth quarter margins and the EBITDA margin for Q4 2015 was 27.2%. Now included in that you'll see that we had higher SG&A cost, incentive comp was about 50 basis points higher, we had some legal settlements of about 20 basis points and we had some initiative investments of about 30 basis points. Now the initiative investments in 2016 are going to be offset by the cost savings from the realignment that I had talked about and we're not expecting the initiative comp, the incentive comp and the legal settlements to reoccur. So, just from that alone you're ending up with 100 basis points more in margin for the quarter. And we're looking at SG&A in 2016 closer to 10.5% and once again that has to -- it's a little bit higher than the 10% that we called out just because of some of the costs that we're incurring is associated with initiatives but after 2018 and getting the full benefit associated with both the realignment and the customer resource centers, we're expecting SG&A to be back in -- back to around 10%, so looking longer term, really we're going to be able to start leveraging our SG&A and that's what is going to be a primary driver of our margins going forward. Don Slager : Yes. And Mike, just to kind of look at -- if you look at the full year-over-year what Chuck just described on the SG&A expenses that's probably 30 basis points of the 40 basis points of margin expansion from '15 to '16 just on SG&A and then the rest is basically just due to a better business performance. Michael Feniger : And then with free cash flow coming in ahead in 2016 and a very healthy cash flow from operations, is there any thought about maybe taking up that tuck-in acquisition target of 100 million higher? Don Slager : Yes so, we've got a target of 100 million as I said and we've got a pipeline -- each of our Area President's and our General Managers have responsibility to contribute to that pipeline with ideas around companies that might be interested in selling. You know I always say right, in order to gather the deal, one of the main components of having a good deal is having a willing seller right. And you need a willing seller, you need good synergy, real synergy, you'd like to get real assets and real property and real goodwill of customers, we don't like startups, we don't buy serial seller, we like the quality companies with recurring revenue and good assets and so there's a limit to what is out there and there's a limit frankly to owners who are willing to sell and they got to be at a point in their lives frankly where they are so, we're going to be as optimistic because we can be -- we think the tuck-in really looks like 100 million. It is something so much long that's it is not in our sites today, we'll let you know as the quarters tickle off, we always have the capability to do more and that\u2019s one of the reasons that we maintain our capital structure the way that we do. And again we are very focused on trying to grow the core and we know the value of tuck-in more business into already a very strong management team and really a strong asset base. So if it's there we will take a look at it. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Baumgarten of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Adam your line is live perhaps muted on your end. Adam Baumgarten : Hi sorry guys, thank you [Multiple Speakers] just a quick question on the Post-Collection yield and it's pretty stable quarter-over-quarter despite a pretty nice pick up in MSW yield, can you kind a walk me through the put and takes there? Don Slager : Let me back up and give you just a sense to it and then I\u2019ll let Chuck walk through the numbers. But remember that Post-Collection right includes right transfer and landfill and remember that a good portion of our landfill business today, MSW still comes through as municipal waste from municipal customers, right. And a lot of that business -- so these are cities who have their own trash fleets their own trucks quite and their own trash from rate payors. But they have no landfills and so unfortunately for us some of those contracts are still in with the CPI accelerators, so as we are thinking about moving to new indices that is the one of the areas that we will focus on overtime. In the other part of the business, the sort of the open market part of the rent business we do much better. But it's heavily weighted still towards that municipal waste product. Chuck Serianni : Yes so the restricted piece of the business, the yield there is closer to 1% to 1.5% and then to Don\u2019s point the unrestricted price is probably closer to 3% or 4%. Adam Baumgarten : And then just one quick one, should we expect any material impact on 1Q margins from the extra selling day? Chuck Serianni : Yes we think that there is going to be a downward pressure on margins, higher cost I should say in Q1 because of the extra selling day. That\u2019s about 30 to 40 basis points. Don Slager : And then the other thing again just to kind a keep in mind when you take a look at the first quarter is last year we got the benefit from the lag in the fuel recovery fee. And that was about $0.02 EPS benefit it contributed about 60 basis points to margin in the first quarter of '15. So when you look at the combination of the two just kind of something to keep in mind as you are looking at your model for next year for this year. Operator : At this time there appear to be not further questions. Mr. Slager I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Don Slager : Thank you Emily, I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment, and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic Way. Thank you for spending time with us today. Have a good evening, and be safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

And finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participate in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our Web site. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. We're pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well-positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which allows us to attract and retain higher value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long-term value. During the first quarter, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.48 and adjusted free cash flow of $160 million. Both were in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.4% and average yield was 2%. This was the fifth consecutive quarter with average yield of 2% or more. Average yield was strongest in our small container commercial and large container industrial businesses, where a majority of the business is in the open markets. In these open markets, we have great flexibility and can realize more pricing power from our enhanced product offering and improved service delivery and by leveraging our priority-based selling program and our Capture pricing tool. First quarter volumes increased 2.5%. This included 50 basis points of contribution from one additional work day. Volume growth is concentrated to the event-driven waste streams, including construction and demolition in our collection and disposal businesses and landfill special waste. While a portion of this volume growth can be attributed to favorable weather conditions during the quarter, we saw broad-based volume growth across most of our markets. Additionally, Landfill MSW volumes grew 4.7%. This was the fifth straight quarter where MSW volume growth exceeded 3%. First quarter EBITDA margin was 27.8%. It should be noted that the additional work day resulted in a 50 basis point margin headwind, which will not repeat in future quarters. We returned $191 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 1.9 million shares repurchased for approximately $87 million. Regarding our revenue enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $325 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently run higher than CPI. Second, approximately 1.4 million customers are enrolled in My Resource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity. Finally, we opened our first customer resource center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The center further enhances our customers\u2019 experience through a more professionally trained customer service team, improved technology and additional communication channels. We expect to open the other two customer resource centers later this year. Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost-saving initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 73% of our resi fleet is now currently automated and 81% of our total fleet has been certified under our OneFleet maintenance program, up from 64% a year ago. We are expediting the timeline to get our entire fleet through the program by June of this year and fully certified by mid-2017. During the quarter, we completed a realignment of our organizational structure. This included the elimination of our regional teams, consolidation and reduction of our areas by 50%, and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We reinvested a portion of the cost savings back into the remaining area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles, which puts resources closer to our business and our customers. We were able to make these changes as a result of developing standardized processes, with rigorous controls and further leveraging our scale. At the same time, we maintained our high performance business culture with field management, retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility. The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making in our customer-focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and the realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. Before the turn the call over to Chuck, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our recycling business. As many of you know, recycled commodity values have always been somewhat volatile. However, the industry has never experienced such a sustained downturn in commodity pricing. We continue to evolve our recycling strategy to adapt to this new normal. We are focusing on three key areas to evolve our business model. First, as part of our realignment, we centralized management oversight and accountability for recycling processing operations. The new organizational structure ensures clear ownership for the recycling and processing market vertical, provides additional expertise and support to our recycling and collection operations. Second, we're transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model. This model ensures we can cover our processing costs and earn an acceptable return on our processing investments. Under this model, we are including provisions to incentivize communities to bring us high-quality materials. This includes the right to conduct waste stream audits and assess contamination fees and glass surcharges. Finally, we\u2019re optimizing our recycling and collection business. Many municipal customers still believe there is significant value in the waste stream and are not aware of the cost to recover the material. Currently, our municipal sales team is focusing on educating municipal staff and elected officials on the all-in cost of recycling in these low commodity markets. Although we're still in the early innings, we're making progress. We transitioned our largest municipal processing agreement to a fee-based structure, negotiated a rebate reduction with a large customer on the East Coast, and added a glass surcharge with a large customer in Texas. Our customers have told us they value recycling and are willing to pay for these services. Our collective actions to improve the performance of our recycling business is intended to create a model for Republic and our recycling customers that ensures profitability and, therefore, supports its long-term sustainability. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck Serianni : Thanks, Don. First quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $79 million or 3.6% over the prior year. This 3.6% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.4% and acquisitions of 1.2%. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, total average yield growth of 2%. Average yield in the collection business was 2.4%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business, 2.3% yield in the large container industrial business, and 1% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes Landfill MSW of 1.5%. A majority of our third-party Landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.4%. Core price consisted of 4.5% in the open market and 1.7% in the restricted portion of our business. Second, our total volumes increased 2.5% year-over-year. This includes 50 basis points of contribution from one additional work day. The following discussion of volume by line of business excludes the impact of the additional workday. The collection business increased 1.4%, which includes increases from the large container business of 5.1% and the small container business of 20 basis points. As expected, the residential business declined 10 basis points. With our large container business, temporary C&D volumes were up 13% and recurring volumes were up 2.9%. Our small container volume performance of 20 basis points includes a 40 basis point decline due to not renewing select national accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 5.5%. Landfill volume increased 6.8%, which includes MSW of 4.7%, C&D of 17.8% and special waste of 8.7%. While C&D volumes and landfill volumes were broad-based geographically, we saw above-average volume growth in the areas of the country that experienced milder winter conditions. At the same time, we saw heavier rainfall in certain areas of the country. In these areas, we experienced higher disposable expense due to heavier container weights and additional leachate management costs. We believe these additional costs were directly related to the wet weather and expect these costs will return to planned levels for the remainder of the year. Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 140 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel which decreased approximately $23 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.08 in the first quarter from $2.92 in the prior year, a decrease of 29%. The current average diesel price is $2.20 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. Next, energy services revenue decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a decrease in drilling activity resulting from a decline in oil prices. The energy services revenue decline includes a decrease in Tervita-related volumes from the date of acquisition and a decline in E&P volumes at our solid waste landfills. Finally, commodity revenue decreased 10 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 10% to $100 per ton in the first quarter from $111 per ton in the prior year. First quarter total recycling volume of 621,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 7% from the prior year. Volumes were approximately 1% on a same-store basis. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was relatively flat with the prior year. Now, I\u2019ll discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.8% which compares to 28.9% in the prior year. The change includes a 50 basis point decline from the additional workday, a 20 basis point decline from net fuel and a decline of 40 basis points from an increase in healthcare-related expenses. Regarding the increase in healthcare costs, we self-insure employee medical claims. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in large claims, primarily resulting from non-work-related injuries and one-time incidents. We did not make any changes in our plan structure and our third-party administrator confirmed these were not inflationary type increases. We expect healthcare costs return back to planned levels for the remainder of the year. When looking at other cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees and the sale of commodity revenue. For example, the 1.5% decline in these revenues resulted in an increase in labor expense as a percentage of revenue of 30 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. SG&A costs were 10.7% of revenue and in line with our expectations. These costs improved 30 basis points compared to the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. First quarter 2016 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the first quarter reflects a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling estate tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $160 million and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we spent $275 million or approximately 31% of our annual projected capital expenditures. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Chuck. To conclude, our first quarter results were consistent with our expectations and keep us on track to achieve our full-year guidance. I\u2019m proud of how the Republic team continued to execute our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation and our performance reflects our hard work. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go-ahead. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. Don Slager : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Buscaglia : Can you just talk a little bit about your volume? So we\u2019re seeing strength across, not just with you, but with your peers, can you just talk about if this surprised you in the quarter? I know there\u2019s a lot going on with milder weather and extra workday. But does this surprise you and is this inflection we\u2019re seeing with strength sustainable in your opinion? Don Slager : Yes. So I don\u2019t think the extra workday surprised us. The weather was certainly \u2013 if you compare the weather in Q1 to Q1 last year, the weather was much milder, which we like. The standard answer we tend to give in Q1 on this kind of thing is that a big, important quarter for us is Q2, Andrew, as we see the normal seasonality return. So we\u2019re very happy with the trends. We know there\u2019s a lot of good construction activity going on out there that\u2019s driving our volume growth. As I said in my comments, a lot of this is kind of the event business. Construction, special waste doing well. So we\u2019d like to think it will continue into Q2. Again, the weather comp would be a different than Q2 over last year. But there is no doubt that it\u2019s fairly robust out there. Andrew Buscaglia : I missed what you said before with your guidance for volume. I know you had said 0.5% to 1% last quarter. But I guess we\u2019re just waiting here on Q2 to see if it is sustainable before you guys feel comfortable. Don Slager : Look, we would say that our volume guidance \u2013 we probably feel like it\u2019s going to be closer to the high end of that range based on how strong Q1 was. So that\u2019s the math we are trying to do. We would agree with it. Keep in mind, we gave that guidance because we\u2019ve got a little bit of loss business coming up in some of the residential contracts that we expect to lose because we couldn\u2019t negotiate reasonable rates to extend the business. So we know that\u2019s coming later in the year that will offset a little bit, but we\u2019ll see probably volume at the higher end of the range. Chuck Serianni : So, Andrew, you can expect to see residential volumes approximately negative 1% because of the losses that Don had talked about for the full year and that\u2019s what brings us closer to the 1% total volume growth. Andrew Buscaglia : Got it. All right, thank guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Hansa Mazzarri of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is [indiscernible]. I\u2019m filling in for Hansa. Thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned in the past about converting the CPI index contracts into an alternative index that better suits your costs. Can you just give us some color on whether this conversion process is going slower or faster than you guys anticipated? Is it getting easier as you convert more? Don Slager : So I said in my comments, we\u2019re up to $325 million now. That\u2019s quite a bit more than 10% of our total. I think we\u2019re picking up a little bit of speed. I would say it\u2019s \u2013 I think, let\u2019s say, it\u2019s getting easier because our people are getting more confident in their ability to have the conversation with customers. As I probably said you before, it\u2019s all about fairness, coming up with an escalator that both the customer and the provider can live with that\u2019s fair based on reasonable inflationary costs. So we\u2019re making headway. We\u2019ll continue to do so. I think the market is becoming more \u2013 I would say more adjusted to it. And so, we\u2019ll see how it goes through time. But we\u2019re fairly positive. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And just one follow-up question. Customer churn, how is that trending versus a year ago in terms of the competitive environment? What\u2019s going on with that? Don Slager : Yeah. So defection, if we\u2019re talking about defection, that\u2019s pretty flat compared to last year. And customer churn, overall, is flattish, but I would say, on a longer trajectory, we continue to see the benefits of our pricing tools, Capture, et cetera, to help us to do a better job with churn. Unidentified Analyst : All right, guys. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking questions. Don Slager : Thanks. Chuck Serianni : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Don Slager : Hi, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Just wanted to go through a couple of cost items. So first off, we saw maintenance and repairs were up 10%. I get it that we have some acquisitions, you had the extra day. But 10% seems kind of heady here particularly when revs were up maybe 4% and 81% of the fleet is under the new initiative. Can you talk a little bit about when you would expect to see that unit cost inflation and maintenance and repair to start going the other way? Chuck Serianni : Sure. So we expect right now that cost as a percentage of revenues for maintenance will decline sequentially for the remainder of the year. We also expect that exiting 2016 that that cost will be lower than what we experienced in 2015. So I would say that the trajectory is going in the right direction here. Tyler Brown : You\u2019re expecting the actual physical cost to be down in 2017, is that what you\u2019re saying? Chuck Serianni : The cost as a percentage of revenue. Tyler Brown : Okay, okay. Chuck Serianni : And when you\u2019re looking at the costs year-over-year on a dollar basis, Tyler, keep in mind that about half of that increase almost is due to volume and acquisitions. You\u2019ve got some timing issues in there also with some heavy equipment. And then, as Don had mentioned, we\u2019re making a push right now to get this OneFleet maintenance initiative all the way through the organization. So that\u2019s what\u2019s causing this to be a little bit higher on a dollar basis year-over-year. Tyler Brown : Okay. So it sounds like it pays off more kind of as a percentage of revenue in 2017. And then, Chuck, real quick, can you go back over the healthcare expense? So how much was it in gross dollars? And just to be clear, you\u2019re not expecting that to recur? Chuck Serianni : So we\u2019re not expecting it to recur. It\u2019s about $9 million in terms of dollars on a year-over-year basis. When we look at the portfolio claims that we got during the first quarter, it had to do with, what we would say, very unusual items. So think about complications associated with implants. Think about gastrointestinal infections. These aren\u2019t types of claims that we typically get. Most of our claims are musculoskeletal. This is totally unusual for us. And we talked to our experts about this, and they said, yes, it\u2019s very unusual for you. It\u2019s very unusual for companies in the transportation industry. But in their experience, on the portfolio of businesses that they look at, every once in a while, you have one of these Black Swan events. We continue to monitor the expenses in April and they are actually coming down to normalized levels. And so, that gives us more confidence saying that this was a one-time blip in these claims. Don Slager : Yeah, Tyler, you can tell by Chuck\u2019s detailed answer that we spent a lot of time digging into this claim data. So we think that Q1 is somewhat of an anomaly here. Tyler Brown : Okay. No, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s two. I\u2019ll call hop back in queue. Don Slager : All right. Operator : And the next question will come from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale : Hey, good afternoon. Don Slager : Hi, Corey. Chuck Serianni : Hi, Corey. Corey Greendale : Maybe for Chuck or whoever wants to take this, the free cash flow in the quarter, it\u2019s softer relative to what we\u2019ve seen in the past few years for Q1 seasonality. Can you just address that? It looks like some working capital things are moving around. But is it in line with what you expected and should we expect the seasonality to be different this year? Chuck Serianni : Yes. So absolutely in line with what we had expected. When you look at it quarter-over-quarter, you\u2019ve got about $70 million more CapEx during 2016 than we had in 2015. That\u2019s associated with truck purchases that we made, having to do with some contracts in Northern California. And then we had some working capital items also. So the timing of payroll, we actually had an extra payroll during the quarter. Also, higher incentive compensation that was paid during the quarter versus last year. So all timing related. And still feel very comfortable with our annual guidance of $820 million to $840 million. Don Slager : And, Corey, one of the ways you may want to think of it too is, if you take a look at $160 million that we reported in the first quarter, if you normalize the CapEx, so had we only purchased 25% of full year guidance, that would have added $50 million to our performance, which would\u2019ve put us around $210 million. You can do the math on that and see what that extrapolates to the year. Corey Greendale : Okay. And then maybe my second question, also on the cost side, did I understand \u2013 Chuck, did you say that fuel was a net negative to margin? Can you just repeat that? And then, is the full benefit of taking out the layer of management, was that in Q1? Or should we expect some more cost reduction in Q2 versus Q1? Chuck Serianni : Okay. So in terms of the impact of the net fuel on margins, it was about 20 basis points of negative. So keep in mind that what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re pulling that revenue off, and so it\u2019s having an adverse impact on the margins overall. So that was about 20 basis points. In terms of the initiatives, during the quarter, we had about $3 million in savings. We expect that to go up, maybe closer to $5 million to $6 million in savings on a quarterly basis. But also keep in mind that what we had guided to was the fact that we would have some initiative investments during the year that would offset that. So I would say that, right now, we\u2019re right on track in terms of our initiative savings or realignment savings. Corey Greendale : Yeah, thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Joe Box of KeyBank Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Box : Hi, guys. Don Slager : Hi, Joe. Chuck Serianni : Hi, Joe. Joe Box : So I just want to dig into the margin a little bit further. Your EBITDA margins are down 110 basis points. And if you add back the extra day, which is 50 basis points, it sounds like 40 or so basis points from healthcare problems, call it about a 20 basis point headwind. I\u2019m just curious, if you were to normalize some of those other elevated expenses, whether it\u2019s leachate or disposal costs, where do you think that EBITDA margin would\u2019ve shaken out, Don? Don Slager : Let\u2019s think about it this way, Joe. You look at the EBITDA margin that we reported, 27.8%, add back, to your point, 40 basis points for the health expense. And then keep in mind that, during Q1, you had your seasonally highest SG&A. So we\u2019re 10.7% versus our guidance of about 10.5% for the year. It\u2019s another 20 basis points. So a total of 60 basis points. Add that back to the 27.8% and you get 28.4%, which is right in line with our guidance for the year. Joe Box : Okay. Maybe switching gears to the recycling side, can you maybe talk to how long it might take to adapt this fee-based recycling model and maybe at what current recycling prices are \u2013 how out of whack do you think the revenues are relative to your processing costs? I\u2019m just trying to understand what the overall benefit could be as this gets absorbed into the system. Don Slager : Well, starting out, let\u2019s back up to recent year highs. In recycling, today, we are down over like $120 million\u2026 Chuck Serianni : $70 a ton. Don Slager : Yeah, right. So that\u2019s what we were enjoying, whatever it was, seven, eight years ago. So we realigned the organization, so we said it will be focused on getting better profitability cost structure on the processing side. Those folks are doing a great job at that. We need to migrate that over to the collection side now and into some of the hauling contracts. It\u2019s going to take a little while. We probably have some routes out there that are dense enough that may never have enough participation or density to make sense, so we\u2019re going to be addressing that in the open market certainly and maybe even some other contractual stuff. We\u2019ve got to make more headway with our municipal partners. And as I said in my comments, we\u2019ve got some examples where we\u2019re negotiating glass surcharges. We\u2019re taking glass out. We are changing the rebate structure, the fee-based etc. So we\u2019re getting better at it, but we are very, very early innings. I think we are much farther along in moving the municipal contracts to the new index. We\u2019ve got more momentum there. We\u2019re breathing some fire now into the recycling collection business to move those contracts. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take, Joe. It\u2019s going to depend a little bit on \u2013 what the market dynamic is. But we\u2019re not going to be caught with getting drunk again on high commodity prices. We\u2019ve got to fix the business for good, get to the right sharing with our customer base. As I always say, and as I said in my comments, sustainability doesn\u2019t work without profitability. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And we are not going to do business that has diminishing returns. Joe Box : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go-ahead Michael Hoffman : Thank you, Don, for taking my questions. Don Slager : Hi, Michael. How are you? Michael Hoffman : I\u2019m well. Thank you. And yourself? Don Slager : Very good, thanks. Michael Hoffman : So back to the CPI, at one point over the last couple of years, you had described the pull of addressable revenues at about $2 billion. What do you think is a practical number that can be converted on a percentage basis? And where I\u2019m going with that is, it would be a good thing if you got some number and then inflation comes back to 2%. And when the two blend together, you\u2019re net ahead of the game. Don Slager : So, again, with everybody listening \u2013 hopefully, a lot of my teammates at Republic \u2013 we absolutely, positively can\u2019t be entering into contracts with escalators that don\u2019t keep pace with our net inflation, inflation net of productivity. We\u2019ve got to be equal or better. And as I\u2019ve said many times, for decades, as long as I\u2019ve been around, that CPI worked great, it was fair. We need to get to fairness again. And so, my viewpoint is all contracts have to be converted to a metric or an escalator that\u2019s fair and reasonable. And so, we\u2019re tackling this base. We said, look, we\u2019ve got $2.5 billion of this business. About $800 million of that $2.5 billion is the smaller contracts. That\u2019s what we went to work first. Now, we\u2019ve got $325 million of that converted. Now, we\u2019re working toward bigger contracts. We\u2019re, right now, as we speak, talking to customers, some very large customers, about this very thing. And I think at some point we\u2019ll have made some of those conversions successful and the market will continue to move. So if you take a look at our pricing, this quarter, at 2% yield, we\u2019ve been north of 2% now for a few quarters. What keeps holding that back down is residential. And so, we\u2019re very, very close to hitting this overarching metric for us of getting back to a day where yield surpasses inflation on a regular and consistent basis. So we are right on the cusp of that. And so, we\u2019re going to keep pushing the new metric. I don\u2019t have an exact date in mind when we can get there. I know we\u2019re making progress, Michael. You can tell by the determination of my voice that we\u2019re kind of at a place we\u2019re not taking no for an answer because we just can\u2019t be in a situation where we have these large contracts with all the exposure and declining returns. It\u2019s just not feasible or it\u2019s not practical. Michael Hoffman : All right, fair enough. Switching gears to margin trend, if I took your 50 basis points for adjustment to your gross margin, so instead of doing 38.60%, you did 39.1% for the first quarter. Given how good the volume was and possibly some of it got pulled forward, is it probable that the gross margin in 2Q might trend down a little bit, 20, 25 basis points? And really, what you want to look at is smoothing the first half and comparing that to the first half\u2019s 15 basis points? Don Slager : No, I don\u2019t think so, Michael. I think that \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we necessarily need to smooth it. Part of the noise that I think that we might be seeing in the first quarter has to do with the workday. And we need to keep in mind that that reverses in Q4, so there\u2019s going to be a little pick up there when that happens. But I would say that, right now, we feel pretty comfortable with our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance that we gave of 28.5% for the year. Michael Hoffman : Okay. I wasn\u2019t disputing that. I was really actually trying to figure out, given how strong volumes were in the first quarter and operating leverage that comes from that, in all likelihood, those volumes remain good, but not as good as 1Q because of the positive circumstances and that, therefore, you might see a slight shift in margin, 1Q to the next. It\u2019s not a bad thing. If you smooth the two Qs together, you\u2019ve got the objective you\u2019re trying to achieve anyway. But you pulled some of that benefit into 1Q. Brian DelGhiaccio : This is Brian. So, remember, the largest percentage of our volume growth was in the roll-off business, which was up about 13%. And as you know, that comes along with it the variable costs. I know you\u2019re talking about leverage, but that\u2019s where we saw the concentration of volume. But the other thing is that we know that, while it was a mild winter, in parts of the country it was also wet. So we did see extra operating costs. We saw higher disposal expense where we\u2019ve got predominantly third-party disposal market. And we saw some additional leachate expense, again, where it was wet. So from a weather perspective, it\u2019s not that we feel like we got a whole lot of contribution to the bottom line from the mild winter. So if the revenues fall off a little bit in the second quarter because maybe they were pulled forward, we would also expect some of the cost to taper off as well. Michael Hoffman : Okay, fair enough. Chuck Serianni : Too often \u2013 sometimes the answer is timing and mix, Michael, right? That\u2019s kind of what Brian said. But you\u2019re right, [indiscernible] quarter was very strong. If you take out some of the anomalies, call it just healthcare, some of the leachate expense, some of that stuff, I look at like we had a [indiscernible] quarter. We\u2019ve got a little bit of noise with a few items. And we\u2019ve got a little bit of \u2013 as Chuck described with the residential volume, we\u2019ve got couple of blips on the horizon there with some contracts we\u2019ll walk away from. We talked in the comments about some volume where non-regrettable volume loss with national accounts and brokers. So there is some of that noise in the system, but we\u2019re really confident in the guidance and in the margin. And more importantly, in the actions we\u2019re taking and in the way the team is executing. Don Slager : And, Michael, maybe to your question, as Chuck kind of mentioned, second half probably looks better than first half because in the second half we have one less work day whereas in the first half we had the one more. So maybe that\u2019s the way you want to think about it. Michael Hoffman : Okay, fair enough. See you guys in a couple of weeks. Chuck Serianni : All right, take care. Operator : The next question will come from Jeff Volshteyn of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Volshteyn : Thank you for taking my question. I might have missed it, but did you give any update in your prepared remarks about 2016 guidance other than what you said in the Q&A for volume and CapEx? Don Slager : No, we didn\u2019t update our guidance. That\u2019s something that we typically save for the second quarter. And right now, what we said is that we feel comfortable and we\u2019re on track with our guidance. Jeff Volshteyn : Okay, fair enough. On acquisitions, in the first quarter, we didn\u2019t see any acquisitions. How is the M&A environment for small tuck-ins? Chuck Serianni : We set out the year with a target of spending $100 million and spending that $100 million primarily in tuck-ins and primarily within the same EBITDA range that we had over the last couple of years. And we still today think that we\u2019ll accomplish that goal. We\u2019ve got a real slow start here on the year. But we think we will exit the year having very wisely spent $100 million and invested it in some really good tuck-in assets. Jeff Volshteyn : That\u2019s helpful. Last question from me, if I may. You mentioned higher leachate costs, one of your competitors also talked about it today in their call. Are there any sizable investments that you expect related to this issue? Don Slager : No, not really. Not for us. We look at leachate as being somewhat unique to the individual landfill. It really is about the geology of the individual landfills and also the weather that exists, whether it\u2019s a dry climate or wet. Obviously, in the Southwest, we don\u2019t have a lot of leachate. We don\u2019t have a lot of rain. We\u2019ve got arid climate, so the water evaporates. We\u2019ve got some landfills that have in-gradient water flows that we\u2019ve got to deal with. So that\u2019s a little bit of a different issue. So really site-specific. The leachate cost that we saw in Q1 was really more about a seasonally wet \u2013 an unusually seasonally wet quarter. Having said that, landfills are more expensive to own and operate every day and every year and we\u2019re constantly evaluating our cost structure and constantly looking for ways to effectively pass along price increases into the market that makes sense, to capture the cost inflation. We\u2019ve got to manage these things responsibly and be good environmental stewards and we\u2019ll continue to do that. For us, leachate is really more of a site-specific issue. But that\u2019s all I can tell you. As we look at the quarter, there\u2019s nothing else for us really going on broadly with our leachate story. Jeff Volshteyn : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : And the next question will come from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Thanks. Did you guys see any changes through the quarter in April? You were speaking about special event volume, C&D, anything that makes you \u2013 any cause for concern that the momentum you felt on the volume side would slow going into the second quarter? Don Slager : Well, no. I think specific construction volume is strong \u2013 one, because of the unusual weather. But Q2 is where we tend to see the seasonal pickups and we certainly expect to see that. Event business \u2013 the special waste business was strong in Q1. There\u2019s no concern that we have there overall. We\u2019re still only at, what, 1.1 million new home starts. Single-family home starts are actually up, right, on a year-over-year basis. So that bodes well for us. We tend to lag that. So as long as that continues, I think that\u2019s what drives more and more growth in our market. On a total macro basis, we\u2019re feeling really good. Michael Feniger : Thanks. And the loss of the residential businesses that you guys were discussing, should we be thinking that as a positive? Or for the mix, would that be positive to margin? Don Slager : Yeah. Ultimately, look, residential is our weakest line of business in our collection system. And you think about the state of affairs there that we\u2019ve had the sustained low CPI environment there for how many years? Chuck Serianni : Six, seven years. Don Slager : Six, seven years. Its average over that time is 1.6%. Our costs don\u2019t average 1.6%. So you can just do some math and figure out what kind of margin erosion we had there in that space. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so adamant about changing the indices to something that\u2019s fair and reasonable. So we get to do a negotiation with the residential customer who can\u2019t seem to understand that degree of fairness, we can\u2019t enter into extending contracts that continue to decline and go below our reasonable rate of return. So ultimately we have to grow the ROI in the business. And so, your point is, over time, that\u2019s a good thing. We either have to shed business that doesn\u2019t equal the right return or we have to get a pricing scenario that is reasonable for both parties. And that\u2019s the story. It\u2019s the same story with national accounts and some of the broker business. Operator : Our next question will come from of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital. Please go-ahead. Q \u2013 Megan Barnett : This is Megan on for Scott. So I just want to go back to talk about the volume, any regional outliers, positive or negative, impact on volume? Don Slager : Well, if you think about places that have really mild weather, the Atlantic area, Philadelphia, Carolinas, Chicago and Boston, places like that that just had very mild, mild winter, I would point those out specifically. We didn\u2019t see much difference here in Arizona quite frankly. But that gives you some idea. Q \u2013 Megan Barnett : Okay, thanks. And then another question to discuss trends in your energy waste business and like how it impacted your margins? Chuck Serianni : Generally speaking, the business is performing somewhat like we thought it would. We knew it would be weaker because this year than maybe we thought when we started the business. But we budgeted essentially for that. Probably a little bit weaker overall, but I think the thing that we always want to point out is we think ultimately through the cycle that that business is going to come back and perform well for the company. Don Slager : Keep in mind also that it is less than 1% of our revenues, so the impact on the entire company is pretty small. Chuck Serianni : So, Megan, the overall impact to the total company was about 20 basis points negative to margin. Q \u2013 Megan Barnett : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : And the next question will come from Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Please go-ahead. Al Kaschalk : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Don Slager : Hi, Al. Al Kaschalk : Sorry, I joined late. I wanted to focus on really I guess two areas. One, you talked a little bit about the leachate and maybe you could just take a step back and help us appreciate, is this more focused or more of a concern to companies that have higher number of closed landfills than, say, maybe whether storms or other things could occur and therefore water could increase. Could you just talk a little bit about that? Then I have a follow-up. Don Slager : Well, as I said in my comments earlier, leachate is really two things. We talk about it being site-specific. It\u2019s really about geology and weather. If you have a large landfill with a big open face that\u2019s not covered, then you get a lot of rainfall. All that rainfall goes into your landfill and becomes leachate. Okay? If you are in an arid clime where we don\u2019t have leachate or don\u2019t have rainfall you don\u2019t have a problem. So it\u2019s very site-specific. And again, we have a lot of rainfall in certain parts of the country. In certain parts here, we have snow normally. Snow tends to fall and sit on top of the landfill and then evaporate before it melts. Rainfall tends to get inside your landfill. I\u2019m not a weatherman, but that\u2019s kind of how it works out. So we have a number of closed landfills certainly. Some of those are so closed that they\u2019re inert and there\u2019s virtually no leachate coming out of them. So once you completely cap the landfill and it\u2019s in a completely closed state, there\u2019s no more rain water getting in the landfill. So it\u2019s just about timing I guess when it comes to that point. For us, we don\u2019t have from our perspective \u2013 as I said on an earlier question \u2013 a broad-based concern about leachate today. We have some specific sites that saw more leachate in the quarter because of rainfall and we are dealing with that through normal operating expense. Chuck Serianni : And just to put a finer point on that, with the areas \u2013 the landfills that we saw that had an increase in leachate, they were active landfills in the areas that had very, very heavy rains during the quarter. Al Kaschalk : So I guess from the novice point being from my side, the item we want to focus on or center our questions on are those landfills that are closed where you\u2019re not able to potentially charge someone for those extra costs you incur versus an active one you theoretically have the ability to pass through some costs. Whether you get that is a whole different story. Is that fair? Don Slager : Yeah. I\u2019m not sure I totally understand your question. I can\u2019t tell you off the top of my head the exact percentage of our leachate that comes from closed landfills and open landfills, but the majority of our leachate comes from open operating landfills. As I said, the longer the landfill is capped and closed, the less leachate is present in the landfill. Chuck Serianni : And keep in mind also, when we cap our landfills, there is a synthetic liner that is put on top of it that prevents the leachate from going into the landfill \u2013 the rainfall. Don Slager : Our leachate expense was normal across the company with the exception of those sites that saw a much higher level of rainfall than normal. Or potentially a landfill that was in the midst of construction and rainfall event while part of the landfill was open where normally it wouldn\u2019t be. But other than that, our leachate expense across the company net of those landfills is just inflating at what would be normal inflation rate. Al Kaschalk : Got it. Okay, I think I\u2019ll leave that one. Don Slager : And so, we generally \u2013 to your pricing question, we generally deal with leachate expense and the cost of leachate expense through our environmental recovery fee with our landfill customers. And so, over time, we have raised our environment recovery fee to deal with certain issues like leachate expense and we\u2019ve done that very effectively over recent years and customers seem to understand that. So that\u2019s been our mechanism to deal with it. Al Kaschalk : Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up would be, if you could give us some type of \u2013 I won\u2019t say I\u2019m a macroeconomist et cetera, but generally I think at the peak you had at C&D volumes on landfill, I thought, were 17%, 18% of your revenue. You commented where housing starts are, et cetera. And you\u2019ve always had a better leverage to \u2013 or higher leverage, in my understanding, than you competitors to sort of that non-residential construction activity. So, A, could you maybe just frame where we\u2019re at in terms of percentage of revenue? And then, sort of, how much tailwind do we have on these positive volume numbers that we saw? Chuck Serianni : We don\u2019t really give a lot of data on non-res versus res construction because\u2026 Al Kaschalk : That\u2019s a fact. Chuck Serianni : Because again, to us, it\u2019s not that important. And we\u2019re not economists either. Our total C&D for the company is about 8%. And at its peak, it was 12%. Okay? At its peak. So we think about \u2013 I always think about it this way. Again, back to housing starts, we\u2019ve said for many moons now, our business grows with population growth that drives household formation, that drives business formation. And while the household formation creates \u2013 business formation does create some construction debris, what we really like to see is it creates the ongoing recurring revenue part of our business which is the small container, large container pickups and pulls that are ongoing. That\u2019s the part of our business that\u2019s kind of our bread and butter. And we know that the construction is going to ebb and flow a little bit with the economy. Having said that, housing starts are 1.1 million. The 50 year average, if we take the peak out, is a 1.5 million. Most people I talk to that are in the housing business are pretty bullish on housing continuing to improve. I mentioned that single family housing is \u2013 home starts is up like 20%. And you know we lag sort of a year plus when that\u2019s happening. So we think [indiscernible] strong temp volume, 13% in that space. So we\u2019ll continue to do that. So we feel overall pretty positive about the macro. Al Kaschalk : Great. Good luck, guys. And thanks a lot for taking my questions. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Don Slager : Thank you, Denise. I would like to thank all of Republic\u2019s employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence in creating the Republic way. Thanks for spending time with us today and have a good evening. Be safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending.

And finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We're pleased with our second quarter results which were in line with our expectations and keep us well-positioned to achieve our full-year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of probable growth through differentiation which allows us to attract and retain high-value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long term value. During the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.55. EPS improved from the prior year, even with a $0.02 increase in the effective tax rate. Excluding the increases in taxes, EPS grew approximately 6%. Adjusted free cash flow grew 5% to $177 million and was in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.1% and average yield was 2%. We expect the average yield to remain relatively consistent with our second quarter performance for the remainder of the year. We continue to see the highest level of average yield in our small container commercial business. The majority of these customers are on open markets, where we can a leverage an increase in demand for service our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform. Second quarter volumes grew increased -- second quarter volumes increased50 basis points. As expected, volume growth moderated from the first quarter but remain positive. We continue to expect volume growth of approximately 1% for the year, consistent with our guidance. Cost of operations improved 20 basis points to 61.3% of revenue, from 61.5% in the prior year. There was a sequential improvement in most cost categories, including labor, maintenance and landfill operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was consistent with the prior year at 28.3% of revenue. We incurred approximately $5 million of legal settlement costs during the quarter which impacted EBITDA margin by 20 basis points and reduced EPS by approximately $0.01. We saw EBITDA margin improvement in all lines of business, with the exception of residential. Pricing in the residential business continues to be impacted by below CPI environment. We launched and priced a tender transaction and new debt issuance which will reduce annual interest cost by $17 million or approximately $0.03 of EPS. These deals closed in early July. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders, since the beginning of the year. This includes 4.2 million shares repurchased for $194 million. Additionally, our Board recently raised the quarterly dividend by approximately 7%. The annualized dividend is now $1.28 per share. Regarding our revenue enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $340 million in annual revenue that uses a Waste Related Index for the annual price adjustment. These Waste Indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently run higher than CPI. Additionally, we move $25 million annual revenue to a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. We made these changes for customers that want more certainty around future rate increases and we're confident that we can manage our cost structure at or below this level. Second, approximately 1.6 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 60% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity. Third, our eCommerce platform now has the capability for customers to purchase temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower cost sales channel. Approximately 15% of residential subscription sales are coming through our eCommerce platform. And finally, we opened our second Customer Resource Center located in Phoenix. We expect to open our last Customer Resource Center in Indianapolis later this year. Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives 17% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas; 73% of our residential fleet is currently automated; and 85% of our total fleet has been certified under our OneFleet Standardized Maintenance Program, up from 70% a year ago. We recently completed the final wave of our OneFleet implementations and expect the entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017. Recent recycled commodity prices have trended above the prior year by approximately $5 to $10 per ton. If prices remain at these levels for the balance of the year, we would expect to achieve the higher end of our EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. When assessing other macro conditions, we continue to see a gradual improvement in the fundamentals that impact our business which was the premise for our 2016 business plan. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck? Chuck Serianni : Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $39 million or 1.7% over the prior year. This 1.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1.3% and acquisitions of 40 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows, first, total average yield growth of 2%; average yield in the collection business was 2.3% which includes 3.7% yield in the small container business ; 1.9% yield in the large container business; and 1.2% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.1% which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%, a majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.1%. Core price consisted of 4.1% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business. Second, our total volumes increased 50 basis points which was in line with our expectations. Volume growth moderated during the second quarter, mostly due to the mild winter conditions which favorably impacted our first quarter performance. Volumes in the collections business increased 30 basis points which included 2.9% increase from the large container business, a 10 basis point decline from the small container business and a 1.4% decline from the residential business. Within our large container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 6.5% and recurring hauls were up 2.1%. Temporary C&D hauls remain strong and continue to reflect an increase in construction-related activity. There was a 50 basis point impact to small container volume from not renewing select national accounts customers and shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable. Our residential volume decline of 1.4% was due to not renewing certain contracts that did not meet our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full-year volume guidance. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.5%. Landfill volume increased 1.6% which consisted of MSW volume growth of 2.2% and C&D of 13.8%, partially offset by decline in landfill special waste of 1.1%. The decline in special waste relates to large event-driven volumes in the prior dear year that did not repeat. Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 1%. The change primarily relates to the decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.30 in the second quarter from $2.85 in the prior year, a decrease of 19%. The current average diesel price is $2.38 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. Next, energy services revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a year-over-year decrease in drilling activity, resulting from a decline in the price of oil. Finally, commodity revenue increased 30 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue primarily relates to an increase in processing fees charged to third parties. This increase results from our initiative to transition to fee-based recycling model. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 3% to $116 per ton in the second quarter, from $113 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tons was consistent with the prior year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat versus prior year. Now I will discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% and consistent with the prior year. Total cost of operations decreased to 61.3% from 61.5% in the prior year, resulting in 20 basis points of margin expansion. Sequentially, the year-over-year change in labor improved 30 basis points and maintenance improved 40 basis points. We expect maintenance expense, as a percentage of revenue, will be below prior-year levels as we exit the year. SG&A expenses were 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase was due to settling certain legal matters from prior years. On a full-year basis, we expect SG&A expenses of 10.5% of revenue which represents a 30-basis point improvement from 2015. When looking at the detailed cost line items, as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees. For example, the 1% decline in fuel recovery fee revenue resulted in an increase in labor expense of 20 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 10 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Second quarter 2016 interest expense was $92 million which included $12 million of non-cash amortization. As Don mentioned, we recently completed several financing transactions. First, we refinanced our $1 billion credit facility that was maturing in May of 2017. Second, we tendered $575 million of debt with coupons ranging from 5.7% to 7.4%. And finally, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes with a 2.9% coupon. As a result of these transactions, we expect to save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS. Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the second quarter resulted in a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling of federal tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $337 million. Both were in line with our expectations. We expect free cash flow generation will be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of capital expenditures and working capital. We remain comfortable with our full-year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $820 million to, $840 million. Now I will turn the call back over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Chuck. To conclude, our second quarter results were consistent with our expectations and they keep us on track to achieve our full-year guidance. I'm proud of how the Republic team continued to execute our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. And our performance continues to reflect our hard work. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. At this time in the call, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Core pricing did decelerate a little bit but yield has held steady. I think the spread between the two is about as small as we've seen in some time. I know one of your competitors has talked about must improved churn. I'm just curious if you're experiencing the same and can you talk a little bit about how PBS and Capture might be helping out there? Chuck Serianni : Certainly, what we're seeing here is a benefit from PBS and from Capture and that's what's allowed us to decrease our churn by about 30 basis points sequentially. The other thing that we have in here, Tyler is the fact that we're very much focused on ensuring that we're charging for all the services that we performed and that would include things like delivery fees and extra pick-ups. So that's really the focus that we have placed on these new tools and charging for the services has really allowed us to drive down that churn. Don Slager : Tyler this is Don. As you know PBS is fully rolled out. Capture has now been rolled out for some time. The adoption rates, utilization rates of those tools are very high. We've got great training programs in place to re-trained new hires. It's been really a great success for us. There is a lot of pull in the organization for those tools, professionalizing the sales team. As a backdrop to what Chuck said, defection has remained low at 7% and now we've had that low for a long time. Churn is improving, as Chuck said. The underlying fundamentals of small container business are strong. So just all around, a good steady business and really good execution by the sales organization. And year over year, another stat we like to look at cost or price of new sales compared to price of new sales from last year is also up and that's, again due to the new tools that we've got out there. Tyler Brown : Chuck, this is a bigger picture question, but margins have been hanging around this 28% range for, I'd say, the past couple of years. I know publicly, you guys have talked about that there is really nothing structurally that precludes you from getting back to, say, that 30% margin profile. I know there's lots of internal initiatives but what are the real key levers to getting back to that range? Is it really about bending the cost curve or do you guys need some exogenous help from, say, CPI commodities? Is that what's going to help you get there? Chuck Serianni : I think when we think about it longer term, we will need to be successful in terms of switching our customers from CPI to some other pricing index which we're very much focused in on. Obviously, a little bit of a tailwind from commodity pricing would help us also. But we're beginning to see margin expansion, right? So we had gross margin expansion during the quarter, 20 basis points, as I mentioned. The other thing is that we still feel comfortable saying that we're going to have gross -- our EBITDA margin expansion during the year. Part of that is going to come from just our continuing -- continual focus on cost, including maintenance and labor and also we're going to get a little bit of a benefit from the reversal of the workday. So we feel really good about the progress that we're making this year in terms of the cost side of the equation and we feel good about being able to get back to those 30% margins. Don Slager : Remember, last time, we were north of 30% Tyler and given the size 31ish, we had better recycling commodity prices. We did not have the CPI environments. Those are two important macro things that you pointed out. But we're now seeing benefits coming through the P&L from the OneFleet initiative that is fully rolled out, as I said. We'll certify everybody by this time next year; that's starting to pay dividends. We will see the benefit start to happen next year in 2018 from the benefit of the reorg net of the CRC consolidations. Those start to roll in. Those are, I think, costs that will easily be able to achieve, based on what we have seen so far so there's a lot of good things in the works and again, there's always that next wave of initiatives that we haven't talked about yet. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Maybe we just start with the recycling part of the business? First of all, can you just remind us how far you are through that process of reworking the contracts? And how long you think that will take? And I think there's second part of that question be it -- I think recently, in particular, you put in place some pretty state-of-the-art automation on some of the recycling facilities. To what extent are you seeing that in a higher automation level helping you on the margin profile and helping the economics along? Thanks. Don Slager : So let me start by just reminding everybody that the recycling business really is unique based on individual markets. So while on one hand, we continue to make strong investments in recycling. And we're very much committed to helping our customers do the right thing for the planet and to meet their sustainability goals. That only works for us in markets where customers are willing to pay for the service and where we've got a density and participation to make it work. So I say very often, that sustainability doesn't work without profitability and those are a couple of key issues. Customers really need to value it and we need to have density and participation to make it work. So while we made some great state-of-the-art investments, as you pointed out. We have won some awards, frankly, for some of our innovation in and around recycling. At the same time, we've also had to close some low-volume facilities that were antiquated and where we don't have enough participation to make recycling work. It can't work as a loss leader. So how far are we in the process of really reinventing or reimagining recycling? Again you think about our business being only about 10% of revenues in recycling. It's, again, you think about our business being only about 10% of revenues in recycling. One of the most volatile parts of our business has been as we just spoke to Tyler about the commodity pricing environment. While it's starting to move up a little bit. It started out very low in the year. Maybe it's going to come back even stronger in the second half, we will have to see. But two components of recycling, one, is processing where we take in material to our facilities from third parties and then one is collection. On the processing side, about 40% of the volume we take in on processing we've adjusted or have favorable terms so where those customers who actually share in the risk and the upside of the material and the market prices. So those are good contracts. The remaining 18% of those customers in the processing side of our business are -- the remaining customer are going to come due for renegotiation over the 18 months. So over the next 18 months, we will negotiate to get to fairer terms there. And then on the collection side, that really resides primarily in our residential municipal business and we're working with our municipal partners to help understand this issue and we're renegotiating contracts as we go through time. Those contracts tend to be longer term so I would say we're just still very in early -- in the very early innings with that. But most of the -- that dialogue is met with practical solutions and people understand that it's got to work for both sides of the partnership so we're just going to continue to work through it and continue to invest where it makes sense. Noah Kaye : I'd like to ask you a question on the relationship between increasing customer profitability and some of the technology initiatives that you're adopting and you mentioned that you've seen good progress on customer churn continuing to trend lower. I would also think with some of the early events that telematics and raw optimization technologies that you've got; it's becoming easier to pinpoint the types of accounts that will improve raw density and integrate profitability so to what extent should we continue to expect that to be a tailwind for you, as basically a secular technology benefit? Don Slager : Well, just to be clear, we have been using route-based tech -- computer-based technology for routing for a long time, right? GPS-type systems and geocoding, that's not new technology for us. We will continue to improve the utilization of those systems but that's not going to be a big lever for us to pull. We're going to just get incrementally better year-on-year and continue to improve as the tools improved. But we've been using those tools for a long time so I don't want to leave you the impression that our routes aren't highly efficient or densely routed because that's one of the reasons our margins are 28% because the density model of our business. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew Buscaglia : Can you just talk about -- I thought your topline was a little bit -- just a touch less than I was expecting and if you break it down, it looks like I think expectations might have been a little bit high from Q1 with -- on the volume side but they were pretty much in line, although there were some interesting puts and takes when you start breaking down the volume. Can you just talk about each or the ones that -- highlight the ones that met your expectations or maybe were a little bit lighter? I know there's a lot going on with comps and -- Don Slager : Yes, we'll tag team this. Let's start off by setting the context, right? We had a pretty strong volume growth rate in Q1 but we reminded everybody that, that was just kind of a strange comp year over year. We had a very mild winter compared with a very tough winter the year before and we said to everybody that, look, our guidance for volume has been for the year was 0.5% to 1%. And we're saying now that our volume growth is going to be about 1%, right? So it really is in line in total and -- as far as an exit speed this year, with what we expected, frankly, maybe even to the high end of that. Chuck Serianni : What I would add to that also is that we did see, as I mentioned before, we did see a step-down in residential volumes and that's because of certain contracts that we did not renew because they didn't meet our return criteria so keep that in mind also. The other thing is that you've got a 50 basis point sequential decline in volume, just due to the additional work day so that's obviously something that's driving the topline in a pretty significant manner. But as Don mentioned, we still remain comfortable with our guidance of hitting about 1% for the year in volume guidance which, as you mentioned, is that the upper end of our original guidance range. Don Slager : So obviously, a lot of this recovery has been led by our C&D business which continues to perform for us. We mentioned that churn rates are good. We mentioned, I think, defections stayed low. We're seeing container weights increase slightly. We're seeing service increases versus decreases continue to be incrementally favorable. So all those underlying things that point to -- continue to strengthen and fundamentals are there and we're also just being smart about pricing. I guess the last thing is and we mentioned it in the comments is we have walked away from some broker business and we have determined that, that broker model hasn't really favored the Company. And so we have intentionally shed some of that business over the last couple of quarters so that -- you net that out, obviously, the numbers are quite a bit more favorable. Andrew Buscaglia : And can you talk a little bit just looking at the top line as well. It looks like the tuck-in was a little bit lower than normal. Just curious what you're seeing in the private market. It sounds like things have quieted down with that. You also may have had some divestitures in there, so--? Don Slager : We were a little slow out of the gate this year but we're confident that we will intelligently spend $100 million or so in and around tuck-ins. again/We're focused primarily in on tuck ins because of the return profile of those. And as you know, these things are kind of lumpy. But we've got a good pipeline and we've got a number of deals that we're working on now that we think will come through for the second half of the year and we will be right where we said we would be. Operator : Our next question comes from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale : First question I had is actually on the special waste environment. We do this survey every quarter and it -- the results of the survey said everything was strong but special waste looked a little weak. I don't know if it's just a quirk in our survey so wondering what you were seeing? Don Slager : For us, Q2 is, again, from a comp perspective a little tougher for us because we had a pretty large job last year on the West Coast that did not repeat and again, you know that again, a big job like that, you've got to throw off your year-over-year comparison. Our first half special waste was -- remained about 3% above our three-year average so overall, we're still trending in -- we think in a good way. So remember, too, that a portion of our special waste is manufacturing related, that manufacturing waste is reccurring while you stream and those continue to be very stable and strong. And then the event business, similarly related to land clearing and construction, tends to be sporadic. That's what we're seeing. It's not that unusual that we would see these kind of movements. So we're -- I know overall construction remains pretty positive for us. So we think over the long term, we're still in pretty good shape there. Corey Greendale : Okay and then I actually had a question on recycling. The -- as you have done some restructuring in that business, I imagine we've all been focused on what happens when commodity prices are down; now it's actually trending up. Is there a formula you can give us? I think in the K, you've given us a formula each $10 per ton change. Does X to revenue and operating income, how that formula changes as you've restructured those contracts? Don Slager : I think the formula is basically the same so for every $10 change in commodity prices for our basket of commodities it has about $0.03 in EPS impact on the business. Corey Greendale : And you all see that changing -- sorry? Don Slager : Well, it will change as we continue to change the contract. So what we'll do, Corey, is when we make enough progress, we'll reevaluate it and we'll update then -- probably and hopefully by the time we get to guidance next year, we'll have a new view of that. Corey Greendale : I'm going to ask One real last quick one if you'll let me which is Chuck, can you give us-- which quarter do you expect the reversal of the extra day to hit? Chuck Serianni : It's going to hit in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Box : So I appreciate the comments earlier that you guys have narrowed the gap between core price and yield and maybe I'm reading into the a bit much but when you look at core price, your open market component in Q2 was 4.1%; that's down from where it was that in 1Q and it's down from I think it was 4.8% last year. I guess I would have thought that, that this lever would have been pulled a little bit harder given the restricted component is down on CPI. Is there anything that we can point to that would maybe explain some of the moderation or is it just tough comps? Chuck Serianni : I think we need to keep in mind that core price includes the anniversarying of recycling collection prices that we pushed real hard in Q1 of last year. So because those anniversaried, we had a little bit of a headwind in core price but as we mentioned before, even though we had that headwind, we were able to keep average yield consistent at 2%. Don Slager : And Joe, our expectation is with, one, our focus on price and our internal controls around price and then our tools and Tyler mentioned synergy -- our Capture and PBS so with our tools, we keep a very close eye on that. We're rewarding salespeople for selling intelligently so we think and plus the market the general market has been strong. Growth has been there and our whole strategy around growth differentiation. We think our value proposition to our customers continues to improve, right? All of that directionally says that we think we're going to continue to experience decent pricing in the open market because we will earn it and we can help offset some of these costs that we just can't normally offset through productivity so nothing has really changed in our MO or in the overall structure of the market. Joe Box : So then it's fair to say then that some of your bigger open market classes or products like commercial and landfill are good probably seeing similar, if not better core pricing? Don Slager : Well, remember on landfill, specifically MSW, most of the waste that comes in is municipal under long term contracts. We have very little open market MSW coming into our landfills any more, just because we have priced those assets according to what a realistic return is for running a landfill. So but we do see decent pricing across the board. Joe Box : And then Don, just a question for you on some of the customer-facing initiatives that you alluded, the eCommerce in the release. I certainly get that this is aimed at reducing churn and if you do that, you guys could boost revenue and margins. So I'm curious, have you started to see the meaningful reduction in churn from the systems. And I guess more generally, when you guys think about pursuing a project like this, how do you measure the returns associated with it and what's your expected payback period? Don Slager : Well, two things, right? The rollout of click-to-buy or eCommerce tools, right? We -- as I said in my commentary, we're already seeing very high percentage of new business coming through in those markets where we rolled it out. So the return comes from the fact that, that new business shows up with a lower cost of acquisition because basically people are self-serving, right? They are shopping online; they're making the business -- the buying choice without having the interface with a live human being knocking on doors. And then secondly, those online purchases tend to be and have been at a higher than average price because the convenience of shopping online has value. On top of that, those purchases have come with, frankly, a higher degree of contract compliance where customers are opting in for -- to a service agreement because of the convenience of everything. So all of those things have value and now that the tools are proven, they are really user friendly and now they are rolled out almost across all of our markets. We have to just continue to push participation and the payback will be there. And frankly, if you look around the consumerism, that's where it is today. And we've been probably a little late to the game as an industry but I think as an industry, we're probably ahead of many of the other people out there and certainly smaller competitors who don't have the capability or the resources to do this and that's, of course, part of our differentiation strategy, right? We've got to meet customers where they want to be, they want to do business they want do business, so overall, it's just one more slice of how we're going to compete in the market? How we're going to grow revenue intelligently and how we're going to do it ultimately at a lower cost to acquire. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : So on the volume side, did that -- do you see any -- of the underlying volume, did you see any discernible trends through the quarter and is it on track through July? Don Slager : Yes, I would say that we're on track. We're exactly where we thought we be. I actually -- as we said before, we're at the high end of our guidance right now. So we feel very comfortable with the volume growth we've seen in the velocity that we have for the rest of the year. Michael Feniger : Okay and was there anything specific, any region or were there any slowdown as you went through the quarter? Don Slager : No, this is Don. I would say it's very broad-based across geographies, across most lines of business. So again, it's a -- we talk about the fundamentals being strong. We talk about the fact that we're still mid-cycle in the recovery. All of those things are pointing in the right direction. So we think it's a solid quarter and as Chuck said, we're reiterating guidance. We're saying that we think we'll l perform to the high end of that, as long as commodities hold up and the volume side as well. So we're pretty pleased with how the business is performing today and the economy is cooperating. Michael Feniger : Just my last question, I think restricted pricing was 1.5%. Is this the bottom that we should see with how we've been seeing CPI trend or is this going to take another step lower in the second half of the year? Chuck Serianni : Yes, this is pretty much the bottom right now in terms of restrictive pricing. Obviously, we've got a little bit of a CPI headwind in the second half of the year but that's already contemplated in our guidance. But the should be close to the bottom right now. Don Slager : Yes, because what you will see probably sequentially, Mike, right, is that as we -- the majority of our price resets right around the second half of the year, right? So you're going to start picking up the 2015 CPI environment in the restricted pricing in the second half of 2016 and into the first half of 2017. But the one thing obviously is that we're going to maintain this 2% average yield and the way we're going to do that is with a little bit better pricing in the open market. Chuck talked about some of the recycling collection pricing that we did last year Q2 that anniversaried to bring it more in line with what we charged on the solid waste side and we're going to see more of that in the second half of this year to offset the CPI headwind, right? Chuck Serianni : And on top of that we're also going to continue to convert people to the alternative indices and we're also going to deal with the -- some of the pricing that we have today in and around the recycling to make that fair for us. That's going to continue to happen through this cycle and then as we've always said, a little bit of inflation is good and if we see some of that come through that, at some point, will help us well. Don Slager : But also remember, right, we've been managing in this low CPI environment for quite a long time now and I think we've done it pretty effectively. So If you think about the number of years we've -- what's it, 1.6% average CPI? Chuck Serianni : 1.1% over the last verdict. Don Slager : We maintained our margins. We continue to produce strong free cash so this business is built to withstand it and I think there's upside on the horizon. So -- Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Brian Butler : This is Brian Butler in for Michael today. The first question, just on the margins. In the first half, on EBITDA margins, first and second quarters it was down, I think around 40 or 50 basis points and when you think about getting to the midpoint or the high end of your guidance, that means there's about another 120 -- 100 to 120 basis points in the second half. How should we think about that from a waiting perspective in third and fourth quarters? Was that more back-end weighted to the fourth quarter where you see much stronger margins or is it going to be more even? Don Slager : So right now, keep in mind that here in the second quarter, the EBITDA margins were 28.3%, right? So consistent with last year, had a little bit of a headwind as we had mentioned in those margins because those legal settlements that we had talked about. So if you back those out, you're close to that 28.5% that we had guided to for the year. In the back half of the year, we continue to see strong EBITDA margins. keep in mind that work day that I had talked about will also benefit the margins in the fourth quarter of the year so right now, we still feel very comfortable with our EBITDA margin guidance. Chuck Serianni : And we have said, our operating costs are improving, right? We think that continues through the second half; again, this legal settlement doesn't repeat. Those are the things that will continue to pull that EBITDA margin up through the end of the year. Don Slager : Brian, you are probably going to see a heavier weighting to Q4 than Q3 again because of the workday that Chuck mentioned, we're going to get a benefit from that but also we have an easier comp in the fourth quarter from the EBITDA margin performance in the prior year so most of it will be weighted to Q4. Brian Butler : Okay and what was the benefit from the day? Did you guys give that? Chuck Serianni : Well, just think of it this way is that in the first quarter when we actually had one extra day, it was about 50 basis point drag on margin so think of something similar in Q4 but obviously flipping the other way. Brian Butler : Okay. And then I just on a follow-up question, when you talked a little bit on the service upgrades looking better, can you give a little bit more color on those trends on the commercial side of the business and are you seeing any recessionary signs for many of the commercial customers? Don Slager : No, the trends are just moderately incrementally better but nothing negative. Chuck Serianni : We continue to get strong price on the small container piece of the business, once again for the quarter, it was 3.7% for the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Misha Levental of Wedbush. Please go ahead. Misha Levental : Just wanted to turn to the residential side for a second and the contracts you decided not to renew, I get the reason for shedding unprofitable volumes but just wondering what happens to these volumes? And where do the volumes go and how much capacity do you guys have left to shed? Don Slager : Well, I guess, I won't share with you what we think we have to shed because frankly, we go into this thinking that as contracts come up for renewals, that because of our relationships, because of our great service, because of all the work we're doing to improve the customer interfaces, we think we'll be able to extend the business. But this issue of having some contract losses is just the nature of our business for as long as we have been doing this. The point I'm pointing to it is that we had this little CPI environment for many years. We've taken it on the chin with certain customers and we get to a point of renegotiation and we have to express to a customer that when we entered into this agreement five or 10 years ago, we expected to see a 3% or 3.25% price increase as we modeled in old CPI. Instead, we have seen 1.6% or less price increase and our costs are going up at 2% or 2.25%. If a customer's not willing to understand the cost model and thinks that we're going to take another price reduction to go forward and it doesn't meet our return criteria, even though we may love the customer and enjoy being good citizen and good part of the community, we've got to have a return that's appropriate. So this is just business. Right now we're just pointing out that we expected to lose some of those contracts in Q2. That's why we saw the -- one of the reasons we saw the reduction from 2% volume growth in Q1 to 0.5%. I don't want to blow it out of proportion, it's just part of the business but it gets a little lumpy and when it happens, we've got to point it out. But at the same time, we're having a lot of other successes in extending business and improving our work and our value, building strong relationships. Bringing the better service and the differentiation model that we talk about so overall, net-net of net, directionally, the economy has been good to us. The Company is growing, our people are executing, the initiatives are deployed and we're seeing the benefits in the numbers. The quarter is performing right in line with where we thought we would be. And we're, again, saying that we're on top of our guidance and we expect it to hit at the upper end if we continue with just the same pricing -- or in commodity sales. So don't blow that out of proportion. Misha Levental : Okay. And just turning really quick to -- of the refinancing that you guys accomplished, is there any additional room or opportunity for additional refinancings down the road or what's the state of affairs over there? Brian DelGhiaccio : This is Brian. The reality of it is that we start seeing a number of maturities coming due beginning in 2018, right? So I think we've got maturities every year from 2018 through 2023 so that's the more likely scenario, as those maturities come to term, you will see us then obviously issue new debt at the market rates at that point in time. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Don Slager : Thank you, Nicole. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you all for spending time with us today. Have a good evening and be safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for being with us today. Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our strategy, a profitable growth through differentiation. Our solid performance resulted from simultaneously growing price and volume, higher recycled commodity prices, and continuing to execute our strategic initiatives. As expected, margins expanded in the third quarter, keeping us well-positioned to achieve our full year EBITDA margin goal. Highlights of the quarter include adjusted EPS of $0.62, which exceeded our expectations. Our results were positively impacted by solid performance across our business and a lower tax rate. We now expect to exceed the upper end of our original guidance range. Adjusted free cash flow was $239 million during the quarter; we now expect to meet or exceed the upper end of our original guidance range. Core price was 3.2% and average yield was 2.1%. Average yield improved sequentially even with a step-down in CPI-based pricing. We continue to see relatively higher average yield in our small container commercial and large container businesses. A majority of these customers are in open markets, where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform. Third quarter volumes increased 60 basis points. We continue to see broad-based volume growth across our business, which was tempered by intentionally shedding certain volumes performed on behalf of brokers and municipal residential work that does not meet our return criteria. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 80 basis points to 28.9% from 28.1% in the prior year. A favorable reduction in operating cost drove 20 basis points of margin expansion and lower SG&A costs resulted in 60 basis points of margin expansion. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned $622 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 6.5 million shares repurchased for $312 million. We remain on track to complete our goal of $400 million of share repurchases during 2016. Regarding our revenue enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $375 million in annual revenue that has been converted to a waste-related index or fixed rate increase of 3% or more for the annual price adjustment. Second, approximately 1.7 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 50% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity. Third, we expanded our product offerings on our e-commerce platform. Customers can now purchase small container, temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This technology addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower cost sales channel. And finally, we opened our last customer resource center, located in Indianapolis. We continue to consolidate the customer service function from 100 different locations into three and expect the transition to be complete by the end of 2017. Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 18% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 74% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 90% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet standardized maintenance program, up from 74% a year ago. The entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017. As a result of our third quarter performance and expectation that recycled commodity prices remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full-year financial guidance. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $2.19 to $2.20, which is an increase from our original guidance of $2.13 to $2.17. Adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be $840 million to $850 million, which is an increase from our original guidance of $820 million to $840 million. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck? Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $65 million, or 2.8% over the prior year. This 2.8% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.5% and acquisitions of 30 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, total average yield grew 2.1% over the prior year; average yield in the collection business was 2.6%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business, 2.3% yield in the large container business, and 1.5% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.7%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing price restrictions. Total price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.2%. Core price consisted of 4.3% in the open market and 1.4% in the restricted portion of our business. Second, our total volumes increased 60 basis points. Volumes increased 30 basis points in the small container business, and 1% in the large container business. As expected volumes in the residential business declined 1.1%. Volume growth in the small container business reflects a 60 basis point impact from shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have grown approximately 1%. The decline in residential volumes resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full-year guidance. The post-collection business made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes increased 2.5%. Landfill volumes consisted of growth in MSW of 1.9%, and C&D of 13.4%, partially offset by decline in special waste of 3.6%. The decline in special waste volume relates to two large event-driven remediation jobs in the prior year that did not repeat. Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 60 basis points. The change primarily relates to decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.38 in the third quarter from $2.63 in the prior year, a decrease of 9%. The current average diesel price is $2.48 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. Next, energy services revenue decreased 30 basis points due to decline in drilling activity. And finally, commodity revenue increased 70 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue includes higher processing fees charged to third-parties, and an increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 12% to $133 per ton in the third quarter from $119 per ton in the prior year. Third quarter total recycling volume of 655,000 tons was essentially flat with the prior year. Cost of goods sold was up 13% from an increase in rebates paid for recycled commodities. Now, I will discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 28.9%, from 28.1% in the prior year. Of the 80 basis points of margin expansion, the impact from higher recycled commodity prices contributed 10 basis points. The remaining 70 basis points of margin expansion relates to. First, a 10 basis point improvement in cost of operations resulting from price increases in excess of our cost inflation and realizing the benefit from our fleet-based initiatives and second, a 60 basis point improvement in SG&A costs resulting from favorably settling a legal matter, price increases in excess of our cost inflation and leveraging our fixed cost structure while growing volumes. The favorable legal settlement reduced third quarter SG&A cost by approximately 40 basis points, which more than offset legal charges recorded earlier this year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Third quarter 2016 interest expense was $89 million, which includes $12 million of non-cash amortization, both interest amounts exclude the refinancing charge. As discussed on our second quarter call, we tendered and replaced hard coupon debt in early July. Associated with refinancing, we incurred a $0.36 charge in the third quarter, which was recorded for loss on extinguishment of debt. The refinancing activity will save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS. Our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 37%, the lower tax rate in the third quarter resulted in a $0.02 EPS benefit. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $239 million and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $576 million. After considering the timing of working capital, our year-to-date performance keeps us well-positioned to achieve our upwardly revised full-year guidance. Now, I will turn the call back to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Chuck. Before closing, I would like to discuss the 2017 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release. We are currently midway through our annual planning process, and based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions, we project the following : Adjusted earnings per share of $2.31 to $2.36; and adjusted free cash flow of $875 million to $900 million. Both performance metrics represent mid to high single-digit growth. Consistent with our prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February 2017. To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance, as a result of continuing to focus on our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, together with solid operational execution, we expanded margins by simultaneously growing price and volume, reducing costs and leveraging our scale, delivered earnings and free cash flow growth and improved return on invested capital and increased cash returns to shareholders through a balanced mix of dividends and share repurchases. Through our focus on managing the business for the long-term, we continue to create lasting shareholder value. Before going to Q&A, I'd like to discuss some recent events. In September, Republic was named to the gold standard of sustainability rankings, and was the only company in our industry included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Our customers have told us that sustainability is important to them, and we believe that it drives profitability and long-term value creation. We are proud of our progress in this area and the external recognition we've received is best-in-class. With respect to Hurricane Matthew, we're happy to report that we made immediate contact with all Republic employees and all are safe. Our facilities and assets did not incur any material damage and we were fully operational in all locations within days of the hurricane. We are committed to providing the high level of service required to address the needs of our customers. At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Slager. Your first question will come from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Ken C. Wang: Thank you. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Thanks for taking my question. So, just looking at the EPS beat for the quarter, it looks like part of it was driven by lower than expected other category expense within SG&A. Just wondering if you could speak a little bit more about what that was, what in particular drove that? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. We had a legal settlement during the quarter that benefited us in the SG&A line by about 40 basis points. Donald W. Slager: There is about $0.01 of EPS. Ken C. Wang: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just on Hurricane Matthew, was there any revenue effect during the quarter? Donald W. Slager: No, not really \u2013 negligible. When these things occur, what will happen is, you will have some business closings that are a decrease in revenue, but then you'll also have some cleanup effect, that is an increase and then at some point, maybe some ongoing construction, debris hauling that impacts the business. We also have some cost increases along the way as we take care of our people. We move all of our trucks to higher ground so that they are safe and sound. We do a lot of planning and work so that we can get right back to work. So we put a lot of emphasis in on the front-end, so we can get right back to work and take advantage of some revenue as it comes in, but our focus is employees, assets and then hopefully a little bit of cleanup that we can do, but net of net it's immaterial. Ken C. Wang: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question will be from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Good afternoon. Thank you. Just had a question on the volume environment, Don, how would you characterize that? Did you see sort of normal seasonality, are the U.S. elections impacting special waste projects being pushed out? And there is some noise, given you are shutting low margin business. So just trying to get a sense of how you \u2013 how we should think about just the underlying volume environment given some of these moving parts here. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Sure. Let me back up a minute, Hamzah, let's first focus on the preliminary outlook we gave you for 2017, which really says that we think the ongoing trends, underlying rational behavior in the business, underlying economy and the trajectory for the business is good into next year. So we're not seeing anything on a real true trending basis that's got us concerned, we think things are going to be fine. On a localized basis, you mentioned impact of the election, yeah, we do see every four years when we get into this election cycle, some impacts to certain maybe major event jobs being pushed or delayed. I think we're seeing a little bit of that in special waste, right now. Roll-off has been pretty solid for us. We had a little lower growth in roll-off this quarter than last, but we also got higher price. So, we specifically went into the market, because of demand, and asked for a little more price in our open-top temporary roll-off business. So, there is nothing there that has us concerned. And again, I'd just point you to next year. On the commercial side, we've talked a lot about construction coming back that's been our leading growth headline, but we saw in Q3, the first positive or I'd say, the best positive sales growth year-over-year in our small container business in two years. And if you net out the losses \u2013 the broker losses, which were intentional and non-regrettable, it was a really great quarter for us. And that's on top of four out of the past five quarters in that business have had a 3.6% yield to boot. So a solid yield, solid growth and again, shutting a business that's \u2013 that doesn't have the right return is the right thing to do for us. And we're going to continue to do that. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Right. Very helpful. And then just a follow-up question, you mentioned 80 bps of margin expansion, there's some one-time items in there, may be around the legal matter you referenced. Is 30% still a short-term margin target to think of for you guys? Just trying to get a sense of normalized annual margin expansion that we should be thinking about going forward? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Well, I guess, it depends on your definition of short-term, Hamzah. For us, we think 30% EBITDA margin is certainly within our grasp, some things have to go right for us. We got to see continued growth in our best lines of business like small container, which we saw in Q3, we got to see landfill growth continue. Remember, if not for the change in CPI in the fall-off in recycling commodities that we saw following 2011, we'd be at 31% margins today. So, those two things alone have really slowed us down, those are the big headwinds we face, we're spending a lot of time in reimagining the recycling business, we've closed our facilities that don't meet the return criteria. We've invested in others that do, so, we're still committed to recycling for customers, that are willing to pay. We've continued to make good decisions there, we're converting more and more of our municipal business to a fair and reasonable price escalator. So, those things are going to continue over the next several years and we think we'll get back to 30%, we think this business can certainly handle that, and we think that sort of the structural nature of the industry will allow it. So... Charles F. Serianni: Hamzah, I'd say that our third quarter results reflects that also, holding aside the fact that about 10 basis points of our margin expansion during the quarter was the result of commodities, we talked about 40 basis points due to that legal reversal that we had. But on top of that, you've got 10 basis points of leverage in the operating cost line and another 20 basis points of leverage in SG&A. So, we're starting to see all the fruits of our labor. Donald W. Slager: The preliminary outlook we gave you, Hamzah, includes ongoing positive growth, ongoing positive yield and ongoing margin expansion in 2017. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I'd like to just pick up right there on some of the internal levers for the margin expansion. You mentioned the consolidation of customer service, can you kind of help us understand how that and some of the other restructuring initiatives might be creating some of this leverage, let's say, on the SG&A side, as well as in the operating cost side. Maybe just get into a little bit more detail on what's being done internally to help drive that expansion? Thanks. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, that's great question. So, first remember, when we first told you about the consolidation of the Customer Resource Centers, we were doing that at the same time we were going through an organizational restructuring here, by combining a couple layers of management, which that's complete. But we also said, the net effect of that is not really going to be fully achieved till 2018, right. So, we won't see the full effect of the CRC consolidation until 2018. So, that's one of them. There are ongoing improvements in the business all the time around productivity, around fleet. We expect our maintenance cost to moderate in Q4, we're putting a lot of effort into building what I call the most reliable fleet in the industry that's our goal. We think that reliable fleets going to continue to help us with driving employee turnover down, employee engagement up, tech turnover down, all those other things. And so, there is a lot of things going on in there that are worth sort of basis points at a time. Remember on the CapEx side, we're going to save $200 million as a one-time CapEx savings from the One Fleet initiative and an ongoing about $20 million, $25 million a year from aging the fleet very methodically. So, there is no one thing and that's the issue, there is a lot of little things we got to do better across the whole enterprise and I think that's what the result show. Noah Kaye : That's very helpful. Thank you. Second question, I think you'd signaled a target spend on M&A of around $100 million, I guess you spent about $30 million so far this year. How do you see the M&A landscape now? Are things heating up? How do you feel about kind of the near-term opportunities set? Do you think you'll get close to that $100 million after all? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So first I wouldn't say that the M&A pipeline is heating up, we would say that's fairly consistent. We think we will spend you know near the $100 million this year. We're looking to spend that very intelligently. So, it was very light in the front half of the year. We've got enough deals in process, we think to \u2013 again intelligently put that $100 million to work in the remainder of the year. So, we're going to continue to do that, as far as the pipeline looking forward, our estimates for next year would include that $100 million as well. So, again we're looking for the right companies. We're looking for the companies that are in our again tuck-in market where we can just basically tack them on to, built them on to existing operations. We're looking for good business with reoccurring revenue, right. So we're not buying junk. And again we're buying those things at about five times post synergy EBITDA. So, that's our outlook. We think we'll have the opportunity to do that this year and next year, as well. Noah Kaye : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Misha Levental : Hi, guys. This is Misha Levental on for Al. In terms of your progress converting customers over to waste \u2013 waste index and other fixed rates. Could you maybe talk about your expected progress for next year, should it be kind of consistent to what we saw this year or how do you guys see that tracking? Donald W. Slager: Well it's a little hard to project that here, because as you can probably appreciate it's a little bit lumpy right. This is going to depend on timing of when certain contracts roll over and it's going to depend on size. So as we've said, we've started with smaller contracts and customers and moving into medium and larger. So it will get a little more difficult as time goes and we're also hoping to see that the market rationality will change along with us. So we've kind of led this process. Frankly, it has to continue to change because it's illogical for waste companies to enter into five year and seven year agreements with a CPI that averages 1.5%, when everyone in this industry will tell you that their cost increases, average to. So it's a logical that it would continue to be CPI based, we're setting the tone for that, we're starting to see certain market activity that would lead us to believe that it's being more and more well accepted by customers. So we're just going to keep at it. We're not going to enter into new agreements that have decreasing value over time. So it's just going to be work in progress, and we're going to have to just report as we go, because as I said, it's a little bit lumpy based on size of contract and timing. Misha Levental : Great. And as a follow-up, the strength of volume is really quick. Thanks for the broader 2017 guidance and maybe understanding that further detail will come in February, but looking at volume versus this year, volume was better kind of in the front half of the year, kind of tailing down sequentially. Should we expect somewhat of a reverse trend or a similar trend in 2017, or what's the expectation there? Charles F. Serianni: We're looking at volume growth to be relatively consistent from what we saw in 2016. And we'll give you more guidance on that in February. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So remember when we came out in Q1 of this year, we came out with really strong volume numbers and we warned everybody that it was a tough comp to last year. And we let everybody know that the volume was going to trend down over through the course of the year on a year-over-year basis. So, let's not get confused about tough comps and year-over-year analysis. We think the trends are solid, as I said in my earlier comments, we think the underlying fundamentals are strong. And again, we gave you preliminary outlook for 2017, which includes positive volume, positive yield and margin expansion, which is \u2013 again says that we believe our businesses are going to continue to improve and there's nothing on the horizon that makes us think otherwise. Misha Levental : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Feniger of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael J. Feniger: Yeah. Thanks, guys. We saw the impact you laid out this quarter from walking away from some national accounts and brokerage business. I'm just curious when we start thinking about 2017, I mean, could we see a similar headwind in 2017? Or do you see less room to walk away from that type of business or less of a headwind because of that? Donald W. Slager: Well, we're not giving 2017 guidance today, so we'll start there. Again, we are \u2013 we've stepped out and committed to a strategy that frankly doesn't include enabling brokers. And so, we don't think they are good for our business, we don't think they add value to our customers, and we're certainly not going to continue to basically provide services for brokers who basically won't pay us a proper return and frankly drive a wedge between us and our customers. So that model is underway, we're going to continue to work through it, we are part-way through it. We think the underlying volume trends in the overall economy and with our products and our attention to quality and the improvement in our sales force, we'll continue to reap the benefit of growth even as we shed business that's not profitable. So overall, we are just not going to enter into agreements to do business for practice, and we are not going to enable competitors along the way. So that's life as we see it at Republic Services. So, I hope all my team is listening. Michael J. Feniger: Makes sense. And when we talk about the yield and specifically the price, the restricted pricing portion, you know, fell back again obviously because of CPI resets. I'm just curious, that 1.4%, is that the bottom now or is that actually going to step-down again in Q4 and the first half of 2017? Charles F. Serianni: That should be close to the bottom. We would expect that to be close to the bottom. Donald W. Slager: But I think the other thing to remember too is that you saw the step-up in the open market such that actually the overall yield actually improved sequentially, right. So we were able to more than overcome that step-down in CPI-based pricing, which is exactly what we thought we were going to do. Michael J. Feniger: Thanks, guys. Operator : And the next question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Donald W. Slager: Hi Tyler. How are you? Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, good. Nice quarter. Hey Chuck, I know the 2017 outlook is preliminary, it's obviously subject to refinement. But can you give us any sense of the magnitude of EBITDA margin expansion? I mean, are you guys looking at closing in on 29%, or any color there? Charles F. Serianni: You know, we'll give you a lot more color on that in February, obviously we \u2013 as Don had mentioned, we think that 30% EBITDA margins is something that is achievable over a number of years and we are certainly going to progress towards that goal in 2017. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay. That's good. And then just a quick housekeeping item, what should we expect for quarterly interest expense? Donald W. Slager: Well, I think you saw, Tyler, if you take a look at the quarterly interest expense that we talked about, which was $89 million or so total with $12 million of non-cash amortization, that's reflective of a full quarter post our transaction, so you can probably extrapolate that and get pretty close. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. And then Don, any updates on the coal ash side? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Let me pitch in on that last question, and then I'll let Al (33:58) talk to coal ash. Also keep in mind Tyler that the impact of the low CPI that we saw in 2015, that's anniversary out of the second half of 2017, that's going to be in our margin little bit in 2017. And then, the full benefits as I said earlier of the Customer Resource Center consolidation, that's really get till 2018, but if you ask every one of my team members about, are we focused on 30% margins, they'll tell you, yeah, we think the business can get there and then we've got plans in place to negate some of these headwinds and overcome it, so that's what we're thinking. On coal ash, there is not a lot of activity from our perspective, the couple of contracts that have been let, we weren't well-positioned geographically for those and they went really cheap. I'm frankly disappointed to see how cheaply they went. We still think coal ash is more of a 2018 story. And there'll be a big event that occurs and then it's going to be a business decline. So, it's not a business that we're going to put a lot of effort into to be in that space long-term, but we are situated geographically to take advantage of the volume, we certainly will, we got capacity, we're well situated around the states where this stuff is generated. And I think we'll get our fair share as long as the pricing is reasonable. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Cool. And then Brian, one quick question actually for Brian. Are you seeing any unusual inflation in your upper layers of insurance, something I've actually been hearing quite a lot about from the truckers, is there anything unusual going on there? Brian M. DelGhiaccio: No, I mean when we take a look at how we've been able to renew our policies, I would say it's a relatively normal cost inflation. So we haven't seen anything abnormal to date. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay, cool. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question will come from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Don, can you expand, what did you mean on that coal ash comment that longer-term you guys don't see yourselves having quite as much of a hand in that? Donald W. Slager: Well, I'd say this, look I mean it's a business that the \u2013 there's going to be over time less and less electricity produced by coal plants. So this big cleanup that's going to occur from all the stockpile of coal ash will be an event that lasts a number of years. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) All right. Donald W. Slager: We will participate in that. Again remember, big generators are going to want to build monofills. So you're going to have to be \u2013 make a big dedicated play to give up a portion of your landfill to handle their needs. We can do that, we certainly are prepared to do that, we're in conversations to do that today, but over time after all the big cleanup is completed, whether people do it on site and they build their own landfills or whether we do it for them, over time there is going to be a decreasing amount of coal ash generated in this country based on regulation and based on the cheap cost of natural gas. So there are people who think just a regulation change alone is going to bring coal back, but I'll tell you with the cheap cost of natural gas that's \u2013 there is an economic decision there, right. So, we just have to wait and see. And again, we don't know yet how many of these producers are going do it themselves. We think that well-capitalized ones will, because again they can build it into their capital base, and they can make a return on it with their \u2013 with the rate payers. The smaller, less well-capitalized players may not. But I would sit here today and tell you that many of their generators don't really have a well-thought-out plan yet. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay. Donald W. Slager: And remember, only one state so far has come out with rules. And while the Feds have passed the rules, only one state has passed rules, so the remaining states have not yet. So it's just still early. So what's the stat, how many landfills do we have in the states that produce this stuff? Charles F. Serianni: About 10 states produce about 50% of the coal ash, and we've got over half our landfills in those states, we're very well-positioned. Donald W. Slager: So on that alone, I think we'll play in this space, but we'll let you know as it evolves, it's just \u2013 we don't think it's a 2017 story. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay. Yeah. And recycling, I know that it's about 9% of your sales. It's coming off at lows, the commodities are up and the tonnage seems to be up. How much of your 2017 guidance is predicated on improvements in recycling or is that just the icing on the cake if we see... Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Well, as I said in my comments, our 2017 preliminary outlook is based on current trends in the business, which would mean current rates for... Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay. Donald W. Slager: ... sales of material. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay. Got it. Thank you. Donald W. Slager: Great. Operator : And the next question will come from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Brian Butler : Good afternoon. This is actually Brian in for Michael. Thank you for taking my questions. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Brian. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Brian. Brian Butler : First one, just on the SG&A benefit from the legal settlement, that 40 basis points. Is that an ongoing benefit or was that a one-time thing that now reverses going forward or your legal fee is just going to be lower now that it's settled? Charles F. Serianni: That was a one-time benefit and what that did, was negated a legal cost that we've incurred earlier in the year, so that \u2013 but that was one time. Brian Butler : Okay. So we should think about SG&A going back to some normalized level and not that 40 basis been pulled out in the future. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. Around 10.5% is what we are expecting. Brian Butler : Okay. And then, just second follow-up on the 2017 preliminary guidance, not to try to get more out of it, but when you think about the CapEx, was there anything unusual in that 2017 or is that more just kind of normal pace that we've seen in kind of the 2016. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. That's more of a normal pace, more of the same. Our CapEx is pretty straightforward, we've got good visibility into the CapEx, there's nothing unusual that we're expecting in 2017. Donald W. Slager: We'll continue to get benefit from methodically increasing the expected life of the fleet, through the One Fleet initiative as we've done for the last couple of years so that will continue now for couple of more years through that process, but just pretty consistent, that's one of the beauties of our business is, very consistent cash flow. We got a lot of our revenue under contract. Our CapEx draws is pretty consistent. Brian Butler : Great. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Denise. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment, and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you, everyone for spending time with us today. Have a good evening and be safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us, to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 performance. Our fourth quarter results capped off another solid year. Our financial performance continues to reflect our focus on executing our strategy, designed to profitably grow our business, manage our cost structure, generate consistent earnings and free cash flow growth, and improve return on invested capital. During the quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.57 which represents an increase of 14% over the prior year. Core price was 3.5% and average yield was 2.2%. Average yield remains above 2% even with below average contribution from CPI-based pricing. Volume growth was 50 basis points or 90 basis points excluding the impact from approximately one less work day. Our volume performance was in line with our expectations. And finally EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points to 27.9%. As expected, most of the improvement was due to a reduction in SG&A costs and leveraging operating cost while growing units. Turning to the year, adjusted EPS was $2.22 and adjusted free cash flow was $885 million. Both performance metrics exceeded the upper end of our guidance ranges. Core price was 3.3% and average yield was 2.1%. Full year volume growth was 1%. This is the fourth straight year of simultaneous price and volume growth. And finally, EBITDA margin expanded 20 basis points to 28.3%. Importantly throughout 2016, we continued to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, which include our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. For our customers, we strive to provide the highest level of customer service, and are committed to developing differentiated and superior products. Some of our accomplishments during 2016 include the following. First, we expanded our product offerings on our e-commerce platform. Customers are purchasing small container, temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This technology addresses the evolving needs of our customers buying preferences, and provides a lower cost sales channel. Second, we improved the capabilities and functionality of our customer portal and mobile app with approximately 1.8 million customers now enrolled. This represents an increase of over 50% from the prior year. And third, we opened three customer resource centers designed to enhance our customers' experience through a more professionally trained customer service team, improved technology and additional communication channels. We have already transitioned approximately 50% of our call volume to the new centers and expect the transition to be complete by the end of 2017. For the communities we serve, we remain devoted to delivering safe, convenient and value-driven solutions while being good stewards of the environment. With respect to safety, we continue to see a favorable reduction in employee incidence and our performance remains over 40% better than the industry average. On the sustainability front, we are recognized as the industry leader with awards from the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and Carbon Disclosure Project that are both best-in-class. For our employees, training and developing our people is a priority and we strive to be the employer of choice. Over 33,000 employees recognize the progress we have made and have told us they see the difference. For example, in 2016, we saw the largest gain in employee engagement since we began measuring employee engagement five years ago. And employee turnover continues to improve. Our driver turnover rate is at its lowest level in four years. And for our stakeholders, we remain committed to creating long-term value and 2016 was a perfect example. Our strong performance included EBITDA margin expansion, high-single-digit earnings and free cash flow growth, and approximately 20 basis points of ROIC improvement. We returned $819 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a cash yield of approximately 5%. And, finally, we delivered total shareholder return of approximately 33%, which is nearly triple that of the S&P 500 average. I'm proud of our many achievements during 2016 and remain encouraged by the underlying strength of our business. I want to thank the entire Republic team for their hard work and execution. Chuck will now discuss the financial results in more detail. Chuck? Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $89 million or 3.9% over the prior year. This 3.9% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 3.6% and acquisitions of 30 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, total average yield grew 2.2% over the prior year. Average yield in the collection business was 2.7%, which includes 3.8% yield in the small container business, 2.4% yield in the large container business, and 1.6% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.7%. It should be noted that a majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing price restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.5%. Core price consisted of 4.7% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business. Second, our total volumes increased 50 basis points over the prior year, or 90 basis points excluding the impact from approximately one less workday. The following discussion of volume excludes the workday impact. Volumes increased 2.2% in the large container business. Volumes decreased 40 basis points in the small container business and 70 basis points in the residential business. Small container volumes include a 110 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have increased 70 basis points. The decline in residential volumes was expected and resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. Residential volume performance increased 40 basis points sequentially, as some of the losses from early in the year are beginning to anniversary. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 2.7%. Landfill volumes included growth in C&D of 14% and special waste of 1%. MSW volumes were consistent with the prior year. Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 10 basis points. The decrease resulted from lower fuel prices at the beginning of the quarter and the lag in our fuel recovery fee. In the fourth quarter, the average price per gallon of diesel increased 2% to $2.47 from $2.43 in the prior year. The current average diesel price is $2.57 per gallon. And, finally, commodity revenue increased 1%. The increase in commodity revenue includes higher processing fees charged to third-parties and an increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 24% to $134 per ton in the fourth quarter from $108 per ton in the prior year. Fourth quarter total recycling volume of 626,000 tons was down 2.5% versus the prior year. Cost of goods sold was up 20% from an increase in rebates paid for recycled commodities. Now I'll discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points to 27.9%. The improvement included a 90 basis point decrease in SG&A cost, partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in cost of operations. The 90 basis point decrease in SG&A was primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation and legal costs in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2016 SG&A expense was in line with our expectations at 10.5% of revenue. The 20 basis point increase in cost of operations is due to an increase in fuel expense primarily due to a larger CNG fuel credit recorded in the prior year. In 2015, the full year CNG fuel credit was recorded in the fourth quarter, whereas in 2016 the credit was recorded ratably. This timing difference increased fourth quarter 2016 fuel cost by 40 basis points. Excluding CNG credits, fourth quarter 2016 gross margin expanded 20 basis points. It should be noted that CNG credits expired at the end of 2016. On a full year basis EBITDA margin expanded 20 basis points to 28.3%. SG&A cost decreased 50 basis points to 10.3% from 10.8% in the prior year. We believe SG&A cost will continue to decline to 10% of revenue within the next couple of years. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Fourth quarter 2016 interest expense was $90 million, which included $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35.8%, which was favorably impacted by tax planning opportunities. The net impact of these tax items increased EPS by approximately $0.02 during the quarter. Full year adjusted free cash flow was $885 million. Cash flow exceeded the high end of our guidance range, due to lower than anticipated cash taxes of approximately $30 million. Excluding the benefit from cash taxes, adjusted free cash flow would have been $855 million. Now I'll turn the call back to the Don. Donald W. Slager: Before we go into Q&A, I will discuss our 2017 financial guidance. The details of our guidance are included in our 8-K filing. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.32 to $2.36, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided last October. Our expected performance represents high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth, after excluding an $0.08 headwind from an increase in our effective tax rate. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $875 million to $900 million, which is also consistent with our preliminary outlook. Our expected performance represents high single-digit to low double-digit growth, after excluding a $90 million increase in cash taxes. We expect the annual revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%. Selected components of our revenue guidance include average yield of approximately 2%. We expect the pricing environment in 2017 to be relatively similar to 2016. Volume growth in a range of 1% to 1.25%, contribution from recycled commodities of 50 basis points to 75 basis points, and acquisitions of 50 basis points. This relates primarily to tuck-in acquisitions and the rollover impact from 2016 transactions. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 28.5% to 28.7%. This represents 20 basis points to 40 basis points of margin expansion over our 2016 performance. 2017 net capital expenditures are expected to be $975 million, or 9.9% of revenue. We anticipate investing approximately $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions, and we expect to return approximately $900 million of total cash to shareholders through $450 million of dividends and $450 million of share repurchases. In summary, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and supportive of continued profitable growth. The investments we are making in our business and the solid execution of our strategy are producing positive results and creating long-term value. We remain focused on delivering consistent earnings and cash flow growth, improving return on invested capital and increasing cash returns to our shareholders. At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Derrick Laton : Hey, good afternoon. It's Derrick Laton on for Brian. How are you all? Donald W. Slager: Hi, Brian. Derrick Laton : Hey, just a couple questions on \u2013 so, on the M&A front, looks like you guys ended up spending maybe $60 million for tuck-ins in 2016. Just curious if this was maybe lack of sellers here, or maybe you guys just kind of being patient with regards to valuations, and then also just for your target for 2017 is there maybe some upside here given that kind of where things ended in 2016? Donald W. Slager: Well, a couple things. Yeah, I like your choice of word patience, we are I guess somewhat conservative on the side of acquisitions. We're not going to do bad deals just to hit an acquisition target goal. So we have confidence in the pipeline. We have had to walk away from couple of transactions, laid in due diligence, when we found things that we didn't think were acceptable, so we're going to buy good companies and good recurring cash flow. So there is the patience for you. As it relates to 2017, we've got a strong pipeline. We've got a number of deals in advance stages of due diligence already. So we again, we're confident that we'll put a $100 million to work intelligently in 2017. And as we always say, we've always got a little more capacity if there is more out there. But we're only going to buy things that fit and we think the pipeline will be good for us this year and the $100 million is just a good place to start. Derrick Laton : Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe if I could just shift gears quickly to the recycling side. I noticed on your outlook saying it should be maybe 0.5% to 0.75% increase for 2017. Could you maybe provide some color just kind of on how the recycling market is looking for you guys currently, and then maybe the cadence for that 0.5% to 0.75% increase, are you kind of expecting that mainly in Q1 and Q2? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So what we do there, Brian, (sic) [Derrick] is what we do every year, we \u2013 when we give guidance and this is something we've done again historically, for as long as I could remember, we \u2013 with things like fuel and commodities, we just try to peg the rate at the time we conclude our budget. So we've used a $140 per ton average for our commodity prices throughout the year, we want to stay away from speculating what the markets may or may not do, because you don't know some of these things tend to be volatile. We can provide you the detail of what happens for every $10 of improvement, and what that means to EPS, if you need that, certainly we can have Chuck provide that for you, but that's the way we do it. We think that's the smartest way to approach it rather than for us to try to forecast it with a crystal ball here. Charles F. Serianni: And just to put some more color around that, as Don mentioned, as we have disclosed in the past a $10 change in the average commodity price is worth about $0.03 in annual EPS. Now it's important to keep in mind that, that's based upon our average mix of materials and OCC makes up the most of our mix, but it's only 45% of the mix overall. Derrick Laton : Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys. Donald W. Slager: You bet. Charles F. Serianni: You're welcome. Operator : The next question is from Hamzah Mazari at Macquarie. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Good afternoon, thank you. Just a question on landfill volume expectation for 2017, you know, Don, what's baked into what you are expecting on the landfill volume side, I know overall volumes are 1%, just any thoughts qualitatively or quantitatively would be helpful? Donald W. Slager: Well, Hamzah, I think just directionally, right, as the boarder economy recovers, we're going to see just continued improvement in our small container business. We're going to \u2013 that will help drive our landfill volumes. We'll see continued improvement in \u2013 we think in the C&D business certainly. We know, we have strong trends coming out of Q4. We think those continue into next year, certainly not only for our own volumes, but the third-party volumes that come to our site. So there is no new big deal on the horizon, but special waste is pretty sort of normalized I would say going into next year. So I think just everything that we've laid out for our guidance, we think just strong underlying fundamentals continue to drive the business forward. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Great. And just to follow-up. You've made a lot of technology investments and ramped those up, just curious, what inning do you think you're in, in terms of seeing the benefits from some of the technology investments longer-term, whether it be route density or other areas you've invested in, just curious if you're in early innings or later innings? Thank you. Donald W. Slager: No. We thanks, Hamzah. We would class that as early innings, right. So, we're very happy with the course that we've charted, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from customers from our own teammates, employees, but we're going to be \u2013 continue to invest down that road and build out a digital platform, but we're early in the process. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Great. Thank you. Donald W. Slager: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Tyler Brown at Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, Chuck. So in the past, you guys have noted that the velocity of margin improvements really will ultimately be arbitrated by CPI, recycling prices, and, I guess, volume. So as we look at it, I mean, all of those things are kind of moving in the right direction and I think you even have a tailwind from some hedge rollovers here in 2017. And you obviously guided to the 28.5% to 27%, that's great, but I don't get the sense that that's really outside of what your original expectations were back in Halloween. So I'm just curious, big picture, if there is something that's working against the margins that maybe doesn't give you confidence that maybe the margins could improve more than 20 basis points to 40 basis points. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So, a couple things to keep in mind, Tyler, is that, first of all, the CPI lags. So whatever we print then in 2017, we won't see the benefit of that until the second half of 2018. So that's the first item. The second item is that you talked about the roll-off of the fuel hedges. What we need to keep in mind also is that the CNG credit goes away. So that's something that was available to us in 2016, but that doesn't repeat. And, also, right now, we're looking at overall higher fuel prices. So, thinking about the margin then, so we're talking about 20 basis points to 40 basis points of margin expansion. Think about 10 basis points of that coming from commodities, the rest coming from the core business, 30 basis points or so. So we see that as pretty strong and sustainable growth. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So let me chime in here too. Tyler. We'll see the full benefit of the CRC consolidation not until 2018, right. So that will layer in as well. And just, overall, right, we're talking about guidance that has high single-digit to low double-digit expansion, both in cash flow and EPS, right. So, we've got up really strong margin - Patrick Tyler Brown : Yeah, yeah. Donald W. Slager: Built in and I think the signs are positive. So we've got more tailwind than we do headwind at this point. So that's a good thing. Patrick Tyler Brown : Right, right. No, it feels like good momentum there. But \u2013 so, Don, I've got to ask you about maintenance and repair. So if I look at M&R, I think it was up only 2% year-over-year, which I think is the lowest level of inflation that we've seen in that line since maybe 2011. And I'm just curious if you're viewing this as maybe a big inflection? Is OneFleet finally starting to really permeate through that line or how should we think about that maintenance and repair line, kind of, going forward? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. You're right on, Tyler, I mean, we are seeing the benefits of OneFleet. As you know, all of the divisions now have gone through it. We'll finish certifying those remaining divisions that went through it in fourth quarter of last year. But we've got good results from OneFleet in Q4 and we expect to see those continue into 2017. So the initiative is paying off. And, remember, it's not just showing up in the R&M line. Fleet reliability shows up in customer service. Good customer service shows up in price. Reliable fleet show up in the lowest driver turnover we've seen it for years. So there is a lot of other benefits. And then, of course, the icing on the cake is the CapEx savings, right. So, we've saved $100 million so far as we've begun to very methodically age the fleet, extend the useful life of the fleet and we've got about another $100 million to go. So, OneFleet is a success in our minds and it's going to continue to pay dividends and that fleet reliability as it builds is going to continue to show up in other parts of the business for us. Patrick Tyler Brown : All right. Great, guys. Nice quarter. Thanks. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Tyler. Charles F. Serianni: Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the Andrew Buscaglia at Credit Suisse. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Hi, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Andrew. Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Andrew. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC So, I got to ask I noticed you talked in a little bit of energy services guide. I would think that you kind of keep that in your back pocket, but you guys must feel pretty confident that could have somewhat of an impact. Can you remind us how big that is right now as a percentage of your revenues? I mean it's pretty - Donald W. Slager: So it's about 1% right now, Andrew, in terms of overall revenue and what we've guided to is about 25 basis points of increase in that line of business during 2017. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. And what's your assumption there just I don't know in terms of like the energy market? Are you assuming things improving or just staying up where they are? Donald W. Slager: Pretty much consistent with where they are right now. We're beginning to see some rig increases, especially in the Permian Basin. And so that's what gives us the confidence to call out the 25 basis point increase. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. Charles F. Serianni: And you're right to point out. Things look better in that direction. They have historically. So again, as I just said to Tyler, there is more wind pushing us than in our face this year. So it's a good way to start the year out. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Yeah. Definitely. And yeah, the other topic, sort of the other topic du jour is your tax rate. Your stock certainly is reflecting some optimism there. Have you guys had conversations around this about what you would expect and how are you thinking about for the balance of this year? Charles F. Serianni: Well, I'll ask your one \u2013 I'll answer one question directly. We've had a lot of conversation about it, because as you know we are a statutory payer, right. And so, if and when there is some type of tax reform, we likely stand to be a beneficiary of that. So don't know when that will occur or how will occur, and as you know there are probably a number of levers that get pulled. So, we're not counting any of that just yet, but we certainly are thinking about how it might impact us. And so we're also taking the wait and see approach that you all do, but if there is some movement there, it's good for us. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC All right. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question is from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Ken C. Wang: Hi, this is Ken Wang on for Corey. Thanks for taking my question. So we understand Las Vegas is about to start the process of negotiating an extension with you in part because they want single-stream recycling. So just wondering, can you share any insight into the renewal process, how much capital you expect you may invest for single stream recycling and the likelihood of the contract going out to bid? Donald W. Slager: Well, as a rule, we don't discuss individual contracts or the individual contracts terms, and certainly not when we're negotiating contract. So I can't do that for you, but I will just tell you that, more broadly, we've get great relationships there again, in and around Las Vegas, our people do an outstanding job and we've got a strong track record there, and the best assets in the marketplace. So ultimately we think the business there will continue to perform inclusive of those contracts that are coming out, but that's all I can tell you about any contract that we're in the midst of negotiating, today. Ken C. Wang: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Kaye at Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe we can start with the commercial business, really seeing again nice growth in small container and large container, I think particularly the small container given the intentional shutting of business. With that, can you may be update us on where your current commercial churn rate is and have we maybe reached a point, where most of that rationalization and then shutting up unprofitable volumes is done? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So let's focus on a couple of things. The defection rate or more positively the retention rate is 93% across our business. And so, there hasn't been a material movement in that. It takes a lot of transactions to move that number in a meaningful way. So \u2013 but the retention is very strong. Our pricing yield in Q4 was 3.8% in the small container business, which is the highest level it's been in seven years. I think that further underscores just the strength of that business, also such a show up frankly in our fleet reliability, the great job our people are doing, I think the value of the products, some of the digital platform that we've initiated with customers, so I feel pretty good about that. As far as the growth there, we've had decent consistent net unit growth in small container. Again, if you factor out the non-regrettable losses in Q4, we grew 70 basis points in that business, it's one of our best lines of business so to speak. And as it relates to 2017, we'll see about the same amount of shedding a business there that we saw in 2016. So, we're being very methodical and very intentional about moving away from business that is broker business frankly and a business where we're not face-to-face with customers. Noah Kaye : Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then as I think you pointed out, everyone is having a lot of conversations about tax reform, and I am wondering, if that has in any way impacted some of the conversations around M&A certainly with some family-owned businesses that one can imagine that there could very meaningful consequences of potential tax reform, has that impacted in any way the timing of some of your M&A activity, and would you expect it to potentially be a benefit going forward once we get more clarity? Donald W. Slager: Well, Noah, I don't think it's really impacted anything to-date because there hasn't been any tax reform and nobody knows what it would be, so if I were selling my business today based on some empty promise of tax reform, I probably wouldn't do it. So, we're not seeing that kind of activity. We \u2013 I can see there are potential for somebody making a decision, but I think that wouldn't be the only thing that drives your decision, I think if people are in a window of thinking about selling their business then they could use tax reform or some new tax consequence as the reason to finally make that final determination. But I don't think it's the one and only decision or the one and only decision point that people will use. So, I think, there's been a lot of talk about that. I think, it's much to do about nothing at this point. But frankly the pipeline for acquisitions look strong and if there are some kind of tax reform that's meaningful, it could only make it potentially stronger not weaker. Noah Kaye : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Michael Feniger at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael J. Feniger: Thanks for taking my question. I know that the \u2013 you're forecasting the average yield to 2% and it's actually trended down 2015 it was 2.3%, 2016 I think it was around 2.1%. I know that 2016 had that headwind from CPI that goes around 20 basis points, 30 basis points from the low CPI of 2015. So can you just walk us through why the yield is still drifting slightly lower, shouldn't the CPI headwind at least be abating by the time the second half of the year? Charles F. Serianni: By the time the second half of the year comes around that's true. But you got to remember that we still have the first half of the year where we're dealing with the CPI of 0.1% so that's a significant headwind for us. Yeah. Michael J. Feniger: All right. That make sense. And I know there was a lot of discussion so far about the pipeline on M&A front. If you go through the due diligence and I understand to be patient, but I'm wondering is there any point where maybe you decide to step up that buyback amount, and say it's more \u2013 it makes more sense maybe just to buy your own shares at this valuation? Donald W. Slager: Well, look, we talk repeatedly and frankly for years with people about what we call a balanced approach, right, of using free cash flow. And I think frankly, most of our owners would like to see us continue to, one, invest in the business, and invest in organic growth, and invest in M&A when we can buy cash flow, reoccurring cash flow at the right multiple. And that's what we do with our tuck-in program, right. So, tuck-ins are the very best way to get the fastest return on those investments, they have the lowest risk, they are the easiest to integrate and so on. So, as long as those tuck-ins are there, and they are quality companies with quality revenue, draw quality customer base, we're going to continue to do that. That is a very good use of cash for the business. And part of that balanced approach then is with the remainder of the cash, our balanced approach to dividend increase and buyback. And we buy back 2%, 3% of our shares generally, annually. So it's that formula, if you will, that we've been using over the past many years that we've been doing this. And it's that very formula that I think has helped driving the appreciation in the stock, and in the market cap of the company. So I would argue that it's working very, very nicely. So we're going to continue to do that. And if and when a larger opportunity comes along, we always tell people that we've got the flexibility with our balance sheet to go after a larger deal if one comes along. There are some very nice companies that could consume $100 million purchase price all by themselves. We're certainly prepared to do that for the right opportunity, and if something like that comes up, you'll be hearing about it. Michael J. Feniger: That's perfect. And just lastly guys, C&D showed pretty strong growth in the fourth quarter, I think it was up double-digits. From what you're seeing so far in January and February is \u2013 are the trends still intact in that part of the business? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. C&D has been a really good business for us. I will give you a couple of data points, one, remember we've talked a lot about household formation driving the business, that drives business formations. So C&D is continuing. That's going to set up more small container growth in the future which we're excited about certainly. But if you look at the household formation in total, we're still lagging nationally the 5th year average. And so we think there is a fair amount of growth yet to be had there. We're well positioned and very focused on getting our fair share of that growth. At the same time, we're growing both price and volume in that space. So in the temporary large container business on a combined basis of price and volume, we got 4.8% volume growth, and even in permanent business. So the business is very healthy, the supply and demand economics are working the way they should in a rational environment and so the business should continue to post good results for us certainly through 2017, and I would say likely well beyond that. Michael J. Feniger: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael E. Hoffman: Hey, Don, Chuck, Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. Donald W. Slager: How are doing, Michael? Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman: I'm good. Can't complain, what's the point anyway. Donald W. Slager: Right. Michael E. Hoffman: I have a question with regards to free cash, just it sort of walks back towards this leverage question everybody keeps asking, so you posted an $885 million this year 2016, but it's held by cash taxes. So if I smoothed the tax conversation, $855 million looks like what if taxes are all the same. Would it be fair to say $855 million goes to $965 million to $990 million, if cash taxes were the same in both periods? Brian M. DelGhiaccio: Yeah. Hey, Michael. This is Brian, just to think of it this way. Is that, when we take a look at the cash tax as a percent of provision, right, in 2016, it was about 79%. Okay, we expect that to move to about 90% to 95% in 2017. So just that differential creates about a $90 million cash tax headwind. Michael E. Hoffman: Right. So... go ahead, sorry. Well, so what I was getting \u2013 I mean, maybe margins aren't moving as much as some are wringing their hands about. But the fact of the matter is the operating leverage through to cash is actually pretty good, if cash taxes were all things being equal. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. That's right. Brian M. DelGhiaccio: Yeah. Said another way is that on a similar cash tax as a percentage of provision basis, the free cash flow is growing high-single digit to low-double digits, which is very strong. Michael E. Hoffman: Right. Okay. Charles F. Serianni: So, I will say it another way. That's the strongest as far as from a guidance perspective, the strongest guidance we've given in, I don't know, how many years. Both EPS or free cash growing at high-single digits to low double-digits. So the business is moving ahead. We're getting the operating leverage and it is showing up in the cash. That's your point. Michael E. Hoffman: Right. That's what I was trying to get at. Okay. So back to a mix question. Where do you think you are in the \u2013 and this is back to your comment about household formation against business formation. So where do you think you are in your model catching up to the household formation trend in the commercial collection side, which is your best margin business? So that's sort of that, the hand at your back on the margin opportunities, is that new business formation, that service interval upgrades, the service new adds versus losses, all of those patterns? How do you think about where you are \u2013 your company relative to the 1.5 million in housing starts? Donald W. Slager: Well, I think we're still in early innings on that. I think probably maybe you even thought that we'd be further faster just the way the economy would work. But I think there's still plenty of room to go. I mean, household formation is only, what, 1.2 million, 1.250 million, so I think there is a lot of room to go yet. And as far as service increases versus decreases that trend has been positive now for a year, right. So, all signs are really good there. So, again, that is one of our best businesses. So as we see broader recovery, we're going to see that in small container, we're going to see that in MSW landfill, two of our higher margin businesses that are going to continue to push us toward that 30% margin that we know is at some point achievable, so. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. And then Chuck's comment of 20 basis points to 30 basis points is the garbage company and then the 10 basis points is commodities. That 20 basis points to 30 basis points turns into 25 basis points to 35 basis points to 30 basis points to 35 basis points is what's happening, right. I mean, is that the way to think about it as I look out in 2018, into 2019 and 2020 if this pattern keeps holding? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. I think that's fair. I mean, we... Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Charles F. Serianni: We believe that we're going to continue to see margin expansion over the course of the next several years, because of all of the factors, Michael, that we talked about including the increase in the volumes that we're seeing in small container business. Michael E. Hoffman: All right. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So to think about it \u2013 think about the comments, right. So, we give you volume. We give you price. We split it by market vertical. But don't forget about all the other metrics we gave you about improving engagement, improving Net Promoter Score, improving driver turnover stats, improving safety. All of those other underlying metrics are all pointing in the right direction. So, all these investments we're making in creating Republic Way and working on the team and all these other things we're doing in pricing tools and so forth, all of that's taken hold. OneFleet, as I talked about with Tyler, all those things will have additional upside as well as a broader and more positive economic outlook. So, we feel really good about the underlying trends. We feel really good about the rational industry. And we feel good about what 2017 and 2018 can look like, although we're certainly not giving 2018 guidance today, Michael. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. And not to mention, what's happened in the \u2013 with CPI and how we're going to get a bump-up in our pricing second half of this year and then what we might be able to print here in terms of CPI in 2017 and how that will impact the second half of 2018. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, remember right and we mentioned that we don't get the full benefit of the CRC again until 2018. And while we've been working really well and the team has been very successful in moving to the alternative index, as CPI rises, that's just a natural lift across the pretty big part of our business. We get back to now a very fair escalator, very quickly if we get that CPI lift. So, that's another thing that'll trend in our favor we think over the next couple of years based on everything we're seeing. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. And then if I could squeeze the next one in. The capital spending assumes growth for your win of the zones in Los Angeles? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. It does. Charles F. Serianni: That's correct. Donald W. Slager: That's correct. Michael E. Hoffman: And it's ratable through the year, right. You're ramping at the pace of full absorption? Donald W. Slager: More or less. The spend for that contract \u2013 it might be more weighted towards second half of the year, but pretty close to half now. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Congrats on the numbers. Donald W. Slager: You bet. Operator : The next question is from Joe Box at KeyBanc. Joe G. Box: Hey, guys. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Joe. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Joe. Joe G. Box: So just quickly on the energy services side, I guess is it fair to say that the 25 basis points of contribution is all volume driven? Are you guys starting to see some price improvement? And then maybe just from a high level, if you could just talk to some of the changes that you guys have made at this business. I'm sure you guys have changed the mix since you bought in. You've probably added some muscle. So maybe just a little color on what the business looks like today from the margin standpoint versus when you bought it? Donald W. Slager: All right. Well, as far as the mix goes, remember when we bought it, it was primarily infrastructure business, disposal, TRD, very small part of that business was transportation. And so the mix is largely the same. We have added some capacity in around disposal, which has been one of the reasons that the business is building. And as far as what we've done to the business, we've made it more efficient. We've made it operate better. We've improved turn times to facilities. We're trying to be the facility of choice, those kind of things. We've brought some of the Republic Way concepts, as you could imagine, operations into that business. So the team proved very quickly that we could operate the business and frankly operate the business better than it was being operated. So that gave me a lot of confidence. The rest of the noise is just about the market, but we never saw real price erosion in the business, and that's primarily because we bought good assets in good geographies. And of course, the Permian really is performing well. So as volumes come up, those volumes are going to come in at a higher margin, which is, it's going to behave very much as like our solid waste business does. We got the assets, we got the people in place, and we could handle a lot more volume without adding a lot of other cost, we'll just basically take advantage of the operating leverage. So that's what we see for 2017. Joe G. Box: Sure. Sure. Do you think you could actually see some price improvement in 2017 or is that a little out of reach? Donald W. Slager: No. I think look, we believe in supply and demand economics. It works very well in our business and we're very well situated again geographically. So that, as markets improve, should give us some pricing power as well. Joe G. Box: Got it. Thanks guys. Donald W. Slager: Great. Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Next question is from Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Al. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Al. Al Kaschalk : Hope you're doing well. Donald W. Slager: Doing great. Al Kaschalk : Good. One of the follow-up on the energy services side. So is that something you're comfortable with looking at expansion or deploying some capital at the right price? Donald W. Slager: Well, we've done a little bit of that Al. Not in a huge way, but done a little bit of it. And again, we're comfortable with the business. I guess what I'm saying we've run the assets well. We got a really good team on the ground there. So I feel good about that. It's just really a matter of where is the opportunity and is the opportunity in the right location. It's really not that much different than the solid waste business. We want to have good market position and so for the right opportunity we could, but after even saying that, it's still just a really small piece of our overall business, it's less than 1% of our business and it will never be a really, really big piece of our business around here. But it doesn't make it not important, we'll just be opportunistic if we can be. Charles F. Serianni: And this is not another platform acquisition out there, Al, that's available to us and not only that we'd be interested in that, what we're looking to do really is to tuck-in other assets around our existing infrastructure. Donald W. Slager: That's correct. Al Kaschalk : That's very helpful. Love to hear that. Let me try this question and see how we go, but we are shooting for on a Thursday afternoon. How long or how much more and this maybe you can broaden this out to someone other than RSG if you'd like. How much further do we have to go through on this regrettable losses and in terms of purging the business. Maybe said differently, why don't we get rid of the business that's not profitable, is there a fear of vertical integration, is it market specific and therefore you can't do it all at once. What's holding us back? Donald W. Slager: Well, there is a couple of things. First there is contractual obligations, right and so we don't break agreements with customers; even if we are in a situation we don't like, we do our best to negotiate our way through it. We never just walk away from a customer when we've got a contractual obligation, so that's first. Second, we think very strategically about our business, and so the decision to move away from some of the broker business is a strategic decision and we know what that \u2013 we think we believe or we think we know what that outcome will do for our business overall. So we're doing that in a kind of a ratable, methodical way over time, it just makes sense. So we put a lot of thought into it, we maybe at this for another year or two, and then it will be through it, and at the same time, because we have the capture tools in place, because we have PBS training in place, because we have better controls, we're making better decisions at the point of sale, we will be finding our way into this business again, because we have a control point in our National Accounts Group, a portal, if you will, that puts controls on which type of third-parties we choose to do business with or not. Again, we won't find ourselves in this situation again. And so we're just doing it in a methodical way and in a way that supplements our strategy, doesn't hurt our strategy. So that's as simply as I can put it. I guarantee it makes sense and it's the right way to go. Al Kaschalk : Yeah. No, I wasn't questioning that. I was just trying to appreciate not having to run out of business, Don. Sometimes we don't appreciate some of those things. Shifting gears to \u2013 are you able to add anymore color on the LA business that was one, zones, as they are more forthcoming? Charles F. Serianni: No, again, let me just say this, the main point, I think that should be important to people is when this opportunity developed, we certainly put a lot of time and effort, we had a great team on the ground, we got great relationships there in LA, we ended up protecting and actually expanding our previous market share there. As you know we've got great assets in the market, we're the only company that has a landfill in the County of LA, and so we want to make sure we continue to find a way to utilize our vertical integration opportunity and advantage there, which we've done. We are happy with the zones we have, and again we actually did a little better than the market share we had and it's going to be accretive to the business. So we are excited to get started with the city there, and I think it's going to be a great outcome overall. Al Kaschalk : Okay. Are you able to \u2013 with the guidance that you provided, I assume this is included in there? Charles F. Serianni: It is included, but you can imagine, right, the things starts kind of halfway through the year, it's a lot of startup costs. So it's not going to do much for us in 2017 by the time we get it all sorted out and stood up, we'll see some more benefit from it in 2018. Al Kaschalk : Okay. Well, I'll look for the trucks. Thanks. Charles F. Serianni: All right, man. Al Kaschalk : See you. Operator : At this time there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Amy. I would like to thank all our Republic employees for their hard work, commitment to serving our customers and dedication to operational excellence and upholding the Republic Way. Thank you all for spending time with us today. Have a good evening and be safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending.

And finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us on track to achieve our full-year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which is designed to profitably grow our business, generate consistent earnings and free cash flow growth and improve return on invested capital. For the first quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.55 and adjusted free cash flow was $240 million, both representing double-digit growth over the prior year. EBITDA margin was 27.4%. Core price was 4.1%, our highest level in over five years. Average yield was 2.3% and was strongest in our small container and large container businesses. The majority of these customers are in open markets, where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform. In our small container business, average yield was 3.8%, our highest level of pricing in over seven years. First quarter volumes increased 1%. Volume growth was in line with our expectations and was broad-based across the majority of our markets. Volumes continued to be strong in the event-driven portion of our business, which tends to be a leading indicator for future volume growth. And as expected, residential volumes turned positive as we anniversary the impact of contracts not renewed. During the quarter, we invested $55 million in tuck-in acquisitions. And we returned $218 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 1.8 million shares repurchased for approximately $110 million. Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, we are now approximately have $425 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index or a fixed-rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than CPI. Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 18% of our fleet now operates on compressed natural gas, 75% of our residential fleet is currently automated and 96% of our total fleet has now been certified under our OneFleet maintenance program. The entire fleet will be certified by the end of the second quarter. Before turning the call over to Chuck, I would like to congratulate the Republic team for being recognized by Ethisphere as one of the world's most ethical companies. Our commitment to fostering a strong ethical culture, conducting our business with the highest levels of integrity and developing sustainable practices to enhance long-term value creation enabled us to be named to this elite list. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our financial results. Chuck? Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Don. First quarter revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $144 million or 6.4% over the prior year. This 6.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 6.2% and acquisitions of 20 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield increased 2.3%, average yield in the collection business was 2.9%, which includes 3.8% yield in the small container business, 2.8% yield in the large container business and 1.8% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1.9%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.1%. Core price consisted of 5.5% in the open market and 1.9% in the restricted portion of our business. The second component of internal growth is total volume, which increased 1% over the prior year. Volumes increased 1.8% in our large container business and 30 basis points in our residential business. As expected, volumes decreased 70 basis points in our small container business. Small container volumes included a 130-basis-point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have increased 60 basis points. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 3.5%. Landfill volume increased 2.8%, which included C&D of 17.1% and special waste of 1.1%. MSW volumes were flat versus the prior year. The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 40 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.57 in the first quarter from $2.08 in the prior year, an increase of 24%. The current average diesel price is $2.50 per gallon. The next component, energy services revenue increased 40 basis points. The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity. And the final component of internal growth is commodity revenue, which increased 2.1%. The growth in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to an increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 61% to $162 per ton in the first quarter from $101 per ton in the prior year. The current average commodity price is approximately $155 per ton. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased 49% due to an increase in rebates resulting from higher recycled commodity prices. Now I will discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.4%, which compares to 27.8% in the prior year. This change includes a 30-basis-point increase in landfill operating costs, primarily due to temporary costs associated with new operating requirements at one of our landfills. These costs were anticipated and should be completed by the end of the second quarter, and a 20-basis-point margin decline or $0.01 of EPS from heavy rains on the West Coast. In certain markets, we had to close some of our facilities for several days, which resulted in lower volumes and higher transportation and disposal costs. Excluding these temporary cost increases, we had margin expansion in the quarter due to strong pricing and volume growth, which demonstrates the operating leverage in our business. It should be noted that the margin benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was offset by the change in net fuel. SG&A costs were 10.6% of revenue and in line with our expectations. These costs improved 10 basis points compared to the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. First quarter 2017 interest expense was $89 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 36.2%, resulting in $0.03 of EPS benefit relative to our expectations. The lower tax rate resulted from tax accounting for equity compensation. We expect to be at an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the reminder of the year. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $240 million, an increase of 50% versus the prior year. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter based upon the timing of working capital and capital expenditures. I will now turn the call back to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Chuck. To conclude, strong fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, resulted in 6% top line growth and double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow. As anticipated, the current economic environment continues to be favorable for the business, and we're on track to achieve our full-year goals. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. At this time, operator, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from Brian Maguire at Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hey, good afternoon. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Brian. Brian Maguire : Nice pickup from the trend you had been on the last couple of quarters up 1%, but it was a little bit lower than some of the peers. I think you talked about some of the business you shed at the small container commercial. I just wondered if you could maybe give us a sense of what the volumes would have been without that, and maybe more of a cleaner number then, and when we would expect to anniversary some of that activity. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, couple of things on that. The first thing is that the weather did have an impact on our MSW volumes coming into our landfill. So, we posted, as I said, flat volume growth on MSW, but if you take into consideration of weather that volume growth would have been closer to 1.4%. So, overall, I think that the impact of weather and maybe some contracts that we shed may have had a 30-basis-point-or-so impact on our overall volume growth. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. And let me add to that. On the small container business specifically, that's just a strategic decision that we've made to not continue to do business with brokers and that broker volume to us that loss is non-regrettable. Our perspective is that brokers don't add any real value to customers. Customers should be doing business with us directly. A strategic decision we've made, and we've been shedding some of that business now for several quarters. We got little ways to go. But otherwise, if you subtract that, to your point, Brian, the underlying economic growth is strong. We're getting good price and getting our fair share growth in the business. Brian Maguire : Okay. Great. As a follow-up, the margins were a little bit lower than what we were expecting. It sounds like maybe a little bit lower than what you're expecting too is some of the rains and landfill cost that you had there. Just wondering if you expect any of that to carry through into 2Q or if you think those costs were kind of episodic just to the period. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, the cost that we talked about really related to Q1, especially as it relates to the heavy rains. We're still optimistic of regarding the margin expansion this year. If we look at kind of expectations for the rest of the year, keep in mind that net queue, although there was a headwind for us in Q1 that's going to be a tailwind for us starting in Q2. We do get the step up in CPI as we had talked about that's effective in the second half of the year. And we're going to continue to see benefits from our OneFleet maintenance program, which will be fully rolled out in July 1 of this year. So, we feel optimistic in terms of being able to achieve expansion in EBITDA margins this year. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from Mike Feniger at Bank of America. Michael J. Feniger: Hey, guys. Yeah. Thanks for... Donald W. Slager: Hello, Mike. Charles F. Serianni: Hey, Mike. Michael J. Feniger: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On the guide for the margin, it's good that you still expect margin expansion, but are we still sticking in that 20 to 40-basis-point range for the year? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, we are. I mean, that's still what we're looking at for this year. Remember, the headwinds, we knew that the margin expansion would be more a back-half loaded just because of the fuel and because of some of the other costs that we're looking at the frontend of the year. And also keep in mind that CPI price increase that we get together with the OneFleet maintenance program, so we knew that it would be back-half loaded. So, right now, Mike, we're right on track. Michael J. Feniger: That's great. Donald W. Slager: Yes. We've got these temporary landfill operating costs that Chuck spoke of, look we don't like these weather as an excuse, in general, we don't, but when you got landfills that close for several days at a time and we had a couple facilities in the western part of the U.S. that didn't pull trucks out for five, six days that really does impact your overall operations. So, these are just couple of basis points. We're going to get back to it. And again, these other tailwinds that Chuck described are real, and that's going to come through in the second half. Michael J. Feniger: That's great. And just to think about the mix of the business, I'm just curious you're seeing energy services up, recycling prices have been higher. Does the profitability on the waste mix, does it start to move more to being margin accretive, and do you expect that to show up in the back half? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So, we saw some of that, right, Mike, in the first quarter. Right? So, the extent that we had more revenue coming in from our E&P business and our revenue coming in from commodities, we saw some of that actually in Q1. And you strip away the noise that we had in terms of the landfill operating costs and the heavy rains, you actually saw the margin expansion, partly due, to your point, to the mix of business. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. And right. We're seeing growth now across all lines of business. Right? We saw growth in residential. We saw growth in small container, net of the broker loss, so on and so forth. So, we're seeing a broader based recovery. And again, we're seeing in all geographies. So, the macro is in good shape. The momentum is there in the business. Michael J. Feniger: Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question is from Hamzah Mazari at Macquarie. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just around how much capacity do you guys have in the current demand environment? What I mean by that is, one of your competitors had said that they began adding routes in many markets in the nation on the commercial side for the first time since their downturn. And you referenced your business is picking up. Just curious how much capacity you have on the ground. Have you been adding routes already? Just if you could frame that for us, where you guys are at. Donald W. Slager: We have added some routes, Hamzah, in the few markets. Some markets have little more capacity than others, because they were impacted more deeply by the downturn, but I think it's a mix bag. We're also very, very focused on compliance of hours of service and all those other areas of the business. So, we're employing new route tools as well, and getting more precise in and around our really route standard. So, we're going to continue to pickup productivity in the business while we're also expanding the business. So, there's no one answer that fits every market. Everyone is kind of in a different state on the continuum. But I wouldn't say that we're at capacity across the board. And as you know, small container business that the new stuffs soaking pretty easily so to speak in that business. And that's one of the reasons our tuck-in strategy work so well, because we can very often buy a four, five truck company and take trucks off the street. So that alone speaks to the fact that we've got capacity in the system. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Right. And then you had referenced brokers, do you have a sense of how big brokers are as a percent of the market and has that gone down over time or is that going up? I know Waste Management had bought Oakleaf and that wasn't the great deal, but just a sense of how big is the market for brokers. And clearly, you have some non-regrettable losses that you're still working through and that's strategic and I understand that, but just trying to get a sense of the brokerage business. Thank you. Donald W. Slager: So, I don't think brokers are playing a bigger role in the business. When Oakleaf was sold to Waste Management, we said, hey, someone is going to fill that vacuum, somebody always does. Our position again is that brokers don't really offer any real value or advantage to customers. We believe we should be owning that customer interface directly with all of our capabilities, the breadth of our products and all of our digital tools, the customers will be better served dealing directly with us and not through a broker. So that's the decision we made, we're going to maintain it. We don't see the business going other way or the trends going the other way. Frankly at the same time, we're improving our capabilities for customers around sustainability, around filling their needs about being selling them solutions that they need, giving them the reporting they need. So, some of the things that brokers used to sell above and beyond are things that we can all do ourselves now, and we're not done yet, right. So, our products continue to improve. Our product catalog continues to expand. And so, little by little we think there's less and less need for brokers in the business and the market, and we think that's frankly the trend. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Great. Thank you, Don. Operator : Next question is from Al Kaschalk at Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk : Good afternoon, guys. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Al. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Al. Al Kaschalk : And Nicole. Nicole Giandinoto (Koziol): Hi, Al. Al Kaschalk : A little more color on the operating landfill cost. I think it was a 30-basis-point headwind. Is that includes 20 basis points from the heavy rains or is there something else that maybe you can help just articulate further what that occurred in the quarter? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So, there is 30 basis points associated with the landfill operating costs. And then, an additional 20 basis points associated with the heavy rains. So, the landfill operating costs really relate to one landfill, and it has to do with intermediate cover and some other enhancements that we're making to start an operating process at that landfill. Donald W. Slager: And some of those costs we just kind of pulled forward into Q1 from later parts in the year where they were budgeted. Al Kaschalk : Okay. Is this the Midwest landfill? Donald W. Slager: No. It's not. This is actually a landfill in California. Al Kaschalk : Okay. Well, there is a Midwest in the California too. Anyhow, secondly, and this is more, I guess, you have concentrated or invested where you're able to get returns, and it's related to recycling. I think overall, you say there is about a $0.03, $0.04 headwind for a $10-change. You got commodities that have come down here sharply. I guess my point is, I'm just trying to ask from a business and operating prospective, is that the right \u2013 your commitment to that business and the impact it has on your operations, correct, as I thought it also had further impact, greater impact one way or the other based on the dollar change (23:56). So, in other words, the contract changes you may have made or processing fees of \u2013 are those revisions showing up, and that's why maybe there wasn't as much leverage in the model in the quarter, based on... Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, we've updated the market on the sensitivity as it's changed. It used to be greater than it is, right. So that sensitivity has decreased. Our focus on the business remains. In other words, we've continued to migrate our agreements with customers who deliver material to our facilities in a more fair sort of cost sharing arrangement. So, a good portion of those contracts have already been converted. We're working with municipalities to convert the collection portion of contracts to more \u2013 again, a fair cost sharing arrangements, that work is going to continue. And we're going to continue to invest in the recycle business, to your point Al, where it makes sense with the right terms and an equitable contract. And meanwhile, we've still shuttered MRFs at our recycling facilities that didn't return an adequate return on capital, so that's all going to continue. So, we still think it's a good business, where we have good partners, specifically municipal partners who want to be forward-thinking in their sustainability plans, but as you heard me say, you can't have sustainability without profitability. So that's our view. And we think as we continue to work toward fair sharing arrangements that the volatility and the exposure will continue to come down. Having said that, we will also probably be giving up a little bit of the upside along the way, but we will have insulated the business from the volatile downturn. So that's still the right way to run the business we think, but it's going to just happen one step at a time. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. And we're still early on in the process, Al. We've got about 50% of our processing contracts currently converted over to this processing fee, but the majority of the material that we handle right now, we actually collect on behalf of municipalities, those are covered under longer term contracts. So, it's going to take us a little while longer to cycle through those contracts. But we'll continue to keep you updated in terms of the changes and the sensitivity analysis that we do relative to the price of commodities. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. And as it relates to the overall price of commodities now, they started out strong at the beginning of the year, they came down in the end of March and now April, but we think frankly they're, for the long-term, for the full year they're still going to be at or slightly above the rate that we guided to. Al Kaschalk : Okay. And that rate is what? Charles F. Serianni: $140 per ton. Al Kaschalk : Okay. And finally just to clean-up, how many cents were benefiting the quarter from recycling? Charles F. Serianni: So, recycling was actually a $0.01 benefit during the quarter, but at the same time, we had a $0.01 negative associated with fuel, with net fuel. So, if you remember last year, we called out a lag benefit that we received in Q1. So, year-over-year there's actually a $0.01 benefit from fuel. So those two kind of net out. Al Kaschalk : Right. Thanks a lot guys, and good luck. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Al. Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Al. Operator : The next question is from Sean Egan at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean J. Egan: Hey. Good evening, everyone. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Sean. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Sean. Sean J. Egan: I just wanted to touch on OneFleet. Now that you guys are almost completely rolled out, can you help us understand maybe what proportion of the benefits that you've seen from the program either through the P&L or the cash flow statement? Just trying to understand the tail after you are fully implemented, if we continue to see benefits for another 6, 12 months as the program matures or if we're kind of through our total savings. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, I'll start out by just emphatically saying that we haven't seen all the benefits from OneFleet yet. Okay. So, let's talk OneFleet from a couple different views. The first being CapEx, one of the benefits of OneFleet is to extend the useful life of the fleet, which means aging the fleet a year, which is a onetime $200 million savings, we're about halfway through that. We'll save yet another $200 million from what we've saved so far, so that'll happen this year. And then there's an ongoing tail, in other words, if you maintain your fleet to now an older age indefinitely, there is a $20 million, $25 million a year savings every year from doing that. So, that's the gift that keeps on giving with OneFleet. That's on the CapEx side. But that's real cash, that's happening, we're seeing that. On the operating side, the goal of OneFleet, right, is to maintain the fleet to be the most safe and efficient reliable fleets you can have. That doesn't mean the youngest fleet, right, it means, maintaining these trucks to high standard throughout their life. So, in the divisions, the business units that have had OneFleet in place the longest, they've seen the greatest benefit in their operating metrics. Fleet availability, engine hour cost and all the other things that we measured, the handful of key metrics we measured in OneFleet. Every one of our divisions has a maintenance dashboard where they follow and closely track their metrics related to OneFleet and our maintenance staff here at the headquarters works with them directly to put extra emphasis on those divisions that need additional health and support. So, we know the things are working. We know the divisions that I've been on the longest have had the best results and the divisions that I just put on last year who're still in the certification process are still working through some of the bumps. So, this is a big, big undertaking. We're still very convinced, it was the right thing to do, and we're seeing the benefits. And now, we're going to really work hard to find an efficient frontier of our fleet, and we're going to start seeing other benefits from having the most reliable fleet in the industry. That's going to start showing up in areas like drive a morale and turnover. In fact, our driver turnover is found year-over-year. Our employee engagement score is up year-over-year. All these other metrics that we measure point positively to some of the things, some of the underlying fundamental things we're doing. So, I could go on and on about OneFleet, but I won't because we only have an hour. So, we're glad we did it. We're almost through the certification process. And then, we'll have some time and capacity to tackle another initiative to be the inflator. Sean J. Egan: Great. Thank you for all that. And then secondly, I know you alluded to the conversions or the progress that you've made on conversions to a mega water sewer trash index or an alternate to CPI. Can you maybe help us understand the split between collection and disposal within those contracts and maybe kind of give your comments a little towards the disposal side? Donald W. Slager: Well, I would tell you most of that is collection, right. But, as you know, we don't have a great deal of third-party competitive volume at our landfills, because have consistently raised prices on MSW at our landfill and a lot of that other volume has sort of found other homes. But most of the MSW volume at our landfills that's not coming in on our own trucks, comes from municipalities, and to your point, those volumes are tied to some kind of a CPI escalator. But we are working those just like we're working the other collection contracts, moving to an index that makes sense. And so, I'll say this, most of the more recent conversions have been with the water sewer trash, and/or fixed via 3% to 4%, because we think that's fair and equitable, and we've still been able to sell that to customers as fair and equitable, and we continue to make progress, and we're not giving up. Even though CPI is improving, to Chuck's point earlier, we're going to start to see some benefit from an improved CPI environment, certainly come through at the end of the year. We're going to continue to push to an index that makes sense. And meanwhile, we'll take advantage of an improving CPI environment if that continues for us as well. So, it's a best of all for us. Sean J. Egan: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Michael Hoffman at Stifel. Michael E. Hoffman: Thank you, Nicole, John and Chuck for taking my call. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Michael. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Michael. Nicole Giandinoto (Koziol): Hi, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman: How are you? Let's talk about cash flow. And sort of how do you get from here to there to $900 million, you've got heck of a start, but help us walk through the flows, if you will, to the remainder of the year, given the conditions in recycling E&P and the seasonal trends that could or couldn't happen. How does that all play out to get to the $900 million? Donald W. Slager: Well, like you said, Michael, I think that we're already off to a very good start. And some of that has to do with the timing of CapEx. That can be a little bit lumpy. But we're seeing very strong operating results, obviously we've got very strong EBITDA and that's manifesting itself in our free cash flow. So, we feel very confident with our guidance that we gave relative to our cash flow for the year. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Great. How are you going to get there? Talk to me about how do you get there. Charles F. Serianni: I think it's execution with the rest of our plan, right, Michael. So, we said that we would get double-digit growth in earnings, EPS, this year and in free cash flow. And we demonstrated in Q1. We've actually got that in Q1. And so, it's continuing the blocking and tackling. And also it's the tailwinds that I had talked about, right. So, it's the net fuel, it's the CPI, it's the OneFleet, it's all of those coming together, and that's going to produce the cash flow for the year. And like I said, we're confident right now that we're going to be able to hit our guidance. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, Michael, this is Don. You've been around a long time. I mean, that is a complement. You know that it's never about one quarter. And this frankly is a very good quarter. This quarter is right on top of our operating plan, it's right on top the guidance we provided. We've got a lot of momentum in the business. We talk about the best pricing in years, it's not just this quarter that started at the end of last year. We talked about the momentum in volume, shifting deposit volume in all lines of business. That's a trend, it's not just a quarter. We talk about the fact that we're still only at a 1.2 million household starts, and we still haven't hit sort of the 25 to 50-year average. So, there's still growth to come in that business. And we had a couple of things that touches in Q1, a couple of things we didn't expect. So, we make some decisions ourselves to pull some cost forward. That's just running the business, because we don't run the business just for the quarter, and you know that, right. So, we've got ongoing strength in pricing. We've got a great sales force that's pulling their way, and we're getting our fair share of growth. And we're using our pricing tools to get the best customers at the best price. Price per unit for new sales is up. All those things are going to continue, right. We've got improving metrics in areas like safety and turnover and NPS. And of the gazillion metrics that we track many of them are moving in the right direction, right, but it's a game of inches. So, we're going to continue to do those things. We've got as Chuck said, these tailwinds. We've got the net fuel flipping in our favor in the second half. We got CPI coming back. We've got some of these other, what we call, temporary costs of sighting. That's how we get there. It's just good old fashion execution, getting our fair share of the growth, getting better around service delivery, getting better around customer acquisition, getting better around safety and we're going to continue investing in the business. We're not going to get there by taking the CapEx holiday. We're not going to get there by not covering our landfills. We're not going to get there by taking shortcuts. We're going to get there by running the business for the long-term, making the business better and better, and all those things are well on their way. So, we expect to have a solid Q2 and a solid year. We've said, look, we're reaffirming our guidance. And we expect that we're going to achieve toward the higher end of the EPS guidance. And I think there's a lot of confidence in that statement. So, what else do you want to know? Michael E. Hoffman: So, when I look at it in the data you give us, so you gave us cash flow from ops ranges and then you subtract out your PP&E received plus divestitures. There is a pretty healthy ramp and to get the cash flow from ops number to get to the $900 million. And that has to come with operating leverage. I mean, there's no other way to make that up. I mean, there's not monster working capital savings. So, I think what I was getting after is that, if I get the seasonal trend normal, nothing unusual 2Q, 3Q. Given what you've done with your cost, I should see something in and around $1.86 billion in cash flow from ops. You spend what you're going to spend. There's your $900 million. Charles F. Serianni: Right, Michael. And just come back down to the operating leverage that you had talked about. That's what's going to drive the free cash flow, that's what's going to drive the margin expansion. Absolutely. That's baked into the numbers and that's what was baked into our guidance. Michael E. Hoffman: But it's not \u2013 you're not doing this through working capital. This is operating leverage to the income statement, I managed to pick a negative working capital and turn it into a source. Donald W. Slager: That's exactly right. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. We're not taking shortcuts. There's no smoke and mirrors. It's good old fashion run of the business. You got all these benefits of these initiatives layering in, you got the momentum builds. Again, every new unit, every new ton comes in at a higher margin. You got to arrest a few cost along the way. You got to hit your productivity goals, which we have set for the team. Everybody has goals in the organization, right. So all that has to happen, but that should be a phase to do and that's what we see happening in Q1, net of a couple of anomalies and a couple things that we kind of do our-self here. But as I said, the momentum is there, we're reaffirming the guidance, it's really good quarter here. But we don't have our feet up on the table celebrating, as soon as we hang up the phone, we're going to go right back to work. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Fair enough. So, on the landfill side, if my memory serves, a disproportionate amount of your landfill comes on your truck, you don't take that much third-party. Charles F. Serianni: Well, we take third-party but most of our third-party is MSW tied to municipal, which is price restricted. Right. So... Michael E. Hoffman: In that third-party, what was the trend there on the year-over-year volume? Donald W. Slager: Well, are you talking about on the MSW coming in third-party? Michael E. Hoffman: Yeah. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. The MSW was kind of flattish, but then you look at the C&D was very, very strong with 17.1% as I had mentioned. And that's coming off of a 17.8% last year. So, very strong on the advent pieces that were coming into the landfill. Michael E. Hoffman: So, what I'm trying to get out a little bit is, you had good frontend loader growth volume wise in your own business, but your third-party MSW, which is really residential side loaders, but it's MSW. So it's still the consumer is flat, I'm trying to reconcile that. How many will live with that? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. You keep in mind that those MSW volumes that we had talked about were impacted by the weather. And if you strip that weather out, they were closer to an increase of 1.4%. Donald W. Slager: But still it's not monster growth, it's not 5%, 6%. So, we generally feel that landfill growth should be fairly consistent, third-party landfill growth should be fairly consistent with the growth that we have in our core hauling business. They tend to flow with each other. And that's our view of the world. Now, the only thing that sort of changes that is, when we're reporting price volume in aggregate, it really is a revenue calculation, right? And so, we get \u2013 there's only a little bit of noise when you compare the two based on container weights or a container is 100% full and those kind of things, because as you know as people continue to provide or want more service increases, it takes a while before you actually can convert that to revenue, so there's some of that noise in the system. But we still think it's, on a macro basis, a very broad based recovery. It's not spiking. It's not happening in any big way. It's just happening a little at a time. Michael E. Hoffman: Yeah. I think the recovery is very metered, because that's the nature of the housing recovery. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Michael E. Hoffman: And what I was trying to get a feel for is, are you seeing a commercial business growth that's a combination of housing driving new business and your existing group business, walking up service intervals. And a corollary to that would be, it's the consumer everywhere. And so, your third-party volume into your landfill, all those numbers, there is a relationship to them. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. I think all of those things are very well balanced and consistent with what we've seen in our business, in our markets, in our collection of assets, historically. At least over the last several quarters, as we've seen a more pronounced recovery from the dark days we've seen in the past. So, I think it's very correlated. Again, other companies that may report may have a different set of assets. Some companies have a bigger landfill concentration. Some companies have businesses north of the border. Some companies have landfills in markets where they're not particularly integrated. We don't have any of that, right. So, we're more of a vertically integrated business across 240 markets. So, our business behaves a certain way. But there's nothing we're seeing in the trend, in the macro that has us worried. We think there's more to come. We think you look at our positive trends in price and volume, they're not just the quarter, but they're sequential, and the same thing is happening within the business. When I talk about operating metrics we track there, they're improving, right. And we're only doing $100 million of tuck-in a year. So, we're not spending $300 million, $400 million, $500 million, $1 billion on acquisitions. So, we look a little different, right. But the business is performing well. And we're talking double-digit free cash flow growth and double-digit EPS growth, Michael. And that's frankly something we hadn't seen in number of years. So, I would say, strong performance for these assets. And again as I said, more to come, because the trends are and the momentum is in the business. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Donald W. Slager: You bet. Michael E. Hoffman: See you Tuesday. Donald W. Slager: Okay. Operator : The next question is from Corey Greendale, First Analysis. Corey Greendale : Hey, good afternoon. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Corey. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Corey. Corey Greendale : Hey. So, just a couple questions. And apologies if this is treading back over some things you touched on a little bit already, but just to sort of set future expectations. Don, you mentioned on the broker business there's still some more to go. Can you just give us a sense how much of your revenue now consists of work you're doing for brokers? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. I don't know if we've given you the exact number, but I think we'll be through it probably sometime next year. Okay? It'll sort of trickle its way out between now and the end of next year. Corey Greendale : Okay. And then on the volume point, I totally get different mixes and I understand the weather impact, but I think just to put a finer point on one thing, I think one question we're going to be getting is just sort of the comp between your MSW volume growth and Waste's MSW growth. And I realize you can't really address specifically other companies, but any thoughts on why, because presumably they would have been hit by weather also, why the delta between the kind of flattish for you and the 7%-ish that they got? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. One thing I would point out is that, we're coming off a very hard comp on the MSW side of 4.7%. And I'm not sure what they reported last year, what kind of comp they're coming off of. So that might have something to do with it. Corey Greendale : Okay. I don't recall. I'll check. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. And again, we're not paying as much attention to what they're saying as what we're doing. So... Corey Greendale : Yeah. No, I totally get it. And you're running your own business and the business is going well, just in terms of \u2013 I think it's a question people looking at both companies will ask. Last question I had is just, Chuck, as far as on the cost side, one thing that \u2013 not to overemphasize 30 basis points, but the increase in the labor under SG&A was a little higher than I expected. I think it was up about 11% year-over-year. Is that the trend we should expect for the rest of the year? Charles F. Serianni: No, that really has to do with our customer resource centers that we're in the process of opening. That'll be done by the end of this year. So, our expectation is that salaries will come down as a percentage of revenue for the rest of the year. Corey Greendale : Because of cost savings or you're saying there's some implementation costs you're incurring now. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. That's right, Corey. It's an implementation cost. That's exactly right. Donald W. Slager: Think about duplicate staffing levels and having to employ more people in the overlap and all the rest of it. Corey Greendale : Got it. And remind me when should we start to see the savings coming in? Donald W. Slager: So, it's next year is what we had said that you'll see a full run rate of savings associated with the CRCs. Corey Greendale : At the beginning of 2018? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Starting in the beginning of 2018. Corey Greendale : Perfect. All right. Thanks. Donald W. Slager: You're welcome. Operator : The next question is from Noah Kaye at Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Good afternoon, Don, Chuck and Nicole. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe if we could start with the dynamic around core price versus average yield. Suddenly when you've got both numbers moving in a positive direction, it sets a strong start. But if I look at the gap between core price and average yield, which is a metric that you talked to, it did increase somewhat in the quarter since you're getting 4.1% price. I think that delta was about 1.8%, I guess. Do we make of this that some of your recent initiatives around pricing and price capture are starting to take stronger route? And how do we think about the stickiness of some of the core price increases? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So, let me just address the churn a little bit. So, we saw a slight increase in the churn sequentially, and that really had to do with a supplemental revenue imitative that we had in place in 2016 that we ended up anniversarying. And we knew that that was coming. And that's why we were very focused in on going out with additional pricing actions, which help push our yield up over the 2% level. So, that might be some of what you're seeing right now. And certainly that's what you're seeing in terms of the core price that we've been able to push out in the open market. Donald W. Slager: Right. To your point, the tools are fully deployed, the adoption rate is high, people are using the tools. Our selling rate for new sales is up. So, we're selling new business on a per unit basis at a higher rate this year than we were last year. The tools are designed to do that. Customer retention stay strong at 93%. So, all those other metrics are good shape. And again it sometimes the benefits of these things showed slowly, but they continue to provide benefit and they'll continue that through the year. Noah Kaye : Okay. That's very helpful. And then there's been a lot of discussion of the different components of volume. I guess if we just backup, thus far, we've seen normal seasonality in the second quarter. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Second quarter, means, it seems fine to us. Really we usually wait to really talk about seasonality until the quarter's completed, because it's really May-June where that really comes to roost, probably a little bit too early to tell. The frost is \u2013 there's still chance of frost in the Midwest kind of thing. And I know that because I'm doing a little construction project there and they keep complaining that there might be frost in the ground that's why they can't get things done. So, anyways, we get to the seasonality question through sort of mid-May and into June, and we'll give you an update on the Q2 call. Noah Kaye : Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks. And then maybe if I could just finish up and try to get at this MSW versus C&D maybe from a slightly different angle. If you have double-digit increases in C&D, and as you've always framed this, housing starts and construction, should presage over time an increase in the higher margin MSW type volumes. Do you think that you just have some footprints in relatively younger markets or higher growth markets, and that is going to take a bit more time for those MSW growth rates to catch up. Could that be a possibility? Donald W. Slager: Well, I don't know that we slice it quite that finally. We talk about the various types of markets we're in. It's a pretty good balance of urban centers and secondary markets, and 25% of our business is in franchise market. So, it's pretty balanced portfolio. So, we don't spend a lot of time analyzing that, because I don't think it really does us a lot of good help from the business. So, I'm sorry, I can't provide you the insight. Overall, we look more, market-by-market, how we make investments, how we deploy sales force and products, and how all of our markets contributing. And the good news to that answer is, all the markets are really doing pretty well. We get a really broad-based recovery here. It really is, as I've shared talking about with Michael Hoffman, I think it's taking a lot longer for us to see the benefit of small container growth in this recovery. We had hoped and thought we would see it sooner than we did, but we've been seeing it. And net of this broker issue we're working through, we've got decent growth there too. So, when all lines of businesses are contributing, including your higher margin, things start to make a difference for you on the margin and that's what we're going to begin to see here now in the second half of the year. Noah Kaye : Right. Thanks very much for the color and see you at WasteExpo. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Noah. Charles F. Serianni: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Tyler Brown at Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Tyler. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, Chuck. Just to be clear, so the landfill operating cost headwinds, they sunset at the end of Q2? Charles F. Serianni: Yes. That's right. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. And then, was the lack of the CNG tax credit a notable drag? Charles F. Serianni: It was a drag. That's part of that drag that we called out that $0.01 of EPS, about 50 basis points at that, that was all part of it. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay. Charles F. Serianni: But the big piece of it was the fuel like that, the benefit that we received last year for it. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay. And so, my last question here is, just, if CPI is set to help us here in the back half, I mean, it seems that the open market is very rational. It seems like churn is lower stable. Why wouldn't yields be better than the 2%, 3% here in the back half? Donald W. Slager: Well, we're not there yet, right? Historically, when CPI is nor normal or in that sort of 2%, 3% range, open market pricing is better, historically. So, we're certainly thinking about how we will go to market and will think about what the market bears and allows, and will be evaluating competitive behavior and all the rest of it. It's too early to tell, but historically, yes CPI is up, open market pricing is up as well. So, we'll just see what happens. Charles F. Serianni: And we'll update our guidance as we always do in July. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Patrick Tyler Brown : Sure. Okay. All right. It's been a long day. Thanks. Donald W. Slager: All right. Thank you. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Amy. In closing, we'll continue to manage the business to create long-term value and remain focused on executing our strategy of profitable growth with differentiation. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you for spending time with us today. Have a good evening, and be safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We built upon our strong start to the year and delivered another solid quarter. We achieved higher levels of pricing and volume growth, made continued progress on our multi-year initiatives and reported double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow. We continue to see positive momentum in our business from the successful execution of our strategy and improvement in the fundamentals that impact our business, which was the premise for our 2017 business plan. Highlights of the quarter include adjusted EPS was $0.61, an 11% increase over the prior year. EPS was positively impacted by strong growth in both price and volume and higher recycled commodity prices. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $358 million and in line with our expectations. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow per share was $1.05, an increase of approximately 8% over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA increased $42 million or 6% over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%. Total revenue grew 7.5%, our highest level in over eight years. Core price was 4.1%. Average yield was 2.5% and was strongest in our small container and large container businesses. Majority of these customers are in open markets, where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform. In our small container business, average yield was 4.2%, our highest level of pricing in over seven years. Second quarter volumes increased 1.9%. The volume growth was broad based and was strongest in the event-driven portion of our disposal business. Year-to-date, we've invested $91 million in tuck-in acquisitions, which will improve our operating density and further strengthen our market positions. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we have returned $454 million of cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This included 3.8 million shares repurchased for approximately $237 million. Additionally, our board approved an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend. This is consistent with our historical practice of raising the dividend in the mid to high single-digit range. The annualized dividend is now $1.38 per share. Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, we now have approximately $440 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index or fixed-rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more clearly aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than CPI. Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 19% of our fleet now operates on compressed natural gas, 75% of our residential fleet is automated and our entire fleet is now certified under our OneFleet maintenance program. As a result of our standardized maintenance program, we have seen an improvement in cost per engine hour, greater fleet reliability, fewer unscheduled repairs and lower technician turnover. Additionally, we are in the process of extending the useful life of our fleet by one year, which will save us $200 million in capital expenditures. We've already realized over $100 million of savings and expect the remaining savings in the next two to three years. Finally, I'd like to give you an update on the talent pillar of our strategy. We believe that an engaged, empowered and diverse team is another way we differentiate ourselves. We've been steadily building on our employee engagement and diversity and inclusion programs over the last several years in an effort to make Republic Services an employer of choice, one where the best people come to work. This year, we were named to the named to the Forbes 2017 America's Best Employers list and the Ethisphere World's Most Ethical Companies list. And most recently, we received the Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award. The Forbes and Glassdoor awards are specially meaningful and that our employees from across the country are the ones who voted to put Republic on these lists. It is through our employees' collective voices that Republic's culture and company story is being shared and the true litmus test of the impact we are making here at Republic. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck? Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Don. Second quarter revenue was approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $176 million or 7.5% over the prior year This 7.5% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 7.2% and acquisitions of 30 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows : First, average yield increased 2.5%. Average yield in the collection business was 3.1%, which included 4.2% yield in the small container business, 3% yield in the large container business and 1.9% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 80 basis points, which included landfill MSW of 1.8%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.1%. Core price consisted of 5.3% in the open market and 2.2% in the restricted portion of our business. Pricing in the restricted portion of our business benefited from an improved inflationary environment and our focus on earning an appropriate return on our contracts as they renew. The second component of internal growth is total volume, which increased 1.9% over the prior year. Volumes in the collection business increased 40 basis points. This included a 1.9% increase in our large container business and a 50 basis point increase in our residential business, partially offset by a 90 basis point decrease in our small container business. Small container volumes included a 140 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have increased 50 basis points. Within our large container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 1.7% and recurring hauls were up 1.9%. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 8.7%. Landfill volumes increased 8.4% which included C&D of 17.5%, special waste of 15% and MSW of 1.1%. The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 60 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.55 in the second quarter from $2.30 in the prior year, an increase of 11%. The current average diesel price is $2.51 per gallon. The next component, energy services revenue, increased 70 basis points. The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin where we are well positioned. And the final component of internal growth is commodity revenue, which increased 1.5%. The growth in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 35% to $157 per ton in the second quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year. The average commodity price in June was approximately $160 per ton. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased 49% primarily due to an increase in rebates. Now, I'll discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%, which compares to 28.3% in the prior year. The change includes a 40 basis point increase in landfill operating costs. As discussed in the first quarter, we continued to see higher costs associated with the change in operating requirements at one of our sites. We also saw an increase in leachate volumes at a handful of our sites. These costs are temporary in nature and we expect the higher landfill operating costs to abate over the next few quarters. Excluding the increase in landfill operating costs, we had 10 basis points of margin expansion from strong pricing and volume growth, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Second quarter 2017 interest was $90 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 39.1%. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $358 million, which represents 6% growth over the prior year. We remain comfortable with our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $875 million to $900 million, which represents double-digit growth over the prior year, after adjusting for the change in cash taxes. Now I'll turn the call back to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Chuck. To conclude, we are pleased with our second quarter performance, strong fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, resulted in 7.5% top line growth and double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow. Given our solid performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance range. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.39, which is an increase from our original guidance range of $2.32 to $2.36. At this time, operator, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Hi. Good afternoon and thank you so much for taking the questions. Congrats on the strong quarter. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Noah. Charles F. Serianni: Thank you. Noah Kaye : Thank you, thank you. MSW volumes, just to start out, kind of a little bit lagging as it has for several quarters now kind of the growth in some of these other categories, C&D, special was very strong obviously this quarter. Can you just (15:22) how to think about the trajectory of MSW going forward with the course of the rest of the year? Is this kind of potentially growing at a lag to some of these other categories given your footprint in some higher growth areas of the country? Thanks. Donald W. Slager: We'll think about this, right. We've always said that we're in a slow growth business, right, depends on population growth, housing formation and that those dynamics are all pretty consistent and strong. We're still only at a sort of 1.2 million of household formation, there is room to grow as that gets back to some kind of a new norm. And remember, as we talked about some of the volume impact is due to some of the loss in the broker business, which is an intentional strategic decision, right. So we've seen very broad-based recovery, very broad-based volume across the entire book of business. So, we feel pretty good about it and again we just raised our guidance, thinking, saying that the first half performers is going to continue through the second half of the year. Noah Kaye : Okay. And just thinking about the puts and takes of free cash flow for the rest of the year and maybe just focusing on the CapEx, how should we think about kind of the pace of CapEx spend over the course of the rest of the year? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So, so far we spent about 53% of our CapEx first half of the year. As we look at over the rest of the year, obviously we had very strong volume growth first half of the year and therefore because of that we may need to increase our capital spending to fund that growth. And that's why we haven't changed our free cash flow guidance. Noah Kaye : Okay. Got it. And if I could just sneak one more in, obviously COGS went up significantly resulting from the recycling rebates. Can you just tell us, to what extent was recycling incremental or decremental to EBITDA margins in the quarter? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. It was obviously accretive to the margins, but keep in mind that when you're talking about the COGS that 20% of the tons that we handled are brokered by us. So, if you actually exclude those volumes and those brokered volumes, then our sale of materials and our COGS went up by a similar rate of approximately 30%. Noah Kaye : That's extremely helpful. Thanks so much. Donald W. Slager: Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Please go ahead. Ken C. Wang: Thank you. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Congratulations on the quarter. Donald W. Slager: Thanks. How are you doing, Ken? Charles F. Serianni: Hey, Ken. Ken C. Wang: Doing well. Just wondering whether you can comment on the M&A environment and specifically any change in the quality of opportunities you're seeing and what is your view of recent multiples. Donald W. Slager: Well, as we reported, we spent $91 million in the first half of the year. We started the goal with a $100 million spend kind of a \u2013 in our site. So we'll easily hit the $100 million target for the year. I would say the pipeline is full. As far as what we're spending on deals, it's still pretty consistent with our historical sort of 4.5 times to 5 times EBITDA post synergy. So as you know, this gets a little lumpy occasionally a bigger deal comes along, it's a lot of work to close a lot of smaller deals, but we feel good about the trajectory. So we're \u2013 again that's part of the guidance raised for the second half of the year. Ken C. Wang: Thank you. And any thoughts on China's recent announcements that it will ban imports of certain waste materials like scrap plastics, do you think this will have any effect on Republic? Donald W. Slager: Well, again, I don't have a crystal ball, but here is what I'll tell you. This is not the first time we've seen this kind of thing from China. We've been through this a number of times in our past. So we have a very high quality pack that we make whether it's fiber or plastics. We've never had an issue with quality rejection in our history. So even in times when supply and demand kind of shifts, we've never had a slowdown on shipping our material, so we've got a really good track record. And then, the fact is not all of our sub goes to China, right. So really only what about 35% goes to China and there is a lot more domestic capacity than people realize and a great deal of our fiber, specifically, still remains domestic. And most of that China business is going from the West Coast ports and again those West Coast (20:00) that we operate have a very strong track record in quality. Ken C. Wang: Thanks for the color and congratulations again. Donald W. Slager: Thanks. Charles F. Serianni: Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Marc Silber : Thanks so much. I know you don't provide specific guidance beyond free cash flow and adjusted EPS, but I'm just curious, with the increase in your adjusted EPS guidance, where is that coming from? Is it more from a revenue perspective, more from a margin perspective, a mix, any color would be great? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So obviously, we posted a very strong revenue first half of the year, so that's where that EPS guidance increase is coming from and then that's been partially offset and what I talked about earlier about the temporary increase that we're seeing in our landfill operating costs, so it's the net of those two. Jeffrey Marc Silber : In terms of that temporary increase in the landfill operating costs, when do you expect that to go away? Is that something we'll see over the course of this year or is that something more over the course of the next year or so? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, we say over the next few quarters, most of that's going to take place this year. Jeffrey Marc Silber : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question will come from Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe G. Box: Hey guys. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Joe. Charles F. Serianni: Hey, Joe. Joe G. Box: So I just wanted to dig into the margin profile a little bit. Obviously, when the year started, you guys provided some commentary and I get that things have certainly changed. But you laid out 28.5% to 28.7% EBITDA margins for 2017. I certainly respect that recycling is flowed through at a lower rate here, but any commentary on how we should think about what's inherently baked into the guide for EBITDA margin in the back half of the year? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So when we look at the back half of the year, obviously we're expecting expansion in the margins and that's really coming from the strong revenue. At the same time, as I had talked about before though, these landfill costs are going to slowly abate. So, we're going to have that headwind associated with also. So as we're looking at the margin, it's kind of longer term. We're thinking that we're going to be flat for the year. But if you take out the landfill operating costs, then that would get us right back to the 30 or 40 basis points of expansion that we had anticipated. Joe G. Box: And then, changing gears, on the SG&A front, obviously the salary component was up about 12%. Can you just help us understand how the incentive comp flows through for the rest of the year? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So, in terms of the incentive comp, keep in mind that we had an adjustment last year to incentive compensation that didn't repeat this year. And so obviously, our incentive is currently at levels that are consistent with our guidance for the rest of the year. Joe G. Box: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Noah (sic) [Joe]. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael J. Feniger: Hey, guys. Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. On the first part, on the margin, I think I heard you say there was a 10 basis points expansion from strong pricing and volume growth when we take out the higher costs from the landfills. That still feels pretty low with what you're seeing at energy services and the volumes that are coming through. Is that something typical? The 10 basis points, is that typical at this point of the cycle and how should we think about the mix of the business as volumes are starting to grow and it's becoming a little bit more broad-based? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. This is Don. When \u2013 I'll let you think about that Chuck. I don't know that there is typical, right, when you think and you said it, what about the mix, right? So there is geographic mix, there is line of business mix. You start digging through some of that. There is this difference between rising fuel cost net. There is the net between sale of goods and cost of goods. So those things impact the margins, right. So, I don't think there is any typical. We're very confident in the business. Look at the $42 million of additional EBITDA we generated in the quarter year-over-year and we're still confident we're going to raise the margin. We're still internally focused on pushing the margins to 30%. But we're here to run the business for the long term and that's how we roll. So when it comes to dealing with some of these temporary costs, we're going to take them head on. We're going to deal with it. We got to get it behind us. So, again I don't know that there is a typical answer. I don't think we can just frame it that easily. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. I think you should just drop the mic at that point and we'll walk away. Donald W. Slager: Okay. There you go, Chuck. Michael J. Feniger: And then just my second question. When you think about the volumes, how did that look through the quarter and how is it shaping up so far in July? Donald W. Slager: Well, I think volumes are good. I mean, we're talking about 2% almost volume growth, right. And again in the best of times, 2.5% is a strong performance. So, we're bouncing off a 2% and that is including the broker business that we've chosen to move away from. So the team feels good about where we're at, about the trends going into Q3 and again we raised the guidance, which would indicate the confidence. Michael J. Feniger: Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi, good afternoon. Donald W. Slager: How are you? Charles F. Serianni: Hey Brian. Brian Maguire : Your average yield was really impressive, up 2.5%, and I think if I remember comments from earlier, you expected it to maybe accelerate in the back half of the year as some of the CPI uptick that we saw a couple of months back starts to kick in. Is that still the expectation that we would see that start to accelerate in the back half of the year? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So what happened is that we actually saw some of that acceleration in Q2 and that's why we're able to post a restricted price of 2.2%. So those resets have already started to happen. In addition to that, as I had mentioned before, we were able to actually renegotiate some of our contracts on favorable terms, those restricted contracts. So we've got that coming through under restricted price also. So as we look out for the rest of the year, we think that that restricted price and yield in general is going to be pretty much flat to where it was in Q2. Brian Maguire : Okay. And then, just a modeling one on 3Q. I think there is one fewer work day, maybe you can confirm that. And if so, what kind of an impact on margins or volume might you expect from that? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So there is one less work day and obviously that work day is included in our guidance. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on technology, maybe for Don. Where do you see the largest opportunity in your system? Is it on the customer side? Is it the route side? Is it the asset side? And sort of where are you guys in that process, early innings, mid-innings? Donald W. Slager: So I would say both customer and route side. So we're, I think, in early innings of both. Certainly we use computer software to route our trucks today. There is better software out there. We're looking at expanding our digital capability into cab, so that our drivers' day becomes easier, so we can communicate more effectively with the driver. So we can bring, build some more productivity into system with digital, what we call digital operations. There is obviously work to be done to still connect the cab to the customer and our digital platform. You've seen some of the work we've done with our app in our My Resource application. So more and more customers are signing up to do business with us digitally, so that's a good thing. So we're going to continue to move down that road and be \u2013 and we want to be the provider of choice with our customers and make it easy to do business with us. And again we wanted to try to find additional ways to build in some productivity with our driver base and if we can connect the drivers with the customers that's even a better thing. As far as assets, we watch what happens in the marketplace, so we've got our fleet team, they are very much involved in the dialogue around what's going on with vehicles and all this talk of autonomy and so forth. But \u2013 so we'll be involved in the conversation, but I think that's something that kind of a premature, it's going to be a ways out there. I think there's going to be a lot of other industries who get automated and fully automated before the waste business does. But we are looking for ways to improve some parts of it, while we still have an operator in the cab. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Great. And then just last question. I'll turn it over, maybe for Chuck. Maybe just longer term, how should investors think about your operating leverage framework? What I mean by that is longer term on 7.5% revenue growth, what should margins be up assuming, mix gets better, assuming some of these temporary costs go away, just maybe frame for investors how that operating leverage framework works. I realize Q2 is a little \u2013 there's some abnormalcies that I'm asking that, so? Charles F. Serianni: Right. And what we had talked, obviously the revenue growth has been very, very strong and commodities has been strong also. If you were to pull there \u2013 as I said, if you were to pull out these one-time landfill costs we'd have achieved kind of the high end of our guidance range in terms of our EBITDA margin growth year-over-year. As we look out into the future as these costs abate, there is still nothing structural that we see that'll keep us from getting back to 30% EBITDA margins that we had talked about, so that still demonstrates the leverage that we expect from this business. The other thing I would say also Hamzah is that it's not just the EBITDA that we're focusing on, it's also the cash flow. And I had a very wise man telling me one time that you can't spend EBITDA and we are focusing on the cash. And keep in mind that the cash flow guidance that we gave this year is double-digit when you adjust for cash taxes. So that's a very key metric for us also. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Right. That's helpful. That makes sense. Just a clarification question on, did you guys have CNG tax credits that went away or was that impactful at all or not material? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. It was impactful. Those credits went away this year, so we did not have those credits this year. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Okay. Got you. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Buscaglia from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Hey, guys. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Andrew. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Andrew. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Just a quick one on your \u2013 on that \u2013 those higher costs that are impacting your margins. Why would that costs go away eventually that \u2013 can you just give us some confidence or how to think about that, that that's not going to dampen these margins just beyond three quarters or four quarters whatever you said, Chuck? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. This is Don. So, we've got a handful of sites, landfill sites that have some increased leachate volumes that we're handling that's part of it. Based on what we know about how those landfills operate, we think those will abate. We had some unbudgeted heavy equipment repairs that rather than fool around with, we just decided to continue to run the business, right? So, again, some of these costs are lumpy, but we're confident based on our analysis of the business and our local operating teams' ability to run the sites that these things will abate over the next few quarters. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. And then are there any contracts that you might have picked up recently that have higher costs associated with them? I mean, I know it sounds like it's on the landfill side, but could there be anything there? Donald W. Slager: No. Charles F. Serianni: No, there's really no cost that we have that are impacting those landfill operating costs that Don had talked about. Donald W. Slager: But again, when we think about where the volume grows back to mix, right, so we had 9.5% growth in our transfer station revenues, right? Transfer stations are generally viewed as kind of an extended gate of the landfill. We don't run a very \u2013 a super high operating margin or EBITDA margin on our transfer stations. Even though again they are profit centers, they don't run as high of a margin. So, as I said, mix matters, geographic mix and line of business mix and some of these other puts and takes, so it's not quite as clean as you'd like to think. The good news, right, and the underlying thing that everyone used to remember is, it's broad-based recovery, it's across all lines, it's across all areas of the business, $42 million of additional EBITDA, and as you know we run the business for the long-term, we've raised guidance, we're confident of free cash flow, raised our dividend. I'm popped. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Sounds like it. All right. Thanks guys. Donald W. Slager: Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon guys. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey. Don, so nice job on the labor line, I think it fell maybe 50 basis points. But I'm curious can you talk a little bit about frontline driver availability? Are you guys seeing any outsized unit cost inflation there difficulty in procuring drivers? Donald W. Slager: No, in fact our driver turnover year-over-year is down Tyler. And I talked in my prepared remarks about the talent pillar of our agenda, right, of our strategy. We are very, very serious about becoming The Best Place to Work, where the best people come to work and we talk about how excited we are to receive the awards from Forbes and Glassdoor. Those are our real employees telling third-parties that they like working for us, right. Our employee engagement scores are up year-over-year, all the things we do to genuinely make Republic a better place to be. Technician turnover is down, part of that is OneFleet, part of that is the overall engagement strategy. So, look, we've got some markets that have an incredibly low turnover. We got a few that we still need to work through, but overall net of net, we're pretty happy about where we're at, especially in a time when construction jobs are still growing, we'll hold onto our people. So, we feel pretty good about it. Patrick Tyler Brown : Yeah, okay. Donald W. Slager: And by the way maintenance costs looked pretty good this quarter too, huh Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : I saw that. I did have a question on that. Donald W. Slager: Okay, shoot. Patrick Tyler Brown : Yeah, I'll stick with maintenance. So I think you posted 9.3% it's, which is, it's down year-over-year, but it's still maybe 100 basis points above where it was maybe a couple of years ago. So now that we're kind of through the OneFleet rollout, how should we think about that line over the next couple of years? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, here's the reality, right. So, we still have quite a few trucks that lived well over the first half of their life in a non-OneFleet environment, and they weren't maintained maybe the way they should have been and those trucks are going to have a higher operating cost than they should have, if they had been maintained under our OneFleet umbrella. So, over time as we continue to introduce 1,000 new vehicles a year to the fleet, and these 1,000 trucks roll off that were under maintained or neglected in some cases, we're going to see an improvement, right. So, we're also going to continue to see fleet reliability and all the other stuff that comes from that as well, right. So, it's going to continue to benefit us and of course, there is also the CapEx savings that we'll see over time. And once we get through some of that, we're going to really put a finer point on this efficient frontier fleet and we maybe even able to age the fleet a little more at some point, right. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay, good. And then, Chuck, so if I look at it, it feels like back half margins need to be maybe 100 basis points better than the first half, which is very rough math. I get that the landfill operating cost of maybe 40 basis points will fall off. But what's the other 60 basis points? Is that just leverage or are there some other pieces there that we should think about? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So, obviously there is leverage there that we had talked about. We expect that we're going to continue to be able grow that top line like we have. You've got the work day in Q3 which is a benefit for us also. So, it's a combination of all those factors. Donald W. Slager: Chuck and I are still going to come to work on that day. Charles F. Serianni: On that one \u2013 we are? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. We're still going to come to work. Charles F. Serianni: Okay. Donald W. Slager: Not one less work day for you Chuck. Charles F. Serianni: Okay. All right. Patrick Tyler Brown : All right. Well, all right. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman: Thanks, Don, Chuck, Nicole, for taking my questions. Donald W. Slager: It's nice to hear from you Michael. Michael E. Hoffman: You too. Look forward to traveling next week. So, on the capital spending side, where do you think the budget which is $975 million \u2013 I'm not sure why somebody said there weren't a whole lot of details on your guidance there. You've got a whole page of them in your 4Q press release. But you had $975 million of property and equipment net of proceeds. Where do you think that number goes? Charles F. Serianni: Like I said, Michael, it could go up a little bit because of the volume growth. Little bit could go up by $5 million, $10 million, maybe in that range. Michael E. Hoffman: So, $5 million, $10 million is the way to think about it? Okay. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, somewhere in that range. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. And then you did $130 million-some in recycling in this quarter and if 20% of it's brokered and the other 80% isn't and you kind of assign a 5% margins to the brokered piece and a 20% margin to the non-brokered piece, and then you pull it out, your garbage business is doing like 28.6% margins. So, net of \u2013 it means so there is marginal leverage here, there is operating leverage here. Charles F. Serianni: Absolutely, absolutely. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Charles F. Serianni: There is Michael, and it goes back to what we had said before, is that if you pull out, just pull out the landfill operating costs, you've got 10 basis points of margin expansion during the quarter. And if you do that for the entire year, you've got 30 to 40 basis points of margin expansion. That's right on top of the guidance that we had given. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Charles F. Serianni: So, yeah, the leverage is there. Michael E. Hoffman: What's the cash hit for the incremental, because here's the other problem is that theoretically your cash should maybe show a little more oomph than it is. But this 40 basis points is cash, so what's the cash hit from that 40 basis points? Because really the guidance, you're at $875 million to $900 million, I get to add on free cash flow. I get to add that back too. Nicole Giandinoto : Yeah. I mean, Michael, you can do the math. You can take the $2.5 billion of revenue times the 40 basis points in the quarter that we called out, 30 basis points in Q1. And that's all cash expense that's offsetting the strong revenue growth in the quarter. Michael E. Hoffman: And I should basically assume it's 40 basis points for the whole year on roughly $9 billion of revenues? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, 30 to 40, right. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. So ex that what you think is non-recurring over time, even if I cut it in half, my free cash \u2013 the baseline free cash that is coming going into 2018 is north of $900 million nicely? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. I mean, with the leverage \u2013 with the \u2013 the top line growth that we have right now that's true, right. Charles F. Serianni: So, again, we talk about several times on the call, right, mix matters, right. And we are confident that the margins are expanding within the business, we got some of these highlights like recycling and fuel and some of the things that just net things out, but business is strong, the growth is good, pricing is good, operating team's doing a great job. We've got a couple of sort of near-term temporary and unusual things to take care of and then we should really I think end the year strong and move nicely into 2018. Michael E. Hoffman: Right. So just finite detail around the sales since you gave a 4.5% to 5% growth rate in February, clearly we're doing better than that. The 2Q price hold that for the remainder of the year, the one \u2013 the 2Q volume hold that for the rest of the year too? Donald W. Slager: No. Right now, we're saying that we're going to be at the high-end of the range on the volume growth. Michael E. Hoffman: You are already through that. Charles F. Serianni: Well, you remember, you have seasonality. Donald W. Slager: And you've got some special waste volumes also, the special waste volumes like I had talked about and the C&D volumes both really high in the second quarter. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. And those are seasonal for sure. Michael E. Hoffman: 3Q though should be a good special waste quarter typically because it's the best. Donald W. Slager: Yes, yes. Michael E. Hoffman: Yeah, okay. Donald W. Slager: Q3 is generally speaking our best quarter seasonally. Michael E. Hoffman: Right. Donald W. Slager: And so there's... Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. All right. Thanks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you Michael. Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Michael. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Allison. In closing, we will continue to manage the business to create long-term shareholder value and remain focused on executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating a Republic way. Thank you for spending time with us today. Have a good evening, and put that cell phone down when you get behind that wheel. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending.

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, solid price and volume growth, as well as continued strength in our energy services business, and progress on our multi-year initiatives helped us achieve high single-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow per share. Highlights of the quarter and nine months ended include adjusted EPS of $0.67, an 8% increase over the prior year, despite a $0.01 headwind from hurricane related costs. Our results were positively impacted by solid execution across our business and a lower tax rate. In July, we raised our EPS guidance range to $2.36 to $2.39, despite the recent decline in recycled commodity prices and costs associated with the hurricanes, we remain very well-positioned to achieve the upper-end of the range. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $606 million, a 12% increase over the prior year, after normalizing for the change in cash taxes. On a per share basis, adjusted free cash flow increased 14% over the prior year. Free cash flow was in line with our expectations and we remain well positioned to achieve our full year guidance of $875 million to $900 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%, total revenue grew 6.3%, core price was 4.1%. Average yield was 2.5% and was strongest in our small container and large container businesses, were the majority of our customers are in open markets. The reported volumes increased 1.6%. Our volume growth continues to be broad-based and is strongest in the event-driven portion of our disposal business. Energy services revenue was $40 million, an increase of 130% versus the prior year. As part of our revenue enhancing initiatives, we now have approximately $510 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index or a fixed rate increase of 3% percent or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than CPI. Year-to-date we've invested $385 million in acquisitions including ReCommunity which closed in early October. The investment in ReCommunity enables us to further vertically integrate our recycling operations without adding capacity in our existing markets. To meet the demands of our customers who have told us recycling is important to them and have also demonstrated a willingness to pay, and to continue to capitalize on secular trends such as the growth in online shopping. Acquisitions remain a core component of our growth strategy and help us improve our operating density and further strengthen our existing market positions. Our pipeline for the remainder of 2017 and into 2018 is robust and will serve as a catalyst for future profitable growth. Year-to-date, we returned $682 million of cash to our shareholders as part of our efficient capital allocation strategy. This includes 5.7 million shares repurchased for approximately $357 million. Additionally, our board approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization which extends through 2020. This demonstrates the strength and confidence we have in our ability to grow free cash flow as well as our commitment to increase cash returns to shareholders, while maintaining our investment grade credit rating. Next, I'd like to discuss some recent events. First, with respect to the hurricanes, we are happy to report that all our employees are safe. In addition, we did not incur any material damage to our assets. Our third quarter results include cost associated with the hurricanes, which were partially offset by revenue from cleanup related work. In the fourth quarter, we expect storm-related revenue to offset additional costs. I'm extremely proud of the Republic team and would like to thank them for their tireless efforts to care for each other, service our customers, restore our communities and protect our assets. I would also like to acknowledge the generosity of our employees and board of directors, who have contributed $0.5 million to our Employee Relief Fund. With the company's matching donation, the fund has an additional $1 million to further support employees in their time of need. Second, I'd like to provide Republic's perspective on the recent increase in volatility in recycled commodity prices following China's announcement of its National Sword program. From July to the beginning of October, published OCC export prices declined 52% from a high of $237 per ton to $113 per ton. Since then, prices have rebounded nearly 45% and are now above the 10-year average. In the past, when comparable programs were implemented, we also saw a temporary increase in pricing volatility. We believe the recent volatility is again temporary and the pricing we saw in early October is not indicative of a new normal. Also, we haven't seen a structural change in the demand for packaging or recovered fiber and believe that continued growth in e-commerce and online shopping will further increase demand. At Republic, we produce a high-quality product and have established relationships with contracts with some of the largest most reputable buyers and mills across the U.S. and China, as well as Indonesia, Thailand, Korea and India. As a result, we've continued to sell our material without disruption to our partners across the globe and have not warehoused or landfilled any recovered material. Recent events reinforce our efforts to transition to a durable fee-based model and the need for additional public outreach and education to reduce the amount of recycling contamination of low-value material in the recycling waste stream. Looking-forward, we expect our average recycled commodity price in 2018 to decrease relative to 2017, yet remain above our 10-year historical average price. We expect a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind from recycling in the fourth quarter and a $0.04 to $0.05 headwind into 2018. We will provide an update on recycled commodity prices on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. Finally, in September, Republic was named to the gold standard of sustainability rankings for a second consecutive year. We were the only recycling and solid waste company in the world to be named to either the Dow Jones Sustainability North America or World Indices. We share the view of our customers and shareholders who have told us sustainability is important to them. We believe it drives profitability, reduces enterprise risk and enhances long-term value creation. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck? Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Don. Third quarter revenue was approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of $153 million or 6.3% over the prior year. This 6.3% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 5.9% and acquisitions of 40 basis points. The components of our 5.9% internal growth rate are as follows. First, average yield increased 2.5%, average yields in the collection business was 3.1%, which included 4% yield in the small container business, 3.1% yield in the large container business and 1.9% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.3%, which included landfill MSW of 1.8%. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.1%. Core price consisted of 5.1% in the open market and 2.3% in the restricted portion of our business. This is the second consecutive quarter we've seen a sequential improvement in restricted core price. The second component of our internal growth rate is total volume, which increased 1.6% over the prior year. Volumes in the collection business increased 10 basis points. This included a 1.8% increase in our large container business, partially offset by a 1.3% decrease in our small container business. Residential collection volumes were flat versus the prior year. Small container volumes included a 130 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have been flat versus the prior year. Within our large container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 4% and recurring hauls were up 1.2%. The post-collection business made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes increased 9%. Landfill volumes increased 10.1%, which included special waste of 24.7%, C&D of 14.5%, and MSW of 20 basis points. In the fourth quarter, we expect a seasonal decline in C&D and special waste volumes. The third component of our internal growth rate is fuel recovery fees, which increased 30 basis points. The increase relates to rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.63 in the third quarter from $2.38 in the prior year, an increase of 10%. The current average diesel price is $2.82 per gallon. The next component energy services revenue increased 80 basis points. The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin, where we are well-positioned. And the final component of our internal growth is commodity revenue , which increased 70 basis points. The growth in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to an increased recycle commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 26% to $167 per ton in the third quarter from $133 per ton in the prior year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased 22%, primarily due to an increase in rebates. Now, I will discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%, which compares to 28.9% in the prior year. The change includes a 30 basis point increase in landfill operating cost, a 40 basis point headwind due to a favorable legal settlement in the prior year and the 30 basis point increase in cost resulting from the hurricanes. Excluding these items, we had 10 basis points of margin expansion from strong open market pricing and volume growth, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Third quarter interest expense was $90 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 35% and benefited from favorable state tax settlements. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the fourth quarter. Since we received a number of questions regarding the potential impact of tax reform, I'd like to make a few comments. As a statutory tax rate payer, we would be a direct beneficiary of tax reform. For example, if the federal tax rate has decreased from 35% to 20%, free cash flow would increase by approximately $180 million, or said differently for every 500 basis point reduction in the tax rate, free cash flow would increase by $60 million. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $606 million, a 12% increase over the prior year after normalizing for the change in cash taxes. On a per share basis, adjusted free cash flow increased 14% over the prior year. Finally, as Don mentioned earlier, year-to-date, we've invested $385 million in acquisitions, including ReCommunity. At the same time, we successfully completed the sale of lower margin businesses for $81 million resulting in a net investment of $304 million to-date. Now, I will turn the call back to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Chuck. Given the predictability and consistency of our business similar to prior years, we are providing a preliminary outlook for next year. We are currently midway through our annual planning process. Based on our initial reviews and assuming current business and economic conditions continue, we project the following for 2018. Adjusted EPS of $2.53 to $2.58 and adjusted free cash flow of $925 million to $950 million. This represents high single-digit growth in EPS and free cash flow per share, despite a $0.04 to $0.05 headwind from recycled commodity prices. Excluding the impact of recycled commodities, the business is on track to deliver double-digit growth in both EPS and free cash flow per share. We will achieve these results in 2018 by growing both price and volume for the sixth straight year executing our strategy to drive additional operating leverage in the business, effectively deploying capital to fund profitable organic growth and accretive acquisitions, and consistently and efficiently returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Similar to prior years, we will provide detailed financial guidance for 2018 in February of next year. In summary, the current economic backdrop and industry fundamentals combined with our robust acquisition pipeline position us well to deliver another year of strong financial results. At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today will come from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on operating leverage. I think, Chuck, you mentioned 10 bps margin expansion on high single-digit revenue growth, but at the same time, I think you talked about better leverage in 2018, maybe just walk us through what sort of costs normalize as you get into 2018, the hurricane, some of these landfill operating costs, do they go down. Just walk us through what changes in 2018 where the leverage is much higher than 10 bps. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, So, there's a couple of things that we're looking at, Hamzah, one would be, as you mentioned, the landfill operating costs also were obviously higher this year. We did see a sequential improvement in this operating cost from Q2 into Q3. And obviously into 2018, we continue to see a decrease in those costs as a percentage of revenue. So that would be one thing I would point to. The other thing is the SG&A line. We do right now have the full cost of our customer resource centers, included in our SG&A, all three centers. This time last year, we only had two of those centers opened, and as we had talked about, we're going to continue to see leverage in the SG&A line, specifically related to those customer resource centers. So those would be the two things that I would point to in particular. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Great. And just maybe for Don, just any update on the commercial business? One of your smaller competitors highlighted some competitive pressures in certain urban markets. I know you guys are more diversified nationally, but just any color on what you're seeing in the commercial business? Thank you. Donald W. Slager: Sure. Yeah. Overall right \u2013 we would tell you that it's still very rational in that business. You think about the yields we saw in small container business was 4%, still very strong. Small container volume growth was negative due to, as Chuck said in his commentary, moving away from the broker business. So we've been doing that \u2013 now steadily over a number of quarters, and we'll continue to do that in the next year. The real reason for it being negative then beyond that is just National Accounts. So we've lost our non-regrettable National Accounts, and we've taken up pretty hard line on making sure that, that portfolio was \u2013 is meeting the appropriate return. And as you know National Accounts business can be a little choppy that way. So overall though we would say it's pretty rational and we continue to see positive growth, container waste kind of flat quarter-to-quarter, but service increases still are greater than service decreases. So, we still think there's additional upside in the small container business for us. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Yeah. Just a follow-up, I'll turn it over. On tax reform, you mentioned the $180 million, if tax rates go to 20%, and it's in the news, the 20%. What do you guys intend to do with the cash? Would that come back in terms of a buyback or how are you thinking about deployment of that cash? Thank you. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Thanks, Hamzah. So first I'd like to say that the $2 billion repurchase authorization that the board approved doesn't estimate that there'd be any tax reform, right. So, the $2 billion is based on our current performance, the current tax policy, et cetera. So, if you take a look at what we do historically, we've been pretty efficient returning cash to shareholders. Over the last seven years, we've returned about $5.5 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With this new authorization over the next three years, we expect to return about $3.5 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And that doesn't include any kind of tax reform. So, again, when we have cash, we put it to work. So, we put it to work in the acquisition pipeline, we return it to shareholders, as I just described, through sort of the normal channels. But that's what we do with it. All of this planning around cash and around our buyback strategy has us keeping our optimum leverage between 2.5 and 3 times. So, there really isn't a need to do anything with debt service or repay debt at this point. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Good afternoon, Don, Chuck and Nicole. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe starting with your commentary on the robust pipeline, just maybe give us some color on where that's weighted to in terms of areas of the business, tuck-ins, with core solid waste, recycling, any kind of color would be helpful. Donald W. Slager: Sure. Other than the ReCommunity deal, which was a large transaction by itself, once again we bought 26 facilities, 22 were on top of our existing markets, so it was a very nice tuck-in, if you will, to densify and give us more strength in our existing markets. Outside of that, majority was tuck-ins. There were no other really large transactions to speak of and that's what we think the majority going forward. So we'll continue to look at all opportunities large and small that fit our strategy. Again, we're in 240 marketplaces across the U.S. with 39 states. We will look at businesses that are tuck-ins in our current markets, that are contiguous to current markets where we can leverage management and knowhow, but primarily across our core businesses. Noah Kaye : Okay, great. Thanks very much for that. And then, understanding that your guidance is preliminary for 2018, I wonder if you can just help us think as concretely as possible at this point how to kind of bridge from the midpoint of this year to next year's free cash flow guidance. Charles F. Serianni: I will say this that we are anticipating margin expansion in our preliminary guide for next year. Obviously, what we do in our preliminary outlook is give kind of just the big building blocks here, but we'll get into a lot more detail, Noah, in February. Noah Kaye : Fully appreciate it. Just wondering, I mean, I don't know if you're factoring in any kind of potential debt refi off of that. You talked about kind of keeping leverage optimal. But I mean, given the credit markets continue to be pretty healthy, how are you thinking about debt refi opportunity over the near and medium-term? Donald W. Slager: We have over the course of the next three years or so a little over $2 billion of debt that is coming due. The coupon on that debt is anywhere from the high-3s into the 5s, and so we're looking to be opportunistic as we refinance that debt. If we were to refinance that at current levels, current treasury levels right now, there would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million to $35 million worth of cash savings. Noah Kaye : Okay, great. Thanks so much. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question will come from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale : Hey. Good afternoon. A couple of pretty quick questions. I understand you're not giving more specifics on the guidance but are you willing to say anything about either the GAAP tax rate assumption or the cash tax assumption baked into 2018? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So as I said before, we're a statutory tax rate payer, so your 39.5% is what we're \u2013 what's currently in our model. Corey Greendale : And cash tax charge? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So cash tax is once again, a little over $100 million \u2013 little over 100% because we're still coming off of bonus depreciation. When we finally anniversary all the way through bonus depreciation we'll go back to a long-term average of just a little under 100% call it 95-ish-percent. Corey Greendale : Okay. And then maybe I'll do a two-parter for my second question. Risk management costs have been elevated for a couple of quarters, sort of what's driving that, what's your expectation? Then my second question is, as you \u2013 I think you had sort of back-end loaded CPI increases and I know you're switching to other indexes, but should we expect given that that you may see higher levels of price in Q4 and going into 2018? Donald W. Slager: So, in terms your risk management question, we had a reversal, a favorable development of prior claims last year that didn't repeat this year. So, that's why the year-over-year comparison looks a little less favorable. But that's not something that's long term indicative of the trend in risk insurance. In terms of your question on CPI, right now what we're projecting, what we're seeing as maybe CPI coming in a little about 2% for 2017, if that's the case, if that holds then in July of next year, July of 2018, we get a step up, we get that step up in our restricted pricing and that's probably were 10 basis points to 20 basis points of yield for us. Corey Greendale : Excellent. Thanks for the answers. Donald W. Slager: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Box of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Joe G. Box: Yeah, hey guys. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Joe. Charles F. Serianni: Hey, Joe. Joe G. Box: So, landfill costs have crept up pretty much across the space and it seems like we're now going on about four years of volume growth there. So, I'm curious if it's possible to not just fix the cost issues there, but you know maybe aggressively pull the price lever a little more than you have? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, we think that's a great idea, we've been talking about that as well. So, you know we talked a lot over the years about landfill cost and the value of these landfills and they're nearly impossible to replicate, they're expensive to build, to own \u2013 to own into perpetuity. So, we have been consistently raising landfill prices over the last several years. Most of the landfill volume that comes into our sites today, comes from municipalities. So, just like, we're working to move the appropriate escalator index, we use from CPI to something more like water, sewer, trash in our collection business, we're trying to do that in our landfill business as well. So, we're going to continue to focus on that. For us, some of the landfill costs that have been \u2013 that have been inflated, really have been from just a handful of facilities. So it's not, it's not broad based for us from that perspective, so that's why when Chuck said we think some of that landfill increase is going to come down, as we go through 2018 and we believe that we'll get those handful of sites operating better. But we agree, landfill pricing, when you look at the whole list of pricing, for us landfill price has been 1% and everything else is sort of 3%, 4%, when you get to average yield, so our infrastructure needs to be looked at. Joe G. Box: Okay. I mean I guess as my follow-up then. I mean, is it reasonable to think then because we've seen volume flow in at the rate that we have that, we could be on the frontend of a step up or an acceleration in landfill pricing? Donald W. Slager: Well, I just described what \u2013 when we're going to try to do, I mean, as we're talking to municipalities about extending contracts again the same conversation that has taken that $2.5 billion book of residential collection contracts and converted over $500 million of it now to an alternative index. Those conversations are now going to be had with the landfill customers as well or municipalities, the same thing is true, we've done that with on the recycling processing side, we've already converted about 80% of that book over to a better in more fair index or value sharing arrangement. So one by one, we're getting through that. And again as I said, landfills is kind of next on our horizon. Joe G. Box: Understood. Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Tyler. Charles F. Serianni: Good morning, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, Chuck. So, I want to make sure I have the math right on the cash flow statement, you spent $138 million on acquisitions, you noted $385 million year-to-date. So, was all of the delta that $250 million, is that all ReCommunity, or is there some other stuff in there? Charles F. Serianni: So, about $200 million or so was ReCommunity. And I don't have to say what the statement of cash flows in front of me. So, I'm not \u2013 I would have to look at the rest of it, Tyler. Nicole Giandinoto : Yeah. Tyler, if you're looking at the statement of cash flow, remember that that's year-to-date. Patrick Tyler Brown : Yes. Nicole Giandinoto : Kind of acquisition cash paid on acquisitions. So, if you take the $385 million number and that we spoke to back out about $180 million for ReCommunity, which again included the 26 operating facilities and some tax attributes, we get back to a number close to what you see on the statement of cash flow. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then well, so from a modeling perspective, assuming what we know now assume that all the acquisitions that you've done is all you do, do you kind of have what the revenue rollover impact would be in 2018 from those, and maybe what the rollover impact from the divestitures would be? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So, a net number then would be revenue contribution is about 185 basis points. Patrick Tyler Brown : Oh, okay, okay. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, that number. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay, and so how much are you expecting to benefit from the call center consolidation? Charles F. Serianni: Right now it's too early to tell. We'll give you more detail on that Tyler in February. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. And just maybe last one here. But is there any way to quantify how much of the landfill operating cost was maybe extraordinary, I mean, is there, is there any number kind of that we can think about just maybe falling off in 2018? Charles F. Serianni: You know, it depends on how quickly we can actually lower these costs. Keep in mind also that the majority of these costs have to do with us reducing leachate volumes that are actually in the landfills themselves in order to make them operate more efficiently. So, it really depends how quickly we're able to do that, right. So, these are costs that we're incurring today to really help the long-term effectiveness of the landfill. So, right now, I don't have a good estimate that I can give you in terms of the timing, but we do expect that they will go down in 2018. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. And maybe, sorry one, one last one. But are you \u2013 when you talk about margin expansion next year, are you including the dilution from ReCommunity, so as we see it on the P&L? Charles F. Serianni: Yes. I am including that. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman: Thank you, Don, Chuck and Nicole for taking my questions. On the operating leverage, if I can come back there's a multipart to it. 10 basis points but you also have recycling very favorable, so how do I adjust for the year-over-year 26% increase in recycling prices, clearly it says the margin leverage is better? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. You get to keep in mind the costs that we incurred also Michael, associated with the recycling facilities. You know, the whole China National Sword, because of that as you, as you're very familiar, there was a higher quality that needed to be produced in our facilities, that created more cost. And so that offset some of the benefit that we saw associated with higher commodity pricing. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. So, you're saying that there's \u2013 well, that would actually make my case even stronger. So your margins in recycling is even lower. So, if I backed out recycling year-over-year like-to-like, the operating leverage of the garbage company is better than 10 basis points? Donald W. Slager: It is better than 10 basis points, it's absolutely right. Michael E. Hoffman: Yeah. That's what I'm trying to get at. What that number - Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Michael without giving all the detail, when we constructed here the various component \u2013 parts of our business, we saw a really strong operating leverage in our small container business, in our large container business, whereas you know as density grows, margins grow with it. So that part of the business is working great. We had this noise around recycling, as Chuck described. And we did a lot of acquisition work. So, we've got some acquisitions startup costs in the quarter. The good news is, we did a lot of acquisitions; the bad news is, we had a lot of acquisition startup costs. So, we've also been investing in our digital platform, investing in some other fleet issues. As Chuck said, though, the leachate issues. So, and we're making decisions to run the business better that we think will all benefit us in 2018. But there's definitely margin expansion going on in the right parts of the business, that we expect. And since, we had such a strong quarter and we're still guiding to the high-end of the range and producing a lot of cash flow, we're making some other investments along the way. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. So following that line of thinking, what's the EBITDA and free cash flow implications of your penny in 2Q, and 4Q and your $0.05 to $0.06 in 2018 -- $0.04 to $0.05 in 2018 from recycling? Nicole Giandinoto : Michael, it's a balance, call it say like 10 basis points, when you look into 2018. 10 basis points to 20 basis points. Michael E. Hoffman: 10 basis points to 20 basis points on EBITDA? Nicole Giandinoto : Yes. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. And then in your free cash flow outlook for next year. If you start with a $253 million and work upwards it clearly there's margin expansion. But when you start thinking about the components of cash flow from ops, it looks like you have a pretty healthy working capital use going into 2018. And I'm trying to understand why that would be versus your normal pattern. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. No, Michael, we're not seeing that. We're not seeing any unusual increase in working capital. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. All right. We'll go back and fine-tune the model more then. All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Charles F. Serianni: Take care, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman: Yeah. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi. Good afternoon. Just following up on some of the questions on the initial outlook for the cash flows next year. I'm just wondering if you can give any initial look at CapEx either on a dollar basis or percentage of sales or even just maybe directionally from the 2017 levels where you think you'll be landing in 2018. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So, our CapEx, as a percentage of revenue, has trended about 10%, maybe a little bit less than that. And we right now are expected to be at a similar level for 2018. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks. And it seems like this year's cash flow and next year's guidance implies maybe something in the very low-30s as a percentage of EBITDA. And I know comparing you to others in the industry isn't totally fair. You've got a different tax rate, different capital structure, lots of different things. But some of the others have made a little bit of progress moving that up recently. I'm just wondering if you're thinking about the number that we're at this year or next year, there's any sort of unique things that might go away. Maybe it's the CapEx coming down, maybe it's like you see those cash taxes reverting back a little bit. But where do you sort of see that free cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA settling out in a more normalized environment? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. We think that for next year, it'd probably be relatively in the same zone as a percentage of EBITDA. Longer-term, we are looking at the tax side of the equation to see if there's anything that we can do there to help lower the cash taxes we pay. We're obviously very much focused in on our post closure liabilities also, making sure that we're being intelligent about how we spend that cash. And looking at our cash interest rate also and seeing what we can do in terms of lowering the amount of cash that we're paying there. So, we are focused in on it. I would say that we're working very diligently on it. I wouldn't say that we've got a lot of arrows in the quiver here in order to kind of slay this dragon. The one huge benefit for us would be tax reform. So, just doing the math very quickly, if we were to get tax reform, if the federal tax rate were to go from 35% down to 20%, that would increase the conversion from where we are right now, to your point, in the low 30s almost to 40%. So it would be huge for us. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. And Brian, remember that, as we grow, growth requires CapEx. And at the same time, we're still working on extending the useful life of the fleet. So, we're only partway through that initiative and we'll see benefit from that yet in 2018 and a little bit beyond. Brian Maguire : Okay. And just shifting to the recycling topic, you mentioned I think in response to one of prior questions that you have a little bit of expenditure to try and get to the tightened spec in China. I guess they're looking to get things down to as low as 0.3%, which I think most people we've talked to said, it's pretty unachievable. I guess, maybe if you could just give your own comment as to how realistic that is given the current set of technologies that we've got in the industry and where do you think that this spec will eventually settle out at? Donald W. Slager: Well, I think it's too early to tell. Again, we've seen this type of thing before. Everyone agrees, they're really serious about it. But, again, we think we have a better starting point than a lot of people have. So, I know there's been a lot of things in the press, people talking about how this has impacted them more negatively than it has us. But, one, again, we're just starting by a better place. We've invested a lot in our facilities over recent years to make them more efficient to produce a high-quality pack to reduce residual. And so we're going to continue to work on it like everybody else and it'll level out at some point, but I think it's too early to tell where they'll really end up. At the end of the day, they need fiber and packaging demand isn't going to go down in my mind. It's not going to go down on my household, I'm pretty sure. So, we think we're going to be in a good place when it all shakes out. Brian Maguire : And have you seen any pickup in export orders yet? I think we've been hearing kind of maybe that some of the import licenses for 2018 will be granted maybe later this month, but just wondered if there's any people who have some licenses leftover that they're using now or any pickup just in the last couple of weeks there? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So for us, we have never had an interruption in shipping, right. So we don't warehouse our inventory material. We don't play the market. We consistently flow material out of our facilities, ship it regularly, we've never had a back up, we haven't landfilled any material. I know people have reported they have had to, we have not. So, we haven't seen any interruption in the flow of the business. So the rate structure is a little different story, but we've seen no interruption in that, as I said in my comments we've had longstanding relationships with good reputable partners across the globe. Again we ship a fair amount of our material domestically, even though we understand it's a global market. But China, now India, South Korea and then the list goes on. So we've got a lot of outlets and we've got a lot of great partners. And as it settles down I think we'll be in a good place. Brian Maguire : Okay. Just one last one for me. Can you - Donald W. Slager: I would back up by this, willingness to pay for recycling in the U.S. is on the increase. So we continue to report for instance in our open market business \u2013 our open market recycling customers are paying 90% of the rates they pay for solid waste because they're willing to pay. And so, we need to take that same approach across our residential business, across our franchise business. The customers are saying they're willing to pay for it and they are. And because they value the idea of recycling and sustainability. And their viewpoint is simply if I'm going to carry it out to the curve, I'm okay paying garbage prices, I just want you to do something positive with it, right. So and I want you to prove to me that you do. And that's what we're doing and it's working. So it's been very effective in the open market. Now, we've got to get busy moving it into some of these longer term contracts. But the consumerism of recycling is on the upswing and that's where people have to understand. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks for those comments. Just one last one. I can't remember if you said anything in the prepared remarks, if you did I apologize, but any expected benefit in the fourth quarter or 2018 from some of the hurricane cleanup activities? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, as we said we got about a penny negative from total hurricane net-net in Q3. We're going to have kind of flat impact in Q4, and then we'll get that trickled in benefit into next year. So, think about it, three different hurricanes were, you know enough about what happened in Houston, but we've got a lot of landfill space in Houston, so we're going to benefit there on the landfill side, and then to the construction material that comes through Puerto Rico is a similar story, although there's much more devastation, but we're well positioned there with landfills. We've got a great workforce in Puerto Rico. The people there got back to work within seven or days to nine days of the hurricane. So, we're one of the first ones to get back to work and landfills are in good shape. So, where we have landfills, we'll get some benefit as we go through time. And then, the Florida hurricane really hit for the most part of the Keys, and Marco Island, Naples and we're just kind of in that market. So, we just maybe lost one day of work in the process, and not a lot of benefit there. So anyways, well it'll just trickle in as they rebuild, and we're heavily situated prepared in the market with great assets and great people and we'll get our fair share of that business. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Hey, guys, just a couple of quick ones, most of the good ones are taken. So, if you could comment, I don't know if you had said this, but does your 2018 preliminary guide contemplate any buyback. I guess it is too many any in there. Charles F. Serianni: For the share repurchase, Andrew? Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Yeah. Yeah. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. Yeah, it does. It does contemplate the buyback. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. So can you comment how much are - Donald W. Slager: Well - Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. We won't give you. Yeah. We won't give you that. We don't have that detail right now, we'll give it to you in February. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. Thought so. And then just on the January of 2018 when you announced those organizational layer and resource center changes exactly, which line items do those would be model those into. I mean, is it just SG&A? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. It is in SG&A, that's correct. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. All of those. Okay. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. That's all I need to know. Thanks. Charles F. Serianni: Okay. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Alison. To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance, and we are well positioned to achieve our full-year 2017 earnings and free cash flow guidance. We will continue to manage with the business to create long-term shareholder value and remain focused on executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, their commitment, and their dedication to operational excellence, and creating the Republic way. Thank you everybody for spending time with us today. Have a good evening and have a great and safe weekend. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results, which exceeded the upper end of our guidance range. In 2017, the team achieved strong growth in price and volume, delivered high single-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow per share, improved return on invested capital by 40 basis points, and increased cash return to shareholders by over 30%. A robust financial performance continues to demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and our ability to create long-term shareholder value. Highlights of the quarter include adjusted EPS of $0.61, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Earnings were positively impacted by strong event-driven volumes and a net 3-cent benefit from lower taxes. Fourth quarter total revenue increased 7.6% and includes over 5% organic growth, the highest level we've achieved in nine years. Core price was 4.1%, and average yield was 2.4%. Volumes increased 2.7%. Our growth in volume continues to be broad-based and remains strongest in the event-driven portion of our business. Energy services revenue was $46 million, nearly two times prior year's revenue, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.2% was in line with our expectations. Turning to the full year, adjusted EPS was $2.43, a 9.5% increase over the prior year. EPS exceeded the high end of our upwardly revised guidance range by $0.04. Adjusted free cash flow was $934 million and exceeded the upper end of our guidance range. On a per share basis, adjusted free cash flow increased 7% over the prior year. Total revenue was $10 billion, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Core price was 4.1%. Average yield was 2.5%, the highest level achieved since 2009. Volumes increased 1.8% over the prior year and included double-digit growth in event-driven landfill volumes. And finally, we invested $437 million in acquisitions in 2017, and our 2018 pipeline remains strong. Throughout 2017, we continued to deliver on our promises to key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees, and shareholders. For our customers, we strive to provide the highest level of customer service and are committed to developing differentiated and superior products that meet their wants and needs. Some of our accomplishments during 2017 included the following. First, to meet the demand of our customers, we expanded our recycling processing capabilities through the acquisition of ReCommunity. Our customers have told us recycling is important to them and have demonstrated their willingness to pay. Additionally, to ensure the sustainability of recycling, we have transitioned approximately 85% of our processing volume to a more durable, fee-based model. Second, we continued to refine and optimize our digital platform to improve the online customer buying experience. We saw double-digit growth in online sales and the customer satisfaction ratings. Lastly, we completed the transition to our three state-of-the-art Customer Resource Centers. These centers are designed to enhance the customers' experience through a more professionally trained customer service team, improved technology, and additional communications channels. For the communities we serve, we remain devoted to delivering safe, convenient, and value-driven solutions while being good stewards of the environment. In 2017, with respect to safety, we continued to see a favorable reduction in employee incidents, and our performance is over 40% better than industry average. On the sustainability front, we were named to the gold standard of sustainability rankings for a second consecutive year. We were the only recycling and solid waste company in North America to be named either the Dow Jones Sustainability North America or World Index. For our employees, we aim to be an employer of choice, one where the best people come to work. We accomplished this by creating an environment and culture in which all individuals feel welcome and valued, by training and developing our employees throughout their careers and by offering fair and competitive wages and benefits. We've been investing in these areas for several years, and our employees have told us, they see the difference, which is the true litmus test the impact we are making here at Republic. For example, in 2017, we were named to the Forbes America's Best Employers List. We received a Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award, and we were recognized by Ethisphere as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. Additionally, we have a best-in-class employee engagement score with high participation rates, and our turnover continues to outperform industry and competitor benchmarks. And finally, for our shareholders, we remain committed to creating long-term value, and 2017 was a perfect example. Our strong financial performance included high single-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow per share, and a 40 basis point improvement in ROIC. We returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a cash yield of over 5%. And lastly, in October, our Board approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. This demonstrates the confidence we have in our ability to grow free cash flow and increase cash returns to shareholders while maintaining our investment grade credit rating. Before turning the call over to Chuck, I'd like to make a few comments on tax reform. As a statutory tax rate payer, we benefit substantially from tax reform. We believe we have a responsibility to invest and deploy additional cash flow in a manner that will provide meaningful and long-term benefits to our employees, customers, communities, and shareholders. In 2018, we expect cash tax savings of approximately $190 million. As I mentioned earlier, we've been steadily investing in our people for years, and tax reform provides us the opportunity to accelerate some of these benefits. Over the next few years, we plan to invest a total of $200 million back into the business, specifically in our fleet and frontline employee facilities. We believe these investments will benefit people for years to come. With respect to our fleet, we will focus on replacing older trucks to help mitigate rising maintenance cost from increased complexity, reduce vehicle emissions, improve employee engagement, and maximize the benefit of bonus depreciation. We will also be upgrading our frontline facilities to enhance the work environment for our people, specifically locker rooms, break rooms, and training facilities. This will help us continue to increase employee engagement and improve our ability to attract and retain employees. Through data analytics, we know that as employee engagement increases, safety improves, turnover declines, and productivity rises, all of which directly benefit earnings and cash flow, ultimately creating long-term value. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of $181 million or 7.6% over the prior year. This 7.6% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 5.6% and acquisitions of 2%. The components of our 5.6% internal growth rate are as follows, first, average yield increased 2.4%. Average yield in the collection business was 2.8%, which included 3.8% in the small container business, 2.4% in the large container business, and 2% in the residential business. Average yield in the post collection business was 1.5%, which included landfill MSW of 2.1%. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.1%. Core price consisted of 5.1% in the open market and 2.4% in the restricted portion of our business. This is the fifth consecutive quarter we've seen a sequential improvement in restricted core price. The second component of our internal growth rate is total volume, which increased 2.7% over the prior year. Volumes in the collection business increased 20 basis points. Within the collection business, large container volume increased 2.3% and included a 3.7% increase in temporary C&D hauls and a 2.1% increase in recurring hauls. Residential collection volumes decreased 1.2%. The decrease was expected and resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. And finally, small container volume decreased 50 basis points. Small container volumes included a 110 basis point impact from intentionally shedding broker work, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes increased by 60 basis points. In the post collection business, which includes landfills and transfer stations, third party volumes increased 9%. Landfill volumes increased 16.5%, and included growth in special waste of 37.9% and C&D of 31.6%. MSW volumes decreased 1%. The strong double-digit growth in event-driven landfill volumes will create a difficult comp in 2018. The third component of our internal growth rate is fuel recovery fees, which increased 50 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.87 in the fourth quarter from $2.47 in the prior year, an increase of 16%. The current average diesel price is $3.09 per gallon. The next component, energy services revenue, increased 60 basis points. The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin, where we are well-positioned. And the final component of our internal growth is recycled commodity revenue, which decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to reduction in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 7% to $125 per ton in the fourth quarter from $134 per ton in the prior year. Next I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.2%, which compares to 27.9% in the prior year. The change includes a 40 basis point increase in landfill operating costs, a 50 basis point headwind due to a change in revenue mix from acquisitions and related integration costs, and a 30 basis point headwind from recycling. Excluding these items, we had 50 basis points of margin expansion from strong open market pricing in volume growth, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Fourth quarter interest expense was $93 million and included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 32% due to favorable tax settlements and tax planning opportunities. The net impact of these tax items increased EPS by approximately $0.03 during the quarter. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $934 million. Free cash flow exceeded our expectations, primarily due to bonus depreciation. On a per share basis, adjusted free cash flow increased 7% over the prior year. Before I turn the call back over to Don to discuss our 2018 guidance, I want to briefly discuss an accounting change in 2018. Beginning this year, certain payments to customers that were previously recognized as cost of operations will be reclassified to contra revenue. Examples of these payments include recycled commodity rebates and franchise fees. The change will result in lower revenue and expenses with no change to EBITDA. The impact of the accounting change has been incorporated into our 2018 guidance, which is detailed in our 8-K filing. I will now turn the call back to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Chuck. Before going to Q&A, I'd like to review the highlights of our financial guidance. In 2018, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.05 to $3.10, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided last October, adjusted for the benefit from tax reform. This represents 27% growth in earnings over the prior year or 12% growth after normalizing for the change in taxes and recycled commodity prices. We expect adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, which is also consistent with our preliminary outlook, adjusted for the benefit of tax reform. This represents 21% growth in free cash flow per share or 13% growth on a normalized basis. We expect annual revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. This includes average yield of approximately 2.25%. We expect the open market pricing environment in 2018 to be relatively similar to 2017. Next, we expect volume to be essentially flat versus the prior year. In 2017, event-driven volume \u2013 landfill volumes increased 20% due to several one-time large soil jobs and hurricane-related cleanup work that we don't expect to reoccur in 2018. And finally, we expect revenue growth from acquisitions of 2%. This relates primarily to tuck-in acquisitions and rollover impact from 2017 transactions. Next, we expect an adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.8% to 29%. 2018 net capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Given the strength of our 2018 deal pipeline, we anticipate investing over $150 million in tuck-in acquisitions. And finally, we expect to return approximately $1.2 billion of total cash to shareholders through $450 million in dividends and $775 million in share repurchases. In summary, the current economic backdrop and industry fundamentals, combined with our robust acquisition pipeline, position us well to deliver another year of strong financial results. Investments we are making for the benefit of our people, customers and communities will provide positive results and create a long-term value for our shareholders. At this time, operator, we'll open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Slager. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question will be from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Mr. Mazari? (20:48) Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Hi, guys \u2013 apologies. Hi, guys. This is actually Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah right now. Could you give us a sense of service increases versus decreases in the commercial business? And are you seeing any changes in the competitive dynamics in the segment? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So no change. We would \u2013 just as we've said in the last couple quarters, sort of the net-net of increases, decreases are still positive, trending in the right direction. No real change in competitive behavior. As I said, I just admitted on my closing comments, the fundamentals of the business are strong with a really good macro growth environment as a backdrop. So again, that's what positions us, as we've said, I think, well for 2018 in a \u2013 just another good year. Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Perfect. And then just a quick follow-up and I'll turn it over. On U.S. tax reform, do you see \u2013 or do you expect any change in labor inflation, and could you walk us through how much of the cost structure is labor? And do CPI contracts offset any labor headwinds that there might be? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So look, overall, our labor cost increases over the last several years have been pretty consistent. So, I'll start with that as a backdrop. Even when the recession was sort of at its worst, deepest, longest, we continued to adjust our people's pay. So we continue to give raises throughout periods of time, frankly where other employers were not giving raises. We continued to improve benefits. We continued to work on the work environment. So we don't see necessarily for us a big change coming. We put a lot of effort into employee engagement and to make it a great place to work. And we put a lot of work into making sure that our frontline people and all of our people frankly are paid according to the market and fair to market. So, it's not like we've got this sort of pent-up issue. Having said that, wages \u2013 direct wages are about 20% of our total revenue. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. 30%. (22:56) Donald W. Slager: And if you add in \u2013 that's driver frontline, if you add in the maintenance wages in that part of SG&A, that's people, it's about 30% all in. And we've done a good job managing these cost. And we've done a good job managing our benefits while still providing competitive and good benefit programs. So that's not really keeping me up at night. I think we're just going to answer we're fine. And then with CPI coming up, that just gives us additional help, right? So, we've been sort of the victims, if you will, of an artificially low CPI environment. And we've done a good job of holding our margins pretty strong through that. As CPI improves, we'll get some benefit. Remember, a little bit inflation ultimately is a good thing for us. So, I remember the days when inflation was sort of 3-ish percent. We saw that flow through our business pretty well. So that's not the \u2013 that's not worrisome. Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Tyler. Charles F. Serianni: Hey, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, Chuck. So I'm curious on the 130 \u2013 or 110 to 130 basis point expected improvement in the margins, just how much of that is simply the mathematics of the revenue recognition impact? Charles F. Serianni: It's 100 basis points, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. So, apples to apples, margins are \u2013 you're looking for some modest improvement. But can you talk about some of the pluses and minuses in the margins as we think about next year? So I think we have the call center consolidation, maybe some easing landfill costs. I know we have dilution from ReCommunity and then commodities. But can you kind of give us some color there? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, absolutely. So when you think about commodities, think about a headwind of about 20 to 40 basis points. When you think about change in mix primarily due to the ReCommunity acquisition, think about 30 basis points. So that would tell you \u2013 the math would tell you then that you've got 80 basis points of expansion just coming from the business. And part of that, as you had mentioned, is because of the CRCs. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. If I could just add something, Tyler, we're expecting to see margin expansion in all lines of our collection business in 2018. So that is the benefit of having great market position, of building density market by market, and again, that good macro backdrop. So, we expect to see that operating leverage continue to come through the business. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Very helpful. And then just real quick, Chuck, you'd given a longer-term EBITDA margin guidance goal, I suppose, of 30%, but given this change, is it just simple math to assume that it would be more like 31%? Donald W. Slager: How about if I take that, Tyler. Yeah. We \u2013 as I always say, let us get to 30% and then we'll get to 31%, but yeah, it's just simple math, remember, the two big things that have kind of kept us down in the margin department has been this CPI headwind, right, and sort of fluctuations in commodities, and we had shared with you last year, pre-tax reform, that if not for those two issues over the last several years, we'd be sort of above 31%. Right? So that 30% is sort of realistic target. Adjust for tax, we're still going to move the margins forward, and again, a little bit help from CPI and our \u2013 sort of we got an internal program we call sort of Reimagined Recycling (sic) [Recycling Reimagined] (26:19) as we make that business better and more sustainable economically, we're going to get there. Patrick Tyler Brown : All right. Thank you, guys. Donald W. Slager: Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Brian. Brian Maguire : Just on the topic of recycled commodity prices. They've started the year off lower than a lot of people thought, and I think that actually moved a little bit lower in the last month or so. And there's some speculation that China is just going to maybe not grant as many import licenses this year. So just wondering if you could provide more thoughts on that market and what your updated assumptions are on pricing and when and if you think prices might recover here? Donald W. Slager: Yes, so we've got $135 a ton in the plan for the year sort of through 2018. January is a little bit weaker than that, $120 a ton. So, our budget is $135, and we think based on what we know about the business, that it will come back through the year. And so we still feel pretty safe with that assumption of using $1.35 (sic) [$135] (27:27). So let me just speak a minute about China, right? So, we historically have told you that about 30% of our fiber moves to China. Over the last several months, we've been moving fiber to different locations. And now today, this minute, only about 10% of the fiber goes to China. So, we've kind of isolated that issue, if you will, for the time being. Having said that, I'll remind you that we've always felt and we always do produce a pretty good quality product. And so our recycle bales, et cetera, are pretty easy to move. We've never had to inventory material. We've never had to landfill material. Our \u2013 so anyways, we've actually opened new markets in Europe and in other parts of Asia. So we feel pretty good about where we stand from a sort of a supply chain freight movement perspective. And then the free market's going to work. And ultimately, the increase for consumer packaging we think will drive \u2013 mark the price back to where it belongs. And frankly, some of the bad actors that caused this problem in the first place, and we weren't one of them, they're going to have to get their act together, and then sort of the whole market improves. So we're still pretty positive. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks for that. And one follow-up, if I could. Just thoughts on how you would redeploy the sort of windfall you're getting from the tax benefits and the proceeds there between dividends, share repurchases, incremental CapEx, more growth, more employee compensation. And just sort of related to that, are you seeing a change in what the M&A targets you have are asking for, for their businesses as a result of the tax reform? Or is it too early to tell a lot at how that would impact the M&A landscape? Donald W. Slager: All right. So that was a pretty long question, and I'm going to give you a really long answer, how's that? Brian Maguire : Sounds good. Donald W. Slager: So let's go back in time, right? So last fall, when we gave our preliminary outlook, right, about that same time, we also \u2013 our Board also approved a new stock buyback plan of $2 billion. So at that time, you could sort of presuppose that if we \u2013 and we always do, right \u2013 sort of meet our goals around stock purchase, repurchase. So last year, we were saying, look, between the stock repurchase program and the sort of the dividend practice of the company that we expected over the next three years, 2018, 2019 and 2020, to return $3.5 billion to shareholders. Okay? Going forward the next three years, $3.5 billion. The four years preceding that, we returned $3.5 billion. So four years leading up to this year, up to \u2013 through 2017, it was $3.5 billion over four [years]. Now we're saying, we're returning $3.5 billion over three [years], and that was pre-tax reform, right? So we're staying true to that. And with tax reform, there's your question, what are we going to do with the windfall? So as I said in my comments, it's $190 million a year, because we're a statutory payer. And I also said by the way that we think the pipeline for acquisitions is pretty robust. So I'll come back to that. First of all, I said in my comments that we're going to spend about $200 million of that right back into the business. So in two ways. One in fleet. So we've got this One Fleet thing going. It's great. It's working out well. We expect to continue to age the fleet a little bit over time. But at the same time, we've got a lot of trucks that we sort of inherit through acquisitions that aren't really up to our standards. We have trucks that really weren't maintained very well from the beginning of time. We're probably going to buy some of those ages down. So we get a really good return on that by basically putting new trucks on the street. So we're going to use some of that cash flow, that new found cash flow, to infuse some new life into the fleet. So that's going to be good for our productivity, our safety, good for our frontline people, because, as you know, the office that our drivers have is their truck. So our drivers should love that. Secondly, facilities. So the other $100 million is back into the facilities and specifically for our frontline people. So we are going to \u2013 but we're putting together a plan now to go into our facilities and really start to upgrade break rooms, locker rooms, better locker rooms for our women employees, as we have more and more female drivers, and training space. And we take training very seriously. We want to make sure that we've got a really great professional place for our frontline people that come to work to start their day, so we can send them off like professionals, and a great place to end their day. So we think that is the highest and best use that frankly benefits the frontline employee directly over the long haul, and these are a lot of \u2013 again, we have a lot of \u2013 we have low turnover with a lot of employees with us 5, 10, 20 years, they're going to love that. It benefits the local economy, because we'll be hiring local contractors to do the work, so that's infusion into the economy. And it's good for our owners, because as always, I'm a broken record, but we run the business for the long term. And my job definition is create long-term sustainable value. And we think that's the way to do it. The remaining cash, hopefully, the pipeline continues. And we spent over $400 million in 2017. And I said in my comments emphatically that we're going to spend over $150 million in 2018, and we've got a little extra cash to buy some EBITDA. So any time we can continue to buy reoccurring cash flow in the business that we like and that we're pretty good at running, that's what we're going to do. How's that for a long answer? Brian Maguire : I got my money's worth on that one. So I'll... Donald W. Slager: All right. Brian Maguire : ...turn it over now. Thanks. Donald W. Slager: Thanks. Operator : The next questions will be from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew E. Buscaglia: Hey, guys. Charles F. Serianni: Hey, Andrew. Donald W. Slager: How are you? Andrew E. Buscaglia: Good. So I just wanted to touch on the volumes. So you're exiting the year at a pretty good volume run rate, yet your guidance is only flat to up 25 basis points. I might have \u2013 hopefully I didn't miss this in the comments, but why such a cautious view there on volume? Charles F. Serianni: It's really because of the special event volumes that we had in 2017. When you think about special waste in Q4, here being 37.9%, I can never remember a number that large before. So, that just creates a bit of a comp for us. But let me explain it this way also, Andrew. If you strip out the broker and the event business, then the volume growth in 2018 will be closer to 1% to 1.25%. Andrew E. Buscaglia: Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And then just given the macro backdrop here, people are on edge with the markets, and given your leverage, I mean, can you remind us with regards to your debt, how much is fixed here, if there's anything you can do on the variable that you're looking at potentially, and maybe any interest expense guide that you can provide? Charles F. Serianni: Yes. So we're about 81%, 82% fixed. The rest is floating. And we're going to constantly look and we have constantly looked at making sure that we have the appropriate view in terms of liability management. And we'll see what happens in terms of rate increases in 2018. But I'd also say that we've already contemplated a couple of rate increases in 2018 in our guidance. Andrew E. Buscaglia: Okay. Donald W. Slager: Okay, let me add to that. We continue to believe that our optimal leverage, debt to EBITDA leverage, is right about 3 times. And anywhere between 2.5 to 3 times works for us, and so as long as we can continue to put money to work in the market to buy good business, to invest in the business, maintain our leverage at a very acceptable rate of 3 times, and to Chuck's point, manage that portfolio as well as he and the treasury team do, it's a good place to be. So, we're in pretty good position. Remember too, right, I've got a couple things. Always remember, our business is a little bit different, right? Necessary service, long views into the incoming cash flows because of the large percentage of our customers under contract, long views in the outflows of cash because of the stability of CapEx in some of those cash flows or outflows, so \u2013 and also, we like the economy, right? So, the economy is doing well now. If the economy flutters a little bit, which we don't anticipate in 2018, we get a pretty good warning sign. Charles F. Serianni: Right. Donald W. Slager: And we get the sort of benefit from the ongoing housing and those kind of things at start. So that's one of the good things about the waste space. So we're... Andrew E. Buscaglia: Okay. Donald W. Slager: ...in pretty good place. Andrew E. Buscaglia: Got it, helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question will be from Jeff Silver (sic) [Silber] (37:15) of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Marc Silber : Thanks so much. Earlier this week, I believe there was some information came out of the EPA about the proposed settlement up for the West Lake Landfill. I just was wondering if you'd give us a little bit more color in terms of things we should be watching on that front. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Really not a lot more color here. I would just \u2013 I would have you look to the public statement that Bridgestone landfill put out. That's really a statement that you need to check out and review all the facts there that you need. I would just add really the punch line, and that is, given the landfill did not generate this material nor did the landfill transport the material, our belief is that the landfill, it doesn't really have a much ultimate financial responsibility, and it should be limited. So that's really what you need to really focus on, and the rest of it is in the public statement. Jeffrey Marc Silber : Okay. Fair enough. And just circling back to the recycling issue, I think you had previously stated that a $10 per ton move in the commodity price had roughly a 3% impact on earnings. I just want to make sure that that still holds. And I think you had also stated earlier, when we talked about the potential impacts of OCC price declines this year, I think it was a $0.04 to $0.05 impact on earnings. Again, just want to double check if that's the last year. Thanks so much. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, actually, the sensitivity has changed a little bit because of tax reform. So now with $10 change in recycled commodity prices changes EPS by approximately $0.04. Jeffrey Marc Silber : And I'm sorry, the OCC impact on prices? The \u2013 I'm sorry, the... Nicole Giandinoto : Yeah. The OCC \u2013 yeah. Jeff, this is Nicole. OCC makes up about 45% of the fiber or material that we sell, and if you think about the impacts of pricing into 2018, like you said, we said $0.05 to $0.06. Now, with tax reform, that goes up a little bit. So call it like... Jeffrey Marc Silber : Okay for... Nicole Giandinoto : ...$0.07, $0.08. Jeffrey Marc Silber : All right. That's really helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question will be from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks for taking my questions. Good afternoon, Don, Chuck, and Nicole. By the way... Donald W. Slager: Hi, Noah. (39:39) Noah Kaye : ...congratulations on receiving those sustainability awards. Nice accomplishment there. Donald W. Slager: Thank you. Noah Kaye : Just listening to talk about the planned incremental investment in the fleet, certainly, we've heard a lot and read a lot about fleet technology, data, safety tech, I'm just wondering, is there anything that you're seeing? And if so, maybe a couple of areas where incremental technology is helping you see a better ROI to making those investments in newer younger fleets. Is there something there about the new fleets, is it just that they're younger? Because I think certainly getting your perspective as one of the largest vocational fleet, owners will help kind of clarify for folks what incremental technology, whether it's the alternative fuels or call it advanced driver safety, could mean for your business. Donald W. Slager: Okay, that's a mouthful. So as it relates to alternative fuel, right, we've been pretty busy over the last several years moving portions of our fleet toward CNG. And we'll continue to do that over time. And today... Charles F. Serianni: 19%. Donald W. Slager: ...19% of our fleet runs on compressed natural gas. So \u2013 and we started out by building more fueling centers and then kind of consolidating more and more, expanding to those spaces so we get the maximum benefit. As it relates to other technology, we for years have used camera technology and what I would call sonar technology like you have in your personal car that gives you an audible warning if you're backing up close to something. As far as technology within the truck that comes through the manufacturer, there are some really great telematics-type technology that we can use today that comes with the truck that helps us monitor, maintenance, other things. Those are great tools, integrate well with us. We've always used a computer-based routing system to route our trucks. And we will, over the next few years, begin to move more and more technology into the cab. And frankly, that will help us, from a productivity perspective, from a safety perspective, but more and more, even to connect us to customers. So, we'll continue to go down that road. As it relates to things like autonomous vehicles, we've talked about this a little bit. There's several levels of autonomy. And so, just like in your personal car, things like lane change warnings and those kind of things. Those are now starting to be developed by Class 8 truck manufacturers. We will put those to work in our trucks. And I think personally, we're quite a ways away from full autonomous vehicles. And I think frankly, our industry will be one of the last industries to go that way. And one of the reasons is consider the fact that it's not only a truck going like down the interstate like somebody going from Des Moines to Omaha, but our trucks have to stop every so many feet. So somebody has to get out and open the gate and move a container, and that would frankly take two automated or autonomous vehicles to do that work. So now you're really starting to see kind of what we're up against. But we are \u2013 I'll tell you this, we're the seventh largest vocational fleet in the nation. We've got some very good fleet professionals on our team, and we are at the table talking with manufacturers, not only chassis but also body manufacturers to take out weight to improve longevity and all those things. So we're not phobic about it, we're just being realistic and practical, and we're going to invest where there's a good ROI and we're going to keep pace with these developments. So, right now, what we've got cooking for 2018 is baked in the guidance we've given you. And as we accomplish these goals and we get past to sort of the next developments, sort of the next investments we'll make in fleet, we'll keep you updated, and we'll let you work those into the numbers when it's time. Noah Kaye : Well, thanks for that answer. Appreciate it. And maybe a quick one for Chuck. I mean, how should we think about the cash tax rate now as a percentage of book? And is the 27% rate kind of the right effective rate over multiyear period, or do you think you can do some tax planning to further lower that? Charles F. Serianni: 27% is the rate that we're guiding to, and that's the appropriate rate for 2018. But having said that, we continue to look at opportunities to lower that rate. Noah Kaye : Okay. Thanks very much. Charles F. Serianni: Sure. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman: Thanks for taking my questions. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Michael. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman: Hey, hey, Don, Chuck, Nicole. The cash tax rate, can we get that? Is \u2013 what percent of book is \u2013 or do you think you're going to be as a cash taxpayer? Charles F. Serianni: 75%. Michael E. Hoffman: 75%. Okay. Charles F. Serianni: 75%. Michael E. Hoffman: Yeah, all right. Your capital spending is up about roughly 10% year-over-year. So just want to make sure I understand the commentary about the $190 million in cash tax savings reinvest in facilities and fleets. So part of that, the 10% year-over-year increase includes that, includes probably some extra sell (44:59) development because you had so much landfill usage. And then we're kind of more normal overall spending rate. Donald W. Slager: Yeah, let's add growth in there, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Because we had pretty good growth, we had pretty good growth in the year, right, so \u2013 yeah, so, we had growth, you hit that. We've got a little landfill development which is good and part of it is growth. But it's still kind of hanging in that 10% revenue range, right? And then as I said, as you pointed out, $25 million-ish or so next year in redeploying some cash into facility upgrades for our frontline people and a little bit of fleet infusion here to get that ball rolling. Michael E. Hoffman: Which I think that answers my next question, so $190 million is the savings, but your free cash flow is only up $165 million relative to the guidance in 3Q. So the difference \u2013 that $25 million, the difference is what you're reinvesting year-over-year? Charles F. Serianni: That's right, Michael. Donald W. Slager: That is the math. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Charles F. Serianni: That's right. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Not bad for a dumb farmer. Corporate... Donald W. Slager: You said that, man. Michael E. Hoffman: I know. I know. Corporate rate savings out of the $190 million versus accelerated depreciation, how do I think about \u2013 like is there more to play around with on accelerated depreciation? Or is the $190 million the right number for good? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So think about it this way, Michael, the federal rate is probably a $180 million-ish (46:22). And then you get about $50 million of bonus depreciation on top of that for the year. But then you got a couple of negatives that you need to contemplate also. One is lower state tax deductions, right, because you've got less of a shield. And the other one is changes to the deductibility of certain expenses, right? So... Michael E. Hoffman: Yeah. Donald W. Slager: ...you've heard about the change in deductibility of like meals and entertainment, so all of that nets out to the $190 million. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. All right, that's very helpful. And then just to be clear, if I were to take 3.75% off of the revenues and expenses of 2017, that's \u2013 and I could do that just to be able to have a \u2013 to see the comparable, keep the EBITDA at the same number, but the revenue comes down 3.75%, and then I can look at what my sort of comparable margin is 1Q 2018 versus 2017 when I reflect revenue recognition. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. It's about 100 basis points both years, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman: And spread evenly out throughout the whole year or is it lumpy? Donald W. Slager: Yeah, it's more or less spread out evenly. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. All right. And then within the context of the acquisition environment, how much of this is sellers worrying that in three years, all this tax benefit goes away and they better get this done now? Donald W. Slager: Right. First of all, I think that's five questions, Michael, but okay. Yes, so look, here's to our position. I think most of the selling that we're seeing just frankly happens to be companies who are getting to that cycle in their timeframe, okay? And here's what I always try to say. Look, if someone started a business 10 years ago and they're still at a point where they've got the energy to build the business, maybe they're at a certain age or whatever, a little bit of tax reform isn't going push them at the age of 35 or 45 to sell their business, and they're probably not going to do that. But if you've got a business that you're already in the window, you've already \u2013 you're already thinking about generational planning, you're already thinking about, hey, my whole life's work and my \u2013 I'm the third generation and in my whole family's work and it's time to monetize this, then yeah, I think maybe the tax reform might push you forward. But you've got to be in that decision point. I mean, here's the thing. It's a great business. And we've got \u2013 there's a lot of small companies that we buy, tuck-in acquisitions. We buy some really nice companies that have run a long time. I mean, where these people have put their heart and soul into it, they've built really nice businesses, and they're not just going to walk away from them just for a couple of percent. But you get if they're in the window, this may be what they've been waiting for. So we'll certainly be ready to do that. We've got really good people out there talking to companies who are thinking of selling today. That's why I say the pipeline \u2013 when I say the pipeline, it's not hearsay, it's people we've already talked to, it's people that we think are in the position to make a decision. So that's why we're confident in it. But I don't think this by itself will cause each and every person to move. Remember too, the smaller the company is, the less taxes they pay. Frankly, very small private entrepreneurs, they're not paying a lot of income tax today, and their businesses are almost designed that way. So this doesn't really create a windfall for them. Michael E. Hoffman: Very good. Thank you very much. Donald W. Slager: Great. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys, just curious in the volume. So I think you mentioned underlying volume growth of 1%, 1.25% in 2018. Is that a deceleration from what we finished with 2017? I would just think with the housing activity, the big growth you're seeing in special waste, which is typically a lead indicator, like why are we not seeing a step-up maybe in the underlying volume growth? Or is the mix in the volume growth changing? Charles F. Serianni: I think the volume growth is pretty consistent year-over-year. So in 2017, we reported a growth of 2.5% and that includes really strong special waste volume, C&D volumes, some of that actually coming through from the hurricanes also. So when you factor all of that out, and you kind of look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, I think the volume growth year-over-year is pretty consistent. Donald W. Slager: Yes, so, right. We had the special waste we mentioned in the remarks, and we still have a little broker volume that we're walking away from. We still have a couple of national accounts that just \u2013 they're not making it for us. And we've got a couple of residential customers out there that we haven't been able to convince to pay us what we deserve, and we're going to have to walk away from those accounts in 2018. So we're still taking a very strong approach to making sure we're getting the right return on the work we're doing, the right return on the investments we're making. And that's going to continue. Meanwhile, again, we always say it, look at the cash flow. The cash flow is the story. And so we're getting our fair share of growth. As I said earlier in Q&A, we expect margin expansion in all of our lines of collection business. Some of that is coming from growth. Some of that is coming from good pricing. Some of that's coming from productivity. But the business is healthy, strong, and we're making other very intentional decisions around volume to make sure that we're only doing what we're getting the right return for. Michael Feniger : That's great. And just on the margin guidance and expecting 10 to 30 bps of expansion, I mean how should we be thinking about that through the cadence of the year? I think in the fourth quarter, you're still seeing this landfill operating cost still kind of elevated. We have the mix of the acquisitions. Could you just tell us how we should be thinking about maybe the first half or second half with that margin guidance? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. Keep in mind that first half, we're coming off of commodity prices that were really strong. First half of last year, kind of circa $160 a ton. So, we would say that you're going to see the majority of the margin expansion towards the second half of the year. Michael Feniger : Okay. That's great. And just \u2013 if I could sneak one in, it's just on the open pricing, I think you said open pricing should be flat in 2018. I'm assuming that what that means is, I think open pricing was up 5%. So that's the kind of rate you guys would be expecting in 2018 with restricted prices moving up, or do you think open pricing is starting to hit that ceiling? Is that 5% number just kind of where \u2013 kind of as high as we can take it? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, I don't know that it's necessarily hit a ceiling yet. I think that obviously, 5% core growth on the open market is very, very strong. But Don had mentioned before a little bit of inflation, and not only does that help you on the restricted portion of the business, it also helps you a little bit in the open market. So I think that we've got a little bit of room to grow there. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Look, when customers are seeing inflation in their business, right, they're not seeing it from us, they're seeing it from other suppliers. And it makes it easier to have the conversation about what price adjustments are possible and necessary. So, a good \u2013 we've always maintained that a reasonably consistent inflation is good for our business. And if you look historically, it always has been, and if CPI moves higher, it helps us in the fixed portion. It clearly carries over than it historically has in the open market. So, again, we think the future is strong as it relates to that. So, when I hear about a little bit of CPI happening, I feel good about it. Michael Feniger : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : And there appear to be no further questions at this time. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Denise. I would like to thank all of Republic employees for their hard work, commitment serving our customers, and dedication to operational excellence and upholding the Republic way. Thank you for spending time with us today, everybody. Remember to be safe out there. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending this presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased with our strong start to the year. Through the team's relentless execution of our plan in the first quarter we grew revenue, expanded EBITDA margins, produced over 30% growth in earnings and free cash flow per share and returned essentially all of our free cash flow to shareholders. The solid waste business performed exceptionally well in the quarter and contributed 140 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion over the prior year. Within the solid waste business, we saw strong operating leverage in the disposal, small-container and large-container businesses. Additionally, as expected, SG&A as a percent of revenue decreased 20 basis points and landfill operating costs as a percent of revenue also decreased. Overall, our first quarter results position us well to achieve our full year EPS and free cash flow guidance. Additional highlights of the quarter include : adjusted EPS of $0.74, an increase of 35%; adjusted free cash flow of $356 million, an increase of 48%. EBITDA increased $45 million or 7% over the prior year. EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 28.8% despite a 160 basis point headwind from recycling. Core price was 3.8% and average yield was 2.2%, both in line with our expectations. Average yield was strongest in our small-container and large-container businesses. A majority of these customers are in open markets, where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform. We now have approximately $570 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than CPI. Volumes increased 2% and exceeded our expectations. We invested $26 million in tuck-in acquisitions in the first quarter and another $53 million in April for a total investment of $79 million to-date. And, finally, we returned $350 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the call over to Chuck, I'd like to make a few comments on our recycling business. First, it's important to keep in mind that our recycling processing and sale of commodities business is only 4% of total revenue. Second, despite a $0.06 headwind in the first quarter from lower commodity prices and higher labor costs on our sorting lines, we still outperformed relative to our expectations, given the strength of our solid waste business. Third, we continue to believe recycled commodity prices will increase from April levels and have already begun to see clear evidence of this in the last couple of weeks. And, finally, we continue to make progress moving to a fee-based pricing model with a more equitable risk sharing arrangement. We believe the current situation in China will serve as a catalyst in transitioning our municipal customers to this more durable model. Our customers have told us recycling is important to them and we remain committed to de-risking this core service offering and ensuring its sustainability for generations to come. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our financial results. Chuck? Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Don. First quarter revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $129 million or 5.6% over the prior year. The increase in revenue includes internal growth of 3.8% and acquisitions of 1.8%. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield increased 2.2% and was in line with our expectations. Average yield in the collection business was 2.4% which includes 2.6% in the small-container business, 2.6% in the large-container business and 2.1% in the residential business. Average yield in the post collection business was 1.7% which includes landfill MSW of 2.2%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.8%. Core price consisted of 4.6% in the open market and 2.5% in the restricted portion of our business. The second component of internal growth is total volume which increased 2% over the prior year. Volumes increased 1.9% in our large container business and as expected were essentially flat in our small container business. Small container volumes included the 90 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would've increased 80 basis points. Volumes decreased 2.7% in the residential business. The decrease was expected and resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. The post collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 11.1%. Landfill volume increased 12.7% which included C&D of 5.7% and special waste of 35.9%. The strong growth in special waste exceeded our expectations and was due to a large project completed during the quarter. MSW volumes decrease 1.1% versus the prior year. The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees which increased 50 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.02 in the first quarter from $2.57 in the prior year, an increase of 18%. The current average diesel price is $3.16 per gallon. The increase in the cost of diesel was partially offset by CNG tax credits. The credits contributed $0.04 to EPS and included a $0.03 benefit in cost of operations and a $0.01 benefit in the tax provision. The next component, energy services revenue, increased 40 basis points. The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin where we continue to be well-positioned. And the final component of internal growth is commodity revenue which decreased 1.3%. The decrease in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 31% to $112 per ton in the first quarter from $162 per ton in the prior year. Now, I'll discuss changes in margin. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 30 basis points to 28.8% versus 28.5% in the prior year. This included 140 basis points of expansion from the solid waste business and 50 basis points of expansion from the CNG tax credit, partially offset by 160 basis point headwind from recycling. As a reminder, the 30 basis points of margin expansion does not include the benefit from adopting the new revenue accounting standard in 2018. First quarter 2018 interest expense was $95 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5% and was lower than expected due to the CNG tax credit and unanticipated federal and state tax refunds. The refunds provided an approximate $0.02 benefit to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $0.74, an increase of $0.19 or 35% over the prior-year. EPS included a $0.12 benefit from tax reform. Excluding the benefit from tax reform, EPS increased 13% versus the prior-year. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $356 million, an increase of 48% versus the prior year. The growth in free cash flow was due to strong growth in EBITDA and a favorable benefit from the timing of working capital and CapEx. Next, we returned $350 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 3.5 million shares repurchased for approximately $236 million. And, finally, as Don mentioned earlier, we remain comfortable with our full year 2018 EPS and free cash flow guidance, given our first quarter results, the underlying strength of our solid waste business, and our ability to continue to effectively manage our costs. Now I will turn the call back to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Chuck. To conclude, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance. Strong solid waste fundamentals, together with relentless operational execution, resulted in double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow. This performance keeps us well-positioned to achieve our full year goals. Before opening the call to questions, I would like to congratulate Republic team for being named to the first annual Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list and recognized by Ethisphere as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for the second year in a row. These awards serve as external validation of strong ethical culture that we are building at Republic, which includes conducting our business with the highest levels of integrity and developing sustainable business practices to enhance long-term value creation. At this time, operator, we're going to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first questioner today will be Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on the pricing side. Don, maybe if you want to just touch on where do you think going forward you see the most opportunity on pricing? Is it on commercial collection or is it on landfill or is it simply higher inflation is going to lift all boats going forward? Donald W. Slager: Good question, Hamzah. There's a couple of things. One, CPI is on the rise, right? So, CPI has been (15:01) the last few years. As you know, we've been kind of punished by this compounding headwind of low CPI on that big $2.5 billion book of business. So, two things are happening there. One, as I said in my notes, we've got about $570 million of that $2.5 billion now converted to an alternate index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. So, that's happening. You're seeing that layer into the business now, so you'll continue to see the year-over-year benefit of that. And we're going to continue to go for more as you've seen every quarter we've improved that number. Second, CPI is on the rise. I mean people are now expecting, what, 2.5% CPI for the year. So, as we get into the second half of the year we'll see some of those contracts that are still tied to CPI start to roll over at a higher price. So that's great. The open market has been a very good place for pricing for us now for a number of quarters. We exited the year real strong. That's continuing now in the beginning part of the year. We think that's holding up fine. And, frankly, historically, as CPI rises, open market pricing stays strong and frankly improves. So that's a pretty good sign. Lastly, landfill pricing is still a little weak, frankly. I would have expected the landfill pricing would have rose a little faster than maybe it had. Because, again, just the high cost of landfills today, the higher cost of leachate, some of the costs that we're seeing in the business we need to revisiting our landfill prices and see what we can do there, starting to have those conversations with our municipal customers. Again, most of our third-party volume in the landfills comes through municipal customers. And, again, they're tied to these long-term contracts that have been again subject to that lower CPI environment. So as we're having renewal discussions with those customers, we're introducing some of these higher cost that we're facing. So we'd like to expect over the longer-term a better pricing there. But, overall, we're seeing pricing across the board. Again, we've got good tools. We use our Capture tool. All of our salespeople are equipped with their tablets. They're all using the system properly. Frankly, pricing churn continue to be a great story for us. It's actually come down a little bit this quarter. We're seeing a lower defection. So that's helping to drive price and kind of all systems go. There's still some room to run here. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Okay. Great. And just a follow-up question on just acquisitions. You mentioned $79 million year-to-date investment. You still have a target of $100 million to $150 million. But at the same time, the industry seems very bullish on M&A. Some of your competitors have closed significantly above their target in terms of deal flow. Is there anything you would sort of comment on in terms of RSG's focus is more return of cash or maybe there's antitrust issues in doing larger deals? Any kind of color you want to share on acquisitions and how you think about those. Donald W. Slager: Well, sure. I would start off by saying that the pipeline is still robust. We're seeing a lot of deal flow. We're getting a look at a lot of good, high-quality companies. The majority of the companies we're buying tend to be smaller. So the multiples we're paying are still in that 4.5 to kind of 5.5 range, very comfortable multiples. When we buy something a little bit bigger, the multiples get a little higher. You start buying more real property, infrastructure, permits, things that you have to spend a little bit more money for. I think the activity we've seen out there, I think, maybe some of the other companies have made some bigger purchases than we have this year. I would tell you that we were in the hunt on a couple of those, so we're well aware of them. But maybe it was a better fit for somebody else in their market. So they were willing to pay a bit more than we were, just because it fit their system better or maybe they needed something more than we did. As I always say, there tends to be natural buyer in these deals. And when we're the natural buyer, and we've got relationships and it fits our business, we think we can get good deals at the right multiples. So we're very focused on returns. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale : Hey. Good afternoon. Just a couple quick ones. I realized your practice is to update guidance midway through the year, but just \u2013 obviously did a nice job offsetting the impact of recycling in the quarter. Just can you give us some view \u2013 can you continue doing that? So in other words are you still at least comfortable with the guidance you have put out there? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So I'm going to give you some color and then I'll let Chuck give you a little more on the numbers side. We've been saying, I think, a lot of people writing that April really was expected to be sort of the floor \u2013 the bottom this year. That's proving out to be true. As I said in my comments over these last couple weeks, we've seen price start to bounce. The reality is the inventories in China are very low. We actually mentioned this last week when we spoke at WasteExpo. Our team went over to China a few weeks back and met with our mills there. Normally, they have about 30 to 60 days of material inventory. They were sitting at about 10 days of inventory. Normally, they have a fair amount of inventory in-transit, in ocean-going vessels from port-to-port. There's very little if any in-transit. So, this is very sort of what I would call sort of simple ECON 101, supply and demand economics. At some point, they need to make paper. And they're buying a lot of raw pulp. They're paying eight times what they used to pay. So, we think that's the reason that prices are starting to come up. Chuck can give you kind of a color of where we were at the beginning the year, where we were in April and where we think the year heads up for us. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, sure. For the quarter, average price was $112 a ton. What we saw in April was closer to $105. And as we go forward, we think that the average would be closer to $115. So, Corey, to your point, we're able to more than offset the headwind associated with commodities in Q1. And right now, we're estimating that we're going to be able to do the same thing for the rest of the year with commodities at $115 a ton, that being a little bit of a headwind for us based upon our original guide, but being able to offset that through continued outperformance in the solid waste business. Corey Greendale : Okay. Thank you. And then the second question I had is on the volume side where you are intentionally shedding some broker volumes. I think I'm hearing that the underlying kind of small-container business is strong. So can you give us a sense like when you start to \u2013 is there a part when you anniversary shedding those volumes or is that kind of a continual thing? And as you anniversary that, do you think you can get to even higher volume growth levels than you're at now? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So if we take out what we call non-regrettable losses, right, our volume would have been 100... Charles F. Serianni: 110. Donald W. Slager: ...110 basis points, so kind of in line with our expectations. As it relates specifically to broker, by the end of the year we'll have maybe only $100 million or so left of broker business to shed. That's a little lumpy if it happens. But we're cutting through it and again by the end of the year we'll be \u2013 I was saying year of the end. But that will probably happen \u2013 that last little bit will probably happen over two or three years. Corey Greendale : All right. I will turn it over. Thank you. Donald W. Slager: Great. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. If I could follow up just a little bit to clarify. So from this point forward, we should go \u2013 if we had $135 as our assumption for the cycle and go take that down to $115 for 2Q through the remainder of the year which is about $0.08 of incremental headwind and you feel that given the power of the first quarter and it was great quarter in garbage that you can make that up. Is that the way... Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. That's right, Michael. Yeah. On average, $115 the remainder of the year. Your math is right, it's about $0.08. And we feel like we can make that up through the outperformance in the solid waste business. Michael E. Hoffman: And so to that end, you exceeded your own budget \u2013 I mean your own guidance on volumes. So are we to look for \u2013 we should walk volume up as part of the \u2013 as we think about modeling? You had \u2013 $2.25 was your reported price for the year, but your volume assumption was going to be zero to 0.25 a point. So, how do I think about volume in the guidance at this point? Charles F. Serianni: Yes. Michael E. Hoffman: Is that... Charles F. Serianni: Yes. So first quarter volume \u2013 yeah, Michael, first quarter volume was very strong because of special waste. And obviously we'll take that into consideration when we do a broader update of guidance as we always do in Q2. Donald W. Slager: But where you're going with that, right? Volume is good. I would say it's strong. We're seeing strong volume in C&D landfill. We're seeing strong volume in large-container. We're seeing strong volume in temp, good housing market. I mentioned we're seeing lower customer defection, right? Our customer defection actually fell below 7% for the first time in our history, okay. So, all of those things factor into volume, Michael, as you know. So, as Chuck said, as we get through May and June and understand our sort of normal seasonality on how things are coming back we're going to come back to you in the second quarter call and have a clear picture for you. Michael E. Hoffman: Fair enough but I'm interpreting it correctly. I get that you're not changing guidance... Donald W. Slager: Directionally, you are correct. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. And the price seems to have a little bit better momentum as well. So that's the other part of it. If the volume trends that good, that gives you that much more room to push on the leverage on price. Donald W. Slager: Well, look, I've always said, when organic volume growth is good, pricing goes along with that. When organic volume growth dips and goes negative, that's when pricing gets a little squirrelly, right? So if volume's growing, organic's growing, housing's growing, all those things that we're seeing in the broader macro are good, we think volume holds up, and it's a pretty good story for this year and pricing comes right alongside of it. Michael E. Hoffman: So on the recycling issue in your following comment, which I hope the industry is able to take advantage of this and fix this. From a fundamental standpoint, I look at this, what's going on, as we clear the deck in 2018 and 2019, whatever the lower number is, is a slower number, and we just plow on with good garbage in the E&P business. And this is the debt-clearing year. How long do think, though, it will take to get the customer to agree this has to change? Donald W. Slager: Well, let me help you. Michael E. Hoffman: Because it's been really slow, historically. Donald W. Slager: Okay. So I'm going to burn a little time on this answer, okay. So this is really important for everybody to try to understand, everyone listening on the call. We make two assumptions, and we would posit them as facts. The first fact is customers want to recycle, okay. Part B of that first fact is customers are showing us that they're willing to pay for recycling. I'll come back to that. The second important fact that we posit is that paper packaging demand is not decreasing. In fact, most people would argue it's on the increase. So recycling, there's a business here, right. People want to do it, and there's a demand for paper packaging. Most of what we recycle is fiber. So, I mean, the lion's share of it is fiber. So we receive recycling through three channels or three lanes. The first inbound lane comes in our open market collection business. So these are frontload railroad commercial customers where we put out three yarders, four yarders, eight yarders, right. In that business, we've reported quarter-after-quarter that we've been increasing the price we charge for commercial recycling in our small-container business, started out $0.28, $0.30 or 3% of trash rates. Now it's 90%-plus of trash rates. Okay. So customers are saying I'm willing to pay for that because I want to do it. So we've corrected that space. Customers are voting with their wallets and we haven't lost any volume and we're making money in that business. We're making an appropriate return so we can continue to offer that important service to our customers. Second lane that we bring material into our company is through our recycling facilities, right. This is where third-parties who don't own their own manufacturing or processing capacity but they have their collection trucks. These are primarily cities. So cities collecting waste from the curb and some other competitors or smaller haulers bring us material to our facilities. In those cases, in that lane, the lion's share, 85% of those contracts, of that volume, now is coming in at what we would call have a fee-based structure or a fair share arrangement. We're no longer holding all the risk. Now, we give away some of the upside but we're getting a certain or a certainty of a return on that revenue. So those are the first two lanes. The third lane is the biggest and it's most difficult. And that is municipalities where we go out and collect with our trucks and either bring them to our own facilities or to third-party facilities. And this is the same group of people who we're trying to move away from a CPI index to a alternative index. So, you see the results we're having there. We've moved now well over 20% of that business to a fair share arrangement or an alternative index. So, now we're having that same conversation with those customers which is going to take some time, but in my prepared remarks this chaos, if you will, this crisis, if you will, in China is the catalyst to fix this business. And if I look at the first two lanes, those first two customer groups, they've already demonstrated customers understand the economics and they're willing to pay for it because they want sustainability. They want recycling. So, we just have to do the work. And then, frankly, we're built for that. We get up every day. We pick up the garbage. We get up every day and \u2013 pardon the football analogy \u2013 but we run the ground game. And customer's going to have to understand if you want to recycle, it's not free. This stuff is not worth gold, okay. We've got residual issues, too much trash in the garbage. We've got glass which is a contaminant at some point. We've got materials that don't have value that we have to deal with, okay. The fiber has value and has a market. So, these are the discussions we're having with customers, and it's going to take some time but we're very determined. And as I've said a few times now, it's kind of a perverse statement, but frankly in one way, I kind of welcome this China chaos because it gives us the platform that we need to go have the conversation that we frankly probably should have been having 10 years ago, okay. So, it's going to be a good business. It is a good business in some markets, and some markets are lagging. So, again, as we talk about return on invested capital, it can be a better business on that basis than the landfill business, than the solid waste business. And it is a growing segment. It's a growing waste stream. So, we want to get in front of the growth, but we're not going to do it for practice. So you'll see the returns improving in this business. You'll see the story change over time. And that's all I've got to say today. But that's the reality we're living in. And our team is poised to go out there and make it happen. We've got a strong team here and they're getting good results in other ways. And I would say, lastly, that we've seen these issues before in solid waste. When fuel became volatile in 2004, we implemented a fuel recovery fee which is a very fair way to deal with fuel cost with customers. It goes up and down based on fuel markets, so customers are treated fairly. We see CPI which has become an unfair index. We're going to a fair index and customers are coming along with us. And now we have to deal with this last sort of issue \u2013 this sort of last frontier of volatility in our business. And we're going to be through that and it may take a few years to do. But we're going to see progress. And how did I do, Michael? Are you still there? Michael E. Hoffman: Yeah. No, I'm here. Donald W. Slager: Okay. Michael E. Hoffman: Well, so somehow I'm supposed to work in some corny analogy about football games are one but passing. So, on the passing side if you're \u2013 I don't know how I'm drawing this altogether this way. So we'll scratch that and just go. Your $570 million out of $2.5 billion you did in about 30 months. Is that about the way we should think of about the pace of being able to fix the 80% of the recycling... Donald W. Slager: Yeah. I don't know. Let us keep going on it and we'll see in a couple quarters. But we're determined. Again, we're pretty good at picking up trash and recycling. We don't need practice doing it for free, right? Michael E. Hoffman: Right. Donald W. Slager: And then my final word on it and I'm sort of the master of the obvious here, right, but my team's heard it a thousand times. Sustainability, my customers, is not possible without profitability. Organizations like ours cannot invest in sustainable practices, in recycling unless there is a return that we can count on. And that's the nature of the beast. That's what we believe and that's what you'll see happening in our business. And anybody who doesn't believe that it's kind of a fool's errand, so. Michael E. Hoffman: Right. Donald W. Slager: Okay. Michael E. Hoffman: And the only thing we care about is we don't want to see the price recover too fast so the customer won't come to the table. So, at $115 that still leaves you room to argue, hey, you got to fix this? Donald W. Slager: Well, even if it goes to $200, we've got to fix it because here's what we know. It will go down again. Michael E. Hoffman: Right. Okay. Donald W. Slager: Okay. So, again this is just \u2013 we've been doing a lot of other great work in the company over the last seven or eight years. We've been busy on a lot of good things like One Fleet and all the other good stuff and Capture and PBS. And so we've been doing a lot of great things to make the company better. This is the great thing we're going to be doing over the next couple of years. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first off, I mean EBITDA margin is up 30 basis points year-over-year despite a headwind on recycling. I know you guys aren't updating your tide-ins right now and the components, but is there anything we should be aware of, the cadence of margins throughout the year? Is there anything that should stick out? And with that, I mean the landfill operating cost, I think, fell like 5% year-over-year. This was clearly an issue last year. Can you just provide us an update there? Is that something that's like sustainable and should be kind of the run rate going forward for the year? Thanks. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, think about some of the major components, right? We told you last year that SG&A was going to \u2013 some of the SG&A investments we made we're going to anniversary. We're seeing that, right. So we're very much in control of our SG&A spend, right. So we've got a pretty good handle on that. So we made those investments last year, the year before. Now they're coming down just as we said. We told you last year we were doing some additional work at some of the landfills related to some various permit issues and some leachate issues. We're coming through that. That's going to start working its way down. We've already seen that in the first quarter. So we've got a good handle on that. I mentioned One Fleet earlier. Our fleet costs are solid. Our labor costs are in line. The core solid waste business is running well. The operating team is doing a fantastic job. And, again, growth, right, we're seeing pretty consistent growth, positive sort of economic factors across the portfolio. So, yeah, we think it's sustainable. And over the long-term, we still aren't backing away from 30% EBITDA margins because we're going to see that improve. We're going to see our conversion to a better index continue. We're going to see improvement in this recycling business. We've got the courage and stamina to do what we need to do there. And, again, we've got customer willingness to pay on our side. And then we're improving the products. We're improving the quality. We're improving service. We're improving fleet reliability. As I've said, our defection has come down. All those kind of things, a lot of really good stuff going on here and someday we'll want to talk about recycling so much but let's not. What else you got, Michael? Michael Feniger : I guess I just wanted to follow up on that. I mean you mentioned obviously organic growth helps drive the pricing dynamics, but we're also seeing it driving investment back into the fleet. Your CapEx is up. Some of your suppliers to the industry have pretty big backlog. So I guess a big-picture question here. You guys are clearly adding some routes. Are you seeing anything in the open market the small mom-and-pops adding trucks or maybe too many trucks, the supply-demand balance of that with the open market? Donald W. Slager: I would answer it this way. I think we're getting our fair share of the organic growth. And, again, we target our sales force toward customers that we think use some kind of a value equation in their thinking, people that like the idea of great service and solutions, and recycling those services in a broader suite of services. We don't expect to chase every account or have every new yard of growth, but we're getting our fair share. And as long as we're getting our fair share and maybe a little more because our products are strong and we're okay with that. Meanwhile, we're getting pricing to offset inflation, and that's an important factor of the overall story. So, nothing bad to report there. Michael Feniger : That's great. Just my last question. I mean we saw industrial company last week (38:27). You kind of make a comment about peak or near peak. Clearly, it's a different type of industrial company business. It sounds like from what you're seeing on the volume side and with your different aspects of what you guys touch in the economy there's nothing that suggest to you that were any areas of the business that feel frothy to you or peak-ish in any way? Does it still feel like you have a runway ahead on a multiyear basis? Donald W. Slager: Yes. So, simple answer is we think there's still room to run and we backed it up with some statistics. Why don't I let Chuck back it up with statistics because I've been doing all the talking? How is that? Charles F. Serianni: So, what we talk about is there being a 90% correlation to our volume growth, overall, to our company, in single-family housing starts, when you lag single-family housing starts by one year since we're late cycle, obviously. So as we look at single-family housing starts, the print for March was 1.3 million units on an annual basis. So it's been increasing slowly over time based on the experts that we talk to. We think there's nothing that will prevent us in getting back to a longer-term average of close to 1.4 million, 1.5 million units. There's also been a number of articles written recently that say that there is actually a lack of supply of new single-family housing throughout the United States. And they estimated that to be an additional 7.3 million units. So all of that in combination we would say that back to Don's point that there's still plenty of room to run here in this economy. Michael Feniger : That's great. And then just lastly, I mean the special waste was really strong this quarter. You mentioned a big project. I was just wondering. Do you guys quantify that big project that you completed this quarter? And how does the pipeline look in special waste since I think that's one of the reasons why your volume outlook for the year was flat to up 25 bps? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So we've had a tremendous growth in special waste over the course of the last several quarters, close to a year now. To grow on top of 30% type of growth year-over-year is really hard for us to do. Like you had mentioned we had a really strong special waste job that occurred during the quarter that ended now. Looking forward, we still see some growth there. But I can't \u2013 to grow 30% on top of 30% is difficult to do. But what it does speak to though, right, this event work, it's a precursor to single-family housing starts and to development in general. So that's another indication that we think that the economy still has room to run. Michael Feniger : Great. Thanks, guys. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Michael. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions and a great quarter. I think free cash flow conversion this quarter really stood out. Historically, I'd say they tracked around 8% to 9% of revenue. Prior guidance probably implied something like 11% this year. But for 1Q, it was almost 15% of revenue, and I'm not sure if that's a high-water mark but it looks very impressive. So can you comment on a couple of things here? First, you mentioned the working capital benefit. How to think about that maybe reversing over the course of the year? And second is again to one particular line item. It looks like the capping closure and post-closure expenditures were down pretty markedly at $7 million which is a much lower run rate than it had been in past quarters. Is that sort of $7 million the right run rate for the balance of 2018? Thanks. Charles F. Serianni: Yes. So a couple of questions there, the first one being the working capital. We think that that is timing and that will end up reversing kind of evenly throughout the rest of the year. Not really a permanent benefit, but more of a timing benefit. To your point on the capping in closure/post-closure, that tends to be lumpy. Obviously, we don't cap until we need to, right. And so that will depend upon when we need to do the capping and also the weather to a certain extent. So it does tend to be a little lumpy, but we don't expect there to be a significant change in that cash expenditure year-over-year. Noah Kaye : Okay. That's very helpful. And you mentioned weather. Obviously, a strong quarter on a number of metrics, but I think most folks have been expecting a little bit of a weather-related headwind this year. So can you comment on (43:10) might have impacted any part of the business? Charles F. Serianni: Yes. So the weather ended up being a little bit of an offset. We had a lot of rain on the West Coast last year. And this year, we had a little bit of weather as you're aware on the East Coast. So, it tended to offset. So, we didn't see a real significant impact in the business overall this quarter because of weather. Noah Kaye : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one more. Really appreciate the adjustments on pro forma, so we can compare like-for-like. But the point I'm getting a bit confused on, if we look at the recycled commodity revenue line, your bookings are supposed to be moving year-over-year, I guess, down 3% to 4% when the commodity basket is obviously down a lot more. I'm sure part of this has to do with rev rec and the changes but could you just help us explain why the line didn't drop that much? Nicole Giandinoto : Yeah. Hi, Noah. This is Nicole. So, when you look at the supplemental schedules \u2013 and you kind of cut out a little bit, so hopefully I'm asking you a question. When you look at the revenue dollars, there wasn't a significant decrease in that because, if you recall, this time last year, we didn't have ReCommunity. So that kind of offsetting some of the decline in RSG legacy recycling commodity revenue. When you go to kind of the components of internal growth in there you refer to the 1.3% decline, again, that is more of a same-store legacy Republic Services. The impact of ReCommunity is down in the acquisition line. Noah Kaye : That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Nicole Giandinoto : Sure. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Henry Sou Chien : Hey. Good afternoon. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just wanted to follow up on some of the volume trends on the residential side and the small collection side. You mentioned some of the rationalizations or I guess the shedding of the broker business and some of the changes in contracts on the residential side. Just curious, does that change the margin structure of those two businesses and how should we think about that going forward? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. The business that we're shedding both on the small-container side and on the residential side... Henry Sou Chien : Yeah. Charles F. Serianni: ...that's business that's regrettable. I mean it's non-regrettable that we're shedding that business. That's because it's at lower margins. So, part of the reason why we're doing that is because we didn't feel like we were getting an appropriate return on our investment. And what we've always said is that we're very much focused in on ROIC. So, obviously, shedding that work and then deploying those assets in other pieces of business that provide us with a better return obviously will help us enhance our margins. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Keep in mind that those are small moves, right, but they're directionally going to improve the margins over time. Keep in mind that when we're the incumbent in a residential contract, we know all that cost right down to the nth degree, right. So we're very aware when a contract is sort of not meeting our threshold returns and when a customer doesn't really value what we're doing. And if we can't get the extensions at the right price or the right kind of built-in indexes or as we relate to recycling, we've got to move away from them. And we're having a good success rate in converting and increasing and extending contracts as well. Every now and then we run across one where we just can't get it done. And the good news is the team is encouraged to walk away from that business and go find another customer who wants to value great service. Henry Sou Chien : Got it. Okay. Great. That's good to hear. And just on the cost side, I mean, some companies seem to have some difficulties in transportation costs and labor costs. I was just wondering how you're thinking about that. Is that potentially an issue going forward or something that you're keeping an aware of? Thanks. Donald W. Slager: Well, it's certainly something we think about. We spend a lot of time, effort, energy talking about, thinking about, working on employee engagement at Republic. So our employee engagement rates are at all-time highs. Our turnover has been flattish year-over-year. We think our employee turnover is best-in-class. And even in light of a good or even an improving economy where you might lose more people, we're actually holding our own quite nicely. So we're spending more and more effort in just making Republic Services a great place to work. We think as it relates to our front-line people, truck drivers appreciate our One Fleet initiative, having reliable, safe trucks. Our techs enjoy working in a shop where we take fleet seriously. Our professional salespeople like the tools that we've created for them. Again, we're working on the work environment at the facilities. As I said last quarter, we're going to spend about $100 million over the next few years improving front-line facilities, locker rooms, training rooms, break rooms, those kind of things. So we put a lot of effort into just creating the best work environment, and we've got a number of external agencies and experts that have given us some acknowledgement and some accolades around that. But it's something we take really seriously. So it doesn't mean that we won't be affected by things to come, but I think we're ahead of the curve. Henry Sou Chien : Got it. Okay. That's great. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Hey. I just had a quick follow-up for Chuck. Chuck, do you know what your updated tax rate is in your guidance given Q1 was lower? Is it still 27% or has that changed? Thanks. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, it is, Hamzah. It's still 27%. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Okay. Thank you. Nicole Giandinoto : Hamzah, just to clarify, 27% for the remainder of the year. So, the full year average would be closer to 26%. Just to clarify. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Donald W. Slager: Hamzah said everybody else got four questions, so why don't you ask another? Charles F. Serianni: That's his fourth. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Hamzah. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Thank you. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in here. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, Chuck, just real quick. It's a little unclear, but was the $0.04 CNG tax credit contemplated in the guidance from last quarter? Charles F. Serianni: No, it wasn't. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. So we... Charles F. Serianni: If you remember that was part of the budget reconciliation package that came out a couple of days after our earnings call. Patrick Tyler Brown : So, do we tack on $0.04 to the guide or is it used to absorb some of the recycling? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. That's what absorbed the recycling during the period. Keep in mind we had about a $0.06 headwind from recycling during the period. So, we had about $0.04 of a benefit from CNG, and then another $0.02 benefit from the tax refunds that I've talked about. So, that's what offset the recycling. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then I apologize, but can you go back over the margin math? So, are you saying that if you exclude the tax credit, ReCommunity dilution and recycling prices, basically solid waste margins were up 140 basis points, is that right? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, right. So, solid waste up 140 basis points. The CNG tax credit, as I have mentioned, was about 50 basis points. And then recycling operations, that was a negative, a headwind of 160 basis points. So, the net of all of that is the 30 basis points that we called out. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then I do want to kind of go back to the transportation question. But one line item we've been watching pretty close is the subcontractor hauling costs. And I think you guys saw a pretty pronounced squeeze this quarter. I think some of your peers have as well. I know it's a pretty granular question, but can you guys talk about what the expectation there is? I mean, transportation costs don't look like they're abating anytime soon in my humble opinion. But should we expect that that is a margin headwind for the rest of the year? Charles F. Serianni: No. No. Not necessarily. So what we saw in the first quarter was a little bit of a spike in our transportation subcontract costs because of business mix. So there is a little bit higher national accounts subcontract work that was performed that was in the mix and just a mix of the business kind of in general and we're not necessarily saying that that's a trend that's going to continue. Donald W. Slager: Also, Tyler, a large group of those waste moves, if you will, we've got long-term contracts with stable providers. And so, we're in pretty good shape there. Patrick Tyler Brown : Right. Okay. And then maybe my last one, I don't know if you can parse this out. But how much did the shutting of the broker business help margins, solid waste specifically? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. Tyler, I don't have that at my fingertips. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Charles F. Serianni: As Don mentioned before, it's small relative to the rest of the business. But, incrementally, as we continue to do this over time, it is going to improve our margins. Patrick Tyler Brown : Right. Okay. All right. Thank you. Charles F. Serianni: Thank you. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Tyler. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hey. Good afternoon. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Brian. Brian Maguire : Just following on Tyler's question there, just to make sure I have it clear. The energy credit was, obviously, about $14 million benefit to EBITDA. And we shouldn't think about that recurring in the future, right? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. It was about $15 million. That's right. Brian Maguire : Okay. Charles F. Serianni: That was a one-time benefit that actually pertained to 2017. Brian Maguire : Got it. Okay. And it just wasn't included because the tax law clarification didn't come out until after you gave your original guidance. Is that right? Charles F. Serianni: That was part of the budget reconciliation package that came out a couple of days after we had already had our earnings call. Correct. Brian Maguire : Yes. Okay. Thanks for clarification there. And then not to belabor the recycling point too much, but just the contaminant levels that China is trying to get to. I know that's a big obstacle to try and get down to 50 basis points of contamination. Just wondering as you've changed your operations, and you're incurring these additional costs, how close are you getting to that level? And sort of related to that, are you seeing \u2013 sort of what we've seen is maybe some different markets develop in recycled fiber where some higher quality stuff like OCC number 12 or DLK is trading at a little bit of a higher price than some of the more commodity grades. Is that sort of what you're seeing too? And is that what you're sort of referencing when you say you're starting to see some signs of uplift on recycled fibers? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. That's fair. So, with OCC, we're doing a pretty job. With the mixed paper and some other grades, it's a little bit tougher as you can imagine. But, again, we've opened up other outlets. So, we're moving our export material to a number of other places now that we didn't previously. But again, ultimately, China has got to figure out that they've got to make paper. And they have to decide whether they're going to deal with some of this contaminant or they're going to keep buying pulp and chopping up trees. So we're just going to keep working it out. But again, it's supply and demand. And we're already starting to see the bounce, as Chuck talked about, the rates we experienced in Q1 where the April dip was and now we're seeing a bounce already, the last part of April and here in early May. So we're pretty confident it's going to come back as we've said in line with that $115 number. And our team's doing a great job getting the material moved. And again, we threw a little extra labor in Q1 to do a little better job at cleaning up. But I think it's going to come back for us. Brian Maguire : Okay. Just one last housekeeping one, appreciate the restated 2017 numbers. Just was wondering why the \u2013 it looks like the adjusted EBITDA was a little bit lower than what we had in our model as the reported numbers from last year. Any reason why the accounting change would modestly lower the EBITDA in 2017? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So it was 110-basis-point impact from the revenue recognition change. So I'm not really sure why that would be different than what you had in your models. Brian Maguire : Okay. I'll follow up with that later. Appreciate it. Operator : And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call over back to you for your closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, William. In closing, we will continue to manage the business to create long-term value and remain focused on executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, their commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for spending time with us today. Have a good evening and be safe out there. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect your lines.",

We are pleased with our strong second quarter results. The team sustained the momentum built in the first quarter by executing our business plan, advancing our multiyear initiatives and capitalizing on strong solid waste trends. As a result, we continued to grow both price and volume, effectively managed our costs, and despite a $0.10 headwind from recycling delivered double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow. Additional second quarter highlights include adjusted EPS of $0.73, an increase of 20%; adjusted free cash flow of $323 million, an increase of 173%. Core price was 3.6% and average yield was 2.1%, both in line with our expectations. Average yield was strongest in our small container and large container businesses. The majority of these customers are in open markets where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform. We have converted almost 25% or $590 million of our CPI-based contracts to a waste-related index or a fixed-rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than CPI. Volumes during the quarter increased 60 basis points. Excluding the impact of non-regrettable losses and a difficult special waste comparison in the prior year, volume growth would have been 1.4%. The solid waste business contributed 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. We maintained customer defection of less than 7% for the second quarter in a row. We invested $56 million in tuck-in acquisitions in the second quarter, plus an additional $42 million in July. This brings our year-to-date investment to $123 million. In February, we guided to over $150 million of investment for the full year. Our pipeline continues to be robust and we now expect investment \u2013 to invest approximately $200 million in tuck-in acquisitions for the full year. And finally, we continued our practice of increasing cash returns to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $328 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, our board approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend. This is consistent with our historical practice of raising the dividend in the mid- to high-single-digit range. The annualized dividend is now $1.50 per share. Next, I'd like to make a few comments on recycling. At this time, China's actions continue to create a supply-demand imbalance for recovered paper. This unprecedented imbalance is causing commodity prices to remain low and processing costs to increase as mills become more selective in the quality of material they buy. While this situation is painful in the near term, we believe these market conditions will serve as the catalyst needed to transform recycling into a durable, sustainable business model, a model in which companies can continue to invest for the benefit of their communities without undue risk. The Republic team is taking action. We are working diligently to both minimize the near-term impact of these headwinds and accelerate efforts to shift our municipal customers to a fee-based pricing model with a more equitable risk-sharing arrangement. First, in the open market, we are raising prices to cover higher processing costs resulting from stricter contamination requirements. Second, in the restricted market, our sales team is meeting face to face with our 1,000-plus municipal recycling customers. We are requesting an immediate price increase and adoption of a new pricing structure at or before contract renewal. This structure includes a fee to collect the material, plus a net processing fee that factors in processing cost, contamination levels and commodity prices. Of the customers we've met with to-date, 10% have already agreed to an incremental price increase within the next six months. And another 60% are reviewing and approving price adjustments or considering implementing the new pricing structure by the next contract cycle. Typically, negotiations with staff and city council approvals take months to obtain. So, we're extremely pleased with the initial results of these concentrated efforts over the past 90 days. Third, to support our initiatives to increase prices and transition to a new pricing structure, we are leveraging the current environment to drive awareness and change among our customers and consumers. For example, we are hosting webcasts, presenting to state and local officials and conducting interviews with local and national media. Additionally, we are meeting with municipal solid waste directors and consultants to review the new pricing model and explain why it must be included in future RFPs. And finally, we are leveraging technology to increase productivity, reduce cost and improve the quality of material recovered at our processing centers. Our customers have told us repeatedly that recycling is important to them, and they are demonstrating their willingness to pay. Although it will take time, with their help, we can ensure recycling is sustainable for generations to come. Next, turning to our full-year guidance. Despite a recycling headwind of approximately $0.30 versus the prior year, we are reiterating our full-year EPS and free cash flow guidance. Growth in the solid waste business is more than offsetting the headwind from recycling. In fact, even if you remove the benefit from tax reform, we still expect to see mid- to high-single-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow, despite the recycling headwind. Looking forward, the immediate actions we are taking in the recycling business will not only benefit the remainder of 2018, but will also generate positive momentum heading into next year. Furthermore, the current macro indicators that impact our business continue to remain favorable. We believe this will lead to an increasingly supportive pricing environment and continued volume growth in the future. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chuck, who's going to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Chuck? Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Don. Second quarter revenue was approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $94 million or 3.9% over the prior year. The increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.1% and acquisitions of 1.8%. The components of internal growth are as follows : First, average yield increased 2.1% and was in line with our expectations. Average yields in the collection business was 2.4%, which includes 2.6% in the small container business, 2.5% in the large container business and 2% in the residential business. Average yield in the post collection business was 1.5%, which includes landfill MSW of 2%. The majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.6%. Core price consisted of 4.4% in the open market and 2.3% in the restricted portion of our business. The second component of internal growth is total volume, which increased 60 basis points over the prior year. Volumes in our large container business increased 2.5% and volumes in the small container business were essentially flat, as expected. Small container volumes included an 80 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have increased 80 basis points. Volumes decreased 2.8% in the residential business. The decrease was expected, based upon our strategic decision not to renew certain contracts that fell below our return of criteria. The post collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.3%. Landfill volume was essentially flat. Growth in MSW and C&D was offset by a decrease in special waste. More specifically, landfill MSW volume increased 1.8% and C&D volume increased 8.3%. Special waste volume decreased 4.5% due to a difficult comp in the prior year. The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 60 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel increased to $3.19 in the second quarter from $2.55 in the prior year, an increase of 25%. The current average diesel price is $3.22 per gallon. The next component, energy services revenue increased 20 basis points. This is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin, where we continue to be well-positioned. The final component of internal growth is recycling processing and commodity revenue, which decreased 1.4%. The decrease in revenue primarily relates to lower recycle commodity prices and tons sold. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 42% to $91 per ton in the second quarter, down from $157 per ton in the prior year. As Don discussed earlier, recycling continues to be a headwind. But it's important to note that recycling processing and commodity revenue represents less than 5% of Republic's total revenue. Additionally, beginning in Q4 of this year and into 2019, we expect the recycling headwind to decrease as the prior-year comps become easier. Next, I will discuss changes in margin. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 180 basis points to 27.4% versus 29.2% in the prior year. This included 50 basis points of expansion from the solid waste business, which was more than offset by 190 basis point headwind from recycling and a 40 basis point headwind from increasing fuel prices during the quarter. Our fuel recovery fee lags changes in diesel prices. Therefore, in a rising fuel price environment, we face a temporary headwind. In the second quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 10%. For the full year, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 10.4%. Second quarter 2018 interest expense was $97 million, which included $10 million of noncash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.7%, which was lower than expected due to the resolution of an open tax matter. The lower tax rate provided a $0.01 benefit to EPS relative to the prior year. In the second half of the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% due to tax planning opportunities. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.73, an increase of $0.12 or 20% over the prior year. EPS included a $0.12 benefit from tax reform, which was offset by a $0.10 headwind from recycling. Adjusted free cash flow for the first half of the year was $679 million, an increase of 89% versus the prior year. The growth in free cash flow was due to solid growth in EBITDA and a favorable benefit from the timing of working capital, which we expect to partially reverse in the second half of the year. Next, we returned $320 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 3.2 million shares repurchased for approximately $215 million. And finally, as Don mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full year 2018 EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. If recycled commodities remain at July levels of approximately $95 per ton, we expect to be at the low end of our guidance ranges. At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question today will come from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Good afternoon. The first question is just around M&A. Don, you sort of raising the tuck-ins that you're doing. Historically, I think you said $100 million tuck-ins. Today, it's running a lot higher. Just curious what the pipeline overall looks like. And at what point do you sort of run into sort of antitrust? I guess you're at $10 billion in revenue today. Can you get the $15 billion before that's an issue or just maybe size up your pipeline longer term? Donald W. Slager: Well. Look, if you think about the industry being $60 billion and what do we say $30 billion of it's still in the hands of private entrepreneurs. Charles F. Serianni: 35%. Donald W. Slager: 35%. So, there is a big chunk out there. The issue really comes to \u2013 and you've heard me say this before most likely, we're not incenting people to sell their businesses. We're buying good quality businesses from good quality operators. People are getting to a place in the life cycle of their business where selling the company is an option. And that may be because of their life plan, their succession plan, their age, you name it. But it's been a good robust pipeline. We think the pipeline remains robust into next year. We think we continue to deploy, call it that, $100 million, $150 million a year for several years at least because that's sort of the timetable or the sales cycle, the pipeline we look at. So as far as your antitrust question, when you think about this business, it still remains a local business. When we think about having a first or second market position, which we do across 95% of our revenue, having a first market position may mean \u2013 it may start with the fact that you're vertically integrated, but it may mean you only have a market share of 25% or 30%. And so, there's plenty of room to grow our share of a market through tuck-in acquisitions for quite a few years to come. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Great. And just a follow-up question on recycling. The actions you're taking are very encouraging. I guess, it revolves mostly around contract renegotiations. And so, just curious whether you think you have to spend capital in the recycling business today or maybe at a later stage or maybe that's off the table? And then maybe for Chuck, is the recycling headwind $0.30 that's baked into the guidance? Thank you. Donald W. Slager: All right. I'll start and let Chuck finish up. I think you asked three questions there, Hamzah. So, the first one is, look \u2013 and I may have to say it a couple of more times on this call, because I'm sure it's on everyone's mind. And I said it in the prepared remarks. This issue that we're facing right now emanating from China, while it's really painful in 2018, it really is overall a good thing. And so, I'm really optimistic about this serving as the catalyst needed to actually change, then fix the business. So as we said before, recycling is a product our customers want to buy. It's a growing part of the waste stream. It's a business we want to be in because we want to be a good partner to our customers. The fact is our customers are voting with their wallets and they are paying more for recycling. We've been very effective raising prices in the open market on recycling without losing volume. It's the contractual nature of the municipal business, contracts that are sort of five years on average, and the nature of municipal budgets and sort of a political aspect of too many decision makers in the process that slow us down there. But the good news is individuals, consumers want to recycle, staff wants to recycle and certainly city councils and mayors don't want to give up recycling. So, we think there is a lot of room here to finally fix the business. I said in my remarks, we've talked to the lion's share of our 1,100 customers already and we're getting good results. We've already renegotiated some contracts with new pricing ahead of the contract date. We have a lot of customers already taking our advice and thinking about new ways to do things. We certainly have a handful of customers who kind of scoffed at it. We'll have to reassess whether we like that partnership or not. Partnership's a two-way street. We're making a lot of progress. There is a lot of room for pricing here and we're going to really use this opportunity to fix this business. And the one point I'll make too is when we break this down to the absolute lowest common denominator, a household, a household is paying on average in the country $25 a month for twice-a-week service; one's for trash, one's recycling. Let's say that's $20 on trash and $5 on recycling. That $5 needs to be $10 or $12. So, we're not talking about amount of money that breaks the bank for an individual rate payer and that's what lawmakers, city councils, and people need to understand. And I think the average citizen who wants to recycle and do good things for the environment will be more than willing to do that to make this right. And so, that is the road we're going down. So, as far as CapEx, we will invest in CapEx. These won't be new facilities. These will be some advanced technology. So we've already invested some CapEx in sorting equipments, some robotics, things like that. We'll continue to do that, but that won't be a material change in our capital spending, Hamzah. I'll turn it over to Chuck. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. To Hamzah, in terms of your question, so in our guide right now is $0.30 to $0.32 of headwind associated with recycling business. And the good news is that that's been offset by the solid waste business. The solid waste business continues to perform very, very well. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi. Good afternoon. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Brian. Brian Maguire : Just a question on cost inflation. I think we're seeing just general labor tightness. Obviously, trucking drivers is more of a long-haul situation. But I guess kind of general inflation out there. Some others in the industry has suggested you're kind of seeing 4% to 5% rates. So I was wondering if you can kind of validate what you're seeing? And then kind of related to that as we exit this year and go into next year, what sort of a yield net pricing do you think you need to keep margins flat in the current environment? Donald W. Slager: Okay. Again, a multi-faceted question. So, let's start with labor. We are seeing some increases in labor cost, in direct labor and that is a result \u2013 let's start with the good news, right. That is the result of a strong economy. So, the underlying factor here is a strong economy. A strong economy helps our business beat (25:02) from a growth perspective. The fact that there are some labor increase also drives some inflation across the board and we've always said a little inflation is good for us. Remember, we've got a big chunk of business still. Even though we're making a big dent in that restricted market, we still have some business that escalates with CPI. So, the fact that there's a little more inflation that will come back to us through CPI pricing as well. As relates to labor for us, we are in some markets, in select markets raising some wages and, frankly, rethinking some of our pay plans. Because here's the thing, we're focused on being an employer of choice, being a great place to work, attracting the best and brightest people. We're going to continue to do that, we believe the market pay. But the backdrop to that is our turnover is low. And it's dramatically lower than general industry. It's lower than trucking by a long shot. And in the waste space, we think our turnover is lower than anybody's, and specifically drivers and techs \u2013 in fact, our tech turnover went down year-over-year. So again, when we talk about employee engagement, do the right thing by people, and being that great place to work, we're really serious about it, and that's one of the things, I think, that's helped us offset some of these pressures in the labor market. But we'll see a little pressure there. And then as it relates to some of the long-haul waste transfer business, we'll see a little pressure there. But the fact is, if those are structural changes, that allows us a room to price, right, because these type of things affect all companies. They don't just affect one company. We think they'll affect us less because of our focus on people and talent and turnover and the work environment. But we'll use the opportunity for pricing and we'll gain the advantage from how it affects CPI. In all other instances, there's a delay. Right? You've got to review, but we're being responsive. So, we'll see more price in the second half of the year. Our RPM process, which you know is we don't just price once a year all the same time, we price throughout the year. So we've got still four buckets of price through the remainder of the year that we can lever up on in the open market, we'll do that to start to make up for it. And we'll push for pricing that looks more like a 3% yield, frankly. And that's the conversations we're having internally. Brian Maguire : Okay. Great. That's very helpful. One on recycling, this is maybe a little bit of a bigger picture. One, not trying to get too much into the ins and outs of China and what's going on, but a lot of commodity markets, when you see a demand shock, like we've seen from China, prices reset lower like we've seen. But then there's oftentimes a supply response. Recycling seems very different. Sort of the future that you're portraying is one where really there won't be much change in supply. Everyone wants to do the right thing. My question is sort of, is there a place to put all of this material if China follows through on some of its proposals? Today, are you able to actually place all these tons somewhere in the world, albeit at a lower price and not a great margin? And maybe you can kind of also just comment on how much you're actually exporting to China today that you would have to move to other markets if they did truly come out of the market? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, to use easy math, we're still about 60% domestic and about 40% that we export, right. And again, that's general math. Don't hold me to those exact numbers. But use 60/40 to make the discussion easy. We've moved material away from China. We're virtually sending nothing to China today. We're still very closely in contact with our partners in China who have had to shut down a capacity because there is no inflow of material. They, I think, would agree with us, the demand for packaging is not lessening. In fact, most people you talk to, if not all people you talk to, believe that two things are true. The demand for paper packaging is going to continue to increase. If people continue to use virgin fiber pulp, then the price for pulp's going to continue to increase. And then we get into this nice supply and demand economy again. The fact that we've been able to move paper pretty easily to other markets says a lot about our team and our capability and the fact that the packaging demand remains. And then just like in the big macro picture, the fact that you've got \u2013 and you can argue where and how much, but sort of an expanding economy of people who want to buy goods and services, right? So, you want to call it a middle class or an emerging class in markets globally. So, I think those macro trends continue, so the demand will be there. The supply, I think, when we talk to customers, they want to recycle, in the open market, the fact that we've aggressively raised prices on recycling and haven't lost customers, because frankly people are saying, hey, I'm okay paying just about as much for recycling as I do for trash, because I've got to carry it out to my dumpster anyways, I might as well feel good about doing something for the environment. And that's \u2013 I'm oversimplifying. That's generally the vibe that we're getting from our customers. So, we're going to continue to be a good partner. This is going to be a slow go as we continue to turn contracts over. The supply/demand economy is global, so it's going to take time. There are going to be other investments in domestic mills. These Chinese mills are going to look for other ways to clean up the paper, and there's a lot of ideas on the table. So, this will take a few years to work out. And in the meantime, as I said, and I'll say it over and over again, this in the long term is a good thing. We at Republic Services run the business for the long term. We don't get excited about something that's temporary in nature that makes our quarter hard or our year hard. This is going to be a good thing when we're all said and done, and it'll take a little time to sort out, but we're being very opportunistic and very optimistic. Brian Maguire : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. If we could start with volume, it's been a couple of quarters of positive volume here and 1Q was particularly strong. As we get into the back half, obviously, the special waste comps get tougher, and I'm looking at your kind of original volume guidance for the year. Just wondering \u2013 and it may be something we should all be aware of as we go into the back half \u2013 how should we expect kind of those headline volumes to trend over the course of 2H? Will they kind of go flat or even negative? Just how to think about that so we're modeling appropriately? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, Noah. Probably, a little negative in the second half of the year. But right now, we had guided to zero to 25 basis points of volume growth for the year. And right now, we're thinking we're going to at or slightly above that 25 basis points. Nicole Giandinoto : And then, Noah, I just would add to that, as Chuck mentioned, we might be flat to slightly negative in the back half. But if you exclude that difficult solid waste or \u2013 excuse me, special waste comp and the non-regrettable losses, we'd be looking at, for the second half, volume growth pretty similar to the first half. Donald W. Slager: Yeah, that's a great point. Right? So, I think we should focus on that, because that's the trend \u2013 the underlying trend in the business. And I think it also demonstrates the sort of internal discipline that we use when determining what business we're going to do, what business we're not going to do. Noah Kaye : Right. So we're still in the sort of underlying 1% to 2% volume growth environment, and that should be understood when looking at these underlying metrics. Donald W. Slager: Yes, absolutely. Noah Kaye : Second question, $700 million of buyback for the year is very strong. It does imply a bit of a deceleration from 1H. I guess there will be more spend on this targeted M&A in the back half, but anything else to read into there just in terms of how you're lining up the balance sheet? Charles F. Serianni: No, it's really the M&A. So, obviously, $50 million more than what we had anticipated. There are also a little bit more in terms of CapEx, about $20 million. It's what we're anticipating and that's really due to fund the growth that we're seeing in the business. Those are the moving items. Noah Kaye : Yeah. And actually, it looks like you increased your assumption of operating cash flow for the year, but you actually have a little higher CapEx to offset that, but your OCF is moving up from your original guidance, is that right? Charles F. Serianni: Right. Yeah, it's correct. Donald W. Slager: Right on. Noah Kaye : All right. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey. Good afternoon. Donald W. Slager: Hey, Tyler. Charles F. Serianni: Hey, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey, Chuck, can we maybe walk from the 29.2% to the 27.4%, the EBITDA margins, maybe with a little bit more color here? So, I get the positive 50 basis points from solid waste, the 190 basis points from recycling, which I'm assuming includes dilution from ReCommunity, and the 40 basis point fuel math, but SG&A was an 80 basis point tailwind. So, does that imply that core, core solid waste margins were down even ex-fuel, which quite frankly is debatable whether that should be in there or not? Charles F. Serianni: Well, keep in mind that the fuel \u2013 there's a lag on the fuel, right. And so, in a rising fuel environment, we get a little bit of a headwind associated with that. And obviously, that reverses when fuel goes in the opposite direction when it decreases. What Don had talked about is that we're beginning to see a little bit more wage inflation in the core business and that's happening in select markets. And that is actually eating into a little bit that SG&A benefit, Tyler, that we saw down \u2013 below operating expenses. But once again, that's something that we're aware of and something that the pricing team is going to take into consideration second half of this year and into 2019 as we develop our pricing strategy. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. So, it sounds like core solid waste is very solid. You're converting more to higher CPI, CPI is improving. I mean all indications are the open market remains very rational. So, why are we seeing price decelerate specifically in the restricted, but I guess frankly in both, decelerate sequentially? I mean, I get the lack of the fee from last year in the restricted piece, but again why the decel sequentially? Charles F. Serianni: So on the restricted piece, we anniversaried a significant price increase with a very large municipal customer, and so you see a little bit of a price decrease there, sequentially. But once again, we said that's going to pick up in the second half of the year, right? And I would say, in the open market, the core prices continues to be very, very strong. This is the 20th quarter in a row that we've seen core price at 4% or higher in the open market. So, we continue to perform very, very well there. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. And Tyler, as Chuck said, I'm sure a lot of our Republic leaders are listening, a lot of our field leaders, general managers, and sales managers are listening. They know the pricing is going to be picking up in the second half. We're going to recoup some of this recycling. We're going to take advantage of the growing market. I said, defection is down sub-7%, almost as low as 6%, the second quarter in a row. We've got more room and \u2013 we've got more room to price in the market. We've got a reason to price with the recycling issues in China and with some of this labor costs. And then CPI is going to pick up, right, because we're going to start to see those second half reset, so it will start to come back. Patrick Tyler Brown : Did I hear you, Don, talk about 3% yields in the back half or was that more an aspirational comment? Donald W. Slager: Yes, that's not the back half, but that's where we think we can go, right. And we've been there before. That's not a number we've never seen. And it's in this kind of a growing economy with a strong CPI, with good organic growth, that does impact market behavior, and we think we can get back there. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Because going back to one of the prior questions, I mean there is a lot of inflation in the system, it's not just labor, but whether it's transportation, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, big picture, does \u2013 2.1% yield is probably not enough in this inflationary environment, even excluding recycling to really get sustainable solid waste margin expansion. Would you agree with that? Donald W. Slager: Yeah, yeah. With inflationary environment, we've got to be north of that, and you heard the comments said earlier, we're going to \u2013 I mean that's where we got to go. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. And then just my last one here. Chuck, maybe a tax rate for next year, I know there's some moving pieces here this year. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So, the statutory tax rate's going to be a little over 27%. And so, without giving guidance, right now that's kind of our best guesstimate, maybe a little bit less than that. Patrick Tyler Brown : Sorry, 27% Charles F. Serianni: 27%, right. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman: Thank you, Don, Chuck, Nicole, for taking my question. There's a little bit of a windup on this one, because I'm trying to flesh out something that, I think, is being missed. So if I started with your original outlook for the components of your \u2013 the bottom end of the range, $3.05 in February, and I look at where you are today at $3.05, my math says you've got an almost 35% improvement sequentially in the performance of the solid waste business inside that forecast. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. I mean, there is an improvement in the solid waste business, Michael. Let me try and figure the easiest way to explain this. Let me do it this way. So, original guidance of $3.05 to the $3.10, right? A recycling headwind right now, we're saying, is going to be about $0.26. Right? But improvement in the solid waste business, above and beyond what was in the original guidance, of $0.10. And then you've got $0.04 from the CNG tax credit, and then another $0.12 from the tax rate. And that's what gets you back to the $3.05 to the $3.10. But to your point, the solid waste portion of the business is performing better than we originally expected. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. So you said that really fast, all that. Just so I get it \u2013 make sure we have the numbers correct. There's $0.12 from tax reform for the whole year? Charles F. Serianni: No, $0.12 from tax rate, not from tax reform. Michael E. Hoffman: Tax rate, yeah. Charles F. Serianni: The benefit from tax reform, and this is important, that was already included in the $3.05 to $3.10 that was already included in our original guidance. So, the remaining $0.12 in tax rate, that's other tax opportunities that we were able to take advantage of this year. Michael E. Hoffman: Right, okay. What I was trying to do is bridge the $2.43 that you finished \u2013 that compares to the $3.05. And what I concluded if I took the headwind from recycling, added back tax reform and then looked at what solid waste was, there's a clear sequential improvement versus where you started the year. Charles F. Serianni: Absolutely. So, think about it this way. The solid waste piece of the business is up 16% from where we thought it would be. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Charles F. Serianni: In our original guidance. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Since the last 10 people asked 45 questions. Can I ask one more? Donald W. Slager: Sure, Michael, even we only had a big windup. Michael E. Hoffman: Yeah. How much capital do you have tied up in recycling? And what does the revenue margin mix need to look like to generate a reasonable return on that capital? Charles F. Serianni: Here's what I would say, is that right now, we're getting a decent return on recycling, but it's not where it needs to be. We need something a little bit higher and that's why we're focused on all of these different action items, the pricing and also on taking costs out of the system. So, obviously, the headwind that we're seeing with commodity prices, $160 million roughly year-over-year, it's huge. But we are very confident that we have the action items in place and the people in place to fix this portion of the business, and we will get an appropriate return on the business. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Just so I understand, you are generating a positive return on capital on that business as bad as it is? Charles F. Serianni: I would say that the return on capital is positive, but it's not where it needs to be. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. So, remember, we've talked about this before, I think on this call, there are three ways that we deal sort of with recycling, right? One is, where we go out and collect it in the open market with our small container, large container business, where we're negotiating really directly with customers, one-on-one kind of negotiations with proprietors and decision makers. In that business, we have been raising prices over the last couple of years and here more recently very effectively. And when I say customers have voted with their wallets, those customers have said, I want to continue to recycle, even though recycling now costs almost as much as trash removal for those customers. So, that has been a good business for us. We have a lane, if you will, where waste \u2013 or recycling material comes to our facilities that we don't collect. We've been pretty effective in getting that business converted and there's more work to do, but those customers have been open to the conversation and we're moving that business. And then, the last is this big municipal piece, right? And as I said in my comments, the actual rate payer is paying very little per month for recycling. So, the idea of doubling or tripling their rate is miniscule in the scheme of things, it's a cup of designer coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker. But it's not that much compared to what they pay for cable, for Internet, for all of their other sort of habits. Trash and recycling is sort of a necessary service, and recycling is something they want to do. But when you aggregate that spend to 10,000 residents, then the decision maker gets nervous, right, because it becomes a big dollar amount. We've got to continue to break it down to the lowest denominator. And those are conversations we're having, because the consumer, ultimately, the voter, wants to recycle and they want a company like Republic, that's a good partner, that will do the job for them. We're only going to invest in recycling where the returns are warranted and where the construct of the contract is fair and reasonable and equitable. And we're going to, along the way, find partners. They're great partners. And we're going to, along the way, find partners who we're going to have to reevaluate the value of their partnership, because they don't want to understand this. That's what we're at. And that's okay, because this business will sort of work through that. And so again, it's a good opportunity. It's a stinker right now in 2018, but we're \u2013 the strength of solid waste is overtaking it. There'll be headwind in 2019 and 2020 as we start to climb out of it \u2013 I mean, tailwind. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Yeah. Thanks, guys. I believe you were originally expecting underlying EBITDA margins expanding 10 basis points to 30 basis points for the year. What's your new expectations for that now? I don't know if you guys \u2013 I know we see the EPS guide, but just what is \u2013 the first half, I think, you did 1.39x (46:32) of adjusted EBITDA. What's the expectation in the back half? It seems like you need some sequential ramp up to get there. So, I was hoping you guys could help just kind of bridge that. And how much of that is Q3 versus Q4? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So for the year, we're expecting EBITDA margin to be about 28%. And just to put that in context for you, what we're expecting right now is solid waste margin expansion of 60 basis points to 80 basis points, and then recycling being a headwind about 120 basis points to 140 basis points. And we are, obviously, expecting the margins to improve in the back half of the year. Once again, on the back of the solid \u2013 the continued strength in the solid waste business. Michael Feniger : And is that more \u2013 sorry, is that more like fourth quarter weighted? Charles F. Serianni: It goes down Q \u2013 It actually goes down Q3 to Q4, steps down a little bit, as you would expect because of the seasonality in the business. Michael Feniger : Okay. And I guess, just my last question would be, you mentioned volumes \u2013 underlying volumes of 1% to 2% range. Should we be thinking about \u2013 with the economy the way it's been progressing and the momentum, should we be thinking 2019 close to that 2% range? And just on the average yield discussion, we were talking about 3%, I mean, is there a room for the pricing? Is it just to cover the rising cost or is there a room for that price/cost dynamic to inflect higher in 2019? Donald W. Slager: All right. So, first of all, this isn't our 2019 guidance call, okay? Michael Feniger : All right. Donald W. Slager: Look, Mike, first, on the growth, the underlying growth, 1% to 2%, we think that's realistic. Give us a little time to see how the rest of the year comes in and how things sort of normalize. But the underlying fundamentals, again, population growth, household formation, all things we look at still indicate there's room to run. You know that we're well-situated across our markets with strong position. We get our fair share of the growth along the way. So, we've got high confidence in that. We'll talk \u2013 we'll file a report on 2019 when we get to that junction, right. On pricing, especially hear this, right, we've seen 3% and 3.5% yields in the past when the economy has been strong. We're enjoying one of the strongest economies we've seen in a long time. And we've got a really great story to tell and the economy in the solid waste business is what is overcoming this struggle with recycling, but we're going to fix that too. So, my point about 3% price, as Tyler said, that is aspirational, but it's very doable. And there's conversation we're having today in the building. We're talking with our revenue management team and we're taking with our operating team, and we're having those conversations, because \u2013 and the market will allow it, the value we provide will allow it, and there are some structural changes that we take a fairness approach with customers that we can go ask for legitimately. And CPI is \u2013 almost $600 million now of the restricted book now is converted. We're going to continue \u2013 we're not done yet. We're going to hit $600 million, then we're going to take on $700 million. So CPI, by itself, is on the rise. So, all these things are good factors. I mean the fact that the underlying solid waste business is strong, a good economy, operationally, we're solid, the fact that we've got this great workforce and low turnover, we've got a ton of other metrics that we watch that we don't share with you, obviously, that all tell us really story. We're going to continue to build on the success and then we're going to turn this recycling thing around and it's going to be a happy day. So, more to come. And these things start to anniversary into 2019 and help us build a strong 2019. And that wasn't guidance. Charles F. Serianni: Good job. Michael Feniger : Thank you. Charles F. Serianni: Thank you, Don. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Henry Sou Chien : Hey, guys, it's Henry Chien, good afternoon, calling for Jeff. Just a follow-up on some of the points you're making. I'm just curious of how you're thinking about the overall capacity of the business. If volume growth picks up, are you kind of prepared at least given the wage inflation to ramp up hiring? And I'm just kind of curious with sort of your increasing CapEx, does that sort of suggest you need to sort of invest in new improvements to make things more efficient given the wage inflation, just however you're thinking about capacity for the business? Thanks. Donald W. Slager: Well, first of all, as far as CapEx goes, we've always guided, CapEx is 10% of revenue. So when revenue's growing, as volume's growing, deploying CapEx to capture that volume, that's the best way our owners would like us to see us deploy cash, right? So, we do that very effectively. There's not latent capacity in the business because the business has been growing for some time now. So, as it relates to the staffing model, again, we have low turnover. We've held the line very well year-over-year. Some of this wage inflation that we talked about is in select markets, but we're handling that well. And in fact, our time to fill open positions is actually down year-over-year. And we track a lot of really cool metrics here. So, our people are doing a great job of attracting good people. We've got great training programs to bring people into the pipeline. So, I think we're poised to again handle the growth that comes us. Remember, solid waste, that 1% to 2% organic growth, we're not talking about light speed here. But when you factor in a very nice steady diet of 1% to 2% volume, price in excess of inflation, the model sings a very nice song and we're going to continue to build on a great cash flow. So, as someone would like to say, follow the cash. Look at the cash flow of the business. We're very happy with what we're doing in the underlying business. And frankly, we're very certain that this is the moment when the waste industry is going to fix this recycling thing for good. Henry Sou Chien : Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Mr. Slager for any closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Austin. In closing, I think as I just said we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, strong solid waste fundamentals together with relentless operational execution. I love when the team is relentless. Resulting in a double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow. And despite the recycling headwinds, we are reiterating our original guidance, which represented 20% growth in earnings and free cash flow per share versus the prior year. We will continue to manage the business, create long-term value and remain focused on executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. I'd like to thank the entire Republic team, all the employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating this thing we called The Republic Way. Thanks, everybody. Thank you for spending time with us today. Have a good evening, and please, please be safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Donald W. Slager: Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong third quarter results. The team sustained the momentum built in the first half of the year by capitalizing on strong solid waste trends to drive both price and underlying volume growth, advancing our multi-year initiatives to provide an improved customer experience, in addition to safer and more efficient operations, and executing our plans to mitigate recycling headwinds in the short-term and advance our long-term strategy to transform our recycling business. As a result, in the third quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow per share, despite an $0.08 headwind from recycling, invested an additional $53 million in value-enhancing acquisitions, bringing our year-to-date total investment to $133 million, and returned approximately $200 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we continued to see solid revenue and EBITDA growth in our collection and disposal businesses, as well as energy services. Together, they contributed 80 basis points of margin expansion. The pricing environment continued to be favorable in the third quarter. Core price was 3.9% and increased 30 basis points from the second quarter. In the open market, core price increased 20 basis points sequentially to 4.6%. In the restricted market, core price increased 50 basis points sequentially to 2.8%. This is the highest restricted core price we've achieved in nearly 10 years. Improving the customer experience continues to be a critical part of our overall business strategy. We achieve this by developing and offering products that are designed to meet our customers' wants and needs and delivering superior service. Doing so helps us retain our customers for a longer period of time and earn a price increase each year. In turn, we successfully raised prices while maintaining our customer defection rate below 7% for a third consecutive quarter. Additionally, we continue to convert our CPI-based contracts to an alternative pricing mechanism. We now have 25% of our CPI-based contracts representing $625 million, transitioned to a waste-related index or fixed rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and continue to run higher than CPI. We also continued to see strong underlying volume growth in our collection and disposal businesses in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of non-regrettable losses and a difficult special waste comp, total volume increased 1% over the prior year. We believe the current economic backdrop, including solid consumer sentiment readings, supports continued top-line growth. Next, our energy service business continues to perform well. In the third quarter, total energy services revenues increased 30% over the prior year. Our recycling business also improved in the third quarter. We successfully increased prices and reduced our operating cost by 3.5% sequentially. As we expected, current market conditions are serving as a catalyst to transform our recycling business into a more durable, economically sustainable business, one where companies can continue to invest for the benefit of their communities without undue risk. Our team has been working diligently to execute our short-term plans to mitigate recycling headwinds, as well as advance our longer-term plans to transform our recycling business. In the open market, we continue to see new recycling service at 90% to 100% of the price of solid waste, demonstrating our customers' willingness to pay. We rolled out a recycling processing fee to our recycling collection customers to cover higher processing costs. And this fee contributed 25 basis points to total revenue growth. In the restricted market, we successfully negotiated price increases with a portion of our municipal processing customers, with an annualized benefit of $6 million. These will go into effect in the fourth quarter. We also continued to secure immediate price increases from many of our municipal collection customers. These price increases contributed approximately 10 basis points to average yield. Additionally, we transitioned some of our municipal collection customers to a new pricing model, including multiple municipalities in Texas, Illinois and Iowa. Finally, we continued to leverage technology to increase productivity, reduce costs and improve the quality of material recovered at our processing centers. As a result, we sequentially improved our year-over-year cost headwinds by $0.01. I'm extremely pleased with the results our team has been able to deliver thus far. Although it will take time, with help from our customers and consumers, we can ensure recycling is sustainable for generations to come. Turning to our full-year 2018 guidance. On the second quarter earnings call, we advised that we expected to be at the lower end of our EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. Given the strength of the business, we now expect EPS to be near the midpoint of the guidance range and free cash flow to be near the upper end of the guidance range, despite a recycling headwind of approximately $0.30 versus the prior year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Chuck? Charles F. Serianni: Thanks, Don. Third quarter revenue was approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of $102 million or 4.1% over the prior year. The increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.2% and acquisitions of 1.9%. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield increased 2.4% and was in line with our expectations. Average yield in the collection business was 2.8%, which includes 3% in the small container business, 3% in the large container business and 2.3% in the residential business. Average yield in the post collection business was 1.7%, which includes landfill MSW of 2.2%. The majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.9% and increased 30 basis points from the second quarter. Core price in the open market was 4.6% and core price in the restricted portion of our business was 2.8%. The second component of internal growth is total volume, which decreased 10 basis points over the prior year. Volume in our large container business increased 60 basis points and volume in the small container business decreased 30 basis points. Small container volume included a 90-basis-point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volume would have increased 60 basis points. Volume in our residential business decreased 2.9%. The decrease was expected based upon our strategic decision not to renew certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. The post collection business made up of third-party landfill and transportation volume increased 2.4%. Landfill volume increased 2.3%. Growth in MSW and special waste volume was partially offset by an anticipated decrease in C&D volume. More specifically, landfill MSW volume increased 3%. Landfill special waste volume increased 3.9%, despite a difficult comp in the prior year. C&D volume decreased 60 basis points versus the prior year due to a difficult comp. In the prior year, C&D volume increased substantially due to hurricane-related clean-up efforts in the South. The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 80 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel increased to $3.24 in the third quarter from $2.63 in the prior year, an increase of 23%. The current average diesel price is up $0.14 from September levels. The next component, energy services revenue, increased 10 basis points. This is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin where we continue to be well-positioned. The final component of internal growth is recycling, processing and commodity revenue, which decreased 1%. The decrease in revenue primarily relates to a decrease in the number of tons sold and lower recycle commodity prices, which was partially offset by the new recycling processing fee rolled out to our recycling collection customers to cover higher processing costs. The recycling processing fee contributed an incremental 25 basis points of pricing. It's important to note that our average yield of 2.4% does not include the 25-basis-point benefit from the recycling processing fee. Excluding glass/organics, average commodity prices decreased 37% to $106 per ton in the third quarter, down from $167 per ton in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, we expect the headwind from lower recycle commodity prices to decrease as the prior-year comp becomes easier. Next I will discuss changes in margin. In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 70 basis points to 28.4% from 29.1% in the prior year. This included 80 basis points of expansion from the solid waste business, including collection, disposal and energy services, which was more than offset by a 150-basis-point headwind from recycling. Keep in mind, following 28 quarters of low CPI, we are now just beginning to see the margin benefit from higher CPI in conversions to the water, sewer, trash index. In the third quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 10.2%. For the full year, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 10.4%. Third quarter 2018 interest expense was $95 million, which included $10 million of non-cash amortization. Keep in mind, 17% of our debt portfolio has a variable interest rate. Therefore every 100-basis-point increase in variable rates will increase annual interest expense by approximately $15 million. Our all-in adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 23.6% and in line with our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we expect our all-in effective tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.82, an increase of $0.15 or 22% over the prior year. EPS included a $0.12 benefit from tax reform, which was partially offset by an $0.08 headwind from recycling. Adjusted free cash flow through the first three quarters was $968 million, an increase of 60% versus the prior year. The growth in free cash flow was due to an increase in EBITDA, lower cash taxes primarily due to tax reform, and the timing of tax payments. During the quarter, we returned $203 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Don to discuss our preliminary outlook for 2019. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Chuck. Given the predictability and consistency of our business, similar to prior years, we are providing a preliminary outlook for next year. We are currently midway through our annual planning process. Based on our initial reviews and assuming current business and economic conditions continue, we project the following for 2019 : Adjusted EPS of $3.23 to $3.28 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion. This represents mid- to high-single-digit growth in EPS and free cash flow per share despite rising interest rate environment. Also contemplated in our outlook is a tax rate headwind of approximately $0.16 and an incremental $50 million capital investment of tax reform savings back into the business for the benefit of our front-line employees. Excluding the impact of taxes and tax reinvestment, our outlook includes double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow per share. We will achieve these results in 2019 by securing price increases in excess of our cost inflation, growing volume for the seventh straight year, executing on our profitable growth through differentiation strategy to enhance the customer experience and drive additional operating leverage in the business; continuing to transition our municipal recycling customers to a more durable fee-based pricing model, including a fee that fully acknowledges the cost to collect and process the material with a more equitable risk sharing arrangement; effectively deploying capital to fund profitable organic growth and value-enhancing acquisitions; and consistently and efficiently returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Similar to prior years, we will provide detailed financial guidance for 2019 in February of next year. In summary, our 2018 performance, along with a favorable economic backdrop, position us well for continued growth in 2019. Next year, as we anniversary the headwinds from recycling, we expect our results to demonstrate the strength and operating leverage of our business. This includes strong top-line growth, 30 basis points to 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion, and double-digit growth in EPS and free cash flow per share. At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Slager. The first question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey. Good afternoon. Charles F. Serianni: Hey, Tyler. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown : Hey. Yeah, nice quarter. So I appreciate the early look into 2019. You mentioned the 30 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion next year. That's very solid. But I am a little curious about how we get there. So, first, is there any assumption of a margin benefit from, say, recycling, be it a processing fee or commodities? And then, given what's going on the unit cost inflation side of the equation, what kind of average yield do you think you need to achieve to overcome that heightened inflation? I mean, do you need north of a 3% yield to get there? Donald W. Slager: What an ironic question that was, Tyler. So, look, let me start with a really strong performance here as we end the year, right? So we're really happy with the quarter. Again, the underlying fundamentals of the business of strong volume/price, and we pulled through some of the highest prices we've seen in years, right? So, that price is going to continue and build and we'll have certain things that start to anniversary in our favour. We're already having impact from our efforts to change the recycling model here in this year and we'll have more impact in Q4. Those will start to come to bear throughout the year. And again, we have 1,100 contracts we talk to, municipal contracts. We've already converted quite a few of them to a new model. We are still talking to over 40% of them today is to move in that direction. So there's a lot of that good happening. As far as the commodity value, we have that flat into next year, right? So, if that comes back, we sort of get the automatic benefit. You've heard me say before, I hope it doesn't come back. I hope it just stays right where it is, because that's how we'll fix this recycling model. And we don't want any of our people sort of getting weak in the knees. We need to push through to a new model that gives us predictable consistent returns in that business and then shares the upside with customers, if they do a good job and a responsible job with the contamination. So we're going to continue to push that. We're getting benefit in maintenance. We're getting benefit in some of the labor activity. We've got a lot of good things happening underlying the business that are starting to now show up, and that's how we get the margin expansion. It's just good old-fashioned blocking, tackling. Pricing continued to be strong, and a good economic backdrop in solid waste. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. And then maybe coming back a little bit to the pricing. So I know next year the CPI look-back is going to benefit 2019 mathematically. But I'm just curious if you can talk about how quickly you can push through on the open market side, maybe talk about how Capture plays a role in that? And maybe how quickly you can pivot in the open market side? Donald W. Slager: As it relates to recycling or just solid waste? Patrick Tyler Brown : Just solid waste pricing Donald W. Slager: Well, again, Capture is the tool we use to really, one, make our sales team more efficient, make the selling experience better for customers, but also keep some level of centralized control over the process. So Capture is a real-time tool. So as we see the opportunity and the pricing flexibility, markets change, we're able to really act quickly with the pricing that we move into the marketplace. And of course, when we price our open market customers, we use this RPM process, where we're only pricing a segment of the customers per month. So we've got the ability to kind of accelerate/decelerate depending on what we're seeing in the market. So that's the tool we use. And again, if you look at the pricing that we're getting now, I think it was on the last call you asked me some similar question. Don, are you going to need pricing that looks more like 3% to start to offset some of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing in, for instance, long-haul trucking or leachate? And my answer to you was, yes, we're going to have to move pricing north from where it is today. And you can see now just in the last few months, our efforts, moving pricing in the right direction sequentially. So we're going to continue, as I said in my comments, to get pricing over normal inflation costs, net of productivity. And we're prepared to do that. Our people are good at it. We've got the systems in place to do it. And we're confident we can do that with the good economic backdrop we have. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. Good. I'll turn it over. Good stuff. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Good afternoon. My first question is just around how you guys think about your U.S. housing exposure versus others in the sector. It feels like legacy Republic had more exposure because of Sunbelt states. But then you also have a slide in your deck that others do not, signifying sort of a correlation to single-family housing starts. So do you guys have more exposure? Or is that just a coincidence that you guys talk about it more? Donald W. Slager: Well, I'll let Chuck give you some numbers on this. But I think we had a lot of exposure when the bubble burst, because of the overcapacity that was built out in places like Florida and Arizona and Las Vegas. And those are markets that we're very dense in. Of course, we don't have that problem today. Frankly, today there's more sort of a supply shortage. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. Donald W. Slager: Right? So we're on the other end of it. So I still think this steady growth in housing is still good for the business. I'd much prefer sort of a steady improvement than a sudden improvement. And if the market continues to move toward the all-time average of 1.5 million [housing starts], even the 1.4 million, we're sub that today. So I think we're well positioned and right in the way of the growth. And so the growth will come to us. As far as having more than anybody else, I don't know that that's true. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. I don't think that that's true either. When we talk about housing starts, we're really talking about that as a proxy for consumer sentiment, how the consumers really feel about the economy. The consumers are really the ones that drive GDP. They're really the ones that drive the growth in the business. So we look at housing right now, it's still strong, it's 1.2 million units and that's up 6.6% over the prior year. So we still see good growth in housing. Even if it stays kind of at 1.2 million or creeps up a little bit from there, that still tells us that the consumer feels very good about the economy. And if they feel good about the economy, they're going to spend more money and that's going to generate waste, which is good for us. Donald W. Slager: And remember, Hamzah, we lag these changes, right? So if there's something moving there that is of any sort of material impact to the business, I think we'll see it coming a long way off. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Right. Makes sense. And my follow-up question is just around how to think about M&A as you look into 2019. You talked about $200 million this year. It feels like the last time you did below $100 million was in 2016. So, just maybe walk us through, is $200 million the right number to look at in 2019? And is that just solid waste or are you looking at energy as well? Thank you. Donald W. Slager: Well, thanks. Well, look, I think overall I would tell you that the pipeline is robust. We're not giving exact guidance on M&A for next year, but I think you could say it's certainly going to be north of $150 million in 2019 based on what we know today. That that pipeline builds over time. So we've got a good group of people that wake up every day and think about this. We've got a number of interesting acquisition candidates in the pipeline today. So we'll see good progress continue. And again, the good news is we're still paying a reasonable amount for these deals on a multiple basis post synergy. So I think we'll see a continued benefit from acquisitions still and well into 2019. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi. Good afternoon. Donald W. Slager: Hi, Brian. Charles F. Serianni: Hi, Brian. Brian Maguire : Thanks for the yearly color on 2019 guidance. Just to try and tease out a little bit some of the components, I know it's still early, but the 30 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion, I just wanted to make sure I have the right starting point. I think you were previously talking about a 28.0% for 2018. Is that still what you're looking for? And so we should think about it being like a 28.3%, a 28.5% next year, is that right? Charles F. Serianni: That's right, Brian. Donald W. Slager: You're right. Charles F. Serianni: That's right. Brian Maguire : Okay. So, just want to make sure I have the right starting point there. Yeah. And then based on your comments around the tax impact next year and assuming even if acquisitions contribute only half the growth that they did this year, it seems to imply yield price plus volumes are maybe up 3%. My math might be off a little bit, but seems like somewhere in that ballpark. It seems still lower than what others are talking about. We have one guy talking about 3% plus 3% this morning. Others are doing more like 2% plus 2% in this environment. Just wondering if you think about 2019, we're talking about price maybe having to get almost up to 3% just to offset inflation. Does that leave us much for volume growth? And if not, is there anything you guys are looking at in the 2019 that would cause you to think we're not going to see a pickup in volume growth? Donald W. Slager: Well, all right. Well, look, we're not giving a detailed guidance for 2019. We've given our preliminary outlook. Again, based on what we're seeing in the business today, again, strong economic backdrop, we still think there's room to run here, good execution in our initiatives, already good progress in restructuring and revamping this recycling business, really strong pricing, strongest in years. As Chuck said, we're starting now see the benefit of the compounding benefit of rolling over with the new alternative index starting to take place. Higher CPI, we think that continues to fuel progress into 2019. Remember, when it comes to volume, we've got a little bit of our business to shed still with the brokered business. We're not afraid to walk away from bad contracts with municipalities. So we talked about non-regrettable losses, so that'll still be part of our 2019 story, right? But, again, we're starting from a strong position here in ending Q3 and already in Q4. So I gave you a lot of color, but we think the volume and the pricing traction that we're seeing will continue into 2019. Brian Maguire : Okay. Yeah. I think that broker component continuing is probably what I was missing initially, but that makes sense. Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. And I would just add, we're talking about the 28% margin here in 2018. If not for this recycling headwind, we'd be at 29.5% for 2018, okay? So we would have been sort of a stone's throw from that 30% goal we set for ourselves. And then our friends in China can then kind of put us back on our heels a little bit. But we're standing up and we're going right back at it again and all these things we've got, they're making progress for us in 2018, they're going to bode well for us in 2019. We're going to march right back to a better margin. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Hey. Good afternoon. Appreciate you calling out the 25 bps revenue growth from recycling processing fees. You're clearly making a lot of progress there. So, first, can you remind us of the magnitude of the EBITDA impact you're expecting from recycling this fiscal year and what kind of tailwind you might be able to generate in the recycling line of business in 2019 as a result of these initiatives? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So what we're expecting this year is 140 basis points of compression from recycling in 2018. And obviously, we'll get a little bit of a benefit associated with the actions that we've already put into place in Q3. So, if we just talk about the annual value of the Q3 actions, it's about $40 million, that's the annual value. So, about $20 million of a rollover benefit in 2019. And I need to point out that that doesn't include any of the actions that we expect to be able to take here in Q4. Noah Kaye : Great. Next, I think you mentioned a $0.16 tax rate headwind for next year. Does that imply the tax rate going back to 27% or 28%, what's the right number? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, going back to 27%. Noah Kaye : Okay. Great. And then if I could just take one more crack at what I think a couple others have been trying to get at. It looks like you'll probably get 1%, maybe 1.5% growth from M&A next year. You're moving past the impacts of rev rec. So, underlying volume growth in particular, I think a lot of people are focused on that. You're coming off of kind of an easy headline comp this year. So, any reason why underlying volume growth rate, you can't be in that 1% to 2% range? Donald W. Slager: Well, again, this is not guidance, right? But let's just talk about the predictability of the business, that's the hallmark of the business, right? Other than sort of these sort of anomalies like China's actions or things like that, or the housing bubble reaching 3 million units or whatever heck it did and bursting years ago, generally speaking, things do not always move pretty slow. So, when you've got good traction and momentum, you've got the underlying fundamentals we have, they tend to sort of stay with you for a period of time. And as I said, I think it was to Hamzah, because we lag, we still sort of see these other big changes coming. So, think about that predictability. We also tell people, right, that the business grows with household formation, population growth, business formation. We see that continuing, right? We also tell people that, look, on average the business can grow sort of through this cycle sort of 1.5% to 2% organic volume, right? Now we have some takeaways from that because we've got some business we're shedding in a non-regrettable way. So I didn't just give you guidance. I just gave you general backdrop of this business. Pricing, we generally are able to price ahead of inflation. Now we ran into a problem when CPI went away from us and now we're getting our grip back on that. So, as I said in my comments, we're going to price ahead of inflation in 2019. So, that pricing historically has been 2.5% to, in some cases, 3%. Now that sort of varies a little bit by line of business, by market vertical. But those are sort of generalities that underscore the strength, the predictability in this business, and that's what we're seeing now. We're seeing some of that CPI anomaly sort of going, again, in our rear-view mirror. We're making a great deal of headway in this China situation. And while it's just a lot of hard work, it's all stuff we know how to do and we're already getting the benefit. It's showing up in the numbers now and that's what gives you confidence into 2019. Noah Kaye : Thanks very much for the color, Don. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question will be from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Marc Silber : Thank you so much. I know there's been some discussion in the industry, and I know we heard from one of your competitors this morning about some increasing third-party costs, transportation-related, labor-related. Can you address that? I'm assuming that's something you're seeing. How you're able to push that through in terms of price increases to your customers? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Sure. We are seeing some of that. Again, we generally don't handle our own waste transfer trucking. So we generally hire a third-party to move waste from our transfer stations to our landfills. The long-haul trucking companies are experiencing a great deal of cost increase and labor shortage and turnover. That's kind of coming into that space a little bit. We're doing a much better job with our own drivers, with our own front-line workforce, because we've spent a lot of time trying to work on creating a great work environment, employee engagement and the rest of it. But we are seeing that coming and we're building that into our cost inflation model. We're building that into our pricing assumptions. We're building that into our go-forward planning when it comes to renewing large contracts and so forth. Jeffrey Marc Silber : Okay. Great. And my follow-up question, I just want to confirm something I thought I heard you say. But if we take out the recycling headwinds that you've seen this year and just look at your core business, margins are up on a year-over-year basis. I know there's some noise in terms of the revenue recognition, but I just want to confirm that that's the case. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. Yeah. Margins would be up anywhere from 60 basis points to 80 basis points during the year. And obviously, that's being masked this year because of recycling. But when we guide to 30 basis points to 50 basis points EBITDA margin expansion, that's where you truly see how the solid waste piece of the business is growing. Jeffrey Marc Silber : Okay. Fantastic. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask a quick question on you had a nice jump in the restricted pricing, up 50 bps. When we kind of think about the open, I mean you're kind of at this 4.5% mark the last three quarters. Should we be thinking next year that's kind of the ceiling on the pricing gains in the open market? And where you're getting most of the leverage is really on that restricted because of the CPI? Is that kind of how to think about it? Is there like a limit on the pricing gains base that we're seeing in the open market right now? Donald W. Slager: Yeah. You could think about it that way. I mean, we're going to continue to explore price elasticity by market, by market vertical, whether it's large container, small container, what have you. We're going to continue to do that. Our tools allow us to do that, our people are really good at it. We are, again, seeing the benefit now of the rolling over of moving restricted business to a more credible and appropriate index. That's certainly going to give us a lot of help as we go through time. And even though CPI is starting to look a little more like normal, we're not going to relax and go back to CPI. We are moving forward to change contracts over time to water, sewer, trash or a fixed 3% or greater. That's still our model. That's still what we're aiming at. Just like I said, if China changes its tune, if recycling gets better, we're still going to continue to change the model to something that's durable. We're going to take this volatility out of the business. So again, I'm not giving detailed pricing guidance by market vertical today. But again, the underlying strength, the results we're getting today, you can kind of model those into next year and get a pretty good handle on it I think. Michael Feniger : Makes sense. And then on the internal cost inflation, we're kind of thinking about next year. I mean, I know the rule of thumb I believe used to be around 2.5% and then you guys would get 50 bps of productivity. I mean, how is that framework kind of changing into next year? And can you still get that 50 bps of productivity gains? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. So what we've said historically is cost inflation at about 2% to 2.25% and that's net of the productivity gains that you spoke of. As we look now and then into 2019, we're thinking that costs are probably going to trend up closer to 2.5%. And once again, that's net of the productivity gains. And that's why getting the price increase that Don had talked about is so important. And that's what allows us to get the EBITDA margin expansion in 2019. Donald W. Slager: Right. We've always said, we can't offset normal inflation through productivity. There's just not that much sloppiness in our business. So while we get better every year across many different functions and capabilities, there's not so much sloppiness to overcome inflation. So we just have to adjust pricing to do that. And when there are real broad-based legitimate things happening in labor or with trucking and those kind of things, we're able to go to customers and get it done. And our contracts, the markets allow us typically to do that. And again, with CPI now being something that we're getting in our hand or at least when it's improving and we're changing the index, that can help us get that. Michael Feniger : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. One housekeeping, what's the share count you're using for the per share guidance? Charles F. Serianni: For 2018, Michael, or for 2019? Michael E. Hoffman: 2019. Charles F. Serianni: For 2019, we're going to have to get back to you on that, Michael, I don't have it in front of me. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. And then, you really helped bring a little clarity to all of this hand-wringing around what the price environment is supposed to be next year. You're at 2.4%, 2.5% second half of this year. You're going to put pricing initiatives in the fourth quarter on an open market basis. CPI is trending at up 40 basis points this year. So it would be reasonable to think that I take the trend out of the second half of this year and it progressively gets better all year long and that's the way to think about it, right? Donald W. Slager: In 2019. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. The trend for 2019, yeah, that's right, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman: Yeah. Okay. And then... Donald W. Slager: Yeah. But we're never just sitting still, right? So there's always something happening in the market with our tools, with the way we're adjusting pricing, with our fees, with whatever, there's always something new happening that ultimately rolls into the pricing format, right? And the reality is that some of these inflationary costs are beyond our control that we have to overcome. And then as you said, CPI, and every time we're successful in getting a new contract rolled over with a new index, every time we're successful convincing a new recycling customer to go to a fee-based structure, each one of those things just keeps rolling into the business, right, and ultimately moving that number up through time. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. And then the volume question, everybody keeps wringing our hands about as well. When you shook away all the noise of regrettable losses and contracts you chose to walk away from, this year you had a positive volume that I would assume that's something in that 1.5%, 2-ish range. Donald W. Slager: Well, above 1%. Michael E. Hoffman: It was underlying... Donald W. Slager: Above 1%. Michael E. Hoffman: Above 1%. Donald W. Slager: And better next year. Michael E. Hoffman: Right. So, that's where I was going. Okay. That's all I needed. Thanks. Donald W. Slager: Thank you, Michael. Nicole Giandinoto : Hey, Michael. Just on your share question, what I would tell you is think about it in how we've always talked about it. We first invest in CapEx and M&A. And then from there, we return the remainder of the cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. So I would just kind of think through that as you're modeling it and we'll get more detailed guidance in February. Michael E. Hoffman: All right. Well, you tend to buy back 2% to 3%. So I was assuming I was going to just reduce the number on a rolling basis 2%. Nicole Giandinoto : Yeah. I think that's a good... Charles F. Serianni: Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. Nicole Giandinoto : ...starting point. Michael E. Hoffman: Okay. Operator : The next question will be from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale : Hey. Good afternoon. I think, Don, you've been pretty articulate about how you're thinking about pricing. But maybe just a little bit on landfill pricing, and I know a lot of that is locked up under long-term contracts, but just given \u2013 well, it sounds like a good environment overall. Do you expect any sort of inflecting on that in 2019 or thinking about that any differently? Donald W. Slager: Well, I should like to expect more landfill pricing, but here's the deal. Most of our landfill volume, besides all the volume that Republic brings to its own landfills, comes from municipalities. So, that restricted price is getting restricted generally to CPI, except for those contracts that we've begun to move to a different index. The unrestricted volume looks more like a 3% to 4% price increase. So we're going to continue to move that up. I'm a little disappointed that it hasn't been able to move up faster. But as we've shared with you before, I mean we've been pretty straightforward on the cost of these landfills, the cost of leachate, the scarcity of the asset. And we continue to move pricing up and unfortunately that dislocated some volume to other landfills that have been willing to take on all that cost and liability for less than we are. So it's still something that I think over time has more room for upside. That's really not baked into our 2019 guide or 2019 preliminary outlook. Corey Greendale : Got it. And my follow-up is I think hopefully pretty easy question which is just can you remind me the consolidation of the service centers, is that totally a 2018 cost benefit or is there some benefit in 2019? And just can you quantify what it is in 2018, if there isn't anything in 2019? Donald W. Slager: No we pretty much got it done, right? It's pretty much behind us. Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. It's 2018. Donald W. Slager: Yeah. Corey Greendale : So, just in terms of roughly what the benefit is in 2018 versus 2017? Charles F. Serianni: Yeah. It's the SG&A improvement, that's the primary improvement year-over-year, so call it 20 basis points to 30 basis points. Corey Greendale : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for your closing remarks. Donald W. Slager: Well, thank you, Denise. In closing, I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence in creating the Republic Way. And you could all do me one favor and go to recyclingsimplified.com, so everyone can learn how to recycle responsibly. Tell all your friends to be friendly to the planet, it'll change your life. Thank you for spending time with us today. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending this presentation.

Finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Donald Slager : Thanks Nicole. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong finish to 2018. Full year 2018 EPS was $3.09 and in line with our guidance range. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion and exceeded the upper end of our guidance range. Total acquisition investment was over $200 million. Total cash return to shareholders was $1.2 billion, and total shareholder return was 9% compared to the S&P 500's negative return of 4%. The team delivered these results despite a $145 million headwind from the recycling business. We accomplished this by capitalizing on solid waste trends to drive both price and volume growth, strengthening our market position, and improving route density through acquisitions, executing our plans to mitigate recycling headwinds in the short-term, while advancing our long-term strategy to transform the business, and efficiently returning cash to our shareholders. Turning to fourth quarter highlights, we delivered double-digit growth in earnings per share, invested $87 million in value-enhancing acquisitions, and divested $79 million of non-strategic assets. We also returned $284 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Throughout the fourth quarter, the pricing environment continued to be favorable. We achieved core price of 4.3% and average yield of 2.7%, our highest pricing level in nearly a decade. We also achieved an all-time low customer defection rate of sub-7%. We attribute these accomplishments to our laser focus on enhancing the customer experience and delivering superior service. Additionally, we successfully converted 27% of our CPI-based contracts, representing $660 million to a waste-related index or fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and continue to run higher than CPI. During the quarter, we also continued to see underlying volume growth in our collection and disposal businesses. Excluding the impact of non-regrettable losses and a difficult special waste comp, total volume increased 90 basis points over the prior year. Our recycling business also improved in the fourth quarter. The team continued to tightly manage operating costs and increase recycling collection and processing fees. As expected, the current market conditions continue to serve us as a catalyst to transform recycling into a more durable and economically sustainable business. Additionally, we opened our first next-gen recycling processing center in Plano, Texas. We call it next-gen because unlike a traditional processing center, where we primarily sort and remove items that are not recyclable, here, we are leveraging state-of-the-art technology to extract items that are recyclable. This positive sort configuration allows us to produce a higher quality product with less labor. The facility also includes a 5,000 square-foot learning resource center for the community, so residents can learn the proper way to recycle and reduce their environmental impact. Our partnership with the City of Plano is an example of our new recycling business model. We are paid an appropriate fee to process the material and the majority of the commodity value is rebated back to the community. This contract structure enables us to invest in new technology while earning an appropriate return on our investment. Lastly, given we operate one of the largest vocational fleets in the U.S.; we are continuously evaluating innovative approaches and technologies to improve the performance, economics, and environmental impact of our trucks. Earlier this week, Mack Trucks announced our partnership to design and test electrification in a fully integrated garbage truck with zero diesel propulsion components. We are proud to be partnering with Mack and optimistic that this will result in a significant step towards an even cleaner, more efficient fleet. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Chuck Serianni : Thanks Don. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $65 million or 2.6% over the prior year. This increase includes internal growth of 2.3% and acquisitions of 30 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield increased 2.7% and was the highest level we've seen since 2009. Average yields in the collection business was 3.4%, which included small container of 3.2%, large container of 4.5% and residential of 2.6%. In our post-collection business, average yield was 1.5%, which included landfill MSW of 2.1%. The majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.3%. Core price in the open market was 5.1% and in the restrictive portion of our business was 2.9%. The second component of internal growth is total volume. As expected, total volume decreased 70 basis points over the prior year. Excluding the impact of non-regrettable losses and a difficult special waste comp, volume growth would have been 90 basis points. Volume in our small container business decreased 80 basis points as anticipated. This includes 130 basis point headwind from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volume would have increased 50 basis points. Volume in our large container business increased 80 basis points. And volume in our residential business decreased 1.9% due to our strategic decision not to renew certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. Next, turning to landfill volume. Landfill MSW volume increased 7.2%, while special waste decreased 11.6% and C&D decreased 10.7%. The decrease in special waste and C&D volume was due to a difficult comp in the prior year. In 2017, both special waste and C&D volume grew over 30%. The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 70 basis points due to the rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel increased to $3.26 in the fourth quarter from $2.87 in the prior year, an increase of 14%. The current average diesel price is $2.97 per gallon. The next component, energy services revenue, was flat versus the prior year, which was in line with our expectations. In the Permian Basin, where we are well-positioned, drilling activity remains steady. The final component of internal growth is recycling processing and commodity revenue, which decreased 40 basis points. The change in revenue primarily relates to a decrease in the number of tons sold and lower recycle commodity prices. This decrease was partially offset by the new recycling processing fee rolled out to our open market recycling collection customers. This fee contributed 35 basis points of pricing. It's important to note that our average yield of 2.7% does not include this benefit. Excluding glass organics, average commodity prices decreased 15% to $106 per ton in the fourth quarter, down from $125 per ton in the prior year. Next, I will discuss changes in margin. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 80 basis points to 27.4% from 28.2% in the prior year. This included 10 basis points of margin expansion from the solid waste business, which was offset by a 40 basis point headwind from recycling and a 50 basis point headwind from one additional work day. Fourth quarter 2018 interest expense was $96 million, which included $10 million of non-cash and amortization. Our all-in tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20%. This includes an adjusted effective tax rate of 12% and a non-cash charge of approximately $30 million related to solar energy investments that qualified for tax credits. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.80 and increased $0.19 or 31% versus the prior year. EPS included a $0.12 benefit from tax reform. Excluding this benefit, EPS would have increased 11%. Adjusted free cash flow for the full year was $1.2 billion and cash conversion was 42%. Free cash flow exceeded our expectations primarily due to better than anticipated improvements in working capital. During the year, we improved both DSO and DPO by approximately two days. This improvement provided a one-time benefit to free cash flow. Looking ahead, I'd like to review the highlights of our 2019 financial guidance, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided in October. For the year, we expected adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.23 to $3.28. After normalizing for taxes, our guidance represents double-digit growth in earnings per share. Next, we expect adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion. Included in our free cash flow guidance is a working capital headwind of approximately $45 million and $50 million of incremental capital we are investing for the benefit of our frontline employees as a result of tax reform. Excluding these two items, our guidance represents high single-digit growth in free cash flow per share. Total annual revenue growth is expected to be 4.25% to 4.75%. We expected adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by 30 to 50 basis points over 2018, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business. Furthermore, given the strength of our current pipeline, we anticipate investing approximately $200 million in tuck-in acquisitions. 2019 net capital expenditures are expected to be $1.2 billion. And finally, we expect to return $1.4 billion of total cash to shareholders to $500 million of dividends and $875 million of share repurchases. I'll now turn the call back over to Don to make a few closing comments before going to Q&A. Donald Slager : Thanks Chuck. Our strong finish to the year positions us well for continued growth in 2019. We'll achieve this growth by securing price increases in excess of our cost inflation, growing volume for the seventh straight year, continuing to transform the recycling business by transitioning our municipal recycling customers to a more durable, fee-based pricing model and educating customers on what and how to recycle through our recycling simplified campaign. We'll be executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation to attract and retain the best people, enhance the customer experience, and drive additional operating leverage through the use of technology. And finally, effectively deploying capital to fund profitable, organic growth, invest in value-enhancing and consistently and efficiently, as always, returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey good afternoon. Donald Slager : Hey Tyler. Chuck Serianni : Hey Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey. So, I see in the guide that you're expecting 25 to 50 positive basis points on processing fees, commodity sales in the guide. So, I think that the RISI data that came out yesterday showed a dip in fiber prices. Can you just give us some clarity? I guess, on the one hand, I surmise you've got continuing -- a push on processing fees, but it's a little unclear. Specifically, what are you kind of assuming recycling prices in the guide? Donald Slager : Yes, so the guide has -- is about $505. I know it's a little bit lower than that right now but if you think about sort of how this thing normally works through the cycle of the year, we feel that it'll bounce back through the middle of the year. And over time, we'll average it at the right rate. So, underprice in the number. Tyler Brown : Okay, and Don, I know you probably dislike getting that question as much as I dislike asking it. So, in that vein, do you think that, over time, Republic will really, for all intents and purposes, eventually inoculate itself from commodity price changes, really pushing the risk down to the waste generator? And if so, how long do you think that process might take? Donald Slager : Well, I like your term inoculate, so that's -- we're all about that. So, if you think about my comments in we used our new contract with the City of Plano, right, that's an example of what we're doing. We believe the right way to do this is to get paid appropriately for the collection, we get paid appropriately for the processing, and I say appropriately, that means within a return that we can live with. And there is a function in the contract for contamination that the cities and communities have to bear that burden, and in the end, that they get the benefit of what's left over, which is the commodity value less contamination. That's fair. Again, we've made it increasingly easy for customers to recycle. We're committed to be a good environmental partner for those customers that want to do their part. But where customers don't want to be responsible, that's got to be on them. And so we're only making investments in recycling going forward that have a true sustainability from a profitability perspective, and that has to work just like I described. So, we're having success. And to be frank, there's all kinds of customers, right? So, we've had conversations with all of our 1,100 contracts. Some have immediately already agreed to new terms that work. Some have told us kind of, at this point, no way. And some have said let me think about it. We're in the second and third round of talks. We are going to continue to push this. I think, frankly, any operator would have to be, I'm trying to think of a nice word, an idiot to sign up for recycling the old way when we've got this big, global, macro thing in front of us. So we did a great job. The team did a great job isolating the problem in 2018. We've done a ton of great work in 2018 that's going to anniversary and carry forward into 2019, and the work continues. We're going to have more success in 2019 than 2018, and that's one of the reasons we've got the confidence. But we're going to change the model. And people tell us they want to recycle and I'm kind of a broken record around here. You're going to have to give us -- every homeowner is going to have to pay us about $1 more a week, and they're going to have to give us about two minutes more a day of their good, responsible time. And if they don't want to do that, we'll be glad to provide trash service instead of recycling service because we're really good at that. Tyler Brown : All right. Yes, that's really good. And then one last one just on the volume guide of zero to 25 bps. So, can you talk about some of the puts and takes there? I mean, I thought you were largely through the broker coal lane. I don't think special waste has any real big comps. And frankly, it just doesn't really feel like a zero volume environment. So, can you just talk about what's driving that outlook? Is that just conservatism? And -- or is there something more idiosyncratic? Thanks. Chuck Serianni : Yes, there is a headwind associated with the special waste that we have going from 2018 back into 2019. So, that's part of the reason why that volume growth is more muted. And at the end of this year, we're going to be about halfway done with shedding of brokers. But if you extract that out of the equation, if you remove broker volumes and those event volumes, the volume growth is closer to one to one in a quarter. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Donald Slager : Yes. And let me add to that. On top of that, we've got some strong price here, too, right? So, we're being very intentional about where we can get pricing, and we understand the trade-off of price and volume. So, for instance, in our temp roll-off business and so forth, you know how that works, Tyler. So, if we can get extra point of price because demand is there, we might see -- we might give -- let a little volume go for that purpose. Tyler Brown : Right. Okay. Thank you. Donald Slager : Great. Operator : The next question will be from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi, good afternoon Don, Chuck, and Nicole. Donald Slager : Hey Brian. Chuck Serianni : Hey Brian. Nicole Giandinoto : Hey Brian. Brian Maguire : Hey. A question on just the interrelationship between the CapEx and volumes because it seems like the CapEx will be up again and I thought of, in the past, the model being a little bit more like 10% of sales. It looks like we're going to be in that 11% to 12% range, 10% of sales if we're getting roughly 1% volume growth. And totally appreciate walking away from some broker business and some residential business that doesn't meet your return hurdles. But I would have thought, with that would have come actually maybe some reductions in CapEx or shifting of trucks from less productive routes to more productive routes. So, can you help me maybe understand where this CapEx is being spent and where that number could be heading over time and in kind of a flat volume environment, why it should be so high? Chuck Serianni : Yes. So, keep in mind that included in that CapEx guide, there's $75 million of what we're calling spend associated with tax reform, and that's money, as I said, that we're going to put back into the business benefiting the frontline employees. So, if you try and you pull that out of the equation, then what you end up with is CapEx that's closer to 10.5% of revenue, which is right in line with where -- what we've told The Street that we would be at kind of post-rev recognition, which is, on a historical basis, is closer to 10%. So, that's right in line with our -- what we believe our long-term average should be. Brian Maguire : And this will be the last year with that sort of outsized spend on employee stuff? Chuck Serianni : Yes, we've got one more year, that being 2020, where we're going to -- we have about $100 million that we're going to spend doing the same thing. But keep in mind that we talked about this back when tax reform was first enacted going into Q4 2017. Brian Maguire : Got it. And then just one more for me just on -- tax rate in general in 4Q was a little lower than your guidance. I was wondering if you could help us with that and then just thinking about the 2019 guidance. I appreciate the EPS is kind of in line with what you outlined earlier, but it looks like the tax rate may be a little lower. Just a little confused on that. Maybe I'm reading that wrong, but it seemed like it was 24% versus, I think, 27% before. So, just trying to understand the puts and takes there. Chuck Serianni : Yes, so both in 2018 and again, in 2019, we're going to benefit from solar projects, these investments that we're making that come with tax credits that we're able to utilize in order to reduce our effective tax rate but also to reduce our cash taxes. So, just to put that in context for you, 2018, our effective tax rate was 20.7%, and then we had a certain non-cash charges associated with those solar projects that are included below operating income, right? So, if you think about those two items together, then the net tax rate, including both of those, are just closer to 22.8%. As we go into 2019, our effective tax rate is 24.2% and then we have about 3.1% in non-cash charges related to those solar projects. So, once again, if you put those two together, you end up with a tax rate of about 27.3%. Brian Maguire : Got it. So, you're -- in those non-cash charges, you're going to include that in that EPS. Chuck Serianni : That's included in our EPS guide, yes. Brian Maguire : Got it. Okay, so laying that out to 27%. Okay, just checking on that. Thank you. Brian Maguire : Welcome. Operator : The next question will be from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : Good evening. Thank you. My question is just around the cost side, specifically, how you guys are managing labor cost inflation, labor shortage. What's baked into your guidance there? I realize employee turnover is lower for you because every driver wants to work for Don Slager, but just any thoughts in terms of cost inflation? Donald Slager : Yes, so our overall inflation, we think, for 2019 is kind of in that two and a half range. Labor will be a little higher than that. We do have pockets where we've got some labor shortage just because maybe there's local economic issues. Our turnover is essentially flat year-over-year. It's up a little bit with the growing economy, that's to be expected. We're not sitting on our hands. We're still working hard to improve the work environment. Chuck mentioned some of the investments we're making in facilities and specifically around employee facilities, locker rooms, training rooms, et cetera. So, there's some labor pressure with long-haul trucking, which will impact our costs in and around transporting waste from our transportation to our landfills. We're dealing with that. But we're also doing a great job in and around with our procurement team. They've got goals this year. There are some spend categories that we historically haven't looked at. So, we'll dig into those, and we'll find some savings in there as well. But the driver shortage, so to speak, isn't keeping us up at night. We're working hard to retain and attract the best people, and I think we're on a good track. Landfill ops is going to be another part of the story. The leachate expense is going to be about flat year-over-year to what it's been this year, and that really is related to leachate because of just changes in POTWs or public treatment works that are changing their technology and starting to raise prices on leachate disposal. That's something we can manage through and it's something we can price for. But I think that's going to be something, again, that affects all people in our business. And so I think, more than likely, you'll see more companies turning to some kind of price action to recover some of those costs. Hamzah Mazari : Great. And just my follow-up question, on pricing, you guided 2.75%. It feels like that's the highest price since 2009 or just prior to waste or downturn because you guys are late cycle. Anything different in this pricing environment that you see versus prior to the downturn? Clearly, there's a lot of changes in this space over the last, I don't know, 10 years or so. Any thoughts on how this pricing environment is different, Don? Thank you. Donald Slager : Well, I guess, I'll say this, look, when organic growth is decent to good, that sets up the industry for better pricing environment. I've always said that. So, when there's decent organic growth, pricing tends to be better. The overall increase in capital cost, capital intensity, complexity of the business, I think, gives people a reason to price that maybe they didn't have before. So, that lifts us up a little bit. Certainly, CPI has moved in our favor, and we're derisking our CPI portfolio. I'm moving to alternative indices that work for us. So, that's going to benefit us going forward. Moving to alternative index, we've said $660 million now of that book has been converted. The hard work we're doing in and around recycling with the question that Tyler asked, we're doing a lot of contract renegotiations and new pricing. That's going to help. We've got recycling processing fee that we've implemented. That's going to add some lift. And some of these things aren't fully implemented yet, so we're -- we still got some time to run under them and have them build through 2019 and frankly, anniversary into 2020. So, we think there's a fair amount of upside there. As it relates to just us pricing customers, we've got a lot better at it. We're smarter about it. Our overall defection is down sub-7%, which would tell you that, again, that's the lowest in the history of the company. We're spending a lot of time on customer experience, and so I don't believe you can just raise a customer's price. I think you've got to raise a customer's willingness to pay. And so we're working on further improving our service levels, meeting our service commitments, improving our products, improving our fleet, certainly, having the best people on the front lines of our business. All those things, I think, give us pricing power in the end, and those things, we're going to continue to work on. So, again, as you said, Hamzah, best pricing in 10 years basically. It's been building through the last few quarters. We're pretty confident we can achieve these levels in 2019. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and great to hear about solar project and electric trucks. Always nice. I wanted to ask you about the outlooks. You're reiterating the components of the preliminary outlook you provided in November and I think [Indiscernible] surprised by that. Investors have some to expect that consistency from you. The final numbers look to be the same. But has anything changed in the last three months within your assumptions, whether it's on volume, price, M&A or the cost side? And I ask in light of what is still a very sort of dynamic macro situation. Donald Slager : Well, what's changing the macro is, last year; we spent a lot of time wringing our hands over to this China thing. We're no longer dependent on China. Our team's done a lot of work moving material to new ports, opening new lanes. All of our material that we collect is handled and recycled ethically. So, we've overcome the operational hurdle of that, and now we're settling into sort of a new cost model. So, working through that and I've already described what we're doing there. From a growth perspective, right, we've always said we grow with population growth that drives housing formation, business formation. So, when there's population growth and there's job growth and there's wage growth, that's good for waste generation, right? So, as long as we see the same kind of housing start number and consumer sentiment spending is good, we think that's enough for us to continue to grow into the future. So, we feel good about that. Chuck described some of the capital spending. Our CapEx is very, very consistent. Other than when we got the gift from the government with the tax reform, we decided to spend $100 million or so to improve our -- $200 million, I guess, to improve our customer -- or our employee facilities. And these are not offices for general managers and staff. This is for frontline, hard-working men and women who show up at two in the morning and drive garbage trucks and fix garbage trucks and work at landfills. So, those are the people we're most concerned about improving their work environment, so we're spending real money for a really good cause. So, -- but that's not a surprise because we told you about that. So, again, as you said, the business is very, on one hand, slow moving, which is maybe a bad thing for you, but it's slow moving, which is a good thing for you because it makes it predictable. So, it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that our guidance is right on top of the preliminary outlook because we got a pretty good handle on our business. And then what will change in 2019 going forward? How fast can we move on restructuring the recycling business? That's going to depend on customer sentiment. It's going to depend on how well the market adjusts. It'll depend on what other competitors do frankly. But our resolve is greater than it's ever been, and we're making some really great headway and making great examples of where customers are taking a good common sense approach. And again, I gave an example in my written remarks. So, we feel good about the business. We've got a really solid team here and we're off to a great start. Noah Kaye : Thank you for that. And just to come back to the labor question, I was really struck by the labor and benefits line. Expenses were up just 3% year-over-year. Obviously, that's a significant improvement in your cost containment. Anything you would point to in terms of kind of an improved success containing those labor costs? Anything we could think about going forward? Because, obviously, we saw a lot of growth over the first three quarters of the year and what you are sort of suggesting for 2019 suggests kind of a deceleration of labor cost inflation. Donald Slager : Well, look, I'll hand that to -- off -- kudos to our operating leadership. They're really labor focused on productivity, on efficiency and safety. Employee engagement's a big deal around here as I said. I think we're probably the only solid waste company that does a nationwide employee engagement survey every year. 85% of our employees respond, which is double that of a world-class company. Our employment engagement scores are high. Our people trust that if they give us their opinions, we'll listen and we'll respond. We really are genuinely in earnest trying to make this the best place to work or the best people come to work, and I think that helps us a great deal. And that's just not a slogan. It's what we really think. So, -- and again, our operating leaders echo that throughout the organization. So, I think that's part of it. Again, every year, we get a little benefit from the things we do last year. So, we can continue to automate the residential fleet. We continue to make improvements in other areas. One Fleet continues to pay off. That investment, we don't talk about One Fleet anymore. But it's part of what we do now all the time and it makes us more reliable. Reliable trucks mean more efficient trucks. They mean more happier drivers. So, we're just going to keep building on the Republic Way and year-on-year-on-year, we get better at the things we launched two and three years ago. We launched new things, and while maybe not one of them by itself is a game changer, it's the combination and sort of the sum of the parts that really make a difference for us. So, we're just going to continue to build on that. So, appreciate the compliment I think. Noah Kaye : That's right. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi guys. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Really excited to be joining the group here. I just wanted to touch on the M&A front. The $200 million planned investment seems to indicate an above normalized year, again, in 2019. That's expected. So, just hoping to get an idea of the profile of the discussions underway with your targets. Is it the usual singles and doubles? Or is there a good probability we might see something towards the upper end of that range in terms of target size? Donald Slager : Well, it all depends, right? So, look, we wouldn't tell you $200 million unless we felt pretty strongly that we could deliver it, right? So, we've got a great pipeline and again, we've got a great development team. We've got a lot of good people in place now who've been in place for a while with all the business. Again, we don't go around and sending sellers because these are good companies we buy. And if you got a really great company, you're not likely to sell it unless somebody pays you an arm and a leg for it. So, when it comes time for you to be in that moment, where you reach your business life cycle or your personal plan comes to fruition and it's time to monetize your life's work or something else happens, some kind of a life event, that's when we buy good companies. And we've been able to keep our multiple really consistent over the year. We're not overpaying for deals. And there are a lot of really nice companies out there, some really -- some companies of all sizes that we'd love to someday have an opportunity to be part of our network. And our job is to know the owners, to know where they're at in the life cycle and be able to write a check. And we've consistently done that. We've sort of built our momentum up over the last few years, and we've got the appetite to do very big deals. It's just a matter of whether or not it's their time. So, it's kind of like when the seller's ready, we're ready. And we're very good at integrating businesses. And so we're, first and foremost, focused on tuck-ins because those are, again, lowest risk, quickest return, best returns. It doesn't mean we wouldn't look at a brand-new market. If we could go into a new market and have scale and vertical integration or at least the opportunity to over time, we would look at that. But you'll see us kind of stay in our lane. And with most of the acquisition activity, we've got some good work in and around the E&P space, and there might be an opportunity or two there that we'd look at. But we're very diligent about the ROI in these deals. We always compare and contrast the better use of cash to buy more cash flow at the right multiple or buying in our own stock. We're very comfortable with the value of our company and what value we're going to create over the next three years. We always look at that intrinsic trade-off. So, this is kind of our formula. It's been kind of a balanced approach of cash allocation, dividend, buyback, keeping a strong capital structure, keeping our debt where we think it needs to be, and having plenty of powder to do more acquisitions. Sean Eastman : Got it. I appreciate that. And the next one I have is just on the differentiation strategy. You guys were speaking to the customer experience, customer willingness to pay. I was just hoping maybe you could talk anecdotally about where you guys have been finding -- you're getting some additional pricing power through that strategy. I just want to understand that a bit better. Donald Slager : Well, we've had a lot of effort. Our marketing groups put a lot of effort into gaining customer insight. We probably spend more money on customer insights than any of our competitors really in getting to know what they think, what they want and for us to prioritize those things. Some of them seem pretty obvious on the surface and some of them don't. So, there's a lot of learning there. We are -- we're looking at digital opportunities. We're looking at ways to make it easier to do business with the company. We do have a digital channel for subscription residential business that actually has worked quite well. And new business coming into that channel comes in at a higher price than if we were going door-to-door. So, people are willing to pay for convenience and reliability. And so you'll hear us talk more and more about digital as we go through time, not only digital in the trucks, digital in the operations to make us safer and more efficient but digital as we connect more and more to customers. And we think customers want to pay for that and are willing to because it makes their lives easier. So, we'll continue to do that. And then job one, though, is to get the garbage off the ground every day on the right day in the right hour, do it safely and be a good environmental partner, and we're pretty good at that too. Sean Eastman : Okay, great. I really appreciate the time and insights. Thanks very much. Operator : And the next question will be from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Thank you for taking the questions. Don can you share with us where in the business model we're going to see the effect of the operating leverage? Is this going to be mostly OpEx or this mixture of OpEx and SG&A as we work through that 30 to 50 basis points of operating leverage? Donald Slager : Yes, it's mostly to the OpEx, right? I mean, just to say, we still have some SG&A savings on the horizon. But I will say, look, and you always hear me say this, Michael, I mean, we've got two constraints. One is cash flow. We don't want to put so much cash to work on initiatives every year and the reason for that is we can only take on so much change at a time. We got 35,000 employees. We're trying to lead them in a direction and we're getting all 35,000 people to buy into that plan. And so we can't overload them with too many new things. But there's benefit and then pricing, right? I mean, we're going to price to beat inflation. Years and years where we couldn't do that and now we got momentum on our side to do that as well. So, -- but those things go hand in hand. Better operations mean happier customers, mean better pricing. Michael Hoffman : And then on free cash flow, I appreciate the talks something about $200 million in the quarter. $225 million spending over three years is sort of the $50 million, $75 million and $100 million, so we invest into employee base. If I get to strip that away in working capital timing things, how do I think about, one, what's the baseline free cash flow I'm starting with? And what's the sustainable growth rate? Your thoughts about that sustainable growth rate at that cash flow. Chuck Serianni : Okay, let me explain it this way, Michael. If you take our reported free cash flow for 2018, so $1.178 billion and then I would back out about $45 million from working capital, which we believe one-time in nature. And then tax reform capital investment that you mentioned of $50 million, you end up with $1.083 billion and that was -- that I would consider to be a baseline. So, then if you look at that relative to the guide that we gave for 2019, that's about a 6% growth in free cash flow year-over-year. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That's what I was trying to get at, is that's probably a good sustainable number. If I'm talking about a 4% at the top, getting the 6% at the cash is kind of a good relationship. Donald Slager : Yes, that's right. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then just one more thing from a -- or maybe just two housekeeping. What's your share count in your EPS guidance? And -- go ahead, sorry. Chuck Serianni : Yes, so the share count is -- for the end of the year is 323 million shares. And then we'd expect that to decrease by about 2.5% during 2019 because of this executing on the share repurchase program. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then in the 4.25% to 4.75% for total growth, so 1% is acquisition, is that all rollover? Nicole Giandinoto : Michael, it's both in year and rollover. So, we do have a little bit of the $200 million that we're investing this year is going to benefit us this year. Michael Hoffman : Right. So, if those get done earlier, that's the upside to that number, is what I was kind of getting at. Nicole Giandinoto : Sure. Michael Hoffman : Yes, okay. Thank you. Donald Slager : Thanks Michael. Operator : The next question will be from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Henry Chien : Hey, good evening. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just wanted to follow-up on that similar question prior on your cost structure and how you're thinking about beyond natural operating leverage, are there any areas in the business where -- I was just thinking of the technology that you mentioned earlier in your remarks that are opportunities that you could maybe make the sort of long-term margin structure higher. Donald Slager : What's your definition of long-term? Henry Chien : The next few years, so beyond next year. Donald Slager : Okay. Look, there's a lot of upside left in the business, right? I mentioned just something like One Fleet, where we don't talk about it much anymore. Internally, we do quite a bit. Obviously, we measure it against the standards. But there'll be a moment when all new trucks come in. Every truck we have will have been sort of brought into life under the One Fleet banner, and we'll even have a better fleet situation than we have today, right? So that day is out there, but that is long term. Some of this technology, we're excited about this thing we've got going on with Mack on the EV but too early to tell, right? But that's why we're spending time and effort on this because technology has a real place in the future. We talked a little bit about technology in our new Plano next-gen recycling facility. There's sort of some technology yet beyond that, sort of robotics and things like that, that we're testing. So, I will tell you this. I think there's a lot of opportunity yet with our digital operations initiative, and digital platform is kind of our fifth pillar of our strategy. But what I wouldn't want you to do is sort of run away with that too soon because we're involved in the conversations. We're involved in pilots and tests. We're involved in evolving technology where we can. And as we get sort of the magic formula, we'll be talking more about it, and then at that point, we'll be layering it into future guidance. But it's more right now for you to know that there's upside here, and we're working on it. And there'll be a moment when it comes to realization, and we're going to have a lot of talk more about it. Henry Chien : Okay, great. Sounds good. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Schwartz of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Steven Schwartz : Good afternoon everyone. Donald Slager : Hi there Steve. Steven Schwartz : If I could just continue on that question with respect to fuel recovery fees, looks like you, in your prepared remarks, noted a pretty significant sequential decline in fuel costs here in the first quarter. And I know that typically there's a lag between your recovery of increasing cost, which is certainly something that I think you faced over the past several quarters. So, as we look for 2019 and your cost versus those fees, can you give us some color there? Donald Slager : Well, let me start. Fuel recovery fee isn't -- I don't think is frankly much of a story by itself because the purpose of our fuel recovery fee is to create a fair and equitable vehicle to sort of de-risk the fuel that at some times in our history have been pretty volatile. It's somewhat of a built-in hedge against fuel prices. So, while it does go up and down and at times can play a little havoc with our margin because of a lag, net-net of that over the long-term, it doesn't really do much for us. It doesn't help us. It doesn't hurt us. It just sort of negates and offsets the volatility. That's the mindset. Chuck Serianni : Yes. And then what I would add to that is that we anticipate fuel fee up in 2019. And that's really due to a couple of things. One is the CNG tax credit. So if you think about that had -- providing for us in 2018 a $0.03 benefit in OpEx and then a $0.01 benefit of tax, so that goes away. And then also, we had some hedges in place during 2018 that ended up rolling off. So, because of that, we're expecting fuel to be a little bit higher in 2019 than it was in 2018. Steven Schwartz : Okay. So, in other words, that cost, you wouldn't expect any significant difference from the 25 basis points that you have built into your revenue guidance for fuel. Nicole Giandinoto : Yes, that's correct. I mean, if you think about it, the 25 basis points that the revenue goes up; you'd have a corresponding cost increase, maybe a little bit more because the CNG tax credit isn't tied to the fuel recovery fee. And that's the only disconnection you might have in there. Steven Schwartz : Okay. And then my second question, my follow-up is just, once again, an extension, I think, of the discussion that you had with Tyler on volume. Through 2018, essentially, your volume declined. So, from a comp standpoint, going through 2019, do you expect your volume to kind of play out through the quarters, I guess, in opposite or in mirror to what happened in 2018? Chuck Serianni : Yes, I would say that it would be relatively close to what happened in 2018. The only thing I would say that we would need to be cognizant of are some of the quarters where we had especially heavy special waste volumes and C&D volumes coming into our landfill. That could skew the numbers a little bit. Steven Schwartz : Got. Yes, yes, first quarter of 2018. Nicole Giandinoto : Exactly. Donald Slager : Yes. Steven Schwartz : Okay. Thank you. Donald Slager : I'll just add some color to that. We have a good outlook for growth this year and we've got a good handle on, again, our sales efforts with our good sales tools and a great sales team. We think we're winning our fair share of new business. And at the same time, we're going to maintain the discipline to walk away from some business. We do have some municipal contracts out there that, frankly, don't perform very well for us. We're the incumbent, so we know all the costs and we know all the pressures. And when we're the incumbent and we know that there's no profit or not a reasonable return in these things, we're going to probably walk away from some contracts. That's baked into that number, right? So, that's going to continue. That's no different than it was in 2018. So, you got to make sure you understand that. That's going on behind the scenes net of net. So, we're looking for our teams to either bring these contracts back around to profitability or move the equipment and the assets into utilization in other parts of the business. So, that's the guide we have. Steven Schwartz : Yes, okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just can you help me with the 30 to 50 basis points margin expansion in 2019? Is this backend-loaded? Is there -- how should we think about the quarterly cadence with still pretty tough recycling comps in the first quarter? Chuck Serianni : Yes, I would say that it's pretty well distributed throughout the entire year. You're right. We have a little bit of a headwind associated with the recycling in Q1. So, we need to keep that in mind, but other than that, I would say it's pretty well evenly spread. Michael Feniger : Okay. And then-- Nicole Giandinoto : Yes, Michael, so -- Michael, just to put a finer point on that, so you're exactly right, as Chuck mentioned, our most difficult commodity comp, we still have a little bit of the headwind in Q1 just because that was the highest priced quarter of last year. And then when you look forward, as Don talks about pricing, the pricing momentum will build as we go in and we renegotiate and we get more and more of our recycling municipal customers to agree to price increases. That will build. So, you do see a little bit. Think about Q3 as kind of our strongest quarter and that's kind of where you build up in expansion in Q3. And that's kind of how you can think about the distribution. Michael Feniger : Okay. That's helpful. And then did you say earlier in your comments that you had 10 basis points of margin expansion of solid waste in the quarter? Donald Slager : That's right. That's right. Michael Feniger : Yes. I'm just curious. I mean, if you're talking about shedding non-regrettable contracts, walking away from some of these resi contracts, which we know can be low margin, seeing the best pricing in 10 years and with the mix of the business, wouldn't we -- would we expect that number to be higher at this point of the cycle? Chuck Serianni : Yes, keep a couple of things in mind. One is that we had a headwind associated with special waste, right? And the other one is that we had -- as we had talked about, a little bit higher cost from our landfill operated. So, that's masking or diminishing that growth that we called out. Michael Feniger : Okay. And just lastly, that makes sense. On then on average yield, the 2.75%, like how much of that is just automatic from 2018, is just automatic from the CPI uplift? And how much of that is pushing on the open side? Chuck Serianni : Yes, about 10 to 15 basis points is coming off of CPI. Michael Feniger : Okay. Thanks guys. Chuck Serianni : You're welcome. Donald Slager : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Donald Slager : Thank you, Denise. In closing, I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment, and dedication to operational excellence, and of course, creating the Republic Way. Additionally, I'd encourage everyone listening to this call to take a few minutes and visit recyclingsimplified.com. It'd be good for everyone to learn how and what to recycle this very day. We all have an opportunity to do our part to create a cleaner and healthier environment. Thanks, everybody, for spending time with us today and be safe out there. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

Republic Services is traded on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RSG. All participants in today's call will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Nicole Giandinoto, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead. Nicole Giandinoto : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' first quarter 2019 conference call. Don Slager, our President and CEO; Jon Vander Ark, our COO; and Chuck Serianni, our CFO are joining me as we discuss our performance.

Finally, I'd like to point out that in our 8-K filing we've included the table that reflects changes in average yield and volume as a percentage of total revenue by line of business. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong start to the year. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which includes strengthening our market position, attracting and retaining the best people, enhancing the customer experience to increase willingness to pay, and leveraging our scale and technology to drive additional efficiencies in our business. As a result in the first quarter, both earnings and free cash flow are in line with our expectations. Through strong pricing, we were able to offset a $0.01 headwind from lower-than-anticipated recycle commodity prices. For the full year, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow guidance, assuming current economic conditions continue. The strong momentum in our business will enable us to offset the additional $0.06 headwind from lower-than-anticipated recycling commodity prices. In the first quarter, we continued our balanced approach to capital allocation to increase long-term shareholder value. We invested $86 million in acquisitions. We sustained this momentum into the second quarter and have invested an additional $56 million for a total of $142 million of investment to date. This puts us on track to outpace our original acquisition guidance of $200 million. We now expect to invest approximately $300 million for the full year. During the quarter, we also returned $233 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I'll now turn the call over to Jon to discuss our first quarter operating performance. Jon? Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Don. The pricing environment in the first quarter was strong. Total core price was 4.7% and average yield was 2.9% our highest pricing level in nearly a decade. We achieved this pricing, while also sustaining our all-time low customer defection rate below 7%. The progress we are making on key initiatives is contributing to our ability to increase prices and retain customers. First, we continue to focus on providing superior service to our customers and making it easier for them to do business with us. Next, we are successfully converting customers from CPI based pricing to a waste related index or fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and continue to run higher than CPI. To date, $685 million of our $2.5 billion book of business has been converted. Finally, we continue to discuss the true cost of recycling with our municipal collection customers as we renegotiate contracts. To date, we've secured price increases from approximately 21% of our municipal collection customers. In terms of dollars we have now reprised approximately 17% of our municipal recycling collection revenue. Turning to volume. As anticipated total volume in the first quarter decreased 1.5% versus the prior year. We faced several known volume headwinds in the quarter. These included a difficult special waste comp in the prior year, continued shedding of work performed on behalf of brokers and non-regrettable contract losses in the residential collection business. Excluding these items, underlying volume growth was 60 basis points and in line with our expectations. Next, our recycling processing and commodity sales revenue continued to experience downward pressure from further declines in recycled commodity prices. In the first quarter, our average recycled commodity price per ton decreased 17% to $93 down from $112 per ton in the prior year. Our April price per ton0 is estimated to be approximately $85. We continue to take action to transform recycling into a more durable economically sustainable business model and more importantly we are making progress and seeing results. Through the end of the first quarter we secured price increases on approximately 34% of our recycling processing business. Additionally, last year we rolled out an incremental recycling process charge to our open market collection customers to cover our increased costs. In the first quarter this contributed 35 basis points of pricing in addition to average yield. Combined, we achieved total pricing of 3.25%. These results demonstrate that our customers do value recycling and are willing to pay for the service. Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 28.3%. We saw good operating leverage in the business, particularly in maintenance and labor. Both of these costs as a percentage of revenue decreased versus the prior year. Our maintenance expense continues to benefit from our One Fleet standardized maintenance program and our labor expense is benefiting from our focus on process and routing efficiencies, as well as our efforts to attract and retain the best people. In the first quarter, our industry-leading turnover decreased versus the prior year. Given the tight labor market this is a true testament to the culture we are building here at Republic. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Chuck Serianni : Thanks Jon. First quarter revenue was approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $43 million or 1.8% over the prior year. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong pricing across our collection, disposal and recycling processing businesses. Adjusted EBITDA was $699 million, and adjusted free cash flow was $349 million, both in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 28.3% in line with our full year guidance of 28.3% to 28.5%. As expected EBITDA margin decreased 50 basis points versus the prior year due to known headwinds. These headwinds included the expiration of C&D tax credits and a decrease in high-margin special waste volume due to the anniversary of a large event-driven project. We also continued to maintain our strong liquidity position and leverage within our optimal range of two and a half to three times. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $8.5 billion of debt outstanding and $1.7 billion of additional borrowing capacity available under our credit facilities. Interest expense in the first quarter was $100 million and included $11 million of non-cash amortization. In the first quarter tax related expense was a $0.01 headwind relative to expectations. The headwind was primarily due to higher-than-anticipated non-cash charges of $12 million, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate of 25%. For the full year, we continue to expect non-cash charges of $60 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 24% consistent with our original guidance. Finally, as Don mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.23 to $3.28 and our adjusted free cash flow guidance of $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion, despite a $0.07 headwind from lower-than-anticipated recycled commodity prices. For purposes of reaffirming guidance, we've assumed recycled commodity prices remain at current levels for the remainder of the year. At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question today will be from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hi. Good afternoon. Don Slager : Hi, Tyler. Good afternoon. Tyler Brown : Hey, Congrats on the 2.9% yield. It seems like the acceleration was maybe a little faster than we were expecting. I was just curious if you could talk about a couple of things or initiatives that kind of allowed you to get to that 3% range so quickly. And just as a point of clarification, the 2.9% yield, is that exclusive of the 35 basis point yield held from the processing fee? Don Slager : Yes. Tyler, its Don. It's a great catch, yes. The 2.9% excludes RPC. And so again, a great quarter in pricing. It underpins a couple of things. One, strong economy. As we've always said, when there's good organic growth in the market, pricing is better. Certainly, that's one thing. Two, our tools, the team now has been using our capture tools and our -- a part of the selling message now for a couple of years, when Jon introduced those a couple of years ago, so those are well underway. Overall, rational backdrop competitively. We're really focused besides the RPC on recycling, we're really focused on extending contracts and changing contracts in and around recycling and Jon mentioned a lot of that in his prepared remarks. So it's a good backdrop. It's a good economic backdrop and we expect that to continue. Tyler Brown : Okay. Very helpful. And then Chuck, I don't want to be super nitpicky here, but why is there such a large adjustment to free cash this quarter? I mean, it looks like there's maybe a $90 million adjustment versus say $30 million last year. I mean, normally, it's not a huge number, but this quarter really stood out. What was going on there? Chuck Serianni : Yes. Adjustment to free cash flow, you're talking about in the non-GAAP, correct? Tyler Brown : Yes. Chuck Serianni : Yes, I've got to take a look at it Tyler. Tyler Brown : Maybe -- yes. Nicole Giandinoto : Tyler, well, I think what you're -- I don't know if this is what you're looking at, because I don't see a huge adjustment going from cash flow to adjusted free cash flow, but perhaps in the CapEx line you're seeing\u2026 Tyler Brown : Yes, that's exactly where it is Nicole. Yes, you're right there. Nicole Giandinoto : Yes. That is just the timing of payments. So, basically, when we manage CapEx, we manage it on CapEx received, because that's easy for our business to understand. We budget that way. That's how we think about it. And then -- so basically, what happens is we took receipt of a lot of equipment, and then those will be paid in the next quarter. So you'll see it as a cash outflow in the statement cash flow in Q2. Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Chuck Serianni : And then look\u2026 Tyler Brown : Yes, sorry. Chuck Serianni : Yeah, I was just going to say, it has -- it just has to do with the timing of the receipt of the trucks and this is adjustment that we make is no different than the adjustment that we make every quarter. Tyler Brown : Okay. And then likewise why are you adding back this $12 million loss from unconsolidated equity method investments? I mean, it looks like it's below the line in the P&L. It's just -- I'm just curious on that as well. Nicole Giandinoto : So Tyler, we -- the loss on unconsolidated equity method is really a tax-related item. So if you're looking at EBITDA, you want to add that back. Plus it is non-cash, so you want to add that back and when you adjust that free cash flow, you subtract down for cash taxes. Tyler Brown : Okay. Nicole Giandinoto : We're really actually paying the tax liability. Tyler Brown : Okay. That is helpful. And then just lastly, maybe as we think about the EBITDA margins. So I think they were down maybe 50 basis points, but that's actually a bit better than we were expecting. But Chuck, I was wondering if you could quantify some of those big moving items such as the CNG tax credit, maybe recycling, maybe special waste. Chuck Serianni : Yes. So the CNG tax credit was negative 60 basis points. At special waste, we talked about that. That was a negative 50 basis points. But then we had 60 basis points positive from just the solid waste business. The interesting thing here is that the recycling processing and sale of materials that was flat year-over-year, so that speaks to all of the efforts that we've put into place not just last year, but the efforts that continued here in Q1. Tyler Brown : Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks. Don Slager : Thanks Tyler. Operator : The next question will be from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Hey good afternoon and thanks for the breakout in the filing of yield and volume trends by line of business. And just looking at that really strong volume in MSW again 6.5%. Maybe you can comment on any specific pockets of strength what you're seeing there? Don Slager : Go ahead Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We think it's broad -- it's broad-based. It's no individual side. It's not onetime events. We're getting some third-party volume that we didn't get last year. And we're seeing strong growth from current customers, so very positive turn. Don Slager : Yes. I think overall again across the board nationally and as we've always pointed out right, when special waste is strong, when C&D is strong. That's just a continued good positive outlook for us for the economy. Noah Kaye : Okay. Turning to M&A, you just -- the good activity so far in the year expectations for a higher spend than you guided. Can you just talk about kind of the factors behind that? Because obviously we've heard from some of the peers today, you're not alone that there is more spending across the board. But just what kind of environment are you seeing for deal activity that is making you go forward? And I assume your spending is still primarily weighted to tuck-ins, but just if you could clarify kind of the mix of your pipeline. Don Slager : Sure. So one, we've always said that deal flow can be a little lumpy, right? It really depends on where these businesses are in their business life cycle. So if they have accummed larger deals that can drive the number here and there. We're seeing now for a number of quarters that the pipeline is robust and this is just sort of proof positive that it remains robust. We've had a couple of deals here lately that were maybe a little larger than our average. That's helping drive that. But we still have -- having spent almost $150 million year-to-date, we think we'll obviously -- we think we'll do $300 million for the full year. And that could go up a little bit depending on sort of timing right? So we are well positioned with our team. We've got great relationships with sellers. And there are just frankly a lot of really attractive companies right now who are coming to a place in their life cycle who are thinking about monetizing their life's work et cetera et cetera. So we don't force deals. We don't do bad deals. We don't chase deals. We're looking still at companies that have a really high-quality revenue base, meaning a large percentage of reoccurring revenue, revenue under contract, small container business, permanent contractor roll-up business. We've been very selective and hats off to the deal team to our development group. And I think it's just that we're in a good place in time where maybe generationally people need self updates. I don't think there's any one driver we've seen that's tax related or anything like that. We're going to continue to -- to consolidate the business. That's how we've built Republic. We'll continue to be in the hunt for good deals. Noah Kaye : Yes. That makes sense. If I could just sneak one related on, the potential obviously for divestitures out of the WMA -- the WMA merger, I mean who knows how large that is, but if you could just talk about what you see as maybe the opportunity there. It will obviously be a new source of targets and kind of how you see the overlap or potential fit with your footprint. Don Slager : Well sure. I'll leave it to the team of the big green company to determine what they think they're going to have to put up for sale based on the divestiture or markets don't fit or whatever issued by the DOJ. We will be glad to be looking at opportunity there if there is any. We'll be looking at opportunity that could fit into our markets. Again, you've read all the deal points. So again, we will look for good opportunity to buy good companies, good cash flow at the right multiple and at the right return. So -- our general stance in this business is we look at everything and then we -- we're very intentional about what we go forward on. Noah Kaye : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question will be from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : Hi. Good afternoon. My first question is just on MSW landfill pricing. Maybe if you could comment whether you think there's more opportunity there. It seems like the 3% number on pretty strong volume is much higher than you've seen in the last couple of quarters. I think your largest competitor had a similar MSW landfill number on pricing. Is this the beginning of investors beginning to -- see landfill pricing, beginning to see more momentum than we've seen historically? Don Slager : Well let me start. I'll let Jon give you some color. You have heard me say many times that -- these landfills are very expensive to own. They're very difficult to develop. You own them in the perpetuity. Every single time -- we bury someone's ton of waste, we're taking the risk, if you will and owning it and selling that real estate forever. These assets are nearly impossible to replicate and I have been very vocal about the fact that they frankly have not held up their end of pricing in the marketplace over the past several years. We're certainly evaluating the costs of running landfill. We have some higher costs related to leachate that we have to pass-through to customers. I think part of that is what you're seeing. And I think I'd like to believe what you said Hamzah that this is the beginning of land to landfill and the infrastructure -- finally getting some traction on price that it deserves and frankly needs to offset some of the future of costs related to owning people's waste forever and ever. Jon, what do you think? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. I think, we've been exhibiting a lot of price leadership on this for a long time. And I can tell you we're looking at every ton that comes into every one of our landfills and understanding what is the true cost of that and ensuring that we are getting a fair return to Don's point for taking up that real estate forever and you'll continue to see I think a positive trend in that direction. Hamzah Mazari : Good. Got it. And then just on your adjusted volume number of 60 bps. It seems like that there's a massive disparity with your largest competitor that reported 3% adjusted. I mean if you go back historically the volume differential on an apples-to-apples clean number adjusting for comps is pretty big. They talked about technology investments and customer emphasis driving that. I'm just curious is it just asset footprint? Are you just earlier in your technology spend? Or are you just sort of walking away from more business? Just any thoughts as to -- what are your thoughts on the volume side? Can you drive more volume? Or is this just sort of your focus is elsewhere or maybe the technology spend, maybe gets better and drives more volume? Chuck Serianni : Yes. So a couple of things I'd point to you Hamzah. The first thing is that the 60 basis points is muted by the fact that we had one less work day. So if you include that in the mix and the volume growth is usually 1.1%. So more consistent -- with our historic average. The other thing I would point to you, if you look at the temporary large container business, the volumes there were muted also but that's because we took this as an opportunity to further price those volumes. We felt like there was more pricing available in that line of business. And obviously, we were able to achieve that with price of 4.2%. So we always see this price/volume as a balance and we've always had a very balanced approach to price/volume as you're well aware of. And we'll continue to maintain that balanced approach going into the future. Don Slager : Yes, Hamzah look, we're digging deep into the recycling book of business. We are raising prices effectively. We're also going to be walking away from some business here and there. This task can be kind of lumpy when you lose a large RISI contract or something that is meeting returns. Winning and losing a national account can have a big impact. As Chuck said we always try to find this right balance with price and volume and where is the price elasticity. We would tell you, we think we're getting generally speaking our fair share of growth and it will kind of ebb and flow a little bit with mix, but I would read more into that if I were you. Hamzah Mazari : Yes, got you. Just last question. I'll turn it over. I'm just trying to understand sort of Republic's strategy on large acquisitions. Progressive Waste Republic didn't participate. ADSW Republic didn't participate. Is it just sort of DOJ issues? Is it valuation? Is it that the board just wants 100% return of cash and no leverage? Just any sort of big picture thoughts on how we should view that? Don Slager : Okay, let me start with this and you heard me say it probably many times, but in almost every situation there's a natural buyer, right? So when you have a willing seller, there tends to be a natural buyer. There\u2019s certain things that fit better with other companies. It might be somebody has a leg up in more landfill internalization. It might be complementary, other infrastructure or the need to pay a little bit more for a permit that you couldn't get on your own or landfill space you couldn't achieve or develop. All those things kind of weigh into our situation. I would tell you, I think we're getting the deals we want. You brought up Progressive. I mean, there was a clear-case financial buyer there because of the inversion that was able to take place. We would not have been able to do an inversion in that situation because of our size. And so if we were to got down to an absolute auction and that deal going to the highest bidder, I think frankly the same company that bought, it would have bought it because of the advantage and the inversion. So those are just real facts. We look at everything I said a minute ago, so you can take that comment and then imagine that we also look at ADS and some really good assets, good leadership team, some really interesting things there. It may just come down to in the end a better fit for the current company that is engaged in bringing that deal together. So I don't have anything bad to say about the assets of the business. I would focus back to the fact that we are going to put $300 million to work this year where we've got a full pipeline and we are looking at deals and we're going to continue to drive value for shareholders through a balanced approach of cash allocation. And that's a combination of buying good cash flow at the right multiple, i.e. acquisitions, developing current assets, expanding landfills, developing -- spending CapEx on our current fleet and technology as well as the obvious buying back our stock at the right price and dividend. And our dividend CAGR has been a very consistent 8% over the last several years. So we factor all that in and that's what I can tell you. I think we've got great opportunity ahead of us to continue to consolidate our fair share of this business and you'll see us do that. And into another question, there's an opportunity to pick up some pieces that don't fit or are mandated divestitures in this process will -- we certainly think will be at the table there as well. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi, good afternoon. Don Slager : Hi, Brian. Brian Maguire : I just wanted to make sure I understood some of the components in the reiterated guidance as it relates to recycling and a couple of other things. It sounds like the impact from lower recycled prices is going to be about a $0.07 headwind and you incurred $0.01 in the first quarter and you've got $0.06 still out in front of you. And if that's the case, just trying to understand what the offsets are to keep the guidance unchanged. I think it sounds like the upside M&A is a partial contributor to that. But then will the balance of that just be a more favorable outlook in the core business essentially? Don Slager : Well, it's not really M&A because frankly the cost of integration sort of tends to outweigh the benefit of integration in the first six to eight months. So, the upside of M&A really isn't going to make us get a lot of benefit this year. It really drives a ton of benefit next year when we get the rollover from that. It really is more the underlying strength of the business. Its cost as Jon said. Jon leads the operating core of the business. He and his team has done a great job on labor costs, on maintenance, on labor efficiency productivity. He said turnovers kicked down a couple of points here. That speaks to an opportunity that will continue through the year. Pricing strength, all the work that Jon mentioned in and around recycling itself right? So, the headwind is coming from recycling but we got busy. I would tell you that Republic was sort of the tip of the spear in the marketplace when it came to attacking the recycling issue, so we've got rollover benefits from what we did last year. And Jon and the team and the sales organization have gone -- have turned right run right into the fight this year on. So, Jon you want to talk about a couple of things you're doing this year that are going to offset? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. So, on recycling we had $12 million of pricing actions our annualized pricing actions in the first quarter built off the back of $55 million last year and we're not stopping. We are literally going through all 1,100 of our municipal recycling contracts and we are asking for a fair model right? That one that has -- shares the risk and the volatility and that we get paid a fair return for what we do. And some customers say no at first and that's not stopping us. We're continuing to have that dialogue. And just like what we've done over time in the alternative index, we will make progress over time as we continue to represent the case because the facts are on our side. All we're asking is for a fair model and to be an environmental partner with us over time. Brian Maguire : Okay, that's clear. It makes sense. Just wanted to come back to the question on sort of volume and the different moving pieces in there. So, they're down 15. It sounds like 50 bps of that is just the calendar, so it's probably down one as a better representation there. I'm just wondering if you could break out the components to that as far as the special waste comp the intentional shedding of business and any weather-related impact that you maybe saw in there. Don Slager : Yes, let me start with this and Chuck you can spread the numbers out. The business the solid waste business grows with population growth that drives housing formation that drives business formation. That is still the reality of where solid waste generation comes from. So, good ongoing economics job growth, wage growth all the rest they are good for volume growth. But the general reality is that volume is going to grow 1% to 2%. You might have a few periods of time where you can push it to 2.5% or 3%, but I will tell you that if you're thinking a 3% volume growth is sustainable, you're probably giving up price, right? And so you're probably growing your business with some big chunks of volume that may not be able to sustain price long term and that's our view. And so we don't spend a lot of time chasing trophy accounts that have low margin. We don't -- while we have a nice little national accounts portfolio they are sort of a mid-sized national accounts and not these mega accounts that frankly never give you pricing leverage or opportunity to expanding your margins that's why. So, we're going to generally live kind of in that 1% to 2% volume growth ebbing and flowing with the economy. And when Chuck gets -- nets it all out there for you in a minute you're going to see that we're kind of right in that 1% to 2% volume growth which is kind of the sweet spot and getting pricing and getting customers who will accept pricing in the future because the fact is nobody in this business can offset inflation through efficiencies alone. I mean people are better according their businesses in that. So, again that's the real scoop. That's frankly what you should be putting in your model. Chuck? Chuck Serianni : Yes, so, we talked about total volume decline of 1.5%. Like we said the 0.5 point -- 50 basis point of that is the work day. But then you've got 210 basis points associated with special waste and non-regrettable losses. So you net all that out, then you can see that we did have good growth in line with our historical average on the volume side. Brian Maguire : And so, does it sounds like much impact from weather that you guys saw? Chuck Serianni : No. It was -- the impact from weather was pretty minor. Maybe it was 10 basis points, but it looks pretty minor. Brian Maguire : Okay. And last one, just kind of related. Will the one fewer work day sort of reverse out in the third quarter, or some time later in the year? Chuck Serianni : Yes, it reverses in the third quarter. Brian Maguire : Okay. That\u2019s what I thought. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question will be from Sean Eastman of Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. The first question is just on recycling. It's great to see such great things happening in the core business and helping to offset some of those headwinds there. But just in light of all these price actions and continuing those dialogues through the year, is there -- relative to what's in the annual filing from 2018, is there an updated sensitivity we should be thinking about as it relates to potential further moves in that recycling commodity price basket? Chuck Serianni : No. We're still at $0.04 of EPS impact for $10 decline in our basket of commodities and that's an annualized number. But as we continue to make progress on all the various initiatives associated with recycling, our expectation is that sensitivity will go down. Sean Eastman : Okay. That makes sense. And then, it's great to see the leverage on the maintenance and labor lines. I just wondered, how much more juice we have there on that leverage and that One Fleet program and some of the labor programs? What inning are we in terms of driving those efficiencies and still seeing that into the future? Don Slager : Well, again, I'll start and I'll let Jon give you a little bit of color. Look, we're -- as he said in his remarks, we're seeing the benefits of the One Fleet initiative. We are kind of past One Fleet 1.0 and we're moving into the sort of next phase of really using all the data we have and understanding what the real life cycle of the fleet. Jon's got some great ideas. Look, what I always tell you guys is, there's way more going on here than we talk about, right because there's a lot of good technology we're working on, there's a lot of sort of phase two and three things up our sleeves. We tend not to talk to you about them until we're ready to put them in a model, ready to put them in the guide. But Jon, can you give a little bit of color? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. On maintenance costs, we're fighting underlying inflation of parts cost on an increasingly sophisticated vehicles, so we're doing a great job of maintaining that on the maintenance side. On the labor cost side, we're going through routing efficiencies, using technology and certainly it's technology customer of our vehicles, but lots of initiatives lots of effort underway there to understand it. We want to service, but first of all we want to be safe. We want to service the customer and pick them up every time, but then we want to do that efficiently. And lots of efforts underway to figure out how we do that, and showing some real progress in fleet market. Sean Eastman : Okay. Thanks. Then the last one for me. This could be totally not material, but I just keep seeing headlines on this Rainbow business you guys own. Something about some potential turnover in that one of their big contracts and then also some class-action suit around that purchase. So just wondering is there anything there or just noise? Don Slager : Well, here's the thing, right? One of the great things about owning a portfolio, right, is that it ebbs and flows, right? And so one economy, one market may be booming or another may be dragging. Weather might be 50 degrees below in Chicago, but the sun is shining in Florida. It's the same as it relates to the sort of the lumpiness of business. We have several hundred million dollars a year of municipal contracts that come to term and we have to renegotiate. In the midst of all that, there are certain political issues and so on and so on and so forth. We've built this business through acquisitions. And when you buy companies, you have to sort of work out sort of some legacy issues and part of that is we're going through. What we don't do is, we don't, on this call or in any time, speaks specifically to any one contract or any one issue, because we've got this portfolio. I would tell you this, these kind of things really are no different than the kind of things we dealt with last year or the year before that or 20 years ago, right? It's just part of what we do for a living. And so we do win some we do lose along the way, but overall the strength of the portfolio and the mix carries today. So we're working around the clock with a lot of customers right now to find new solutions overcome recycling issues and deal with some of the legacy stuff that just sometimes we inherit along the way. So that's all I'm giving you on that one. Sean Eastman : I appreciate it. Understood. Thanks very much for the time. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Feniger of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Yeah. Thanks guys for taking my question. I may have missed this. Why is \u2013 I know it's just one quarter but why is cash from ops down year-over-year? Chuck Serianni : Yeah. It's really just a timing issue, Michael. We \u2013 it's the timing of maybe the timing of working capital and including the timing of CapEx. Once again for the entire year we're right on our guidance in terms of our free cash flow. Michael Feniger : Sounds good. And Chuck is there any reason why margins should not sequentially step up in Q2 and Q3? Chuck Serianni : Yes. We're expecting that margins to continue to increase obviously over the course of the rest of the year. And that's right in line with our guidance of up 30 to 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Michael Feniger : Got it. And then \u2013 did you \u2013 or was there any change in trend in April? Did you actually see underlying volumes potentially maybe pick up as we started Q2? And on the opportunity you mentioned on the temp business where you're pushing price, did you still see that momentum where you reported a really strong open price number. I mean, is there any reason why that number should decelerate from here? Don Slager : Well, I'll take the first half and then I'll let Jon talk about what's going on in temp volume. What was the first part of the question? Nicole Giandinoto : What we've seen in April. Don Slager : Oh, April volume. Yeah, so we're not really talking about April right? We're talking about Q1. Look, when we reaffirmed guidance, right? We are reaffirming guidance based on all the underlying great work that the team's done in the quarter. Certainly, we're taking it into consideration what we're seeing in April, but we don't generally give commentary on it other than we want to give you a little bit of color in and around what we've closed to date on the M&A front. But the real time for us when we're talking about seasonality is May. We've got to kind of get May in the books for us to really just kind of compare year-over-year seasonality. But by the very fact that we are reaffirming guidance with such confidence, I think would tell you that we feel really good about what we're seeing in the business on this very day. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. I would just say from the underlying demand, we see strong demand in large \u2013 across most of our markets. And we have the tools to look at the price/volume trade-off and try to make those on a daily basis, and again as we see demand come in and we make those trade-offs. And really we're looking at maximizing return on our assets. We're not looking to buy more assets to take low-margin work. Michael Feniger : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hey, gang. Thanks for taking the questions. Nice Q. Don Slager : Thanks, Michael. Chuck Serianni : Thanks, Michael. Michael Hoffman : The $142 million spend what did you get for it in revenues? Chuck Serianni : So in total that's about $55 million in annualized revenue Michael. Michael Hoffman : And how do I think about the margin of that? Chuck Serianni : It's kind of \u2013 I would say that it's probably just a little bit higher than the company average. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That helps. Nicole Giandinoto : But again, Michael just to put a comment on that. As Jon mentioned, sometimes there's a little bit of implementation and integration costs upfront, so we'll grow into that margin that Chuck mentioned, but it's not right out of the gate accretive overall to the company margin. Michael Hoffman : Yeah. No, I got it. It just helps to do the modeling. And then back on this whole volume question everybody wants to focus on. I mean I would think all day long, you would take lots of price and very little volume, because you get so much more leverage. But more importantly, if I look at the data you did give us, and if I remember correctly your landfill business is predominantly -- the third party volume is predominantly municipal contracts. So to get a 0.3% price and 6.5% volume from that one the pricing is pretty powerful because it's indexed business, so you've driven a lot of leverage there. But volume is huge telling you the underlying kind of economy is just in great shape. Am I correct? Don Slager : Yeah. On top of that, and somebody else on the call brought up, is landfill pricing is starting to get traction, because it's been a little bit flattish more than maybe you would expect with the consolidation. So I think that's really the good news. But you're right we don't have a lot of third party volume that makes up a big percentage. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. I'd also say Mike you're seeing the fruits of our efforts around purchasing CPI come up. So its contracts and the fruit of our alternative index work. We didn't just work on municipal collection contracts. We certainly worked on MSW contracts as well. Michael Hoffman : Right. So.., Don Slager : On your earlier point, right? I mean every time we dig our profitability by customer, by call, by route, by point of business, right? And you're right I mean that each one of these things has to carry its own weight. And we're going to continue to work through the business the way we've always had. Just talking about landfill, I mean we're slicing and dicing every stream. Jon mentioned it earlier, at the landfill and making sure that everything carries the appropriate return. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That helps. And then Chuck, when you gave -- earlier you said CNG is a negative 60 and special waste is negative 50. That wasn't at the EBITDA line. But does that just -- if I step that up to gross OpEx, that's just a straight carry through because those are all operating related? Chuck Serianni : Yes, they are Michael. That's right. Michael Hoffman : So when I look at 61 versus 60.5, that's the waterfall I'm building? Okay. Chuck Serianni : Yeah, that's right. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then directionally on gross margin, I know you don't give this, but can you talk about the trend of the three sort of major lines of business solid waste, recycling E&P year-over-year? Directionally, what was happening in the trend in the gross margin? Chuck Serianni : Yeah. The gross margins are all trending positive, Michael. And you would think that that would be the case right? We're once again working back into the guidance that we gave for EBITDA margin expansion, 30 to 50 basis points for the year. Michael Hoffman : So on all three businesses, its positive even recycling? I have a thought recycling might have been flat. Chuck Serianni : Yeah, but it went slightly positive. But keep in mind, all of the initiatives that we've put into place, once again back in the 2018 and here again in 2019. So we are starting to see the benefits associated with those initiatives. And that's once again why we were able to offset the recycling and processing headwind here in Q1. Don Slager : If you think about that in context of what we've accomplished so far in the getting this headwind from recycling if you will, and think about how the benefits of that will roll into next year. Let's just say let's just hope for a minute that commodity prices stay where they are and don't get worse. Let's hope for a minute that these other mills come online in the U.S. and that has a positive impact. Let's hope for a minute that our long-term view of recycling holds up, right? That population growth and emerging economies and middle-class and all blah, blah, blah is all going to be right. And we've already offset sort of the current headwind. If we combine all the efforts that the team has put into place, it really sets us up pretty well for next year as well right, as these things anniversary and we just build on the momentum and as we shift the model. And again the operating leaders Jon, and the sales organization is doing a great job, and customers one by one by one are coming to the realization of what has happened here. Wouldn't you say, Jon? Jon Vander Ark : Absolutely. Michael Hoffman : Right. So let me follow on with that. If you took the current run rate of revenues on an $85 commodity book, what should the profitability of that be in an absolute dollar opportunity? Don Slager : How about this? How about we stick with Q1? And how about we stick with our guidance for 2019, Michael? We're going to meet our guidance. We're going to meet our cash flow guidance, and we're going to be, if not one of the leaders, the leader in turning this recycling business around and making it sustainable for customers, we being a great environmental partner. And as we get more and more traction through the year, we'll be talking in October about how it sets us up for 2020, but it will be a good story. Michael Hoffman : Well, okay, fair enough. It was much of a higher-level question of, it's a big number when you fix this, some it might take two or three years, but it's a big number. Don Slager : It's a big number. It will be fixed. The underlying issue is customers want to do this. We'll just have to help them do it right. Michael Hoffman : Right. Don Slager : And it's going to be good story -- and it will be a good growth story for Republic Services. Michael Hoffman : Right. Last question Chuck. Your cash flow from operations was 22% of revenues, which is terrific in the context of the expectation for the year. So maybe the dollars are down, but the percent of revenue is a very good number. Chuck Serianni : Yes, that's right, Michael. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Yeah, all right. Okay. Nicole Giandinoto : And Michael just to add a point for your model. So if you look at the CapEx spend in Q1 relative to our capital guide, it was less than 20% for our full year guide. So Q1 is a really strong cash flow quarter for us and that might trickle down a little bit for the remainder of the year and as this kind of timing goes through the year. Michael Hoffman : Got it. Thanks very much. Don Slager : Thanks Michael. Operator : The next question will be from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Henry Chien : Hi, guys. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Thanks for squeezing me in. I have a follow-up question on your M&A plans and just the additional capital. I'm just curious if the type of deals that you're looking at if it's still in terms of the tuck-insurance, if it's still for the solid waste business or you're considering anything adjacent to that. Don Slager : Okay. Well, look the majority of our spend is always solid waste. The majority is frankly leans toward collection by definition tuck-in. There aren't -- frankly, we're pretty well situated with infrastructure throughout the company or countries so we're not spending a lot of dollars just to work in these last several years on infrastructure. But when we do obviously that brings -- the prices they go up just a little bit. But tuck-ins by their very nature are in our core space and in our current geographies. We have had a little good fortune in some good opportunities that are in adjacent geographies, but in the solid waste core space so that is another place that we do grow and intend to grow. But that's where we're spending most of our time. We've got some good opportunities in and around the E&P space. We'll continue to look at those. That's a good business for us, high-margin business for us. But again for a long, long time, we'll be making most of what we make here out of running a solid waste business very well and that's where most of this is coming from today. Henry Chien : Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Don Slager : Thank you so much Denise. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our first quarter performance. Solid waste fundamentals remain strong in the current economic backdrop is supportive of continued growth. Given our team's relentless focus on operational execution and the passion they have for our customers, we are reaffirming our full year financial guidance. Finally, I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to the men and women of Republic Services. As a result of their collective efforts, we remain to the world's Most Ethical Companies list by Ethisphere for the third year in a row, as well as Barron's 100 Most Sustainable U.S. Companies list for the second consecutive year.

Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased with our second quarter results, which clearly demonstrate the underlying strength of our business. During the quarter, we successfully priced in excess of our cost inflation, achieved EBITDA margin expansion of 50 basis points, and increased earnings per share by 8%. We expect the strong momentum in the first-half of the year to continue. As a result, we are reaffirming our original full-year EPS and free cash flow guidance provided, in February, despite continued declines in recycled commodity prices.During the second quarter commodity markets continued to be challenged. We overcame these headwinds by focusing our efforts on things we can control, in particular, transitioning to a more durable, economically sustainable recycling business model. As you'll hear from Jon, we are making good progress and seeing results. For example, the revenue and EBITDA impact of lower recycled commodity prices in the second quarter was $8 million. Because of the team's relentless efforts we overcame this headwind and increased recycling revenue 6% versus the prior year. In the second quarter, we invested $129 million in acquisitions to further enhance our leading market position and drive growth in free cash flow.Our currency pipeline continues to be strong. As a result, we now expect to invest approximately $550 million in acquisitions this year. We estimate these acquisitions net of divestitures will provide 125 to 150 basis points of top line revenue growth in 2019. During the quarter, we also continued our balanced approach of returning cash to shareholders. We returned $213 million through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, our Board approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend, in line with our 10-year dividend CAGR. The consistent growth in the dividend demonstrates the stability and predictability of our cash flow as well as our confidence in the future cash flow generation capabilities of our business.Through the consistent execution of our profitable growth through differentiation strategy, we have created a solid foundation for our business. We are leveraging this foundation to deliver results and increased long-term shareholder value. Our second quarter results clearly demonstrate this. Next, turning to our people, in recent years our efforts to create an environment that attracts and retains the best talent have been recognized by reputable third parties such as Barron's, EpiSphere, and Glassdoor. Most recently, Republic Services was named to Forbes List of Best Employers for Women. I'd like to thank our team for their relentless efforts to create a more inclusive culture and an environment in which all individuals feel welcomed and valued.Finally, we believe as we grow the business so does our potential to drive change and positively impact the environment and society overall. We know we can do more, and are raising the bar through our latest long-term sustainability goals which we announced last week. Through the pursuit and achievement of these goals we will further enhance the foundation of our business and continue to create long-term value for our employees, our customers, communities, and shareholders.I'll now turn the call over to Jon to discuss our second quarter operating performance. Jon? Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Don. The pricing environment in the second quarter remained strong. Total core price was 4.6%, and average yield was 2.8%. Core price included open market pricing of 5.5%, and restricted pricing of 3.1%. Our pricing continues to benefit from the use of our tablet-based pricing tool. Through this tool we are monitoring price elasticity and adjusting accordingly.Additionally, we are benefiting from the advancement of several other strategic initiatives. First, we continue to successfully convert customers from CPI-based pricing to a waste-related index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and continue to run higher than CPI. We have now converted $715 million or 29% of our $2.5 billion CPI-based book of business.Next, we regularly reassess our landfill pricing to ensure we are covering the total lifetime cost of managing the ways to accept. Third, we are proactively renegotiating our municipal recycling collection contracts. We are ensuring they reflect the true costs of recycling and include a more equitable risk sharing arrangement. We've now secured price increases from approximately 29% of our municipal recycling customers up from 21% in the first quarter and finally, we're increasing our customer's willingness to pay by providing superior service and leveraging technology to make it easier for them to do business with us.Turning to volume, total volume in the second quarter increased 10 basis points versus the prior year. Underlying volume growth was 80 basis points after normalizing the impact of intentionally shutting certain volumes. This included work performed on behalf of brokers and non-regrettable contract losses in residential collection business.During the quarter, recycled commodity prices continue to decline. Our average price per ton decreased 14% to $78 versus $91 in the prior year. This resulted in an approximately $8 million or $0.02 headwind versus the prior year. We offset the impact of lower commodity prices through additional pricing and increased recycling revenue in the second quarter by 6% versus the prior year. Our ability to increase revenue and overcome these headwinds demonstrates that we are transforming the recycling business into a more durable economically sustainable business model.In our recycling processing business, we have now secured price increases on approximately 55% of our contracted volumes up from 34% in the first quarter. In our collections business as I mentioned earlier, we continue to proactively secure price increases and renegotiate our municipal contracts. Additionally in the collection open market, our recycling processing charge is enabling us to recover our processing costs and minimize volatility from changes in recycle commodity prices.This change contributed to -\u2013 this charge contributed an additional 40 basis points of pricing not reflected in average yield. If included average yield would have been 3.2%. These results demonstrate that our customers do value recycling and are willing to pay for the service. Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 27.9% and expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year. Strong pricing and solid cost controls enabled us to more than offset a 20 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. We saw good operating leverage in both labor and maintenance again this quarter. Both of these costs as a percentage of revenue decreased versus the prior period.Labor expenses benefiting from our focus on process and running efficiencies as well as our efforts to increase employee engagement; turnover decrease versus the prior year for the second quarter in a row. Maintenance expense continues to benefit from our One Fleet standardized maintenance program. Today, approximately 90% of our work orders are scheduled. This enables us to take the reliability of our fleet to the next level and further improve our already high customer service delivery rate of 99.9%. By providing even better service to our customers, we can further enhance customer loyalty and increase willingness to pay.With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Chuck Serianni : Thanks, Jon. Second quarter revenue was approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of $88 million or 3.5% over the prior year. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong pricing across our collection, disposal and recycling processing businesses. Our revenue growth came in at an incremental EBITDA margin of over 40%.SG&A expense as a percentage of total revenue was 10.1%. For the full-year, we continue to expect SG&A expense to be approximately 10.4% of revenue. During the quarter, we grew EBITDA dollars by 5% versus the prior year and expanded EBITDA margins by 50 basis points.For the full-year, we continue to expect approximately 30 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in line with our original guidance. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $621 million, and in line with our expectations. Cash flow generation in the first-half of the year positions us well to achieve our original full-year guidance. At the end of the quarter, leverage was three times, and within our optimal range of 2.5 to 3 times. Interest expense in the second quarter was $99 million, and included $12 million of non-cash amortization.In the second quarter, relative to our expectations, cash related expense was favorable by $0.01. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, and provided a $0.04 benefit. This was partially offset by a $0.03 cash related headwind from a non-cash charge of $12 million. For the full-year, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 23%, 100 basis points lower than our original guidance, and a non-cash charge of approximately $60 million, which is consistent with our original guidance. Finally, as Don mentioned, we are reaffirming our original full-year financial guidance provided in February, which included EPS of $3.23 to $3.28, and free cash flow of $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion.We're assuming current economic conditions continue and recycled commodity prices remain at current levels of approximately $75 per ton for the remainder of the year. Relative to our original guidance, the decline in recycled commodity prices has created a headwind of approximately $50 million or $0.11 of earnings. We're offsetting these commodity headwinds primarily through strong pricing and solid cost management.At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon guys. Don Slager : Hi, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey, nice quarter. But Chuck, so I don\u2019t want to dwell on the guidance too much, but it seems like there's quite a bit of movement here. So like if we look at this from a high level, and let's say we started at the midpoint of 326, you're going to reduce that by some recycling prices, you add back some from incremental M&A, maybe you take away some because you're doing less of a buyback because of that M&A. And then maybe you're getting a few pennies back on the tax rate, but basically is that -- are those the moving pieces, and if I do all of that math is there really any change in the core trends is really my question? Chuck Serianni : Yes, I think you got the component pieces, Tyler. I mean, you talked about the commodities being a little bit more of a headwind than we had originally anticipated. We continue to do good work in terms of recycling processing charges and improvements there. Certainly cost control has been a good story for us. The other thing is pricing. And pricing is coming in a little bit stronger than we had originally guided to. And we believe right now that that's going to continue for the rest of the year. Tyler Brown : Okay. And then on the M&A side though, it sounds like you're raising the expectations there, that's correct, right? Chuck Serianni : That's correct. Tyler Brown : So that would be a positive. And then maybe you're taking some of the capital from buybacks to the M&A, is that correct? Chuck Serianni : That's also correct. Tyler Brown : Okay, so -- Chuck Serianni : And as you know, Tyler, and as we've said to you before especially when you're doing midyear type acquisitions you spend a little bit of money to get things integrated, so there's not a ton of bottom line benefit in the first year, but great rollover benefit in the next year, but there'll be some benefit, and as we said in the comments, surely going to drive some top line revenue growth from that as well. Tyler Brown : Okay. And Don, so $550 million, if I go back to my notes, I mean that must be one of the strongest M&A years that we've seen in a long time maybe outside of the Tervita year, but what's really driving the strength there, are these chunkier deals or are they just a lot of small tuck-ins? Don Slager : Well, there's a couple of chunky ones in there. Again, as we've always said to you, that one, we're going to remain opportunistic, right, we're going to remain flexible with our balance sheet and keep our debt and the leverage where it needs to be. We've got plenty of dry powder to do good deals at the right price. When it comes down to buying good cash flow, good consistent, reliable cash flow at the right multiple we'll do that in exchange of buying in the shares. So that's always been our model. But we don\u2019t overpay, we don\u2019t overspend. If you take a look at what's happening under the hood with our ROI we're driving in the right direction, so you can see that these investments are paying off in the long-run.And so all things that are well within our footprint and our ability and our team's core competence, so it's all good stuff. And we're going to continue to do it. $550 million will be an outsized year compared to the years past. I think we started this year at $200 million, and then boosted it to $300 million, 400 million I guess pretty quickly. So yeah, $550 million is a good number for us, and we'll talk more about what we think the pipeline looks like when we see you in October, for next year. Tyler Brown : Okay and then -- and so maybe my last one here, so Don, just a bigger picture question. So we saw the release around the 2030 sustainability goals, really appreciate all that. Don Slager : You bet. Tyler Brown : But I want to talk about two of the goals that were in there, that I surmise both have a sustainable and maybe a direct financial impact. So first, can you talk about some of the specific plans to cut the reportable injuries in half just particularly given that it's kind of hung around these levels the last few years despite your side loader adoption. And then secondly, your employment engagement scores, they have been flipping just a little bit, not a lot, but a little bit over the past couple of years. Can you talk about maybe why and then how you plan to get those up, but those two pieces\u2026 Don Slager : Well, sure. First of all, I think, look, when you look at what's happening just above and beyond just engagement, all the other sort of cultural impacts we're having, I think we're having a -- and Jon mentioned in his commentary a lower turnover now for the second quarter, right, or two quarters in a row. So it's continued focus. And I would tell you that having turnover that's flattish to down in this economy is a much bigger story than we probably mentioned on the call, right. So the combination of some of the fleet reliability stuff that Jon and the team have delivered on, the focus on safety, late leadership training, we've invested in frontline leadership training, we have all of our frontline supervisors coming through this building. And some of them now come through for the second time, but we're seeing really good trends develop underneath. And those trends have to continue. And again these things, this is sort of a long-term aspirational goal, but we're very confident. Let me have Jon add a few things. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, so on the safety piece; I think technology is going to be a huge play for us. Cameras is the most immediate venture on that front, but then if you think longer-term and you compare commercial vehicles to passenger cars we are at the very early stages of a lot of technology that's already available in passenger cars, and pushing very hard our vendors to build that into the equipment going forward. And they all have that as their product roadmaps, and things like active safety lane assist, all those things will help us become safer. And then on engagement, we are rising -- our workforce are becoming digital mitas [ph] and that will be an increasing percentage of our workforce.And as we put technology, and we don\u2019t think about that singularly, we think about making our customers lives better. We're also thinking about making our employees' lives better. And as we've done that, a lot of investments historically on the sales force we've seen that with engagements with them, they are more engaged, they are more connected, their lives are easier and better. And we think we're going to see the same thing in the operating side of the business as we roll more technology to that part of our workforce. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. I know those are long-term goals, but I appreciate the color. Thank you. Don Slager : You bet. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hey, good afternoon everyone, and congrats on the progress on transforming the recycling business. Just a couple of questions, on the landfill side, the volume growth was really strong there at up about 6%, just wondering if there's any one-time kind of special waste benefits in there, anything kind of unusual you would call out in that solid growth there? Don Slager : Yes, I think landfill has been very strong on both price and volume, so good sign of economy, and I think also good sign of our leadership in that area where we continue to raise prices on landfills. We know that these are expensive assets, hard to operate own, and we want to think about the total lifecycle of everything that we bring in and are pricing accordingly, and also seeing the volume growth associated with that. So, it's been a good story for us. Chuck Serianni : Yes, there's nothing really there that's going to -- it's a tough comp from last year or for next year. Don Slager : It's good solid across the board. Brian Maguire : Okay, and then just sort of a little bit on the flip side, collection volume seemed like they - and I understand you're shedding some broker business, some of this is non-regrettable, but it seems like it flipped a little bit and continues to kind of underperform the industry a little bit, just any comments you have on general trends there outside of the broker business? Don Slager : Well, no, I would say that there was one sizable loss - a customer loss in the quarter, a large national account with garbage that was just too heavy for the amount of price they wanted to pay, right. And so, that does happen. We're going to continue to again have non-regrettable losses, and so nothing unusual, nothing has changed with -- I think the market and nothing really changed with our strategy, it's just timing, it's a little bit lumpy from time to time. Brian Maguire : Okay. And then just on the input costs. The one that seem like it ticked back up again was just some of the disposal costs and leachate. It's been kind of a problem for a lot of the industry. Just any color you can give on what - how those are trending into 3Q and the back-half of the year, as we expect sort of continued margin headwinds on leachate? Don Slager : Yes, I think you're right on the landfill operator, particularly leachate. Listen, we suffer from weather and we've had a couple of wet seasons that doesn't come out of the landfill immediately, but it does over time. I think you'll see that trend, that cost, that trend move favorably going forward, and while we continue to maintain a pretty robust pricing environment. Brian Maguire : Okay. I'll turn it over. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thank you for taking the questions. Actually if I could just follow up on the previous question, so you got about $10 million, it looks like in price realization on the landfill and I'm just applying the yield growth to the landfill business. And the leachate costs also went up about $10 million. So obviously getting 1.7% yield is better than it had been in the past, but just a view of tightening disposal capacity, and these cost pressures, could this be an area where maybe you can push price a little bit more and we can going to see it tick up passed the 2% range? Chuck Serianni : Well, let me take the high level and Jon give you some background. But if you look at the results in the quarter and you look at our landfill pricing trends and, you look at to your point, the ultimate long-term scarcity and difficulty of owning and operating landfill business. Yes there are, pricing has been trending up in landfill space. And certainly believe there is more room for pricing in landfill space. And then specifically to the cost of leachate, that's the kind of thing that you answer real cost that ultimately will pass back through to the market, and the market is willing to pay for it, because again these landfills are ultimately still few and far between. Jon? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, let me add. There is a natural lag, right, the cost hit us immediately and we can't price immediately, where we price typically over 30, 60, 90-day environment, sometimes a little bit longer depending on the contract. We are raising our environmental recovery fee, because as we see cost increase, we are going to price ahead of that cost. Noah Kaye : Okay. And roughly, how much does that add in that recovery fee? Chuck Serianni : Well, that's going to be a future period thing that we've talked about. So standby, we'll talk about how that's impacting us in October, when we talk about future. Noah Kaye : Okay. Nicole Giandinoto : And the benefits of that are contemplated in the guidance. Noah Kaye : Yes, and I don't want to take away from what you did in this quarter. I mean your price - your total price was ahead of your total operating cost inflation, which is impressive. And I think if we just look at some of these cost items, you held your maintenance flat year-over-year. And so I guess the question is, if that's really from one fleet, is this kind of level of holding the line on maintenance and some of these items sustainable, how should we think about that? Don Slager : Well, think about some of the comments that Jon shared with you guys, schedule maintenance is now 90%. That means unscheduled maintenance is 10%. So reactive maintenance now is -- we only spend a certain or very small amount of our time on reactive maintenance. So think about what they need that downtime to drive satisfaction, the customer service, the safety and all the implications not to mention just fleet cost, right. So that\u2019s been a long road for us to roll out one fleet but we started on the other end of that where we were 20% scheduled, now we're break over our goal of 80%. So that has now become a durable process in the company, right. So that's ongoing. You were seeing some nice things about the price traction and the price consistently that we got don't overlook the fact that in the restricted market, we got over 3% price.So the team's been long working at turning around that restricted book of business, which was kind of the bane of my existence for a couple of years, right. And now we've got that book performing at 3% price. So it just goes to show you the way this business works, it takes time to get these things up and running. They've got a long-term benefit, they do find their stride and we tell you we\u2019re going to do something, we're going to do it and we've got a couple of great examples here that all those things are coming to fruition. Noah Kaye : Okay, excellent. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m just curious on the second-half, could you just give us anything in terms of how we should be thinking Q3 versus Q4. I mean you definitely got the operating leverage in the second quarter but margin in the first-half. First-half last year are still flat. So we're expecting some more leverage it seems like in the second-half, is there anything that kind of help pass through how should think about the third quarter versus the fourth quarter? Don Slager : Yes, I think that we are expecting margin improvement in both the third and the fourth quarter but most of that's going to come through in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind also that in the fourth quarter of last year, the margins were a little bit lower there with 27.4%, so when we talk about that margin expansion for the second-half of the year. Like I said, a lot of that will come through Q4. Michael Feniger : And Chuck just on the $550 million for acquisitions. How much is actually it\u2019s peaked into 2019. Clearly you must have some line of sight to be able to put that number out. How much is that is actually going to be baked and you think to 2019? Chuck Serianni : Yes, in terms of the Op income you mean or in terms of the revenue. So it\u2019s going to have very little impact in terms of the margins. Obviously, it's going to improve the dollars but very little impact on the margins just because of the ramp-up time because of the time it takes to get the synergies out of those acquisitions. The true tailwind associated with those acquisitions will come in 2020. Michael Feniger : Okay. And just lastly, I know it\u2019s splitting hairs but like average yield last quarter was the highest in a decade, it ticked down a little bit. How do we think about that that number in the back-half? I mean I know comps get a little tougher but how do we think about in the back-half. And why don't we include the processing fee, I think that was taking you above 3%. Is that just because that number is just a quarter is not sustainable, why don't we actually include that processing fee and some of the actual recycling within that number? Thank you. Chuck Serianni : Yes, that processing fee actually fluctuates with the price of commodities. And so what we didn't want to do is introduce that volatility into our yield, right. In terms of the yield it does tick up and down a little bit. There's a little bit of volatility associated with it but as we think at the back-half of the year, we think it's going to be relatively consistent. Don Slager : In yield there is always a little bit of a mix, right. There is some mix geographically, there's mix by line of business by market by market vertical. That's always the business, we are always going to have that. But remember you're always getting the benefit because we're in this pricing environment and we're in this pricing reset environment when it comes to pricing differently than CPI, and also now re-pricing the book of business around recycling. So you're going to have that running out ahead of you. In other words, we're going to have this rollover benefit as we re-price contracts now with better contract structure and terms that we negotiated last year, this first quarter and second quarter.So as we keep anniversarying new quarters, that's going to kind start catching up. So you're going to have that benefit out in the future. And one more point in that. That's what's fair for customers, right, it's good for us because we don't have this crazy that we talk about that that's what's real and is fair to customers and it helps us sell that to customers, who is trying to still partner with them and doing what's right for the environment, something they can get their mind around. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. Excuse me, in your prepared remarks you pointed out that the incremental margins you got on the revenue growth I think were over 40%. You haven't seen those numbers in quite a while. I'm just curious how sustainable you think that is and where that might normalize over time. Thanks. Don Slager : Okay, well, I'm not sure what that was. But look what we've told you for a long time that when the business is working sort of normally that we do bring in new business in and around that 40% margin, that's not new to us. Yes, it's been, it hasn't been that high lately but you've got a robust environment, right, so pricing strong, you've got consumer sentiment is good. Consumer spending is good. All these things point in the right direction, you've got job growth, you've got wage growth, all these things that that helped the price war. You've got certain amount of volume growth that helps drive pricing up. So we've got the tools deployed, when you first interest capture I mean years ago that, Jon? Jon Vander Ark : Five. Don Slager : Yes, so we have got five years now of integrating that and making that sort of the way we do business. The adoption rates are 100% right. So all of those things working in a good work, in a good environment and as a result we get. So as long as you have that kind of a backdrop, that's what we'll have. Jeff Silber : Okay, great. That's helpful. And I know when we kind of look at the broader economy, you mentioned the consumer is very strong but we're not seeing those kind of numbers on the industrial side or the commercial side as much. I'm just curious from your exposure there. What are your customers telling you, are you seeing the kind of weakness that we're seeing in some of the broader economic indicators? Don Slager : Well, we're seeing a little bit of softness in the Midwest in the Great Lakes and some of those areas, we're still seeing strong economies of East and West. So we've got a lot of good in case we look at special waste strong. We think that's a great indicator of future projects, we see again more service increases and decreases, there's a lot of good data in our system that we track that still paints a pretty positive future and when there's a little softness here or there, that could be related to a number of things. But we're not too concerned about that right now. Jeff Silber : All right. That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hey, thank you very much. I just want to make sure that point of clarity here. I mean you had 3.2% price increase yield in the landfill side of MSW which is where the bulk of the leachate gets generated, that's expensive. So that's more than covering which you need to do and from the margin leverage of that all the way through the revenues and inflation and you're getting pricing leverage on the part of the business that has the worst part of the leverage from leachate? Don Slager : Yes, so we're getting leverage on that piece of the business, Michael. You\u2019re right about that. But we need to get leverage on the entire landfill book. And as Jon mentioned, the leachate costs continue to rise and we need to make sure that we're getting an appropriate return on that entire asset. So there's still some work to do there. Michael Hoffman : Okay. On the revenues, the $550 million that you want to spend, you spent $180 million in the first-half, that means $370 million, when you gave the number in the beginning Don. And I'm going to ask you if you'd repeat it. We didn't write it down fast enough. What are you assuming in the current outlook that that converts to and booked revenues in 2019? Don Slager : Yes, 1.25% to 1.5% top line. Michael Hoffman : Top line and that and you've spent the whole $550 million, can you tell that or okay. Nicole Giandinoto : We did the remainder over the second-half. Don Slager : Yes, we haven\u2019t spent it all yet but we'll spend it. Michael Hoffman : But the assumption in the 1.25%, 1.5% is the whole $550 million spend? Don Slager : Yes, right. So we'll give a free type system here on deals in pipeline deals and process deals under contract. So we got pretty idea where we are. So high level of confidence in that number, we wouldn't give it to you. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And no, no I get that. I just wanted to understand. So what do you think the rollover into 2020 for acquisition on January 1, you have in hand was contributing related to the acquisition? Nicole Giandinoto : I would say because the incremental growth on that is 50% that would roll in because if you think of the $550 million we're about halfway through that. So we have half of that contribution to top line growth rollover. Don Slager : We're talking revenue. We're not giving you guidance on margin and yes that comes in there. Michael Hoffman : No, no just trying to understand, what the revenue rollover is, yes just trying to understand what the revenue rollover is. Don Slager : And this was my point earlier, right. I mean especially when we're having kind of robust second-half M&A activity, really nice rollover into next year, right. That\u2019s a good thing to have. Michael Hoffman : And with it comes operating leverage on that rollover. So it excludes the momentum, so that is the point of this. Okay. Don Slager : Thank you very much. Michael Hoffman : All right. And then it\u2019s all solid waste? Don Slager : It\u2019s not all solid waste. It's all waste, it\u2019s all environmental service, it's all the industrial waste, it's all stuff that we kind of do now and stuff that we're good at and it's all within our capability set, we spent a lot of money this year on some things around E&P in environmental industrial stuff. So it's a basket of things, right, but nothing, nothing outside what I would call our core capability. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And at Expo, Brian offered up that you were looking at industrial liquids as an opportunity because basically you have a skill set there. Can you do somewhat leachate processing, so that that would fit into that bill as well that you might find? Don Slager : Yes, look I mean here is the thing, right. When no different than when we first introduced to the fact that we were going to invest in that right now. Our timing was in the best on that deal but it turned out to be pretty nice for us. It's delivered good returns for us. And what I told already then was, look, this is about what's it about transportation, it's trucking, it's material handling, it's disposal, it's engineering, it's land management, it's landfill expansion, it's environmental service, it's all the kind of thing we do. We take in that business, we learn everything we need to know about it, we've expanded, we've made it a better business and then what happens is that opens you up to some additional capability, right.So we're not going to go very far from what we do well because that does make sense. So we're slowly looking at other opportunities the one you mentioned is an opportunity in the space, right. So just like I always about M&A in solid waste, we look at everything. We take a look at how it lays over our capability and our footprint. And then we look at the cash returns and we compare the cash returns of that M&A and our capability to run it against the returns on buying back our stock. And it's kind of that simple but just like we did a great job with Tervita, just like we're doing a great job turning the recycling business around. We've got capacity beyond just dumping two yards and four yards, right, really good that by the way. Michael Hoffman : Got it. Yep, you are pretty good at it. Last question from me, based on all if the commodities all stay right where they are and all the things you're doing will you on a run rate basis fully offset all of the headwinds including the first-half incremental headwind going into next year that you'll get, I don't, we don't have to talk about recycling if the commodity stay right here as far as headwind? Nicole Giandinoto : Well, what I say, Michael, just to clarify, so in 2019 all of the year-over-year commodity headwinds that we're experiencing were more than offsetting through pricing. So we\u2019re improving the profitability of the recycling business overall. If you know as far as 2020 goes, we'll talk about that more in October. Don Slager : But having said that, if you listen, if you reread the prepared remarks, we're making progress on every front, in fact we\u2019re making progress on moving those contracts de risking and recycling is many fast food business but we're making progress on every fronts of recycling. So we are on a path, right, not only to sort of ultimate overcome a deficit we've created for ourselves but we're on a path to the de-risk the business to a point where we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about it anymore, right. We're going to grow it, we may shrinking a little bit here and there, to grow it, but we're going to, we're going to be able to grow it and run it and do a great job for customers environment without having to talk about all this crazy volatility that exists. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So I think that opened up one quite more question from me, sorry. So the Plano, Texas facility was Michael that's sort of, that's sort of an example of opportunity where lower labor because of the technology we're bringing to bear there. Don Slager : Well, it's a combination of applying new technology and know-how with a customer who values recycling is willing to pay and willing to take their fair share of the risk. It's a combination of all those things so that may not be the case for every customer, but certainly it was people point they value enough to come to the table and we were looking for a great partner and they found in us. So we're going to continue to push our model and the model works. Jon? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, allows us to do two things, will take out about half of the labor in a tight unemployment environment that becomes important because that sort of job is can be a tough one to fill it also helps us produce about better product, the technology produces a cleaner product on the end and therefore we think bringing in a little more from what we saw on the back door that facility. Michael Hoffman : Terrific, thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Michael. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi, guys, compliments to the team on the first-half and really nice work. Don Slager : Thanks Jon. Sean Eastman : Yes. The first question from me is just in light of the first-half sort of price, volume being ahead of expectations and you guys are saying you expecting that momentum to carry into the second-half I think we came into the year with a 2.75% average yield guide and then volume outlook of flat to up 25 bps. I'm just wondering, is that still the algorithm that we're trending to here or is, is that not the way we should be modeling anymore. Chuck Serianni : I would say that on the yield side, we're probably a little bit higher than the original guidance, maybe something a little bit closer to 3 and then on the volume side, maybe a little bit lower than what we had originally guided to maybe something slightly negative, so -- but net-net in good in good position here for the rest of the year. Sean Eastman : Okay, that's helpful. And then next one is just on the acquisition $200 million and $550 million. Definitely not a insignificant change versus initial expectations. So I just wanted to get a little bit more color on, on how you guys came that far. I mean is it just a function of timing or is there some sort of change in behavior in terms of your acquisition targets. Don Slager : Well, it's mostly timing, right, and we start the year we've got a pretty good view of the pipeline, but things develop over time. So remember it went from 200 to 400 to 550. So anyway, the point is we locked it up, and so we know we know we share what we know and we give you numbers that we're confident in, and then as the world moves we've been able to move it up, but some deals maybe move faster than we thought in some deals came to market that we're in the market when we first give you guide to February, Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I mean I know the team has done a great job. We've invest in resources and we become a preferred buyer and I would say, we've got a higher number of referrals to buy companies than we ever have, because our that's were employee engagement comes back, we treat the employees that we acquire with dignity and respect, and they understand this is a great place to work, and owners care about money, but they don't care just about the money, they also care about legacy and our people are going to take care of the businesses they built and we've proven ourselves to be very good stewards of the business they're selling to us. Sean Eastman : Okay, got it. That's helpful. And just last one from me leverage at three times. I think you guys said at the end of the quarter. I'm just wondering kind of later in the cycle where maybe at the higher end of the leverage target, does this mean you guys sort of cool your jets, a little bit at this point or I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about that. Don Slager : Well, look, we've kept our leverage at our target leverage now for our over the quarters when we did have very intentionally, right. So we continue to do the work continuing to year. On the debt portfolio, we continue the work on what we think optimum leverage looks like, continue to look at all the other outlooks , that we should look at understand our leverage and we do that consistently, we have a lot of the structural our Board around that. We still think the target is that Optimum is between 2.5 to 3 and frankly more optimally 3. So again if when we're buying cash flow, right, we're growing the business that obviously allows us to actually increase our absolute debt, but still maintain our leverage ratio. So it's just, that's just math. So as long as you're buying really good cash flow at the right multiple with the right returns. We've got frankly a lot of dry powder to do that. There really is no limits on us from that perspective. Sean Eastman : Yes, that makes sense. All right guys, congrats again. And thanks for the time. Don Slager : Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Derek Spronck of RBC. Please go ahead. Derek Spronck : Okay, thank you for taking my questions. Just first off, sorry to belabor the acquisition pipeline, but does it 550 make any assumptions around potential divestitures of advanced disposals from the acquisition there. Don Slager : No, it does not. Derek Spronck : Okay. In I guess it's still pretty early but, do you see that elevated potential M&A environment carrying forward into 2020 as it stands now. And then on top of that the potential divestitures as well. Don Slager : Well, it's too early to talk about 2020 again, we'll give you our preliminary outlook in October, and we'll show of that guidance in February. It's a robust. It's a robust pipeline. I will say that and again it's activity is usually driven by sort of similar situations in life changing events and other things that occur. So there is nothing we're really doing to out there and say people to sell, it's all about being there people are ready. And as Jon said, being the right kind of company that people want to sell to. And of course maintaining our flexibility financially to do deals and integrate those quickly.So, and then as far as the mandated divestitures from the big merger that's been announced, I think it's too early to talk about that. I think from what I know there are still in second request and they've got some work to do, and they publicly said what their target range is for divestitures. You can probably all imagine that we've got a pretty good handle on markets across for at least 48 states. And that when deals like that come to market, we're pretty good at assessing what opportunity might be there for us, or where certain market positions might be something we're interested in. So there might be an opportunity there for us and others, and I'm sure my counterpart at the big green company, Houston has his phone ringing off the wall, with people who want to buy those assets. Derek Spronck : Okay, that's great color. Thanks, Don. How is the competition for these from the -- are the buyers that you're competing against for potential some of the more attractive assets. And they remain relatively rational or is it a pretty competitive in terms of acquisitions versus your peers there? Don Slager : I would say, yes, and yes, it's competitive and it's rational. In the end, there's always a mix. You may have to pay more for something that comes with real estate, a permit, a landfill certainly infrastructure, a platform type acquisition in a new market you're trying to expand and into those things that come at a higher purchase price, then a tuck-in. Tuck-ins come at a very nice value and are very quick to turn around to producing cash flow and so on, but -- so competitive, yes, and rational still, yes. There are issues, there are times when may be certain thing comes to market or may be private equity comes into the program, things get a little squarely then. So - but you've seen by our by our pipeline and what we've done, we know we haven't chased deals. We've looked at just about every deal large and small, it's come to market and we haven't bought them all, because sometimes we're not the natural buyer. I think there's always a natural buyer, who has got - some time a leg up with synergy value et cetera on or market position that we don't have.So, we are a not natural buyer, we're always willing to pay the going price. Maybe it's somebody else's because of their current situation or willingness to believe in what they could do with the asset. And then there's sometimes there's a disrupter in there like private equity. But if you look at what we're paying for deals now last year, the year before that all really pretty rational. And that'll be still our MO as we go forward. Derek Spronck : Okay, that's great. And then just one last one for myself if I could just on the restrictive markets and the move towards our Wastewater Sewer Index or is there CPI plus type of index. Do you think you'll be able to continue to increase that book of business on your ticket side toward the new index, I mean what happens if a customer just says no, I mean do you just revert back to the original pricing index and try again next time or do you walk away from a contract at that point? Don Slager : Well, first of all, there's something really great about being the incumbent right because you've already made the capital investment, you know exactly the weight of the trash and the disposal cost and the cost of labor and all the situations that exist in the contract. So nobody knows the cost and the probability of the contractor in more than you do. So that's a good news, we're dealing people that we already have in our book of business.So we get to know what we're at. If you look at that the success that the team has had that Jon spoke of in his comments, we add to that book every quarter -- what do we have, Jon?. Okay, you know, so when we first went down that road, I would it can't be done, it can't be done. And now here we are a couple years in and we've converted basically 30% of it. So I think frankly when CPI is higher like it is now, it's actually easier to have the conversation with customers because you don't have this big CASM between this half percent CPI and the 3% we need to get out. So, if a customer flat out doesn't want, will not accept the fluctuation of an index, again this is a government index, it's not an index we made up. It's got a lot of science behind it. It makes sense that they would accept that and we negotiate for flat rates of 3% or better, it\u2019s not sometimes it is 4% or better depending. And if the customer just frankly flat out doesn't make us a reasonable return, we cannot obviously keep that customer going forward in the current state. So we're returns based seller, right. The capture tool everything we do is based on the return and this is very capital intensive business, so sometimes we've got to go back in three or four times to get it. Chuck Serianni : Yes, we have two things on our side, one we're relentless. So we just keep asking two, we're only asking for what's fair. We're asking for a reasonable increase that support our cost increase for employees who live and work in the communities in which we're negotiating. So that argument over time resonates we might not get it immediately because local government it takes time to get things done but we keep asking and we're really pleased with our progress and we do a really good job for customers, right. So, and having said all of that we're every now and then going to walk away from a piece of business because we just can't get there. Derek Spronck : Okay. No, thanks for the added color, and congrats on a nice quarter, guys. Don Slager : Thank you. Chuck Serianni : Thank you. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey guys, just, Don, you mentioned some softness in the Midwest. Just to be clear, is that something that has transpired recently. Is that something you picked up in June or tracking that way in July? And Chuck, just on the volume side being slightly negative this year, I know you're doing a lot of intention shedding. Is that just the intention shedding portion of the brokerage business that you guys were talking about or was it something underlying of why that might be more negative than what you guys kind of were expecting beginning of the year? Thanks. Don Slager : Yes, I think the softness I think I would even say more of a slowdown or not being growth expectations. Certain parts of construction you see in the outside of Midwest, some of that's weather related. Right and we've seen some of those markets kind of bounce back to our expectations too. So I wouldn't read too much into that right now. Chuck Serianni : In terms of the volume growth itself, we have walked away with business as Don mentioned we're very returns focused. So as you know our system begins to show up. We're looking for where we can get the best returns. And we've demonstrated an ability to redeploy assets if certain customers aren't giving us an appropriate return on our work, so that's part of it also. Don Slager : It's overall look we think we're getting our fair share of the business. We got great sales tools and pricing tools, we've got great pricing internal controls working for our benefit. Again don't lose sight of really strong and crystal clear yield that we report and low churn and improving ROI. I mean those are the results of that kind of internal control environment that Chuck described right. So and again as always, there's always a little bit lumpiness in our business, you lose one big national account and it does ding your revenue growth when your slow growth business like us and if you net all this out, I mean we're growing like we say that we typically do. It's population growth that drives growth in our business. And if you kind of net some of these things we're right on top of that. So we're feeling pretty good about it. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Don Slager : Thank you, Alison. In closing we are extremely pleased with our second quarter performance and well-positioned to achieve our original full-year financial guidance. Our teams let us focus on operational execution, the passion of our customers enable us to deliver these results.Thank you to everybody. We expanded EBITDA margins by 50 basis points and grew earnings per share by 8%. And then finally, we increased the quarterly dividend by 8% again demonstrating our continued commitment to increase cash returns to shareholders, and also shows our confidence in the cash flow generating capabilities of this business. The team did a great job this year. Thank you everybody. Thank you Republic team. Thank you for spending time with us today. Those of you on the phone, have a good evening, and be safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Therefore, they exclude the benefit of an additional workday in the quarter versus the prior year.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Donald Slager : Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our third quarter results. We continued to successfully increase price in excess of our cost inflation, expand underlying EBITDA margin by 60 basis points and drive double-digit growth in adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow.During the quarter, we continued to see additional weakness in global recycled commodity markets and further declines in U.S. rig counts and drilling activity. Despite these macro headwinds, the business is performing ahead of plan. As a result, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.28 to $3.30. We also expect to achieve the upper-end of our adjusted free cash flow guidance range.In the third quarter, we generated $372 million of free cash flow and approximately $1 billion of cash flow year-to-date. We utilized our free cash flow to invest back into our business and returned the remainder of \u2013 to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We believe investing our free cash flow in acquisitions is the best way to increase long-term shareholder value.We look for appropriately priced solid waste acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. We also look for opportunities to increase the scale of our environmental service offerings, including materials management and waste disposal. These offerings address the needs of our upstream E&P customers and downstream refinery and petrochemical customers.In the third quarter, we invested approximately $275 million in acquisitions. This brings our year-to-date acquisition investment to $490 million. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust. For the full-year, we are on track to invest approximately $550 million and believe 2020 could be another strong year of acquisition investment.Regarding 2020, given the predictability and consistency of our business, we are providing a preliminary outlook as we have in prior years. We are midway through our annual planning process. And assuming current business and economic conditions continue, we project the following for 2020, adjusted EPS of $3.46 to $3.51 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion.We will achieve this by continuing to prioritize the safety of our people and communities above all else, targeting value-oriented customers to drive profitable volume growth, leveraging our scale to minimize costs and drive operational improvements, continuing to make disciplined acquisition investments to grow free cash flow, and further investing in technology to enhance the customer and employee experience. Similar to prior years, we will provide detailed financial guidance for 2020 in February of next year.Before I turn the call over to Jon, I\u2019d like to congratulate the Republic team for being certified as a great place to work for the third consecutive year. We believe an engaged and diverse workforce is the greatest indicator of our success. This is yet another recognition of the inclusive culture we are building at Republic, one where the best people come to work.I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jon to discuss our third quarter operating performance. Jon? Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Don. In the third quarter, the pricing environment remained favorable. We continued to price in excess of our cost inflation and maintain customer defection or churn of 7%. Core price, which represents price increases to our same-store customers, net of rollback was 4.7%. This included open market core price of 5.7% and restricted core price of 3.1%.Average yield, which measures the change in average price per unit and takes into account customer churn, was 2.8%. Average yield was strong across all lines of business. In our small-container collection business, average yield was 4.1%. In our landfill MSW business, average yield was 3.3%. This level of landfill MSW pricing is especially impressive, given approximately two-thirds of our MSW volume is restricted.As you can see, our team has made great progress moving our disposal contracts away from CPI-based pricing to a more favorable pricing mechanism. In total, including both collection and disposal-related contracts, we\u2019ve converted $775 million, or 31% of our CPI-based book of business to a waste-related index, or fixed rate increase of 3% or greater.Average yield is also benefiting from improvements in our municipal recycling collection contract. We are working to ensure, they reflect the true cost of recycling and include a more equitable risk-sharing arrangement. We\u2019ve now secured price increases from approximately 35% of our municipal recycling collection customers.Turning to volume. Total volume in the quarter decreased 40 basis points and was in line with our expectations. Underlying volumes increased 10 basis points after normalizing for the impact of intentionally shedding certain volumes, including non-regrettable contract losses in our residential collection business and work performed on behalf of brokers. We expect the broker-related headwinds in our small-container business to decrease in 2020, as we anniversary some of the larger losses.In the third quarter, volume across all collection lines of business improved sequentially. At the same time, average yield for our total collection business was 3.1%. On the disposal side of the business, MSW volume growth continued to be strong at 1.8% and C&D volumes increased 15.8%. As expected, special waste volumes decreased versus the prior year due to a difficult comp. Looking forward, the Q4 pipeline remains strong.During the quarter, recycled commodity prices continued to decline. Our average price per ton in the third quarter was $72. This represented a $6 sequential decrease from the second quarter and a $34 decrease versus the prior year. Prices have continued to decline in October, and we estimate our October price per ton to be approximately $68.Importantly, we continue to make progress transforming recycling into a more durable, economically sustainable business model. As a result, next year, we expect our sensitivity to commodity prices to decrease.Next, turning to our environmental services business. In the third quarter, rig counts in the U.S. continued to decline. At the end of September, total U.S. rig counts were down 18% versus the prior year. And in the Permian Basin, they were down 15%. As a result, environmental services revenue decreased and created a 40 basis point headwind to total revenue growth in the third quarter.Finally, turning to margins. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 28% and decreased 40 basis points versus the prior year. Underlying margins expanded 60 basis points, which was more than offset by a 50 basis point headwind from an additional workday in the quarter relative to the prior year and a 50 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices.We continue to see good operating leverage in the business, as we tightly manage costs and improve productivity. We expect this positive momentum to continue into 2020. Every year, we invest in innovative technology and equipment to enhance the customer experience, improve productivity, and make our employees\u2019 job safer, easier and more engaging.For example, last year, we opened our first next-generation positive-sort recycling facility in Plano, Texas. To date, in Plano, we\u2019ve seen about a 20% reduction in our total cost per ton. It\u2019s important to note, this improvement is net of the depreciation expense associated with the upfront capital investment.In the third quarter, we began to roll out our RISE platform in our dispatch operations and large-container business. The platform leverages the operational foundation we\u2019ve been building over the last several years. It includes additional mobile and in-cab technology with more real-time routing information and data visualization tools.Ultimately, this platform enables us to digitally connect our customers, drivers, dispatchers, supervisors and trucks. Through this technology, we will further differentiate our product offering, empower our employees and increase productivity.Next year, in partnership with Mack Trucks, we will begin piloting our first electric vehicle on a residential collection route. As you can see, we have a lot of exciting projects underway and we\u2019re looking forward to discussing them more in 2020.With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our third quarter financial results, our 2019 guidance and the 2020 outlook in greater detail. Chuck Serianni : Thanks, Jon. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $993 million and in line with our expectations. In the third quarter, we invested approximately $275 million in acquisitions, or $228 million net of divestitures. We also returned $271 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.At the end of the quarter, leverage was three times and within our optimal range of 2.5 to 3 times. Interest expense in the quarter was $98 million and included $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 18%. We also incurred a $4 million non-cash charge related to solar energy investments that qualify for tax credits.For the full-year, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 15% and a $140 million non-cash charge. Relative to our original guidance, the benefit from lower tax-related expense is approximately $0.17. This benefit is being fully offset by two macro headwinds. First, a $0.13 headwind from lower recycled commodity prices and a $0.04 headwind from a decline in drilling activity.Before opening the call for questions, I\u2019d like to provide some additional detail on our 2020 preliminary outlook. Regarding our adjusted EPS outlook, we\u2019re assuming recycled commodity prices remain at current levels of approximately $68 per ton. Next, we\u2019re assuming an adjusted effective tax rate of 21% and a non-cash charge of approximately $110 million. The year-over-year increase in tax-related expense in 2020 results in a $0.16 headwind to earnings relative to 2019.Turning to our adjusted free cash flow for 2020. Our outlook includes $100 million of CapEx associated with the reinvestment of tax-reform savings. These funds represent continued investments in updated locker rooms, brake rooms and training facilities for the benefits of our frontline employees. This $100 million capital investment will not reoccur in 2021.Our 2020 cash flow outlook also includes an incremental headwind of approximately $40 million from working capital. The working capital headwind is due to the timing of disbursements in 2020 relative to 2019 and will not reoccur in 2021.Lastly, regarding capital allocation in 2020. Although we believe next year will be a strong year of acquisitions, our outlook only contemplates $200 million of investment. Additionally, we\u2019re assuming we spend approximately $400 million in share repurchases.With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Donald Slager : Hey, Tyler. Chuck Serianni : Hey, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey, Chuck. So my big question here is on free cash as we think about 2020. So I just want to make sure welcome all mixed up. So you\u2019re talking the high-end free cash this year, I call it, $1,175 million and your preliminary midpoint is $1,175 million. I think that\u2019s right. I get the incremental CapEx on the facilities, but you\u2019re saying there\u2019s an incremental working capital headwind into 2020 as well Are those the two big kind of puts and takes, or is there something else in there? Chuck Serianni : Yes. Yes, just \u2013 let me make sure I\u2019m clear, right? So if you go to the midpoint of the guide right now for 2020, it\u2019s $1,175 million. And then we have a total of $100 million of CapEx included in that number, right, for tax reform. So you would add that to that amount and then you would add back that working capital I talked about that $40 million. And when you do all that math, Tyler, you come up with a baseline free cash flow of $1.3 billion. Tyler Brown : Okay. As we kind of think out into 2021, am I right on that? Donald Slager : Yes. Chuck Serianni : Yes. So if you think out into 2021\u2026 Tyler Brown : Okay. Chuck Serianni : \u2026you\u2019ve got that baseline of $1.3 billion, plus the growth on top of that, just the natural growth in the business. Tyler Brown : Right. Okay. And then just frankly, Chuck, I\u2019m just still confused on the solar energy investment. So, is there \u2013 is this like a CapEx item? Is it a M&A type of item? Or is it just a charge on the P&L that gives you a benefit on the tax form? I\u2019m just, frankly, a bit confused there. Chuck Serianni : Yes. We\u2019re looking to more of it as an M&A type of item. So this is a \u2013 an investment that we\u2019ve been able to take advantage of. It gives us a really good return on investment. It is extremely low risk. And the great thing about it is, because of the tax credits, we get that benefit immediately. And so that\u2019s why you see a reduction in our effective tax rate and our cash taxes equal to the amount of the investment that we\u2019re making here. Tyler Brown : Okay. Nicole Giandinoto : Tyler, this is Nicole. Just to put a one point of clarification there. When we talk about our acquisition investment in the quarter of $275 million and year-to-date of $490 million, that does not include the solar investment, although it runs through the same line item on the statement of cash flow. Tyler Brown : It does. Okay. So that\u2019ll be a Q4 item? Nicole Giandinoto : Yes, yes. Chuck Serianni : Yes. Tyler Brown : Right. Okay. And then just maybe my last one for Don. Just so I appreciate the color on M&A, but I\u2019m curious. So have all of your transactions this year been in traditional solid waste, or there is some other verticals, it sounded like that may be the case? Donald Slager : It\u2019s a mixture. We\u2019re still seeing great activity in the pipeline on really good solid waste companies, both collection and infrastructure like. And we\u2019re seeing some good opportunities in environmental services that are very adjacent to what we do. We\u2019re looking at opportunities that, again, are things that our customers have said they want to buy from us products and services in areas things that we\u2019re good at.So I think maintenance, fleet operation, container management, land management, permitting, engineering, all those great capabilities that we have. We\u2019re finding great opportunities to move into a little space, more space that still has a great margin profile and works very well with our core business and our core capability. Tyler Brown : Okay, all right. I appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. Donald Slager : You bet. Operator : Our next question will come from Derek Spronck with RBC. Please go ahead. Derek Spronck : Okay. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Just on the acquisition front and just to follow-up just on the solid waste business side. Are they primarily tuck-in acquisitions? And do you have any opportunity to move into new markets here? Donald Slager : Well, they tend to be primarily tuck-in acquisitions. And one of the reasons for that is, again, we\u2019re \u2013 we tend to be first or second place in \u2013 whatever 5% of our revenue, so we\u2019ve got a big market position. Tuck-ins tend to have the highest return. They\u2019re the easiest to integrate. They come with the lowest risk.So there are still a fair number of small companies out there that are getting to a place in their company life cycle, where they\u2019re thinking about selling. And we\u2019ve got some degree of longstanding relationships with those sellers. And so we\u2019re well-positioned to buy those companies.We have moved in some new geographies in the solid waste. There has been a couple of acquisitions we made recently that we\u2019re moving into adjacent geographies or into brand-new geographies, and we\u2019ll do that for the right deal, for the right market position. And so we think there\u2019ll be more of that in the future just as companies, again, come to a certain point in our life cycle. Jon Vander Ark : And if we take a look going forward, the pipeline is robust. It will primarily be existing geographies only because we\u2019re in 42 states. So that\u2019s where the bulk of our opportunities will set, but we have plenty of things we\u2019re looking at in terms of \u2013 to Don\u2019s point, adjacent geographies or new geographies, we moved into Bend, Oregon recently and that was a very value-creating acquisition for us. Derek Spronck : Okay. And what would you say is the average size from an acquired revenue perspective that you\u2019re making at this point of the acquisition cycle? And finally, any potential plans ever to come up here into Canada? Donald Slager : Okay. Well, I\u2019m not going to give you the average, because it\u2019d be misleading. Most of the acquisitions are small. Again, these are small companies, I think, five, 10 trucks, right? And occasionally, you do get to a opportunity to look at a larger company, where maybe that company didn\u2019t have a successful succession plan, or the next-generation, or the third-generation really wasn\u2019t all that interested in it, or it was time to sort of monetize a lifelong work.So there are \u2013 there have been a handful of sizable ones, but primarily, they\u2019re going to be small. So it\u2019s a lot of work to integrate small businesses and spend as much money as we have intelligently. We haven\u2019t made deals to do. As it relates to \u2013 but we look at everything large or small. That\u2019s kind of a battle cry if you look at everything, that makes sense for us.And then as far as Canada goes, I would say this, we always kind of describe ourselves as a North American solid waste and recycling company on purpose. We like Canada. There\u2019s some great business up there. And we would have to be looking at opportunities that gave us a strong market position, which is really the sort of first pillar of our strategy. We\u2019re now looking to be a number nine in a market with no path to number three. And so that would answer your question. If there\u2019s things available that interest us, we\u2019re not going to shy away from that. Chuck Serianni : We are already there today, both in the East and the West, largely in a post collections or disposal arrangement. So that gives us some ties or relationship already into those markets. Donald Slager : You bet. Derek Spronck : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I understand your earnings per share is up. I\u2019m just \u2013 if I look on a trailing 12 months basis, I think your EBITDA is up like 2% year-over-year. In a rather solid waste backdrop, it\u2019s below your peers and everyone is contending with their cycling issue. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of \u2013 is there anything structurally that we should be aware of in terms of your business mix or cost basis or regional mix? Help us understand that, that differential and how that differential might close in the next 12 months? Chuck Serianni : Yes. I think the two big things that impacted EBITDA this year, in particular, were commodities. And that ended up being an over $50 million headwind for us. The other thing was environmental services, and we had talked about that Permian cooling down a little bit. And that was another almost $20 million of a headwind for us also on EBITDA.Now, the good news is that, we were able to offset that \u2013 from those headwinds through some advantageous tax planning. But as we look into the future, and as we look in particular into 2020, we\u2019re saying at this point that we\u2019re going to have EBITDA margin expansion. And that\u2019s because we feel really good about how the base business is performing. Michael Feniger : Chuck, just to be clear on that. So you\u2019re saying into 2020, you\u2019re confident you can get EBITDA margin expansion on the overall business, even with the \u2013 if OCC prices stay exactly where they are right now, and you extrapolate that into 2020? Jon Vander Ark : That\u2019s exactly right. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Michael Feniger : Okay. And just like on the intentional shedding. When we go into 2020, is that over and do we see that finally drop out in \u2013 into next year? Jon Vander Ark : We\u2019re expecting to grow the business next year, obviously, at very solid price environment and volume growth next year. That will be a mix of taking on a lot of profitable customers and still some shedding of less attractive customers. But, as we said in the prepared remarks, that will start to trend down overall. But that we believe we can grow the business, both price and volume. That\u2019s our aspiration. We\u2019ve proven we can do it. When forced to make a trade-off, we\u2019ll take price every time, right, that\u2019s how we think about the business.So, again, to Chuck\u2019s point, with 2020, we\u2019ve got really solid plan for, feel really good about the economic backdrop and how we\u2019re going to grow the business. And that will involve slowing down of the shedding and taking on a lot more profitable business. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Good afternoon. Donald Slager : Good afternoon. Brian Maguire : Chuck, just wanted to come back to the $40 million of working capital that seems to be swinging around a little bit. Am I thinking about it right that you\u2019re kind of maybe pulling that forward into 2019 and that\u2019s what\u2019s getting you from more like the lower-end of the range to the upper-end of the range? And then that\u2019s just sort of coming out of the 2020 number as a \u2013 as an offset? Chuck Serianni : No, it\u2019s really the timing of disbursements in 2020. It has to do with the calendar. And when we, honestly, when we cut AP checks, and it just happens to be a worst-case scenario for us in 2020. And that\u2019s why I said in my comments that it will reverse in 2021. That\u2019s a one-time headwind for us, that will reverse. It has to do with the calendar. Brian Maguire : Okay. So you get the benefit then in 2021 as opposed to 2019 from that progressing? Chuck Serianni : Correct. Brian Maguire : Got it. Okay. And then just wondering, if you could comment on your outlook for special waste volumes. I think yesterday, they were down, but mentioned that was mostly because of a year-ago comp. Wondering what you\u2019re seeing in the pipeline there and the outlook there into fourth quarter? Jon Vander Ark : Pipeline is solid, both for Q4 and then in early 2020. Beyond that, it\u2019s hard to say, but really solid outlook. And this \u2013 the nature of that business is a bit episodic, as you know. It can move around quarter-to-quarter, you see that with us, you see that with our competitors. And it\u2019s always a little down this quarter, C&D way up this quarter. So there\u2019s a little bit of swing in the nature of those jobs because they\u2019re project based. But we feel very good about the pipeline. Brian Maguire : Okay. And just last one for me. Just on the \u2013 back on the tax rate in these solar credits, I think initially, you talked about kind of a $60 million offset in the non-cash line from that. It seemed like in the quarter it was only four. So running a little bit lower that. Is it just going to be a little bit lumpy and a lot in 4Q?And then just thinking about it more longer-term, how many more years do you kind of anticipate having this sort of a weird lower tax rate and a higher non-cash other expense in there? And assuming, it does, and at some point, do we go back to that kind of high-20% tax rate at some point, or somewhere lower now? Chuck Serianni : Yes. So we like the weird lower tax rate. I\u2019d like to keep that as long as we can. Back to your first question, yes, it will be a \u2013 most of the investment will occur here in Q4 for 2019. And these tax credits right now start to phase out through 2022 into 2023. So, we think that we have an opportunity to take advantage of these tax credits for the next few years.Certainly, they\u2019re on the books. But at the same time, we need to make sure that we got the appropriate investments that those are available to us. And these investments typically have returns in the mid \u2013 high to mid-teens. And we\u2019re making sure that they don\u2019t just provide us with a tax benefit here that they\u2019re \u2013 that we\u2019re getting overall a good return on these investments. Brian Maguire : Okay, thanks very much. Nicole Giandinoto : So for those of you that\u2019s dialed in and entered the queue ahead of the start of the call, it looks like you\u2019ve dropped off. So if you want to get back into the question queue, please press star and then one. Operator : Our next question will come from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : HI, team, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the environmental services, kind of acquisitions and stuff being folded into the mix here. It looks like this run rate here on the environmental services line actually picked up really nicely in the third quarter. And I believe that item was called energy services last quarter, so maybe I missed some sort of reclassification. But nevertheless, I\u2019m just kind of wondering if maybe some of the acquisitions done this year are going into that line. And what the run rate on that looks like as we go into 2020, particularly considering the softness on the E&P waste side? Donald Slager : Yes. So we\u2019ve kind of broadened the category, okay? Sean Eastman : Yes. Donald Slager : And so when we first went into the E&P space, we call that Energy Services and that was, again, primarily handling oilfield waste, landfilling, and waste processing from the drilling rigs and so forth. And that\u2019s been a good business for us, a good investment. Again, it could be a little cyclical, right? And it could be impacted by some of the global issues that we face.But all in all, still good business. We like it. We\u2019ve got great market position. A lot of that depends on sort of on your geography. A lot of those customers that we serve in the oilfields are customers that we serve in the solid waste space. And as we\u2019ve looked to sort of connect dots, we talk about going sort of upstream and downstream here. We find opportunity to do other things in and around that space that fit very nicely into what we\u2019re capable of.So it comes down to, again, what\u2019s the margin profile of the business? How does it fit with our customers? Does it help us with stickiness? Does it help us to do more for current customers and kind of bigger wallet share? And does it fit within our capability? You won\u2019t ever see us do things that we don\u2019t know how to do, right?And so yes, so it\u2019s opened up new doors. And it\u2019s not that much different, frankly, from when, I think, Jon, talked about a new geography in Bend, Oregon. We wouldn\u2019t have maybe known those people and had an opportunity, we weren\u2019t in Oregon. So, as you move the geography footprint out, it opens you up to new opportunities because of new relationships and so forth.So not that much different there when we think about what\u2019s happening in the geography of the country, where Energy Services and Petrochem has got a big concentration. Sean Eastman : Okay. And maybe you can just expand on the acquisition opportunities in that environmental services category, as you see it today? Donald Slager : Yes. So we\u2019re not really ready to break it out. Again, as Jon and I both said, the majority of our acquisition activities still going to be in solid waste. Yes. So, these are, I would call it, sort of fringe opportunities. We\u2019re not going to do a natural act and try too hard. We\u2019re just going to make sure that we\u2019re making \u2013 being opportunistic and being intelligent and staying within our adjacent capability set. But most of the investment will still be in and around good old-fashioned core solid waste for the time being. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add is that, space is pretty fragmented. And our customers have asked us to be there, right? We\u2019ve been in this space for a long time in plant on properties. They understand our safety record. They understand our commitment to sustainability. They understand our performance levels that we can execute against. And therefore, they\u2019ve asked us to broaden our product and service offering to better serve them. Sean Eastman : Interesting. Yes. I mean, it sounds like just another big consolidation runway. I guess, just to close it out there, maybe how this particular piece of the business, that\u2019s all kind of lumped together at this point. Just how it\u2019s kind of moving into 2020, some high-level comment on that would be helpful? Donald Slager : Yes. I mean, I think that into 2020, obviously, you\u2019re going to see that line item on the \u2013 on our revenue breakout continue to increase because of the acquisitions that we made this year. And, as Jon mentioned, that we\u2019re going to remain opportunistic here in 2020 and see if there\u2019s any other opportunities that we can also include in that piece of our business. Jon Vander Ark : Don mentioned some cyclicality, we expect a little bit of headwind on a year-over-year comp. If drilling activity remains flat, obviously, that could pick up and move up depending on where oil prices go. The downstream side of that business is much more steady from an underlying demand profile. And you\u2019ll see nice growth year-over-year there because of the acquisition that we made in the space. Sean Eastman : Thanks, gents. Really helpful. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hi. Thank you very much. So just to tease out that last set of conversations, the $51.5 million, that now core environmental services a year ago. Was that pretty much purely energy and now 57.8 has the combinations of things to some \u2013 make sure I\u2019m understanding this whole conversation that just happened? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We\u2019re pulling a little bit from the core business. We\u2019ve been in the downstream for a long, long time. So we\u2019ve pulled a little bit of that into the business, but it\u2019s just the combination of both upstream and downstream and called environmental services, largely because that\u2019s what the space calls it, right? That\u2019s what our customers are\u2026 Michael Hoffman : Yes, I got that, Jon, but a year ago, was it basically just all ups \u2013 upstream energy and this year, it\u2019s got a mixture of things? Jon Vander Ark : Primarily. Donald Slager : Yes, primarily. So\u2026 Michael Hoffman : Yes, just... Donald Slager : \u2026but we\u2019ve tried to say this a couple of times. Look, we\u2019ve been in and around this space for a long time. We\u2019ve had little sort of outpost in our business that have, call it, wandered into the space and done pretty well with it. So none of this is all new to us. It\u2019s just aggregating it into one place. And then as Jon said, it\u2019s somewhat of a fragmented business and customers want to sort of have that one neck to grab and where that reliable, well-known entity. And so it just seems to go together pretty well. So you\u2019ll see it now aggregated, and you\u2019ll see some good growth, as Jon pointed out. Michael Hoffman : Yes. I\u2019m \u2013 sorry, guys. I just want to make sure I understood what was in the mix. I don\u2019t dispute the need or been in and all that. On the free cash flow side, one of the things that I think that also needs to be thought about is there at $68, that\u2019s an incremental level of pressure in the next year relative to the run rate through this year, and that would equal cash headwind as well that you\u2019re overcoming?So when you start with a \u2013 we\u2019re flat year-over-year at the upper-end versus the new guide of midpoint at just $25 million for the incremental lock room spending and the like for employees, $40 million for working capital. There\u2019s some cash tax benefit. There\u2019s also an added headwind as some recycling cash, too, right? Chuck Serianni : Yes, that\u2019s absolutely right, Michael. You\u2019re right on with that. And that was probably circa $20 million or so. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Chuck Serianni : And, obviously, that\u2019s a negative in our 2020 preliminary outlook in terms of the cash flow. Michael Hoffman : Right. Donald Slager : So, Michael, your point is right, that just further makes the point of the underlying strength of the business. Michael Hoffman : Right. Donald Slager : \u2026right? Chuck made a point that our baseline free cash flow is really $1.3 billion. And then all the good work that the team is doing on restructuring recycling contracts, at some point, we\u2019re going to gate that year-over-year impact to nothing, right? We\u2019re just going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to move the risk over where it belongs and then we won\u2019t have that conversation anymore. Michael Hoffman : So can we shift the price for a second? So I love the progress that\u2019s being made on both. What needs to change either within your control or macro that you can narrow the gap between the yield reported and the core that\u2019s being offered? That\u2019s the ideal scenario, right? Is that gap closes overtime? What can you do to close that gap? Chuck Serianni : Yes. That\u2019s obviously us focused on maintaining that stickiness and increasing that stickiness with the customers, right, because what we\u2019re talking about now is that what we have historically called churn. The difference between that yield in that core price. And then that\u2019s where all of the technology that Jon talked about and that connectivity with the customers really come into play. Nicole Giandinoto : And then, Michael\u2026 Michael Hoffman : So what I\u2019m hearing is, you\u2019re tending to \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, go ahead, Nicole. Nicole Giandinoto : I was going to say, the other thing that helped us and will continue to leverage in the future is the capture pricing tool. Michael Hoffman : Right. Nicole Giandinoto : Because as Chuck said, you increase the stickiness to reduce customer defection and then all your new units by leveraging the capture pricing tool, we\u2019ve got that discipline to move with the market when we sell. Donald Slager : Keep in mind, customer defection is at 7%. Michael Hoffman : Yes. Donald Slager : That\u2019s pretty well below. Can we get to six? We\u2019ve been below seven before. Can we get it to five? We\u2019ll see, right? But you have a certain amount of defection just from businesses failing, going bankrupt moving out of the country, et cetera. So that that\u2019s all in that number. So we start with a pretty low defection numberBut everything else we\u2019re doing around all of our customer service initiatives, even fleet reliability, all the new technology, the RISE platform the Jon talked about, all that is to create differentiation in the product value. And can we gain more customers at a higher price? That goes hand in hand with \u2013 using the capture tool? Can we keep customers longer? That reduces this thing called churn over time? Jon Vander Ark : It does. When I say differentiation helps us on both fronts. The other thing that is helping us is upward pressure on landfill pricing, which you\u2019ve seen now for a number of cores in a row that we\u2019ve done a good job with, right? We pass that right through to our collection company, right? And that collection company then is charging higher price than the Street. So we\u2019re getting \u2013 we\u2019re taking on customers at a higher price, which ultimately reduces the churn. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. That\u2019s close enough. Excuse me, I know there have been some media reports about some strikes that have been struck against your company in a number of your markets. I\u2019m just wondering if you \u2013 has there been any impact on your business in terms of extra costs to send in replacements, et cetera? Any color would be great? Jon Vander Ark : Sure. No, yes. So first of all, we\u2019re pro employee, that\u2019s where we start the conversation from a values basis. This has been incredibly narrow. This is one business unit in the Northeast, right? It\u2019s less than two dozen employees. And we are targeting good faith. Local team is doing a great job, right? And we\u2019re hoping we get back to work soon.There has been a couple of one day events in a handful of markets. Good news is, customers are not disrupted. We\u2019re getting the recycling and garbage off the ground, right, in the Northeast and data in those minor kind of disturbances, right? And from a cost standpoint, it\u2019s been nominal for the quarter. Jeff Silber : Okay. I appreciate you putting that in perspective. My follow-up question, one of your competitors had mentioned, if you look at the different end markets, there seem to be a bit of a bifurcation between those that are more industrial-related like the special waste area and more \u2013 and those that are more consumer-focused. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re seeing the same kind of different trends between those end markets? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Well, just to put it in perspective, only less than 10% of our revenue is really tied to manufacturing. We\u2019re really tied more so to the consumer, right? So as we look at our various lines of business right now, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of weakness in that manufacturing piece of the business that I talked about.Keep in mind also that, when you think about a manufacturer, you think about a plant, if they are going to do away with a shift or so \u2013 their waist doesn\u2019t go down to zero, right? They still need the waste service. They may just not needed as often. So that might be a little bit of a service decrease, but it would have a minor impact on our overall revenue. Donald Slager : Yes, overall, we would say, the underlying economy is pretty, pretty strong. And, as Jon pointed out, certain parts of our business are event-driven. We see some fluctuations in construction with seasonality, some special waste. There are large events jobs that come and go. But, as you average through the year, we\u2019re growing the business. We don\u2019t get too excited about seasonality and we don\u2019t get too excited about these episodic things.The fact is, we\u2019ve got this great portfolio. We\u2019re across 42 states and 200-plus markets. And so, if there\u2019s a weather event, or a forest fire or work stoppage, or this or that, or whatever, this portfolio sort of kind of wins the day, and it always has and we think it always will. It\u2019s one of the benefits of being \u2013 having the size of scale we have. And then, of course, we lag.So if the economy gets a little soft, we kind of lag that, right? So sometimes we find ourselves just kind of working through these little blips that otherwise people get excited about. And our view now and our view for 2020 is, the economy is in a pretty good shape. And we\u2019re well-positioned\u2026 Jeff Silber : Okay. Donald Slager : \u2026across the markets and we\u2019re going to get our share of the growth that we want to get. Jeff Silber : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks very much. The color you provided on the solid returns from the solar investments was helpful. But I was hoping to kind of broaden the question to the general topic of sustainability commitments. You called out in your release, your environmental commitment to 35% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030. I believe some of the other sustainability goals you announced in July include increasing landfill biogas reuse, 40% increase in materials recovery.And I just want to understand maybe be helpful, as we think about your capital priorities and how they are aligning with the sustainability goals, how does that impact or what are the areas we should expect to see increasing focus on four capital deployments over the next few years? Besides the solar investment, what would you maybe call out in the 2020 CapEx plan or other investments you\u2019re making that address this? Donald Slager : Yes. The first thing I\u2019d say is, we believe that environmental sustainability and economic sustainability needed to be tightly linked. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re so passionate about restructuring the business model for recycling, because over time, we\u2019re long on recycling and we want to be a major player in that space. But it has to have really attractive financial returns for us to continue to invest there, and we\u2019re seeing that absolutely in given markets over time.So the market is moving there in a positive direction. I think you\u2019ll see things like landfill gas energy projects over time, a place we meet, or place we further invest to meet the sustainability goals, and we put out ambitious goals for 2030. We don\u2019t have all the ticks and ties and all the plans to achieve every one of those items built out yet, because they\u2019re ambitious goals and they\u2019re more than a decade off. But we feel really good that we\u2019re going to do those in a responsible way, value creating way. So that, not only is the environment winning, but the shareholders winning as well. Chuck Serianni : And this isn\u2019t a one-time investment either that you\u2019re going to see all of a sudden pop into our CapEx, right? This is something that we\u2019ve been doing over time, and it\u2019s already baked into our cost structure. So there won\u2019t be any big blips on the radar relative to our investments in these areas. Noah Kaye : I think that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Maybe a little bit more near-term. Just want to understand based off of the M&A that you completed year-to-date, what is kind of the rollover revenue contribution to 2020? And is that basically what\u2019s assumed in this preliminary outlook? Chuck Serianni : Yes, it is. So we\u2019re about 70 basis points of revenue rolling into 2020. And then you get on top of that the revenue associated with the $200 million of investment where we\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to make in 2020. Noah Kaye : But \u2013 so \u2013 does \u2013 in other words, is your outlook assumes both of those and you assume some contribution from next year\u2019s M&A as well? Chuck Serianni : That\u2019s right. Noah Kaye : Okay. Chuck Serianni : The 70 basis points rollover, plus the revenue impact of the $200 million of investment. Noah Kaye : Okay. Okay, that \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. And then, you are \u2013 you kind of defined expectations for the recycling headwind for next year as well around $20 million. Are your processing fees now covering most of your third-party volumes? Is there further improvement opportunity there, or is it really now all about redoing the municipal contracts and improving the technology? What are the levers to pull that could maybe reduce this headwind assuming a constant commodities environment? Chuck Serianni : Right. So I think that we made really good progress in terms of the pricing initiatives and in converting to the processing fee. Right now, the processing facilities themselves are \u2013 continue to be profitable. And we continue to look at that profitability in those fees, so that we can get what we consider to be an appropriate return on this facility. So, we\u2019ve got a little ways to go in that regard. And then we still have conversations that we need to have with our municipalities to get them to convert over to these processes. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. And we\u2019re marching into City Hall every day. And I think the good news is a lot of conversations in flight and the nature of the conversations is turning, I think a year ago, it was staff pushing back on us. And now we are here staff inviting us in saying, I want to make sure that recycling is sustainable in my community. Let\u2019s go on to gather to talk to the elected officials, because ultimately, we need to get more pricing to the curb to make this sustainable for the long-term. Noah Kaye : Yes, makes sense. Thank you very much. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I will turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks. Donald Slager : Thank you, operator. In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter performance. Through the relentless operational execution of our employees, we achieved strong pricing, 60 basis points of underlying margin expansion and continued grow \u2013 growth of both earnings and free cash flow. The momentum in our business is strong. The economic backdrop remains supportive of continued growth in 2020.As always, we will continue to manage the business to create a long-term value for all stakeholders, including our employees, customers, communities and shareholders. I want to thank all of the Republic employees, everyone on our team for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thanks for spending time with us today. Have a good evening, and please be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending, and you may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong finish to 2019. The hard work, passion and commitment from our 36,000 employees enabled us to outperform our upwardly revised EPS and free cash flow guidance despite continued headwinds from lowered recycled commodity prices.By successfully pricing in excess of cost inflation in 2019, we expanded underlying EBITDA margin by 70 basis points and generated over $1.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow. For the full year, we invested over $0.5 billion in acquisitions and returned the remaining cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.We continue to believe that disciplined investment in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value. Our strong finish to 2019 sets us up for continued success in 2020. Given the underlying momentum in our business, we are well-positioned to deliver approximately 5% top-line revenue growth and nearly 6% EBITDA growth. On top of that we are entering 2020 with one of the strongest acquisition pipelines we've seen in years.We will achieve our 2020 guidance by continuing to prioritize the safety of our people and communities above all else; attracting value-oriented customers to drive profitable volume growth; leveraging technology to empower our employees; increase connectivity with our customers; and drive operational excellence; and finally, continue to make disciplined acquisition investments to grow free cash flow and drive sustainable long-term value.These priorities represent the continued execution of our profitable growth through differentiation strategy. We believe our 2019 results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and our team's ability to consistently execute against it. For example, the most critical component to successfully executing our strategy is our people.We believe that engaged and diverse workforce is the greatest indicator of our success. We know that our business units with higher employee engagement have fewer safety incidents, better customer service and better financial performance. In 2019, we improved our overall employee engagement score by over 100 basis points to 86%, which is well above national norms and is high performing for the industry. We also reduced driver turnover by 130 basis points versus the prior year.Moreover, the team continued to receive notable national awards and recognition of the inclusive culture we are building here at Republic. These results reflect the cumulative benefit of the investments we've made in our people over the last decade. We will continue to invest in our people and culture which will further enhance our reputation as an employer of choice. Our strategy also includes investments to improve the customer experience, drive operational excellence and enhance our leading market position.I'll turn the call over to Jon to walk you through our 2019 results in each of those strategic areas. Jon? Jon Vander Ark : As Don mentioned, we've been investing in the customer experience for several years now. Having a passion for our customers is core to our strategy. We know by offering differentiated products, services and experiences designed to meet our customers wants and needs, we drive customer loyalty and increased willingness to pay.In 2019, we continued to invest in and enhance our customer-facing technology including our website and mobile app. We also attained our highest level of pricing in the last 10 years, while maintaining our industry-leading customer churn of 7%. Another key component of our strategy is delivering durable operational excellence. This enables us to deliver consistent high-quality service to our customers while lowering our operating costs.In 2019, we successfully managed our cost inflation and drove solid operating leverage in the business. We also began to roll out our new RISE platform to our dispatch operations. This new technology equips our dispatchers with more real-time routing information and enhanced data visualization tools. It also supports additional mobile and in-cab technology, which we will begin rolling out in our large container business later this year.Over time, this platform will further empower our employees, transform our operations improve productivity and increased connectivity with our customers. Additionally in 2019 we raised the bar with our latest long-term sustainability goals. These goals address our most critical sustainability risks and opportunities and are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.We believe each new goal has the potential to significantly benefit the environment and society while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business over the long term.Finally in 2019, we further strengthened our leading market position by strategically investing over $525 million in value-enhancing acquisitions. Through these investments we increased our operating density in existing markets, entered new geographical markets and increased the scale of our downstream environmental services offerings. As you can see the investments we've made over the years in our people, the customer experience, operational excellence and our market position are delivering tangible results. They also provide a solid platform for continued growth in the business.Next, I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter operating performance. During the quarter our pricing environment remained favorable and we continued to price in excess of our cost inflation. Core price which represents price increases to our same-store customers net of rollbacks was 4.8%. This included open market core price of 5.8% and restricted core price of 3.2%.Our restricted core price reflects the significant progress we've made in repricing and restructuring our municipal recycling collection contracts. Restricted core price also reflects the continued benefits of moving away from CPI-based pricing to an alternative pricing mechanism. To date, including both collection and disposal-related contracts, we've converted $780 million or 31% of our CPI-based book of business. This represents a $120 million increase over the prior year.Next, average yield for the quarter was 2.6%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit and contemplates the impact of customer churn. Average yield was strongest in our small container collection and landfill MSW businesses. Small container average yield was 4.1% and landfill MSW average yield was 3.4%. This is the fourth straight quarter landfill MSW pricing has been greater than 3%.Looking forward in 2020, we expect average yield of approximately 3%. We will achieve this by continuing to focus on enhancing the customer experience and delivering superior service; partnering with our municipal recycling customers to build more durable economically sustainable recycling programs; and pricing our products and services to ensure we earn an appropriate return on our capital investment.Turning to volume. Total volume in the quarter decreased 20 basis points versus the prior year. We continue to intentionally shed certain volumes, which we view as non-regrettable losses. These included residential collection contracts that did not meet our return criteria and work performed on behalf of brokers in our small container business. Normalizing for these non-regrettable losses, underlying volumes increased 30 basis points.On the collection side of the business, large container volumes increased 80 basis points versus the prior year and underlying small container volumes increased approximately 60 basis points after normalizing for broker-related losses. As expected, residential collection volumes decreased 2.2% due to non-regrettable contract losses.On the disposal side of the business in the fourth quarter, MSW volumes increased 40 basis points and C&D volumes increased 16% versus the prior year. As anticipated, special waste volumes were relatively flat versus the prior year. Looking forward, overall in 2020 we expect total volume growth of approximately 75 basis points to 100 basis points.Turning to recycling. In the fourth quarter, our average commodity price per ton was $66. This represented a $6 sequential decrease from the third quarter and a $40 per ton decrease versus the prior year. Importantly, we continue to make progress transforming recycling into a more durable economically sustainable business model.As a result of the team's efforts, our expected earnings sensitivity to changes in commodity prices has decreased by over 25%. Every $10 change in our average price per ton is now equal to approximately $0.03 of annual EPS or $13 million of EBITDA.For purposes of our 2020 guidance, we're assuming commodity prices remain at Q4 levels of approximately $65 per ton. This represents a decrease of $12 per ton versus 2019 and will result in an EBITDA headwind of approximately $15 million. Any recovery in recycling commodity prices would be upside to our 2020 guidance.Next turning to our environmental services business. In the fourth quarter, U.S. rig count and associated drilling activity continued to decline. As expected, revenues in the upstream portion of our environmental services business decreased versus the prior year. In the fourth quarter, this resulted in a 50 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. Relative to our preliminary outlook, we're now taking a more conservative view regarding drilling activity and are assuming it will remain lower for longer.Finally turning to margins. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 28.8% and increased 140 basis points versus the prior year. This included a net benefit from CNG tax credits of 60 basis points and a headwind from lower commodity prices of 50 basis points. After normalizing for these two items underlying EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points. By effectively executing our operating plan, we successfully managed our cost inflation and drove operating leverage across nearly all cost categories.With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our 2019 financial results and 2020 guidance in greater detail. Chuck Serianni : Thanks Jon. Adjusted EPS for the full year was $3.34 and included a $0.06 net benefit associated with CNG tax credits. In December, CNG tax credits were enacted retroactively to 2018 and will be available through 2020.Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 28.3% and increased 30 basis points versus the prior year. This included underlying margin expansion of 70 basis points. This is partially offset by a 40 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices.The CNG tax credit did not impact the year-over-year change in margin. Adjusted free cash flow for the full year was $1.2 billion. Adjusted free cash flow was favorable relative to our expectations, primarily due to lower cash taxes. Cash taxes were favorably impacted in the fourth quarter by acquisition-related bonus depreciation. At year-end leverage was 3 times and within our optimal range of 2.5 to 3 times.Next turning to our 2020 guidance. The current economic backdrop remains supportive of continued growth. Consumer sentiment is strong, unemployment is low and housing starts are up year-over-year. Given this favorable backdrop for the year we expect total revenue growth of approximately 4.25% to 5% and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 20 to 40 basis points.We expect this level of margin expansion, despite approximately 30 basis points of headwind going into 2020. These headwinds include lower recycled commodity prices, a decrease in upstream environmental services revenues and an additional workday.Relative to our preliminary outlook, we increased our adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.02 to $3.48 to $3.53. The increase is due to a $0.04 benefit from CNG tax credits which is partially offset by an additional $0.02 headwind from our upstream environmental services business.We also increased our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $25 million to $1.175 billion to $1.225 billion. The increase is due to a $30 million benefit from CNG tax credits partially offset by an additional $5 million headwind from our upstream environmental services business.Keep in mind our adjusted free cash flow guidance for 2020 includes $100 million of CapEx associated with the reinvestment of tax reform savings. These funds represent continued investments in updated locker rooms, break rooms, training facilities and equipment for the benefit of our front-line employees. This $100 million capital investment will not reoccur in 2021. Normalizing for this capital investment, our free cash flow baseline exiting 2020 will be approximately $1.3 billion.With that operator I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : Hey good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just around the volume on commercial small container. Do you see that sort of turning positive at some point? I guess, we've been pruning low-margin business for three years. And so just any thoughts as -- any thoughts as when that inflects positive? Chuck Serianni : Yes absolutely Hamzah you're right. We've been shedding some of that work. And while there'll always be a little bit of that work to shed because as we acquire companies, right we find that the book of business, we don't value that when we pay for those companies. But we're certainly kind of at the bottom of that trend and you're going to see positive growth in that line of business. Hamzah Mazari : And then just on the M&A sort of pipeline how are you guys thinking about deal flow this year? Where the balance sheet leverage is at? I guess, there's a lot of private company revenue up for sale ahead of the election plus the ADSW divestitures. Any thoughts on how aggressive you want to be there? Don Slager : Sure. This is Don. We \u2013 as I said in my remarks, we've got the most robust pipeline, we've seen in years going into the year. And we spent over $0.5 billion in 2019. While our guide only has $200 million spend in it, I personally wouldn't be surprised, if we matched or exceeded this \u2013 last year's performance. There's a good pipeline of really good companies, and we've got a really good team that is across the nation looking at deals. And as I always say, we look at everything, and we sort out what we're most attracted to. And we're out there talking to a lot of people. We've got a lot of interest right now.So we feel pretty confident. And as far as the leverage, when we talk about leverage being sort of sweet spot two and half to three we have at times gone over three times leverage to buy really good cash flow. And as I said in my remarks, the very best use of our cash flow is to buy more good cash flow at the right multiple. So we could lever up a little bit and then we'll pay that debt down over time. As long as, we're buying good cash flow that's a good recipe for success. Hamzah Mazari : Got you. And just last question and I'll turn it over. Just on SG&A, I realized there was sort of corporate function build-out at the company. And in your SG&A's run rate is higher than your largest competitor by a bit at least this quarter. Do you see that coming down? Is SG&A at peak levels today? Or does it go further up from here? Thank you. Chuck Serianni : Yeah. Hamzah, this is Chuck. And yeah, we do see SG&A trending down from here. I would say into 2020 we're projecting that it will be flat to slightly down. Hamzah Mazari : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Don Slager : And Hamzah, I'll add to that. We have done a great job of building really strong foundational capability within the business over the last several years. And we are at a good inflection point to leverage that scale. And believe me, we're having a lot of conversations about that. We've got a really good talented group of people here that frankly can run a bigger company without having to add \u2013 constantly add people and resources. So you're exactly, right. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Thank you very much. Have a good evening. Operator : The next question is from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hey, good afternoon. Just a follow-on question on the volume outlook, the volumes were down a little bit in 4Q but the guidance for 2020 implies about 100 basis point pickup from where we were in kind of 4Q. So just wondering, where or what quarter we might expect to see that inflection to positive growth comps? And what kind of visibility do you have into that volume turning after a couple of years of it being down a little bit or kind of flattish? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. I think you'll see that in Q1. And please keep in mind volume and price are related. And we've had really, really strong pricing over the last couple of years in part, because we think about returns at every level. When we acquire a company every customer we sell to, we want to have the appropriate return on the investment we make. And so that's caused us to shed some of that work as we've taken price up. We feel like we're off a really good base to price. And I think you're going to see that volume growth we're forecasting you're going to see that consistent across the four quarters in 2020. Don Slager : Yeah. Let me add to that. And we have a very consistent approach for price-volume. There's no zigging and zagging, with our thinking on that. And so there's a lot of moving parts to this story. But as Jon said, everything has to contribute. And we feel like we're getting our fair share of organic growth, but we are doing some intentional things right to make sure that we're not doing this for practice. Brian Maguire : Got it. And the 3% yield guidance for 2020 that would be I think the highest in over a decade for you guys. Is that \u2013 do you think that's a sustainable level going forward? Or should we just view this as sort of a one-year level given what's going on in recycling and the need to just kind of recoup that in other parts of the business? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah \u2013 no. I think I'll see that as sustainable. And the reason is, it's years in the making. It's not an event. We've always gotten that or above that in the open market part of the business and the bag \u2013 the drag excuse me has been the CPI related part of the business. And we've worked very, very hard on alternative index and getting everybody to pay their fair share. And as you're seeing us continually push that the market is changing on that front. Those RFPs change and that is becoming the norm of the pricing index and a lot of those municipal contracts and when everybody contributes to pricing that allows us to sustain that 3% over time. Don Slager : Yes. And let me add to that. We posted landfill pricing, really strong landfill pricing 3.4% MSW pricing as a backdrop. If you look at just the open market landfill and transfer pricing, pricing is actually 4.5% to 5.5%, right? So, in open market post-collection pricing is moving in the right direction as it should. That also provides sort of underlying economics that make the market more rational. Brian Maguire : Okay, great. I'll turn it over. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks. Just a follow-up on the pricing theme thinking about the drivers for 2020. You mentioned tailwinds from reworking the muni contracts both with CPI migration to alternative index and then also recycling landfill just driving higher collection willingness to pay. That kind of covers most of your business lines. So, should we expect fairly broad-based improvement in yield across business lines? Any lines you would expect to be leaders on the yield front? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I mean small container is usually our flagship along with large container perm historically and I expect them to continue to lead the way. But I think the broader theme you're hearing is every part of the business needs to contribute, right? We don't just accept some people are not willing to pay their fair share, right?And to Don's point, it's got to start from the landfill right and that emanates into the collection side of the business. And when those two things work in the right direction, we get it across the Board. Don Slager : Sure. Look also I mean housing starts if housing starts remain up that's a supply and demand environment that contributes to higher pricing, right? So, we've got open-top -- our open-top business should improve as well. Noah Kaye : Makes sense. Perhaps a question on 2020 margins guidance for 20 to 40 bps expansion. It seems like recycling if I got your guide right is maybe 15 bps or so impact to margin. What are some of the other offsets that might offset solid waste margin expansion, dilutive acquisitions, the E&P softness CNG? I guess, just are there any other considerations we should keep in mind or is there some deceleration of margin expansion in solid waste? Jon Vander Ark : No. So, the headwinds that we faced in 2020 one is commodity prices about 10 basis points. I talked about the upstream environmental services that's about another 10 basis points of margin headwind that we face.And then I mentioned the extra workday that we have in 2020 that's another 10 basis points. Net all that out and what you end up with is about 50 to 70 basis points in underlying margin expansion just due to the base business. Don Slager : Yes. Now remember commodity prices were still high in the first half of 2019. That's really what we're talking about. We think they've stabilized and they'll remain stable through the year. But we still have to sort of overcome that first half of 2019 where they were stronger. Jon Vander Ark : And while we have that commodity price headwind we're taking pricing actions overall in recycling that more than offset that commodity price headwind. Noah Kaye : And so the acquisitions you've done there you did a lot this last year. They're margin-neutral or margin-accretive? Jon Vander Ark : That's right. Noah Kaye : Okay. Okay. And if I could sneak one more in. You mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the technology levers you're deploying over the course of this year in the large container cabs. I guess without kind of giving the game away on what you're doing just how to think about some of the areas of focus there and what you see as the key benefits. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Broad-based we start with the customer right? The first thing is to deliver an even better customer experience. We're 99.9% reliable in our delivery. We want to think about a zero defect environment. So, how do we improve the customer experience. How do we make the fully experienced better? And they want to be dealing with a digital environment making it easier for them to do their job.And then we think we take some costs out of the business. We make it more productive or more efficient right and we can get more pulls in this case into the large container system because we've got the tools available to do that. Don Slager : And so think about the size of our business 5 million transactions a day 5 million pickup points a day. And you can get a little -- just incrementally better across five pickup points right from all the points Jon said, there's leverage there. Noah Kaye : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Hey good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the CDP Climate A List recognition. And obviously we're seeing a lot more interest in ESG investing here. Curious how you think Republic should be viewed from this lens. And maybe, what are some specific initiatives you're doing on this front? Further, just curious, are you seeing pressure from shareholders? And what particular metrics do you think they're focused on this? Don Slager : Well, I'll let Jon give you some detail. But we've seen a lot more I wouldn't say pressure, but interest from shareholders, right. ESG is on tip of the tongue and top of mind of our investors today. Certainly, we spend a lot more time on these issues in the boardroom. We have a Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee on our Board that spends significant time working with management on all of the goals we set, initiatives we have in place. And so, ESG isn't going anywhere and we'll see more and more interest in it as time goes by. And of course, you can see just by the rating system, by the grades we get and then by the goals we've set how competitive we are? Jon? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. And I think the more important thing is these aren't disconnected or these aren't just aspirations. These are deeply connected in our business. And we believe to be environmentally sustainable. You have to be economically sustainable. So, these are things that are great for the broader community as a whole, the smaller community and municipalities and they're going to be good for our business. So safety for example is one of our goals, right?Our number one priority right, we want all of our colleagues to go home after work every night, so a huge priority for us. By doing that, we also lower our risk expense and improve the profitability of the business. Our employee engagement by getting them more engaged we lower our turnover and lower the cost of operating the business, right? By adding to our recycling capacity, we meet our customers' need doing it in a sustainable business model where they're going to be willing to pay their fair share for those investments, right? Engaging our community and our national neighborhood promise right is a way that we give back to the community, but it entrenches us with our most important customers and allows us to maintain and extend those contracts over time. Kyle White : Got you. And then just a quick one, I think you mentioned your average recycled commodity basket was $66 per ton here in Q4. Just kind of curious, what you're seeing in 1Q on the average basket there? Chuck Serianni : Yes. So, 1Q is -- it's a little bit higher right now, a few dollars higher right now, but not significantly different than our guidance level which is at $65. Don Slager : And I think the long-term outlook is that, it's pretty flat all year. Kyle White : All right. Thank you. Good luck to you. Don Slager : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey good afternoon. Chuck, congrats on the margin momentum here in 2019 which looks like it's expected to continue into 2020. But I was hoping if you could give us some help on the cadence of margin improvement as the year progresses? I mean I'm assuming you still have some dilutive impacts from recycling and the workday specifically in Q1. So, would Q1 margins maybe be down year-over-year or maybe more flatty? And then they kind of build steam as the year progresses and then maybe a little bit of a tougher comp in Q4 given the CNG, is that the right way to think about it? Chuck Serianni : Yes. You're right about that Tyler. So, a little bit more of a headwind in Q1. Keep in mind that that's where we have the additional workday, right? So you've got that phenomenon in there. And Don already mentioned the fact that you've got the commodity price headwind that hits us in Q1. And then we accelerate there from there right to a good Q2 good Q3. And then Q4 right now we're thinking is going to be kind of flattish. Tyler Brown : Okay. Don Slager : We start to get the rollover benefit of pricing and all the great work the team is doing on converting contracts to the right index to the fair share arrangement. All those things are building speed sort of compound through time. The full pipeline when we first integrate these businesses, we don't see a lot of extra cash flow because of the integration cost. But as they get fully tucked in everything gets converted it bills right? So you'll see all that bills return. Tyler Brown : Okay. That's helpful. And then Don, so obviously you guys have done a really good job on the yield front. But if I look at the spread between core price and average yield, it actually continues to widen out. I think it's actually as wide as it's been in say five years. But I'm just curious if you could speak to why that is. It would indicate that either churn is picking up or the spread between new and lost business is widening. But I really don't get the sense that that's the case. So, I'm having a hard time squaring that. Don Slager : Well, there's a lot of mix, right? And then again when we intentionally shed business we're shedding business that is a lower price per unit right? And we're attentional and unregrettable then that's just a change. So I'll tell you this, we have a pricing plan, of course. There's no doubt that we have a pricing group here that works very closely with all our field leaders. And we know what kind of pricing actions we're going to be taking throughout the year. And we have a pretty good feeling for what willingness to pay is in the markets.And then, it's just the power of the portfolio. We're number one or number two across these markets. We've got good penetration. The field team is doing a better job every month on customer experience and service. And that all drives willingness to pay.The team is doing a great job in educating customers on the way to recycle correctly and people are starting to buy in more, really willing to pay their fair share. I mean, all those things create pricing opportunity for us. So we're pretty confident in the direction we're headed and in the stability and the traction in pricing group. Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay. And then, maybe my last one. So I love maybe asking you guys a strange question after a long day of earnings. But -- and I'm going to go ahead and throw this out to any of you. But if I was to set aside your property insurance, say related to the landfills and I just looked at your vehicular insurance, are you guys seeing any unusual inflation in your premiums particularly in the upper layers of your insurance tower? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. What we're seeing Tyler and it's not just us, it's all of Corporate America right now. The insurance markets are really, really hard. They're really tight right now. And it has to do with a lot of the natural disasters that the insurance companies are \u2013 have been dealing with. Having said that, considering the fact that we are a Fortune 300 company, given our size and all that, we're able to mitigate those cost increases through other cost initiatives that we have within our system. Tyler Brown : Okay. All right. That is very helpful actually. Thank you. Don Slager : And, of course, right, we're self-insured, right? So we're really just talking about insurance for sure. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. It was probably -- Tyler Brown : Yes. Looking at the upper layers of the tower? Jon Vander Ark : Right. You bet. Yes. Operator : The next question is from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. Compliments on closing out a strong year. Don Slager : Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks. Sean Eastman : So just a quick housekeeping one from me first. Just on the CNG, you guys gave a pretty clear contribution number on EPS. But just curious on EBITDA for 4Q and for 2020, what's reflected on the CNG piece? Chuck Serianni : Yes. So EBITDA in 2019 in Q4 was $17 million of a benefit. And then we're expecting it to be similar to that in 2020. Sean Eastman : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And the flat to down 25 bps in environmental services,0 could you just help me frame kind of the upper and lower end there? I mean, in the prepared remarks you guys point to the upstream piece being the swing factor. But I'm just curious, is that just kind of drilling activity? Or is there something else that could frame the upper end or lower end? Chuck Serianni : Yes. It really is just drilling activity. That's what's driving that variance right now. So that's -- that could be anywhere like we said from 0 to 25 basis points of the negative. Sean Eastman : Okay. And then on the five $25 million of acquisitions completed in 2019, how much of that was environmental services versus traditional solid waste? Don Slager : Yes. The majority was solid waste. And frankly, the majority will continue to be solid waste, right? I mean, there -- as I said in my remarks earlier, there's a great pipeline of really good quality companies. There's still plenty of good business for us to look at and consolidate tuck-in and bolt-on and even maybe in a few new markets that we can look at geographically. That's where the focus will continue to be. But there'll be some great opportunities as our core capability expands with key customers who want us to do a few more things for. Sean Eastman : Got it. And last quick one from me. Can you just talk about the runway on the solar investment opportunity? Is the vision here longer term to start utilizing the cap to landfills with these solar build outs? Don Slager : Well, I'll start and Chuck can add in. We have, as you know, quite a few closed landfills. So we've got a big real estate portfolio. And, yes, I mean ultimately, depending on the economics depending on the tax incentives, depending on the advancement of solar technology, of course, and the ability to connect to the grid, all those things are in flux.But just like you've seen advancements in EV, there'll probably be more advancements in solar that we can't even imagine today. But we're well positioned with a great deal of real estate.We've got good partners in the solar space. The investments we made have been great investments with good returns. And as the opportunity exists, we'll continue to do it. And we'd like to certainly see asset utilization in this new way from our landfills if that's possible. That's why we started down this road in the first place. Chuck Serianni : Yeah. And according to the statute right now, solar credits actually start to phase out. I believe it's this year. And I think that they phase out over a five-year period. Now there's debate right now whether or not they'll be extended similar to what happened with CNG. So -- but to Don's point that remains a great investment alternative for us and something that we would like to do on our fully depreciated closed landfills. Sean Eastman : Helpful. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Silber : Thank you so much. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the percentage of your contracts that you've shifted to alternative -- alternate inflation targets. I'm just wondering if we can get the same kind of color on how much of your contracts have been shifted on the recycled side to fee-for-service? And where do you think that goes over time? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. So, on the processing side, a little further ahead on that front. So, we're over 50% on that side of the business. On the recycling collection side, we've got about 36% converted. And that's across a portfolio of 1,300 contracts, and we're not stopping. We continue to walk through City Hall and tell the message around a model that needs to be economically sustainable, to be environmentally sustainable over time. And I can tell you we're seeing momentum shift.First, it was trying to convince staff and now staff is saying to us, hey, listen we've got to work together to convince the electeds because they understand the issue and they have a strong desire to keep their recycling programs : one because it's the right thing to do; and second because the residents deeply want them to keep it. And we've got to work together to make it economically sustainable. Jeff Silber : And besides the cost impact, what other pushback if any do you get? Jon Vander Ark : Some of the cost -- some of the volatility impact, right. There's the volatility aspect to recycling is the commodity prices. And historically, we've borne most of that and some cities say, well, I don't want to bear that either because I don't like the idea of moving residential recycling pricing month to month to month. And we've innovated together with them thinking about hey, let's get a price that's sustainable for residents over the cycle and do things like when commodities are up you can put that in an enterprise fund, right? And so you could take the volatility there. And when the buy prices are high that creates some upside to get the new fire truck, put in the new playground and do things to enhance the community. Don Slager : Yeah. The other thing that gets uncomfortable is just the discussion around contamination, right? So, we focus greatly now on contamination levels. And that could include just glass, which is highly recyclable but of course has low value. And in some geographies the trucking cost to get glass to an end user just takes the whole thing upside down. So, we've got to have those honest discussions with generators about whether the material really does have real sustainable environmental value at the end of the day or are we just basically burning more rubber and more fuel to make ourselves feel good.And then, I just -- the contamination level of educating the end users the consumers on how to do it, right. So again, we've done a great deal of work in creating tools and training to point people to the right place to learn how to do it right. But frankly municipalities, consumers, customers have to take responsibility for this contamination, because when they deliver a stuff that's 80% contaminated we call that garbage, right? So we're working through that. But -- so, we're having a great honest discussions about how do we make recycling sustainable and profitable and good for everybody and we think we can do it. So we're well... Jeff Silber : Okay. Thanks so much. If I could just sneak in some quick modeling questions. What should we be expecting for depreciation and amortization, interest expense and taxes for 2020? Thanks. Chuck Serianni : Yeah. We'll follow-up with you some time after the call. Jeff Silber : Okay. We\u2019ll do. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Chuck, on the free cash flow, can we bridge to the exit run rate given there's some one-timers off the midpoint? So I think the midpoint is $1.17 billion, ex the CNG credit? What's the ratio exiting? Chuck Serianni : Yeah, Michael. So think about $1.2 billion kind of as the midpoint on the exit. We've got $100 million of tax reform capital included in that number as we had talked about, which doesn't rollover into 2021. So that's really how you get to that exit of $1.3 billion. Michael Hoffman : And what about... Chuck Serianni : In 2021 you have -- you'd have the growth on top of that. Michael Hoffman : And isn't there some working capital timing? There's like $40 million of working capital timing that\u2026 Chuck Serianni : Yeah, there is Michael that we had talked about. $40 million of working capital timing but that is offset now by the $30 million of a benefit that we get associated with CNG. Michael Hoffman : Got it, okay. All right. So the exit rate is $1.3 billion and then you've got underlying growth greater than whatever your EBITDA growth is going to be? Chuck Serianni : Yeah, that's exactly right. Don Slager : Yeah. And again this is based on the $200 million target for M&A. Michael Hoffman : Right. Your -- could you share what your year-end for all of 2019 the open market price was versus restricted to get to your 2.8% for yield in 2019? And then I'd be curious what you think those look like to get to the 3% in 2020? Chuck Serianni : So you want the -- I'm sorry, Michael you want the restricted\u2026 Michael Hoffman : Open -- so your open market yield and your restricted yield for 2019 for the full year, you gave us for the fourth quarter or maybe gave it for the year I thought it was the fourth quarter. And then what you think those pieces are to get to the 3% in guidance? Nicole Giandinoto : Michael, we don't have that detail in front of us. That's the quarterly amount and not the full year. But as you think about it, we should do somewhat the same of what we did this year. You're going to have -- CPI is going to be a benefit in the first half of 2020, but it will flip to a slight headwind. So for the year it kind of -- it'll wash its way out. So again think of core price and restricted price to look it a lot like it does today. Michael Hoffman : Well, one of them has got to get better to get to 3% or churn is coming down? Chuck Serianni : Yeah, yeah. And it's probably -- it's going to be the open market piece of it Michael. We think that that's going to get a little bit better. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then housekeeping question. The $15 million of modeled headwind from recycling doesn't give you any benefit for your continuing to work through the 55% that's MRF processing in the 36% on contracts right? You could in fact offset some of that if you make some progress on... Chuck Serianni : Yeah. Just to clarify Michael, $15 million is just the pure commodity impact. The actions that we already have baked into the plan more than offset that. To the extent, we make additional progress that's just icing on top of that cake. Michael Hoffman : Perfect. Don Slager : And we will make additional progress. Nicole Giandinoto : Yeah. And remember Michael as we increase recycling collection pricing that flows through the yield. Michael Hoffman : Got it. And then one just subtly because there's a slightly different messaging around this from another player. And I think you have the same answer. 100% of your open market customer at your MRF has been repriced but you have some contracted work and that's why the aggregate MRF is 55%? Chuck Serianni : Correct. Yeah. Any open market customer has long since had re-priced more than a year ago. Jon Vander Ark : And that's open market. The facilities that's open market collection, all the open market recycling has been repriced. Michael Hoffman : Great. And then if I could, how is the progress in Plano in the context of lessons learned? And is it going to be transferable into other operations. And as you think of, recapitalization through the MRF fleet have you been happy with what you're seeing that this is -- this -- you've hit on something and this is something worth pushing in other places? Chuck Serianni : Yeah. We've been very happy. Obviously, it's a CapEx-OpEx trade-off which is -- we've got state-of-the-art equipment in there and it allows us to cut the labor about in half, right? In the overall process and produce a cleaner product, on the back-end.So we think that's really attractive. And then, as you know, we always think about an anchor tenant. And a community that's willing to partner with us, in order to do that. And over time, I think you'll see continued investment as we go forward. And build out that product line. Michael Hoffman : Terrific, thanks a lot. And one -- I'll just make one comment. This press release is really useful, the way it's been laid out. Thanks for doing that. Don Slager : Yeah. You're welcome, Michael. Have a good day. I think you had six questions in there. Michael Hoffman : Yeah. I know. Well, if everybody else gets four, five, I had to jump in, yeah. Don Slager : Okay. Operator : The next question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey guys. Just on the 3% yield number is that -- Chuck is that like even through the year. Does it -- do we accelerate off this Q4 number? Or do we just build through the year to end up averaging 3% for the full year? Chuck Serianni : Yeah. It's relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. Michael Feniger : Okay. And then, Chuck, I think you made a comment about like SG&A flat to down. I -- that's on a percent of sales basis or is that on an absolute basis? Chuck Serianni : That's 100% of sales. That's as a percent of revenue. Michael Feniger : All right, all right. Perfect. Yeah. I just wanted to clarify that. And then, just on the acquisitions, you guys have completed already, like if we just take that number, what's the revenue lift on that? Is -- if you just -- with everything that's been completed by year-end so far for 2020? Chuck Serianni : Yeah, the rollover revenue benefit of $68 million. Michael Feniger : Okay. And then just on the acquisitions, you guys completed in 2019, is there any -- obviously the overall effect that we've seen, multiples expand. I'm just curious, if you could kind of touch on -- you mentioned -- Don mentioned, you're leveraging up to buy good cash flow.I'm just curious, if you could kind of help us on, what you've seen in the private market with multiples for some of these businesses? Don Slager : Yeah. Multiples are still very good. We will of course and have and we will continue to we pay more for businesses that have infrastructure, that's critical permits, that are impossible to replicate those types of things.We discount purchase prices, when there's a little bit too much temporary work or too much broker work. We don't pay for that. So, each deal is different. But on a blended basis, when you look at the whole portfolio of M&A that we're doing, we would tell you that multiples are still pretty stable. Operator : Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Did I hear you say that, -- so of the 1% contribution to sales growth in 2020 from acquisitions, which I guess would be $103 million. You've already got kind of $68 million of it completed from last year?Or are there some offsets from divestments in there? And I guess, like is there anything you've closed so far in 1Q that would kind of already get to that $103 million number? Chuck Serianni : Yeah. We said the $68 million is the right number. That's already included in our 1% growth guidance for 2020. Don Slager : Yeah. Some of those deals were deals we thought, we'd close at year-end. And they just didn't get done. They rolled into the New Year. Brian Maguire : Okay. But you're effectively kind of at almost two-thirds of the way through hitting that 1% number already? Don Slager : Yes. Yes, that's right. Chuck Serianni : That's correct. Brian Maguire : Okay. And then last one for me. Just I think some of the cost breakout you give, which are very helpful, looks like on the landfill side those costs were actually down for the first time in a while. I know it maybe was unusually high number a year ago. But I just wondered if you're finally seeing maybe a little bit of a light at the end of the tunnel or some leveling off of the inflationary pressure you've been seeing on the landfill side? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. So -- no listen landfills are important assets to Don's point very, very tough to permit. And we -- environmental compliance is something we take very, very seriously. So -- and we price accordingly to more than cover our cost of inflation. That being said, we work on both sides of the equation, not just pricing, but also on the cost. And we work very, very diligently and have an incredible team here that looks at all our landfills from a centralized basis. And every month we're monitoring every element of the landfill is it producing the right level of leachate right any elevated heat sources. And we're getting in quickly and we're mitigating small problems, so that those small problems won't become big ones. And that's really helped us mitigate our cost over time. Don Slager : Maintenance too is a good story. Chuck Serianni : And I think across the category, you're seeing that in labor. You're seeing that in maintenance. If you take out the commodity impact on the revenue right really, really good leverage on business on the cost side. And we feel that's a great foundation that takes us into 2020 which is helping drive that margin expansion. Brian Maguire : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Don Slager : Thank you, Gary. You've done a great job for us today. In 2019 through the relentless efforts of our people working together at all levels of the company, we outperformed the financial goals we set at the beginning of the year. We achieved strong pricing and we expanded EBITDA margins, generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow and invested over $500 billion in acquisitions.Our strong finish to 2019 sets us up for continued success in 2020. Given the underlying momentum in our business, we're well positioned to deliver approximately 5% top line revenue growth and nearly 6% EBITDA growth. On top of that, we are entering 2020 with one of the strongest acquisition pipelines we've seen in years. We will achieve our 2020 guidance by pricing our products and services to ensure we earn an appropriate return.Partnering with our municipal recycling customers to build more durable economically sustainable recycling programs. Tightly managing our costs and increasing productivity through the rollout of our RISE platform as Jon described and leveraging the current momentum in our business from the investments we've made in our people, the customer experience, operational excellence and our strong market position.As always, we will continue to manage the business to create long-term value for our -- all of our stakeholders. I would like to thank everyone on the Republic team for their hard work commitment and dedication to operational excellence and of course creating the Republic way. Thank you for spending time with us today. Have a good evening and please be safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

Finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in Investor Conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. I hope you are doing well and staying safe and healthy. This is of course an unprecedented time for all of us. So before we get into a discussion of our results, I want to first review the steps we are taking in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.As you know, Republic Services provides an essential service. Our team is working tirelessly to serve our customers and communities. And I want to sincerely thank them for all their efforts. As always, the safety and well-being of our people is our top priority. And we are supporting them by continuing to provide all field employees with role specific PPE and masks, implementing enhanced cleaning protocols, adjusting processes, procedures and physical spaces to enable proper social distancing, rebalancing the workload to keep all people working by reducing overtime, providing supplemental paid time off and enhancing medical benefits to cover all COVID related out of pocket costs; and finally, finding new and creative ways to keep our 36,000 employees engaged, motivated and connected.Last month, we launched our $20 million Committed to Serve initiative to recognize our frontline employees, while also helping to support our small business customers and the communities we serve. We are providing weekly on site meals to employees and have sent home weekly dinners for their families. These meals are being purchased from our local small business customers. We are also providing $400 worth of gift cards to each frontline employee to help them and their families. We're encouraging them to use these cards with our small business customers. In doing so, we're not only supporting our people but also our customers by providing them with what they need most, additional revenue.Lastly, we are donating $3 million to the Republic Services Charitable Foundation. Through its National Neighborhood Promise program, the foundation is focused on rebuilding, revitalizing and restoring local communities. The $3 million will be used to fund the foundation's long-term non-profit partners who support local neighborhoods and small businesses as part of their mission.I'm not surprised by our team's ability to quickly mobilize in a time of crisis. Over the past decade, we've been investing in our business to advance our strategy and enhance long-term shareholder value. Some of these investments include : developing standardized processes, implementing innovative technology, consolidating our customer service operations, and building a world class procurement organization and business continuity function.Through these investments, we\u2019ve built a solid foundation, and even more -- and even a more resilient business. These investments were the driving force behind our superior results in 2019, and our strong start to 2020. Importantly, these foundational improvements have enabled us to be more agile as we navigate the current environment. For example, through our investment in innovative routing and workforce planning tools, we've been able to quickly adjust our routes for changes in demand. And our investment in technology and collaboration tools allowed us to successfully transition approximately 6,000 of our people to work-from-home in a matter of days. And we did so without disruption to our customers, or productivity.As you can see, our company was well prepared. Furthermore, our management and business continuity teams are experienced in navigating difficult times. For example, during the great recession, we successfully adjusted our business to changes in demand and continued to generate strong cash flow. And following some of the most tragic weather events such as hurricanes Harvey and Maria, we were the first waste company back up and running in our markets. Fast forward till today, the investments in our people, processes and technology have better prepared us to manage through this unprecedented time. Next, I'd like to give you some perspective of what we are currently seeing in the business.We started the year strong in January and February. In mid March, some customers in our large container and small container businesses began adjusting their service by decreasing the frequency of pickup or temporarily pausing service. Service decreases continued in late March through mid April and have moderated since then. In the last couple of weeks, we've begun to see customers re-engage with us as they plan to reopen their businesses.Assuming these trends continue, we believe the worst is behind us and volumes will sequentially improve from here. This perspective is consistent with current GDP consensus estimates, which call for a decline in the second quarter, and sequential improvement in the third and fourth quarters. With this outlook, we can expect to generate over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2020.Lastly, before turning the call over to Jon, I'd like to briefly discuss capital allocation. Despite the current pandemic, our balanced approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. We continue to believe that disciplined investment in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value.After investing in growth, we will continue to return our remaining cash flow to shareholders through dividends, and share repurchases. During the first quarter, we invested over $60 million in acquisitions. Our deal pipeline remains strong, and conversations with potential sellers continue to be active.With that, I'll turn it over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Don. Because we are an essential service provider, we have contingency plans in place to ensure continuity of service. As a result, we were well prepared to face the challenges of pandemic. Our priorities are simple and remain unchanged : put our people first, keep our facilities running smoothly, and take care of our customers. By doing so, we will continue to generate strong free cash flow and create long-term value for our stakeholders, including our people, customers, communities and shareholders.As Don discussed, we acted quickly to ensure our employees\u2019 well-being. I'm immensely proud of how well all of our employees have adjusted to these changes. For example, our drivers have remained engaged and focused during this potentially distracting time. Attendance is at an all time high, and April was our best safety month ever. Productivity and service reliability have also improved. In just three days, we transitioned 98% of our customer service representatives to work-from-home with no disruption to our service to customers.In fact, since moving to an at-home working environment, we've seen a meaningful increase in their productivity. Our first quarter results were strong, despite the headwind in March from the pandemic. We increased revenue 3.4% and expanded underlying EBITDA margin by 30 basis points. In the first quarter, average yield was 2.9% and volumes during the quarter increased 40 basis points. Excluding the benefit from an additional workday in the quarter versus the prior year, volumes decreased by 10 basis points. This included a 70 basis point increase in January and February, which was more than offset by a 1.8% decrease in March.In April, volumes decreased versus the prior year, but the magnitude and rate of change vary by line of business.Looking first at our small container business. In March, as shelter-in-place orders were implemented across the country, service decreases began to outpace service increases. Additionally, container weights started to decline. In April, total yards collected decreased by approximately 11% and container weight decreased by approximately 20%. It's important to note that in the last two weeks, trends have become more favorable. Container waste has started to increase and customers are beginning to resume service as they plan for reopening. In fact, last week, services increases fully offset services decreases.In response to these changes in demand, our local teams are leveraging existing tools and technology to adjust routes and rebalance the workload daily. Impressively, productivity in our small container business improved and over time was down approximately 45%, a true testament to the amazing work that our team is doing.Turning to our large container collection business. In April, recurring large container hauls decreased 19% versus the prior year. And temporary large container hauls decreased 14% versus the prior year. Given the decrease in demand, our teams effectively rebalanced the routes and reduced over time by approximately 50%.Next, turning to our residential collection business. In this line of business, we bill customers based on the container size and frequency of pickup rather than on the weight of the container. As a result, given we are continuing to operate as normal, the pandemic has had minimal impact on our revenue. However, as residents consume more at-home and create more recycling and solid waste, our processing and disposal costs will increase. For the month of April, average container waste increased approximately 15% versus the prior year.Regarding our disposal business. In April, third-party tons decreased by approximately 20% and included a decrease in special waste of 34%, a decrease in C&D of 11% and a decrease in MSW of only 7%. Importantly, the rate of decline has begun to moderate and last week total landfill tons were only down 15% versus the prior year.Turning to recycling. During this crisis, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the environment. Thanks to the hard work and resourcefulness of our procurement and operations teams, I\u2019m proud to report that we've been able to continue to operate our recycling processing centers across the country without any disruption. In a time like this, when e-commerce activity is increasing and the demand for fiber is increasing, it is more important than ever to keep our operations up and running safely. We've implemented social distancing and are providing necessary PPE to keep our people safe and our facilities operational. In those areas where employees are stationed less than [40 to par], we've installed plastic protective barriers to help keep them safe.Regarding our environmental services business. In April, U.S. rig counts and associated drilling activity continued to decrease sequentially from the first quarter. As a result, we expect revenues in the upstream E&P portion of our environmental services business to decrease sequentially. In the downstream portion of this business, we are also seeing headwinds, though not as severe. Downstream operators, including refineries and petrochemical companies usually benefit from lower crude prices providing a natural hedge to the volatility in the upstream portion of our business. However, given the unprecedented low demand for fuel, we expect utilization rates to come down and activity in the downstream portion of our business to decrease sequentially.Finally, turning to expense and CapEx. As we continue to operate during this uncertain time, we are adjusting our cost structure to align with real time changes in volume. Importantly, we estimate approximately 60% of our total cost structure, including cost of operations, SG&A and depreciation and amortization is variable. We are closely managing these variable costs. For example, we've put labor management strategies in place to redistribute the workload. As a result, we've reduced total overtime hours by approximately 37%. We are also reducing discretionary spending such as travel and are scaling back on capital expenditures. For example, approximately 10% of our capital budget or a little over $100 million is for growth capital, which we will no longer need to spend this year.Additionally as volumes decrease, the replacement cycle of our assets naturally extends. Therefore, we are intelligently scaling back our replacement capital to align with changes in demand including the construction of landfill airspace and the purchase of replacement trucks, containers, and equipment. Overall, we have been quickly adapting our operations based on changes in customer demand. As always, we will continue to manage the business for the long-term. We've been very nimble during this rapidly-evolving period and we'll be equally ready as the economy begins to grow again.With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our first quarter results. Chuck Serianni : Thanks, Jon. In the first quarter, total revenue increased by 3.4%. This included average yields of 2.9% and volume growth of 40 basis points. Core price net of rollbacks was 5.2%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $24 million or 3.4% versus the prior year. Normalizing for an additional workday in the quarter, EBITDA increased 4.8%. Underlying EBITDA margins increased by 30 basis points.Adjusted free cash flow for the first quarter was $267 million and decreased by $82 million versus the prior year. This decrease in free cash flow was due to the timing of capital expenditures in cash taxes. Capital expenditures in the first quarter increased $74 million and cash taxes increased $25 million versus the prior year. Normalizing for these two items, free cash flow would have increased 4.9% versus the prior year. During this unprecedented time, our balance sheet remains strong, and we will continue to have ample liquidity of $1.9 billion.Looking forward, the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economy remains uncertain, in particular, the pace and timing of the recovery. As a result, we have decided to suspend our detailed financial guidance for 2020.But as Don and Jon discussed, recent trends are encouraging. The rate of volume declines is slowing and we're beginning to see customers plan for reopening. Our employees have rapidly adjusted to new ways of working to stay safe and are as engaged as ever. Our operations teams are adjusting routes daily to maintain productivity and minimize costs. We're increasing customer loyalty by continuing to provide great service to our customers and investing in our communities. And finally, we are prudently managing spending while continuing to invest for the long-term. Assuming these recent trends continue, we would still expect to generate over $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow in 2020.In closing, we mentioned numerous times the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic. But we are all facing a tremendous amount of uncertainty. One thing you can be certain of is the stability and resiliency of Republic Services. In my 20-plus year history with Republic, I've seen many ups and downs, from the great recession to the longest economic expansion in history. What I have learned is that the essential nature of our business doesn't change and what is our ability to generate strong, predictable free cash flow. Remember, the economic environment we're currently in is temporary. And when the economy returns to some level of normalcy, we will emerge stronger than ever.With that, operator, we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] . Your first question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Walter Spracklin : My first question here is on pricing behavior. I know you gave some indication on April tendencies on volume. But can you elaborate a little bit on how pricing behavior among some of your competitors have changed as we've gone into the second quarter during the April period? Don Slager : So, pricing, our pricing perspective remains consistent. We're continuing to invest in our employees and we're continuing price for the quality and committed work that we do with our customers. We have not seen any meaningful change in the market. Now, there's always pockets of behavior here and there, but that's true regardless of where we're at in the economic cycle and again our policies and approaches have remained very consistent. Walter Spracklin : Okay, a follow up question here is on residential volume. You noted that we've seen a pickup in the in the amount of volume that -- volume increases compared to last year. Is there any sense that -- or is there any opportunity here going forward that you can reconstitute your contracts going forward to include a degree of volume pickup. How difficult is that to do? Could that be one of the changes? If you look out to your industry post COVID, if you're looking at any substantial shift in the overall industry, could that be one area where your company could focus and industry overall could focus in terms of pricing residential contracts? Don Slager : Certainly, it'll definitely be something we're talking about. And right now, as we've kind of come through into May, April has been all about kind of stabilizing the business, making sure that the service level, quality stays high, working with municipalities and any sort of scheduled changes that we need to accomplish. As we assess the additional tons that we have absorbed, we'll begin to talk to municipalities about what that means and look for some help. It's too early to tell yet. We'll give you more color on that once we get into reporting a second quarter. Jon Vander Ark : The only other thing I'd add in that is we have a small number of programs that is based on the weight, they\u2019re bag programs, and the industry and we've also migrated away from those programs over the years because they're not easy for the consumer. Having one bin that they pull out to the curb, and having that automated has been safer for us, has been better for the consumer. And you've seen the industry move in that direction. And so whatever we do going forward, we want to make sure that it's still effortless for the customer. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, so Jon, appreciate all the color on April. Very helpful. But if we were to aggregate it all together, is there any way you can just be a little more specific, just basically, what did total revenue do in April just for simplicity purposes? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, well, unfortunately, Tyler we will probably cover that in July when we talk about Q2. So we can't get into overall April trends. But I would reinforce that in most of the places we think we've seen the bottom and we're starting to see recovery. So it's been a really good sign. And also I\u2019d say that bottom has been a much higher floor than I think we initially expected on that front. So we're feeling pretty positive about the outlook. Tyler Brown : Yes, yes, agree there. So Chuck, I know there's a ton of moving pieces, but is the best way to think about it that in aggregate, the decremental margins, let's say ex the commitment to serve should be around 40%. I know it's going to vary by line, specifically, collection versus landfill. But is that probably the best way to kind of think about it? Chuck Serianni : Yes, you're right, Tyler that 40% is accurate. Tyler Brown : Okay. And are you guys seeing any changes in cash collection? Are you seeing an uptick in bad debts? I think you're already thinking working capital would be a drag this year. I'm just -- thoughts of maybe what's that working capital draw might look like? Don Slager : Yes. So we're not seeing anything as of yet. As a matter of fact the DSO went down by half a day, year-over-year, so nothing here in the first quarter. We are thinking that DSO will trickle up during the year and that's already contemplated in our cash flow guidance for the year. Tyler Brown : Okay, and then my last one, from a quick modeling perspective, are you guys still expecting about a 1% contribution from M&A? And would that be inclusive of possibly closing Santek? Don Slager : Well, I think we said, we still expect to do about a 600, 650 of M&A this year, right?I think somewhere in that area, right? So you can do the math on that. It could be more. I mean we'll see how companies come through this pandemic, but the pipeline is full, our people are involved, Santek is on track. So, we will be good. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Just on that point, I think, obviously that deal is not closed yet. It's going through regulator review. We typically wouldn't comment. But other people have put that out there but we're confident we're going to close that deal in the second half of the year. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : My first question is around volume. You've talked about volume stabilizing, services increase offset decreases last week. When we do sort of come back in terms of commercial volume coming back, do you see any structural changes, positive or negative in terms of the shape of the recovery for the waste space, given social distancing or any other things that you think sort of, we see sort of a U-shape recovery on the volume side, any thoughts just structurally post-COVID what to expect in terms of changes around your business? Don Slager : Yes. Thanks, Hamzah. I think you'll see the pace of the recovery be differentiated based on geography and based on SIC code. So, you could imagine things like hospitality are going to be under pressure and that recovery is going to be a bit slower than manufacturing, which we're already seeing factories start to come back online and reopen and production ramp up. So again, we're going to see differences in that capacity as we go forward. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. And just a follow up question. Back in 2012, municipal residential was a weak spot and it was driven by budgetary constraints that all these municipalities had. They're probably having budgetary constraints again. Do you think that -- are you seeing that at all or I guess the Federal Government can bail them out? But, is there any sense that you're seeing in your conversations with municipalities that muni, resi pricing maybe an issue or you're not seeing that today? Jon Vander Ark : No, Hamzah, we're not seeing that today, and obviously something we're looking into actively but don't anticipate any credit or collections issues on that side of the business. You know these are long cycle contracts. So, if there's any pressure, it would show up kind of years from now in a bid cycle. And as we've been holding line in that part of the business, making sure that we get a fair return for all the work that we do. Don Slager : Yes, let me add to that. That was a much different situation too, right? So that was caused by housing but caused by property values crashing, caused by property taxes dropping. The tax base of these municipalities was under pressure. To your point, Hamzah, depending on how this thing bounces back. But if it is some type of a decent U-shape recovery, we're not going to see that kind of an issue, we don't believe. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kyle White : I may have missed it, but appreciate all of the details on small container. I was just wondering if you could provide some more level of details regarding to your large container business. How are trends throughout April, was the exit rate any better, any signs of improvement both on permanent and temporary? Don Slager : On that we think we've absolutely found the bottom and that\u2019s stabilized and starting to see kind of trends of recovery here. You could imagine a temp for example, construction shutdown, Seattle was shutdown, reopened about 10 days ago, the Bay area was shut down in construction, and that begins to ramp up. And we're seeing a number of places that are just going gangbusters. And to Jon's point, while construction was a huge weak spot in the last recession and downturn, I think this is going to turn out to be one of the brighter spots given the housing starts already were at a modest pace and commercial construction still is pretty strong. So, we feel pretty optimistic about that part of the business. Kyle White : Just next one is on capital return. I know you're committed to the balanced approach. But just curious are you still targeting around the 400 million in share buybacks this year. Is there any change to kind of the dividend policy, I know typically you look to increase it in July, just any thoughts there? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. No change to the dividend policy. We've been paying the dividend now for 18 years and that's not going to change. We always say that we would like to deploy our capital by purchasing EBITDA and Don mentioned that our pipeline is very robust right now, our acquisition pipeline. So looking for our capital to work by buying businesses to take advantage of what might be a pretty good opportunity right now. And then finally, returning the rest of the cash that we generate to the shareholders in the form of a share repurchase. So, our capital allocation strategy really hasn't changed. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Silber : I wanted to circle back to your commercial business. I don't know if you can parse this out for you, but even at a high level, this will be helpful. What percentage of your clients you think are just putting their service either on hold or reducing frequency, as opposed to those clients that might not come back? Don Slager : I think we've seen there's three things going on. There's customers who have permanently closed and we've seen very little of that, although in fairness still some shifting and sorting out as the economy starts to get some steam back in it. We're seeing customers who have temporarily suspended their service, as they have had shelter-in-place orders and they\u2019ve had eventually temporarily closed their business. And then we've seen people who have decreased their service where restaurant will be a great example who doesn't have in-room dining but does have takeout. So they may have scaled back their service. We're seeing those customers who have temporary paused their service come back online, and we're seeing now those service increases outpace service decreases in small container, which is a very positive by the way. Jeff Silber : And then you mentioned some of the productivity improvements. You cited the reduction in overtime. Are you seeing anything else in terms of just greater route efficiency, fuel cost savings, any color on those areas would be helpful? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, certainly fuel cost savings is there as oil is at a very low historic level. I would say one of the reasons we've been successful in this environment and the productivity improved is all the hard work and the foundation that we\u2019ve built. So, we've worked really, really hard to keep our people working and employed and that meant everybody had to give up some overtime so everybody could get work and that means people picking up different routes and our different stops. And again, the customer service has improved, the productivity has improved. So real testament to our COO, Tim Stuart and the operating team for how they've done that with operations. And I'd also say this, we've benefited a bit from traffic, right, as people sheltered in place, traffic is down, especially in urban areas, our ability to get around and get to and back from the recycling side of the landfill has certainly improved. Don Slager : But as Jon said in his comments, right, attendance is at an all time high. Safety, that\u2019s our best safety month ever, and engagement is strong, right? And all those things will be benefits for us. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : If I could just go back to the earlier question on price and just be more specific. Can you talk about the take rate that you saw on price increases? And any pushback that you might have gotten on price increases, as we went through the last couple of months? Did you lose any meaningful customers due to your pricing discipline? Just curious if you can put some more detail around that. Don Slager : A very strong first quarter in pricing, again. Very consistent with our historic approach and making sure we get paid for the work we do. And have maintained that approach here in the last six, seven weeks, and have not seen meaningful levels of pullback on pricing. Now, our outlook anticipates some of that as people shift through their business as well. So I'm sure we'll see a little bit of that, but I don't anticipate large movements on that front. Noah Kaye : And then you kind of kept your expectations on M&A intact for the year, you talked about the strong activity. I'm curious if this is a obviously a different environment we're all in now versus a couple of months ago, maybe you could speak to if you\u2019ve seen any change in behavior from potential sellers, or whether that's indicative of lesser or greater opportunity for now or the more medium term, and any maybe short-term air pocket to expect just from a diligence perspective? Can you give some color there would helpful. Don Slager : Yes. I don't think it's a material change. Diligence, for deals we had near closing, diligence has been more difficult because we're not travelling, right? So we've had to maybe slow some of those things down and do some things remotely. That just require a little bit of innovation. But as far as new opportunity goes, I think frankly, as we've said, there are a lot of really good companies out there that we'd like to look at and talk to, some of we already have in the pipeline, there may be some more that come to market, I think for the most part companies have just been busy getting their businesses stabilized.Trying to figure this thing out. And as the market starts to come back, people will start to decide, whether they\u2019re still in this for the long-term or not. We know that we are, and we know we've got the balance sheet and the know how to get it done. So we'll be here to have conversations if there are people who want to otherwise. So we think, it'll still be a good year for us in the M&A department. Noah Kaye : Okay. Great. And if I could ask one more, the Committed to Serve $20 million initiative. I guess first I just want to commend you for this initiative and supporting your employees first. You called out I think about $3 million in business reduction costs from COVID-19 as an adjustment, safety equipment, cleaning. Does that kind of cost fall under this program? Should we think about the sort of $3 million a month being kind of the right level of spend on those things for the near-term, just kind of expectations for an elevated cost of doing business there? Chuck Serianni : Yes. So, the $3 million that we incurred during the first quarter were associated with just keeping our employees safe. The commitment to serve actually is a little bit different than that. That's helping the employees, but it's also helping the communities. So, how much we incurred these costs that we carved out in Q1 going forward, really depends on the duration of the pandemic, and how quickly the economy rebounds. It's a little bit too really to be able to forecast that at this point. Don Slager : Most of those costs were one-time in nature. So, hundreds of thousands of masks we purchased. We talked about putting some structural changes into our hauling companies to promote social distancing, screening, et cetera. So, feel really good about that. We've already always used masks on our recycling centers. So, yes, we have a little more hand sanitizer spend going forward, certainly will for a long period of time. But that's not meaningful in the overall economics. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Could I get, Chuck, what the percent of your labor costs, you all are doing a very good job of giving line item costs and OpEx. And in 2019, what percent of that labor number was overtime? Chuck Serianni : It's about 15% Michael. Michael Hoffman : And when we think about how you've rolled that back, about half of that's come out. Is that what I sort of discerned through all of JVA's comments? Chuck Serianni : Yes. A little less than that, probably closer to 40%. Don Slager : And keep in mind, Michael, not much came out in resi. Resi, we're working harder than ever. So, almost half in large container and small container. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Okay. That helps. And then it's terrific to hear this is a higher low than you thought it was going to be. You mentioned Jon that you were seeing less lost business, I'm trying to say this smoothly and I'm not sure I'm doing a very good job. How many customers you think don't return in the commercial business percentage wise? Jon Vander Ark : Small, I couldn't give you a absolute number or the percentage number. I think it will be small, Michael. Michael Hoffman : Small less than 10%. Jon Vander Ark : It\u2019s hard to forecast exactly what the shape of the recovery is, right? If we're in an L-shape recovery, which I don't think any of us are seeing in our side of the business, yes, it could be that number. But in a kind of a steady rebound here. But I would expect less, but it's hard to say yet. Michael Hoffman : Okay. All right. May I ask one more, if I can? You said $100 million in growth capital spending is not spent, but what is the growth capital spending -- or the total capital spending assumption if you exceed $1 billion of free cash? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. So, we'll give you more information on that, Michael as we work our way through the year here. It really depends upon the duration of the downturn, how quickly we come back, right? We talked about the growth capital. The remaining capital is really replacement, and it just depends on the utilization of our assets, which includes landfills, right? Building additional landfills airspace, and that's all predicated upon tons that we're receiving into landfill. So, much more information to come here in Q2. Don Slager : Yes. Look, Michael, as you know, there is a lot of moving parts, right? So, as I said already in April was all about sort of stabilizing the business, right, working with our people, keeping everybody safe. May will be about keeping everybody sort of enthusiastic and ready to return, we're already seeing all these positive signs that Jon laid out. I mean, there's positivity across all lines of business, all market verticals, there's just a lot of really great stories. If we had 4 hours earnings call we can share, we can find really great stuff, it\u2019s too soon to trend it. Right. So, that's the difficulty, there's just so many moving pieces. And the fact is that we know that we can make changes in decisions in and around CapEx and other areas of spending, which we've done and are doing and will continue to adjust. But there's still a chance right depending on how this return occurs, then we can still catch the bottom edge of our original cash flow guidance, which is over $1 billion, right.So, we're going to be making adjustments every day, every week for near the end of the year. The leadership team gets together every day at 11 :00 AM and reviews every piece of data we have, and it's making decisions daily. And that'll continue under Jon's leadership. So it's been really a great process so far and it seems it\u2019s responding great. So, in July we have a lot more data and we'll have some trend information that will be more meaningful, but I would say we're focused on the cash flow and that just really underscores -- helps stability of the business. Operator : The next question comes from Sean Eastman from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : First one from me just on labor, helpful color on the OT reductions. Just wondering if there's been any offsets there with any potential temporary increases for any employees and maybe just rounding it out with trends in retention, turnover, things like that would be helpful discussion? Don Slager : Sure, maybe I'll start the secondary part of your question. So, retention is at an all time high. We have some natural attrition in the business of retirements and other things, but we don't have a lot of people leaving us for bigger, better opportunities, in part because we have done extraordinary job of taking care of our people, which ties into the first part of your question. The Committed to Serve program was done for a few reasons. One, it was to honor and celebrate our frontline people, right? They perform an essential service and it's a noble purpose, and unfortunately, society doesn't do a great job of recognizing them all the time and this is their moment. This is our opportunity to elevate them and appropriately celebrate them. And then connecting that in with customers, right? Customers obviously are looking for some cost relief, what they really needed revenue and we're allowing our people and empowering our people to go support local small businesses that are our customers and when we do that we support the community. So, we think all of those things are connected and tied together. Sean Eastman : And I'm just curious with OCC really spiking here. Does the typical sensitivity to EBITDA there hold or is there nuances on the volume or operating costs that we should be considering as we kind of flow through the recycled commodity price movement we've been seeing? Don Slager : Yes. The only thing I would say is that keep in mind as -- and we talk about our commodities to basket and OCC is a portion of that basket about 25% also included in there is aluminum and plastics and the pricing on that has actually gone down. Heavy metal, sensitivity really hasn\u2019t changed. Our basket of good $10 change for the year is about $0.03 of EPS. Sean Eastman : Okay, helpful. And just last quick one from me. I'm just curious on the residential dynamic, you guys highlighted some specific numbers around container rate increases. I'm just curious if you're able to help us understand what that means for the margin profile you guys are getting on that business relative to normalized, this time last year say? Don Slager : Yes. So because the disposal is going to be compressed a little bit, but we think it's a temporary issue. And we'll work our way out of it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : This is kind of asked earlier, I might have not heard properly. When a customer opens up, which sounds like you started to see at the end of the month, are they decreasing service levels and pickups versus where they were pre-COVID and are they asking for a relief on that price point? And on this topic, it may be too early, but Chuck, can we see small mom and pop start to get aggressive on that line of business when the economy opens back up? Don Slager : Yes. So we're seeing people call back in. We're not seeing meaningful changes when they come back or they're coming back at the same service level. Obviously, it's a mix as we go forward. We've not seen any kind of movement in terms of expecting a different price point. If we have customers who are under contract, and we've allowed them to temporarily pause that contract given the kind of once in a 100 year nature of this phenomenon, and they've been appreciative that we've allowed them to do that.And they\u2019re mindful of their timing and their opening back up, they're eager to get back to business, right? And their first point of interest is not the price point of their waste in recycling service. It's getting their employees back safely and working and getting customers in their door on that front. And then could we see people be aggressive? Yes, we could, we see that all the time in select markets, there always be a player who does a -- how to do a volume grab here or there at a specific time. I think it's too early to tell whether that's going to be a broad trend, but we've not seen any meaningful uptick in that activity in the last six, seven weeks. Michael Feniger : Okay, good to hear. And I might have misheard this comment, is the decremental EBITDA margins, do you think 40%, is that the total company, is that collection, disposal, both, in the April comment, I was hoping if you just flush that out for us? Chuck Serianni : Yes that\u2019s pretty entire company. So if you think about we're losing our volumes on the residential side of the business, right? It's on small container and on the landfill side, and those have the highest margins in the company. So the decremental margins are approximately 40%. Nicole Giandinoto : But Michael, keep in mind, too, I mean we haven't fully closed the books for April. So, we're talking theoretically what that incremental margin will be. And we'll get more guidance kind of in the second quarter around all the numbers that we've been talking about here. Michael Feniger : And just lastly, you mentioned the pipeline with M&A. Are you in active discussions? Are you seeing a recalibration of the multiples in that pipeline? So clearly, the trailing EBITDA gets a haircut post-COVID or in this new environment. I understand that portion. So I'm just curious if you think there's been a recalibration of just the multiples on net EBITDA or that potential future cash flow? Don Slager : I'll start and let Jon finish. I would say, first it depends on the deal. It depends on the makeup of the revenue, right? So, yes, we're smart enough to look at that. But it depends on what is the makeup of the business. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. So, our activity remains higher than ever. We're in continued dialogue and discussions. We are not snapping the chalk line on pricing those deals, but we're giving sellers an expectation of ranges. But we're waiting to sit through both things where the economy nets out and what the future demand profile is going to be for those assets. And then, overtime, do multiple expectations come down because there's more willing sellers, because their life has changed and it might be a little tougher to run the business in this environment, we'll see. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : And appreciate all the detail on trends in April with all the fluid situation here. And I know, guidance has been pulled, it\u2019s a very tough environment to be able to provide any. So, I appreciate given the sort of $1 billion free cash flow marker there. But I'm trying to just reconcile some sort of conflicting talent versus numbers. It seems like April's not as bad as we could have feared, but still obviously not immune to the environment. But really, I'm getting a lot of optimism out of you guys about the pace of the recovery, the ability to maybe even clip the low end of the original free cash range and it's great that sequentially and maybe on a week-over-week basis, things are starting to improve a little bit. But I guess sitting here, how can you have any confidence that we're going to get back to anything close to normal in the back half of the year? I guess, kind of embedded in the question is, there's no way you get to 1 billion kind of at the current run rate, right? I mean, you need a healthy kind of recovery in 3Q and 4Q to get there. So, is there's something you guys are seeing that we're missing that just would explain the heightened confidence to kind of get to whatever level you need to get to even talking about clip in the low end of the prior range? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Look, I'd say the obviously economic outlook broadly, there's still some uncertainty to it, right? And so, if we get into a double dip, right, because we have a reemergence at broad scale and have widespread sheltering in place in the fall, that would be a different scenario. But based on what we're seeing now, and based on we're kind of consensus is going in the macro environment that we're going to have a tough Q2 and start to see growth in Q3 and Q4, coupled with what we're seeing, which is again, relatively high floor to what some of the early predictions were and already seeing that flatten out and starting to see it move upward. I think those are all positive signs and that's what's embedded in our perspective. Don Slager : So furthermore, right, for years, decades as we've talked to you, the market about what's great about the waste business. We talk about the same things. We talk about our market position being number one or number two in 90% percent of the revenue. We talk about the fact that we're essential service. We talked about the fact that 80% of our customers are under some type of contract. We talk to you about the fact that in our small container business, even in our residential business, the cost per household in the residential businesses generally sub $35 a month, the cost of small container is sub 400. These are not giant spends, these are not the numbers that keep them awake at night. These are not the major parts of their budgets, right. That's what makes the business great. In fact everyone needs us. Okay. And everyone pays us mostly in advance, right, for the service that we provide and that's one of the reasons that we get to get strong pricing. 4% to 5%, poor pricing or a 3% yield is really a small dollar amount for any business, right. All those things are true, when we talked about 1 billion, how we can flex our cash flow or our spending in times like this to still produce pretty strong free cash and maintain a strong balance sheet and have a balanced approach to cash allocation. All those things that we've been telling you that frankly, we proved in the 2001 economic decline, in the great recession, and we'll prove again now. All those things started to -- that's the truth that we've been telling you. And frankly, I think is maybe going overlooked by some people during the last call it seven, eight weeks of this [madness], but we're going to continue to do that and that's not anything -- that's inconsistent with what we've done or what we\u2019ve said in the past. Brian Maguire : And would you tend to agree with you on all those points and just none of us have lived through this and underlying assumption is that those businesses are coming back and continue to operate and that's kind to Michael's question earlier just seems like the big wildcard I think we'd all say. Just on OCC, the price has run up and I just wonder what you could say about volumes and how much of the move higher has been supply shock driven with the new collections from brick and mortar retail and establishment where is usually very higher recovery rates and more consumers through the e-commerce channel and maybe lower recovery rates there. Just kind of really a supply shock driving it higher from what you can tell? Don Slager : I mean keep in mind that we're still down slightly, right, because resi\u2019s way up, commercial or small container is down, right. I mean, there's just less economic activity going on right now overall from the supply standpoint. And then obviously from the demand side, the demand signal out of the back door for second process centers, big pull for fiber, both to support e-commerce but also to support all of the Kleenex and paper towel and toilet paper and wipes and everything else you got some of those are just a pull forward of surge in demand. Some of those I would argue are more permanent. Wipes for example, paper towel. I think we're going to have a elevated level of demand for months or probably years to come. Brian Maguire : Okay, and just last one from me, I can't remember if somebody already asked it, but just on the capital reallocation, thoughts on the share repo. I think you sound like you're still committed to do M&A although maybe the stuff that due diligence you can't travel. But on the share repo, so expecting to kind of continue at a similar pace or does the uncertainty out there maybe pull back a little bit on that? Don Slager : Yes, so I would tell you, first of all our stock is a bargain today, right and we should be buying more of it. But with the uncertainty in the world right now, the prudent thing for us to do is conserve cash, right. So, Chuck talked about having plenty of cash on hand and having plenty of capacity in the revolver. That's the prudent thing for us to do at this moment. Of course, we'd much rather buy more businesses, do more M&A than buy your shares, that's still the best use of cash. So, we're going to take a little wait and see approach. And, as chuck said, we've been paying dividend every quarter for 18 years. So while we don't have an exact dividend policy, we do have a practice that we've honored. So we think we're in a good position from a cash allocation perspective. We look at the intrinsic value of the company today. And if it weren't for some of the uncertainly around COVID-19 we'd be buying a little more of our stocks but we're just going to kind of take a wait and see approach. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin Chiang from CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Just one from me. Just wondering, as you hope your commercial customers restart here, I suspect a lot of them or some of them are probably facing more financial duress. How do you manage the counter party risk during the event that they can't make it all the way through, are you changing payment terms at all, or like what are you doing to make sure that it don't become an elevated bad debt expense sometime down the road? Chuck Serianni : Yes, good question. So our perspective does anticipate some elevated bad debt expense that will inevitably be some customers who don't make it through that. I think that's obvious to everybody on the call. But we have a differentiated approach and a very thoughtful one. So customers with good credit ratings get a little bit of help through this, and we will extend terms of those customers. The longer they've been with us, obviously, we'll replay that loyalty to them, and help them get through this time. On that front, feels pretty good about our approach. We have trained all of our people, both in credit collections and all of our customer service representatives, on all those policies and also the approach. People are going through a very dramatic experience. And we start with a human centered approach understanding what they're going through working with them and getting to a good outcome and we have long and loyal customers, over seven years our customers are with us. And so I'm pretty confident we're going to work through this together. Operator : At this time, it appears to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Don Slager : Thank you, Rachel. In closing, given the foundational investments we've made in the business, we've been operating from a position of strength and we will continue to do so through the recovery and beyond. Our diversified footprint across the broad mix of markets nationwide position us well to benefit at each stage of the recovery.We look forward to working together with our customers and our communities, for they resume operations. Once again, I'd like to thank all of the Republic employees for their ongoing hard work, commitment and dedication to our customers and communities. Each of our employee truly embodies that Committed to Serve spirit. Have a good evening everyone and stay safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Don Slager : Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased with our second quarter results, which clearly demonstrate the resiliency of our business, the power of our operating model and the strength of our cash flow. We delivered strong results in the second quarter by leveraging the solid foundation we built over the last decade. During the quarter we increased adjusted earnings per share, delivered double-digit growth and adjusted free cash flow and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 170 basis points to 29.6%. I'm proud of the results the team delivered and truly inspired by their dedication to the Republic way. Our leaders are working tirelessly to keep our people safe, adjust our operations to changing demand and ensure consistent, reliable service to our customers. Our front-line employees continue to show every day for customers and each other and our support personnel quickly adjusted to new way of working. It was the collective effort of all 36,000 employees that delivered these results. Our economic outlook is positive. Since April, total volume has increased month-over-month through July. In our small container business, we are seeing a similar volume trend. Additionally, container weights increased sequentially through July indicating steady improvement in consumption and economic activity. As always, we are running our business for the long-term and continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience, improve the efficiency of our operations and strengthen our market position. These investments will position us well for future growth. In the second quarter, we continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value creating acquisitions and returning excess cash to shareholders. Year-to-today we've invested $124 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and grow free cash flow. Our deal pipeline continues to be strong and we remain on track to invest $600 million to $650 million in acquisitions this year. In July, our board approved a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend. The consistent growth in the dividend demonstrates the stability and predictability of our cash flows as well as our confidence in delivering future cash flow growth and year-to-today we've returned $99 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and have approximately $600 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We now have greater clarity on how the pandemic impacts our business and how we can continue to adjust operations and effectively manage spending. As a result, we are reinstating our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.175 billion. Our ability to achieve the low-end of our original free cash flow guidance, demonstrates the tenacity of our team, the flexibility of our operating model and the strength and stability of our free cash flow. As an essential service provider, we play a critical role in our communities. This starts by providing uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances and being a responsible and ethical partner in the community. This quarter we were recognized for our efforts and were named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the first time. For this list, 1,000 of the largest US public companies were evaluated and ranked based on transparency and performance across 141 environmental, social and governance factors. Lastly, we recently published our 2019 sustainability report, which highlights the progress we are making on our most significant opportunities to positively impact our customers, employees, communities, shareholders and the environment. I would encourage you to give it a look, it's a great read. Now call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks Don. In the second quarter, we remain focused on our priorities putting our people first, keeping our facilities running smoothly and taking care of our customers. By staying focused on these priorities, we successfully executed our plan and delivered strong financial and operational results. These results clearly demonstrate we're well-positioned to come out of this pandemic stronger and better than before. As expected, revenue decreased in the quarter due to customer's temporarily suspending or reducing service levels. Volume decreased 7.4% versus the prior year. The volume decline was steepest in April and sequentially improved throughout the quarter. In April, total volume decreased 10.2%. In Just, volume improved to a 5.4% decline versus the prior year. The decline in volume and pace of recovery varies by line of business and by market. Landfill special waste volume was impacted the most, decreasing 17% versus the prior year. Special waste volumes were down 22% in April and in June were down 13%. The decrease in special waste volume was primarily due to jobs being deferred, not canceled and the pipeline remained strong. In the second quarter, landfill MSW volume decreased 3.5% and landfill C&D volume was essentially flat. Second quarter small container volume decreased by 8.8%. In April, small container volume was down 10.5%. By June volume sequentially improved 300 basis points and was down 7.5% versus the prior year. Second quarter large container volume decreased 12.4%. In April, large container volume was down 17.3% and by June volume was down 7.2% versus the prior year. We expect volume to continue to recover over the remainder of the year. During the quarter we weigh contractual terms to support our customers in their time of need. We made pausing and resuming service simple and easy. We waived late fees and offered flexible payment plans to our most loyal customers in need of assistance. Our results demonstrate that customers appreciate our efforts and value our service. Our net promoter score increased nine point from the prior year and we maintained our customer churn of 7%. Additionally, we successfully executed our pricing program to cover our cost and inflation. This enabled us to continue to deliver the essential services we provide while being mindful of the challenges our customers faced. Total core price was 4.7%. This included open market pricing of 5.5% and restricted pricing of 3.4%. Core price represents price increases to our same-store customers net of rollbacks. Average yield was 2.5%. Average yields measures the changes -- the change in average price per unit and taken into account the impact of customer churn. Thanks for the team's relentless efforts, we effectively managed our cost and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin a 170 basis point versus the prior year. Due to our investments in innovative routing and workforce planning tools, we were able to quickly adjust our routes for changes in demand. This enabled us to reduce over time by 25% versus the prior year and increase productivity across our entire collection business. For example, in our large container line of business, productivity improved approximately 230 basis points. Throughout the quarter our drivers remain engaged and focused. Attendance remained at all-time high and turnover was at multiyear lows. We all decreased safety-related expenses by 19% or 13 basis point of revenue -- 30 basis points of revenue compared to the prior year. We achieved the best safety performance in the company's history, reducing safety incidences by approximately 20% versus the prior year. During the quarter, we continue to partner with our municipal customers and discuss the impact of COVID on our business. In the second quarter, residential weights were up 10.1% versus the prior year. Weights tapered down during the quarter and by June, residential weights were up 7.6% versus the prior year. We also continue to renegotiate contracts with favorable pricing terms. We now have $850 million of annual revenue or 34% of our CPI based book of business tied to a waste index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. Next, turning to environmental services, during the quarter, environmental services revenue decreased 26% from the prior year. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and a delay of in-plant project work. The decrease in environmental services revenue resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. We expect this headwind to continue in the second half of the year. Turning to recycling, during the second quarter, recycled commodity prices increased 29% to $101 per ton compared to $78 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher cycle commodity prices was partially offset by 11% decrease in inbound recycling volume. Finally, preliminary results for July indicate total revenue increased approximately 1.5% from June. We typically see July revenue increase from June due to seasonality. Total revenue in July was down approximately 3% from the prior year. For reference purposes, total revenue in June was down 3.5% from the prior year. With that, I will now to the call over to Brian. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks Jon. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $743 million an increase of approximately 20% over the prior year. Free cash flow growth was driven by an improvement in working capital, which was partially offset by a $51 million increase in capital expenditures when compared to the prior year. The increase in capital expenditures demonstrates our commitment to invest throughout the pandemic, which will protect and improve the long-term health of our business. The contribution from working capital includes a one-day improvement in DSL, a two-day improvement in DPO and a $35 million payroll tax deferral under the Cares Act. We expect a total payroll tax deferral of approximately $100 million in 2020, which will flip over the next two years. To date cash collections have remained strong. We believe our DSO performance reflects our customer's willingness to pay with a high quality service we provide and the essential nature of our business. We expect the working capital benefit from DSO and DPO to anniversary in the second half of the year since we saw improvement in these metrics in the latter part of 2019. With respect to EBITDA margin, the 170 basis points of expansion over the prior year included 110 basis points of improvement from favorable net fuel and higher recycled commodity price and 60 basis points of improvement in the underlying business. The business absorbed $31 million of COVID-related costs during the quarter. These costs related to the investment made in our commitment-to-serve initiative to recognize our front-line employees and support our small business customers, additional PPE and enhanced facility cleaning to help keep our people safe and supplemental paid time off and enhanced medical benefits for employees and their families. EBITDA margin expansion resulted from reducing operating and SG&A cost by a combined $151 million or 8%. This completely offset the $151 million or 5.8% decline in revenue. Most of the cost reductions resulted from effective cost management that positively impacted nearly all P&L line items. Our focus on cost control will enable us to gain leverage on volume growth as demand returns. Some of the cost improvement resulted from macroeconomic factors that positively impacted results. For example, transfer and disposal costs were down 80 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower container weights in our small container business. Container weights were at their lowest level in April and progressively got heavier throughout the quarter. While we are not providing specific EBITDA margin guidance, we expect second half margin to be at or slightly above the second half of last year. This would result in full year margin expansion. During the quarter, total debt decreased to $8.7 billion and total liquidity increased to $2.3 billion. Interest expense in the second quarter was $92 million and included $16 million of non-cash amortization. Our leverage ratio was approximately three times.. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.1% and in line with our expectations. Finally, as Don mentioned, we are reinstating full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $1.1 billion $1.175 billion. This guidance assumes continued gradual improvement in economic activity through the remainder of the year. And with that operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Walter Spracklin : I guess I would like to start with that great color you gave in July on down 3% and then down 3.5% the month before. If you're seeing that trend and take into consideration seasonality, is there anything to suggest that you wouldn't be into positive growth territory year-over-year by the end of the year? Don Slager : As we said right, we have a positive outlook on the trend right and we feel good about a couple of things. One, residential weight increases have stabilized right and now small container weights are resuming right. So again strength of American business, consumption rates, the consumer we think is getting stronger, people are adjusting to a new way of doing things, you see that all around you right. So we've a very positive outlook. Exactly when it will go positive, we can't put our finger on that and so the guidance we give is around cash flow which we think is strong. We chose in April, we thought we know saw a scenario we can catch by the end of range and now we're telling you we're even more confident than that and all the trends are positive and Jon gave you a lot of great trends on cost management and CapEx and people paying their bills the whole nine yards so to speak. So when it goes positive we'll have more full year in the next quarter and hopefully that will be another good news story we can share with everybody. Walter Spracklin : Absolutely trends are certainly in the right direction here but I guess now looking out a little further, I am not asking for guidance here, but just conceptually, you did a great job of managing costs on the way down so that margin expansion in fact occurred. Is there anything to suggest that as volume comes back through the rest of the year, you look out to 2021 and assuming we have hopefully knock on wood here, we have a macro situation with a lot more normalcy to it, is it not out of the question that margin enhancement here as volumes come back, could be quite substantial given how well you were able to in fact improve margins on the way down. Jon Vander Ark : Let me give you a couple of thoughts there. So there were certainly some macroeconomic benefits that we realized. In the second quarter we kind of talked about that. So for example some of the things we saw around container weight, we would expect those to -- those benefits I would say to moderate as we look forward, but I'd say that being said, we do expect to be more profitable as we look for, we've learned things about ourselves on how we can operate differently, one within cost of operations as well as within SG&A and we would expect those benefits to accrue to the P&L in future periods. Don Slager : Right like Jon mentioned, safety is a bright spot, employee engagement is at all-time high. We expect that to continue. We're still doing great work to take care of our front-line people. But look the acquisition pipeline being full we're talking about tuck-ins obviously we're tucking in into current markets that's a margin enhancement in and of its own. We talk about running business for the long term and sort of the depths of COVID, we were busy adapting to new wave of doing business, but we're back at long-term planning in the business. Jon and his team are still rolling out the RISE platform across the organization, the digital tools. We're well underway there. So we're back at it and all of those things are going to be margin enhancers as we go forward. So there's a lot of good news we'll be talking about here as we get ahead this next couple of quarters off. Operator : Our next question will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey Jon, so I know there's been a lot of chatter out there about rural versus large urban market. I think you guys are about a third, a third, a third rural franchise and urban. You gave some great color in aggregate on volume trends but is there any way you could kind of bifurcate urban versus maybe those small-market if even anecdotally, just basically is there a big difference going on in those different types of markets? Jon Vander Ark : It's very geographic to your point Tyler. We've looked at a lot of productivity data and circumstance to understand, we love traffic obviously, we're more efficient in getting the recycling in the garbage off the ground and surprisingly we're seeing pretty steady trend across both rural and urban markets and you think you get a much bigger advantage in urban markets and we're seeing kind of the same advantage across all of those markets which to Brian's earlier point gives us some confidence that some of the cost that we've captured on the way down, we're going to keep that on the way back in those productivity improvements and I wouldn\u2019t -- again we haven\u2019t -- we're not releasing this data, but I haven\u2019t seen dramatic differences between urban, suburban and rural right in terms of the activity levels in volume. Tyler Brown : That's extremely helpful. Hey Brian just a quick clarification on CapEx. So I think coming into this year, you guys were looking for some heightened spend I think on breakthroughs and such. I think that's stemmed all the way back from the tax bill. First off, is that's the case and did you make that spend and number two, I know 2021 is a long way away, but should we be thinking about that incremental spend peeling off in '21? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah so Tyler of the original $100 million that we were spending it's probably going to be $60 million. So $40 million of that will roll into 2021. Tyler Brown : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just my last one here if I can, so Don you were reiterated that you plan to spend $650 million. I think you\u2019ve done I think you said $125 million year-to-date or so. Is the preponderance of that $0.5 billion sitting in one property, are there more kind of multiple sizable deals out there? Don Slager : Yeah, there is one big deal out there right that we've talked about but there are some others. Again I continue to say look there are a number of really nice companies out there well run and good markets, good people getting to a place in their life cycle where talking those makes sense. We're engaged in some other good conversations. So we've a lot of confidence in the pipeline, but there is one big deal out there that will carry forward for that. Jon Vander Ark : I think one of the bright spots for this is when we explode down pricing deals right in the decline here I understand what demand was going to happen. We never stopped conversation and our acquisition pipeline remains very robust, very active and we now are starting to write deals with sellers as we've got a lot more confident in our outlook and there's and feel really confident going forward for the rest of this year and next year in terms of that one. Operator : Our next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : Hey good afternoon. First of all congratulations Brian on the CFO role. My first question is you talked about second-half margins being slightly above last year and I realize you even have some costs that come back into the system as container weights get heavier etcetera, but maybe could you talk about what you see as sort of permanent cost saves during COVID-19 anything sort of structurally that you think you can take out of your business whether it be realistic footprint or maybe there's other stuff that maybe you can talk about that may be more permanent in nature? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah I'll give you three Hamzah, real estate is certainly one of them and we're reevaluating what roles should always be in the office, what roles can be permanently at home and what roles will have some flexibility to them and therefore we capture real estate savings on the ones that home or the ones that are flexible. I think travel is another one, the tools that we use to work remotely, we have spent far more connected and efficient than we expected. There will be roles, there is a role for travel going forward. So operating completely virtual is not a norm that we'll have but we'll certainly be spending less on T&E as we go forward, as we kind of think about that's both worlds. And then just in terms of labor productivity, I think our ability to flex labor and move people cross-train, move people across different lines of business has allowed us to serve customers really well as well as manage cost the same time and we'll certainly carry some of those forward as we recover from the pandemic. Hamzah Mazari : And then just on pricing, I know a lot of the pricing is already locked in, in Q1 and I'm not asking you to comment on your competitor, but they had much lower average yield and maybe we're giving more price relief. Could you just maybe talk about how you were able to keep pricing pretty steady as well as in the face of really down volume. Maybe just talk about your pricing tools and how you see pricing build up for the balance of the year or you expect it to be pretty consistent. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. So we look at a range of options. Obviously, they're given with an unprecedented event and definitely want to be empathetic to customers who were their businesses were changing dramatically. So as I talked about, we let people break contracts to suspend service. And were in constant communication with them about when they could come back at a time that was right for them. We were flexible on payment terms with some of our customers and certainly offered that too many more, that didn't take us up on it, and then spent a lot of time and energy on committed reserve. So we put money in the hands of our frontline people to serve our customers. So our philosophy was that customers while they maybe need a little cost relief, what they really needed is customers and revenue, when we got our local teams engaged and energized to power our small business customers through a very difficult time and got a lot of positive feedback from our customers on that front and listen, we are out there every day in a tough environment, picking up the recycling and the garbage and doing a hard job and our customers are noticing it, and they're paying us a fair price for the hard work that we're doing. So I think that's the primary reason we've been able to sustain it. And going forward, I think we see more of the same obviously, there's some puts and takes in terms of year-over-year and some fees that might change year-over-year, but the philosophy is not changing. And we expect a strong pricing performance in the second half. Don Slager : Look, they\u2019re paying us a fair price, and they're paying us on time. And I think to Jon's point, I think they value the service, and rewarding us for the hard work and the effort our frontline people are putting out so. Hamzah Mazari : Got you. And I just have a last clarification question. That's very helpful. The $600 million to $650 million in M&A, is that a new normal going forward for you guys, it used to be a lot smaller, but you're seeing your peers do a lot more transactions. And so has the philosophy changed at all? Or this is just sort of a time where you're just seeing much more in the pipeline, and then it goes back to sort of a normalized, I think it was, maybe it was $300 million of annual deals used to do? Don Slager : Well, I think, even Jon just said, with the pipeline, not only strong for the remainder of the year, the $600 million to $650 million range, we've given what we think is strong into next year. So do I have an outlook for the next 10 years, I don't, but I would tell you just based on where we are, in this point of history again, there's a lot of great companies out there. We know where they are, who they are, we have ongoing conversations, we think that a sort of a robust pipeline of deals and a continued appetite for good deals, good companies is going to be somewhat of a regular diet for us, at least into the future here, we can see and certainly, we have the appetite, we have the ability and the team continues to demonstrate their ability to very efficiently integrate these things. And after we get everything up to start a company standard really turn into cash flow on that, we think that generate. And as we look back at the deals we've done, we've got a high degree of confidence in what they've delivered. So we know that, we're paying the right price for deals and making the right assumptions on the way in. So it gives us all more competence to keep ongoing. Hamzah Mazari : Great, thank you so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi, good afternoon. And like everybody's congratulations on the nice quarter, solid job managing the cost there. Don Slager : Thank you, Brian. Brian Maguire : Just on the -- back on the margin outlook. There's one thing I'm trying to reconcile is 2Q is the worst for volumes down 7.5% or so and the best for year-over-year margin and volumes are getting better on a year-over-year comp basis for the rest of the year, it sounds like but the margin gains aren't getting there quite as good as it, is that really as simple as a recycling fuel kind of contribution sort of going away and maybe a little bit from a higher container weight or other some other puts and takes, some factors in there? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I would sit there and say it's what you just mentioned quite honestly. So from where fuel prices are right now, we think sequentially that steps down about 40 basis points. So starting with our 29.6 in the second quarter, there would be a sequential decline of 40 basis points. And then commodity prices would be another 20, right. So you're already down 60 basis points just with those two, and I talked about the container weight, right. And we saw those lighter by 20% in April, and actually by July, that's down to about 6%. So that benefit that we enjoyed in the second quarter, we don't expect that to repeat at the same level, going forward. But quite honestly, while it's a near-term cost headwind, it's actually a good sign, right. It's a really good sign for the health of our small business customer. Nicole Giandinoto : And Brian, the other thing to keep in mind, if you recall when the CNG tax credit was passed, we recognized two years worth of benefits in the fourth quarter of 2019. And so that is giving us a headwind for example, in the fourth quarter of 50 basis point headwinds. So about call it 30 for the second half. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, so that's something we have to overcome. Brian Maguire : Got it, so we\u2019re talking about our second half margin, it is cumulative number, so your 3Q could be quite a bit better, but 4Q will have that unique headwind like? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, which is just a timing thing. Brian Maguire : Yes, thanks. And then, just a question on capital reallocation with the outlook being a little bit better and be able to get back to providing guidance? Do you think we get back to buying shares back more periodically, like the closure around beforehand? Or is it a little too early to be thinking about reopening that window? Jon Vander Ark : Look as I said, we've got $600 million remaining on the authorization, we continue to look at the intrinsic value of the business. Again, we look at that based on our three-year outlook and our three-year plan, right. So we're looking at real actionable plan against what, how we think the stock will perform. You look at our track record, we've always taken a balanced approach with that intrinsic mindset. At the same time, we've said look we will flex buyback based on opportunity in the market as it relates to M&A and maintain the optimal leverage ratio of call it right around three times and so all those things are in play. We've got a lot of flexibility. We got a lot of dry powder. We've got a lot of capability. So we're in a good place. And if the market allows it and we see an opportunity, we'll buy opportunistically just as we have. And frankly, I think we'd beat the market year-in and year-out. So the balanced approach won't change. But we'll continue to look to put our money to work and return to shareholder is the best way that we can, we think we do it as efficiently as anybody. Brian Maguire : Okay and just last one for me, just back on the pricing outlook, it sounds like we saw a little bit of a step down in the year-over-year growth rate, which was expected I think just as the year progresses, the comps get a little bit tougher on a year-over-year basis. Should we just expect a little bit more gradual depletion in that line item? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, it\u2019s gradual. Again, there's some timing things year-over-year. So some of our fees are impacted by fuel declines. There's a year-over-year decline on that, but our core pricing philosophy is not changing. We want to send a fair price with the hard work that we do, and customers reward and value that and pay us. Brian Maguire : Got you. Thanks Jon. All right, congrats again. Have a great quarter. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks Brian. Operator : Our next question will come from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, hey Jon, thank you for the details regarding how borrowings progressed through the quarter and the details on total revenue in July, but curious if you could kind of give similar level of details on how borrowings were in July by line of business, how a small container and roll-off and such? Jon Vander Ark : No, we're not giving that level of detail on July. But steady recovery across that, and I would say that we have a little bit of a geographic headwind that we've had to overcome as the COVID cases initially started out in the Northeast and we're heavily impacted, or we have a lighter footprint, the heavier caseload in the last couple of months has been in the South and Southwest. So Florida, Georgia, Texas, Arizona, California, we have significant market positions in all of those markets. And yet we're still seeing volumes recover. So that gives us a lot of optimism. But the outlook is positive. There's still uncertainty of course, there's going to be puts and takes across different geographies. And week-to-week, we're running the business for the long-term, but we feel like we certainly far more than exceeded the floor, and we're on our way to a nice day recovery. Brian DelGhiaccio : I think in Jon's prepared remarks, he mentioned seasonality, right. So we actually are seeing some seasonality in the business. And so with all that Jon just mentioned overcoming what's happening out there again, that leads us to our positive outlook. Kyle White : Got you, that's helpful and apologies if I missed this and appreciate the free cash flow guidance provided, but did you provide any other kind of moving parts there? What do you expect the CapEx for the full-year, what about working capital? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, we actually in our guidance, we provided the various components including, what we expect from a cash from operations as well as our CapEx. So you can actually see the various components in our 8-K filing. If you kind of take the midpoint of the range though, what we're kind of thinking, it's approximately $1.1 billion of CapEx. Jon Vander Ark : And the only thing I will add about, our CapEx plan is naturally pulls back when we don't have the volume, 10% of our annual CapEx typically is for volume growth. And we're not seeing that growth, we're naturally not going to spend that CapEx, what we see decline in some of our replacement schedules for trucks naturally push out, we're still investing in the business. We're still working on projects, still investing in our digital operations platform which is rise and run the business for the long-term. So the team's done a great job in the face of a pandemic, not just working the quarter but working for our multi-year plan. Brian DelGhiaccio : Again it just reiterates the flexibility we have in the business model, when these things happen, we've got the ability to flex very quickly and still produce the cash flow and meet our obligations. So again, I think it\u2019s the great outcome of a lot of great work from the team. But again, it just really shines right light and conversely, the business model is. Jon Vander Ark : And Kyle as I mentioned, the midpoint of right around $1.1 billion, the range is $1.075 billion to $1.15 billion. Kyle White : Perfect, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Our next question will come from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean, your line maybe muted on your end. Sean Eastman : Hey, sorry about that guys. I'm at my mom's house. So just kind of keep it quiet. So guys really impressive job. Congratulations. I just wanted to ask sort of a higher level question. I mean post-COVID it does seem like we could see pockets of population growth in pretty different parts of the country, relative to what we've seen over the last many years. So I'm just wondering, whether that or anything else sort of in the post-COVID world is changing, how you guys are prioritizing or focusing your capital investment dollars or M&A dollars. And any thoughts there would be great. Don Slager : So look, our strategy around market position hasn't changed, right. We strive to be number one or number two in the markets we serve, we strive to be vertically integrated. And again, the results you see there are result of decades of building around that pillar of our strategy. We want to get in front of the growth, right. We want to be where people are. And so when you think about the Sunbelt that we talked about from Portland, Seattle, Washington, down the coast across Texas, up into the Carolinas, and all the little pockets that people are moving into hotspots like Nashville, right, we're there. We've got a great business mix, a great business portfolio of urban centers which sort of picks-up some of the growth around sort of the urbanization trend. We've got a great business position in secondary markets, right. And so look, you won't see especially winder in the markets. We're not in and do startups, just because they're hotspots for people. But if we can take a number one or number two position in an adjacent market that we're not in currently but next door or brand new market, we'll do that. And we've done that, we've done that over the last couple of years, you've seen us go into some, some new secondary markets because we were able to take a nice position. So again, we've got a great pipeline, we've got a great M&A team, a great leader in that group. And again, we've got the balance sheet to continue to grow that way. Great thing about our business, again as population grows, as business formation grows around that, we're very well situated with our portfolio and the fact that we're East and West and North and South kind of insulates us when they're sort of micro pockets of bad news, right. So while there may be a couple of cities right now where the epidemic still on the upswing where plenty of cities where the numbers are going the other way, and so we're getting that balanced benefit. So again, that's the strength of the portfolio, the power of the portfolio. And so one thing that will change in our outlook is just as Jon said, I mean, we've learned a lot on how we can work a little differently. And we're taking all those lessons to heart, that will make us better. It'll make us even more attractive company to work for. It'll make our employees even more engaged. It'll make us leaner. But it won't change our outlook on how we grow. And again, I think we're very well situated for all of that. Sean Eastman : Yes, that makes sense. Good answer. And next, I just wanted to give Brian the floor. I mean, congrats on the CFO role. Just curious, over the next 12 months, where you think you're going to be spending the biggest chunk of your time from an operational perspective, what's the big priority as you come into the big seat here? Brian DelGhiaccio : Well, look, I mean I think the traditional role of the CFO, when you just think about making sure that we have good quality financials, I mean going to be spending obviously my time on that, but even more so when you think about me keeping right the IT department and when we think about our investments in technology, how they're enabling things like our platform, how they're doing things, quite honestly, even on the SG&A and when we think about modernizing our core systems, that's where I'm going to be spending the majority of my time, just to make sure that we set ourselves up well for future growth and enhance profitability. Sean Eastman : Got it. I appreciate the time and nice work again. Brian DelGhiaccio : Okay, thanks. Don Slager : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead. David Manthey : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. On the call, you mentioned that you're questioning your own real estate footprint. I'm wondering do you have an opinion on the near-term outlook for commercial construction in general and how that might influence your business into 2021? Don Slager : Not a strong one given the uncertainty, only that construction has held up pretty well, right if you think about right? If you had you at C&D tons into our landfill or we printed a pretty strong quarter there. And I think in many markets construction has been the bright spot and everything else was shut down and people are sheltering in place. In most markets construction had an exemption. And really strong obviously on the residential side, right construction, probably a lot of current projects getting finished, but we're still seeing new activity in market, so probably too early to tell in terms of the longer-term outlook. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, one thing I would add to that is I\u2019m hearing a lot of people talk about, how they'll use space differently, not necessarily having less space, but having more open space and having more space between cubicles and I know for us for a long time, we need more office space, so we went from the 10 by 8 cubicle to the 8 by 8 cubicle to the 6 by 6 cubicle and just to sort of squeeze people in. So I've heard that from a number of companies that they're going to use this opportunity to maybe maintain some of the space they have and just make it more wide open, more, more sunlight for their people, more meeting space that's required that kind of thing and just to appeal to the next generation of workforce, so I think that's going to be true for a lot of people. David Manthey : Okay, thank you. And then D&A and tax rate expectations for the full-year 2020. If you didn't give those and then somewhat related the July revenue, month-to-month increase of 1.5. Do you just tell us what the normal seasonality ranges from June to July? Brian DelGhiaccio : That's a pretty typical of what we say. David Manthey : Okay, yes. Nicole Giandinoto : And then as far as tax rate goes, our assumptions haven't changed from the original guidance that we provided. So we're looking for the full-year\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate of 21%. And then just keep in mind, we also have a tax related non-cash dollar charge that shows up below operating income. We expect that charge to be about $110 million and waited to the fourth quarter. David Manthey : All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Thanks. Hi, Don, Jon, Bill welcome back. Don Slager : Hi, Michael. Jon Vander Ark : Hi, Michael. Michael Hoffman : I'd like to tease out the free cash flow outlook as they lay the pieces out and I think about your typical ratios like you've been tracking at 40%, 42% conversion ratio, your cash flow from ops are 22%, 23% of revenues just sort of teasing all those pieces together to try and figure out what was going on, it feels like this should be better than 11 to 175. So what's our headwinds in the second half, you gave a couple of them earlier, to take if only to give about $4 million of incremental free cash to be at the midpoint? Don Slager : Yeah Michael, let me give you a couple of numbers here right. So I talked about in my prepared remarks that we expect the working capital benefit to flip in the second half of the year and quite honestly that's just because we saw really strong DSO and DPO performance in the second half of 2019. So it's not expect that we expect those to step down in the current year. It's just going to anniversary. So we no longer enjoy that working capital benefit in the second half. The real big deal is the cash taxes. So when you take a look at what we expect to spend in cash taxes in the second half, it's over $100 million more than what we spent in the first half. The other thing I'll just point out is just because we had some refunds in the prior year, we would expect cash taxes to at least $100 million more on a full-year basis than in 2019 and just to your final point, cash tax as a percent of provision was about 12% last year, this year we're expecting to be about 70%. Michael Hoffman : 17% or 70%? Don Slager : 70%. Hey Michael did we mentioned that we reinstated our original free cash flow guidance? Michael Hoffman : I know the original guidance is actually $100 million on the upper end, on the higher end. So it feels like maybe that's not actually out of reach. Don Slager : Well look, nothing is ever out of reach. How's that? Michael Hoffman : Are the ratios I talked about still consistent kind of 40% to 42% of EBITDA or 22% to 23% of cash flow from ops as a present to revenues? Is that the way to think about thing? Don Slager : Yeah that's fair and again I think the big impact theirs is just going to be cash taxes with what you're seeing at that 50-plus conversion that we're seeing in the first half versus what a more normalized rate would be. Michael Hoffman : Got it and just to close on the acquisition type text $450 million, so that leaves to $200 million to do tuck-in that's kind of what you've spent consistently for decades is $200 million tuck in. Don Slager : Yeah I don't know your question unless you're just emphatically agreeing with me but\u2026 Michael Hoffman : I just feel like there is some confusion and I'm like there is not any confusion. Don Slager : Look back through all the years you've known us, we have a really good track record of telling what we're going to do and then doing what we say and we wouldn't tell you what we're telling you if we didn\u2019t have a pretty good handle on it right. So we're very committed to growing through acquisitions but I can't say enough about the team that we have in place. The person leads that team, the amount of time that we spent talking about it and the amount of great companies that we see out there. So we're in that game and we're going to continue to make intelligent investments in growing our business, expanding our business that way and that's going to be, we'll be right in the hunt along with anyone else and hopefully because of relationships because of our style, because of our ability to get things done we'll get more than our fair share. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead/ Michael Feniger : And Don if you could take a step back for very long time, there was the goal for public to get back to its prior peak margins in that 30% to 31% range, it's been out there for a while and some investors were frustrated, they didn't know if the maintenance and one fleet these initiatives were actually going to benefit. I think put up this quarter and I know that like Brian said it's macroeconomic driven, but focusing on retainer weights, but Don maybe you can kind of talk about how you think about those margin targets? We haven\u2019t heard about that in a while. The maintenance expenses seem like it's really under control this quarter landfill cost, I am just curious how you view this quarter in the context of getting and what you guys talk about the market on a full year basis this year in the context of those prior peak margins? Don Slager : Sure let me start by stating that the 30% margin goal is still very much in our minds and very, very real. There are two main things that have sort of in our nemesis there. One was the CPI escalator built into all of our contracts for decades that we've been overcoming and John mentioned in his remarks the great progress that the team has made in moving away from that archaic element of our contract into something that is more relevant and the teams are doing a great job there. And so that's just another way of showing that once remind something we move the needle, we move the market. We did that with the recovery fee, we're doing it now with alternative index and then the other thing that's our nemesis is recycling right and again we have really put a stake in the ground here. We talk about recycling measure we're second 2.0, the team has made an incredible improvement in progress in moving off all the old way of pricing and sharing in the risk and getting that risk appropriately balanced and that's more to come. So not only are we getting it done with our customers, because our customers value what we do and are willing to pay and understand the fairness of it, but the market is moving right. We're seeing that become more and more of a norm because it's just common sense to do it that way and so again and as that -- as those two things continue to shift as we close the gaps on that alternative index and on the recycling sharing arrangement, those by themselves go a long way toward getting us to 30%. Now just those two things and again if you look at the progress just trend them out in and the team is fighting hard and Jon is committed his eye and to get that done and believes that he will. Now again on top of that again some of things, some of the learings through COVID-19, some of the way we think about how we'll move forward and some of the -- pudding those learings to work the way we work differently remote working even the I think we can maintain some of our safety performance and some of our productivity performance as Jon said, the teams is committed to do that. Now to layer in rights, the teams has been hard at work getting that put into the business and we've got a great percentage of it implement and that's just the first phase and then this is going to be the gift that keeps on giving right. Once we get sort of digitized there and we get the initial benefits then it's going to be one chapter after another of new opportunity that, that will present to us right and so look there are a lot of great supplement horizon. You can't take all that obviously into the remainder of 2020, but as we get further along as we always do, and I told with the preliminary outlook and that we'll share some of those details with you in as the world starts to settle down too right. Then we'll start sharing some of that in February next year. But we think the outlook is very bright and 30% margin is very much in our minds and very reasonable goal in our perception. Michael Feniger : And just lastly, over the years your volumes were a little lighter than your peers and you guys were shutting business, there were talks about non-regrettable losses. Is your book of business now higher quality than it was a few years ago to help get through a time like that. You guys haven\u2019t talked about those non-regrettable losses in a while, but I'm just curious if you could help us with the context you guys going through that process and where that leaves you now in this tough backdrop. Thanks Don. Don Slager : Yeah we spend a lot of time understanding the customer. Not all customers are equal and they are all going to have the same need. So we specifically put a lot of time and energy targeting customers that are willing to pay and willing to stay. Loyalty is a big part of our strategy and where we invest our time and energy and to your point, we had some optimization across the portfolio and a little bit of that will happen all the time as we acquire some more top gains bits and pieces of that business but we feel very, very good about our portfolio. In terms of customers who are willing to pay at all levels from initial subscription all the way up to national accounts and everybody has got to pay their fair share. We feel really good about the progress we've made. Operator : Our next question will come from Henry Chien with BMO. Please go ahead. Henry Chien : Have, good afternoon thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to dig in a little bad and ask you about the pricing dynamic it's been very strong and yeah I was a bit curious if you could talk a little bit more about what's driving that and how much of that is structural supply shortage, if you will willing in disposal capacity and how much of it is like what you're saying before and just proving more value to your customers and what that is that's keeping that price at a pretty solid rate? Don Slager : For sure let's start with this notion of being an essential service right. We really are an essential service and with all the work we've done as John just mentioned to understand customers what they want, what they value, what do they want to pay for, that reliability is top of mind right and just like when you go to turn the faucet you expect the water to come out and you go to flip the light switch, you expect the lights to come on, when you roll the cart to the street, you expect it to be gone that same day within the same window of time. The work we've been doing operationally with one fleet -- fleet helpfully reliability is paying dividends today. The work we've done around a workforce planning and our employee engagement and route readiness, all those things right are coming to bear today. Employee engagement now it makes us safer but it makes our entire organization think about how we better serve the customer right. And so we got about NPS going up towards the nine points or very much wired around that. So when we think we have a service that is valued by our customers, when we show up the way we do with that relentless attitude to get the job done and then we do that even in a difficult time, we feel like we can continue to price through that event and we did that and our customers rewarded us for our hard work. If you back all the way up to the macro right, you have a rational environment out there, when you think about the cost of disposal, the limited amount of ample space even though we have a lot of years ahead of us, it's more and more difficult to get that space permitted and so on. All those things continue to play into just a strong environment and I am really encouraged when we think about and we talk about this for the call, the strength of American business and the business mentality of people all the way back, the strengthen of the free market, not to get too patriotic, but the American spirit right. When we see our own people showing up every day that's happening in other companies as well, that happening in other businesses, that happening with our customers and people have a much more positive outlook I think in the world than what you read in the headlines right. And we're seeing right here in our numbers. We're seeing it right here in the consumption, in the waste generation rates, our story tells a different story than what you might read if you just read the newspaper. So look that strength on the business model and our pricing tools and the way our field leaders work with our pricing meters here and that what we do is really important and has value and what I am telling you like the digital tools will further enhance that relationship. We're going to connect cabs to customers. We're going to further improve the quality of the product and that's going to give us continued pricing power as we move ahead. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Don, you mentioned a couple of times the digital investment in RISE, you started to roll that out last year and at least just the initial folks is really about really about improving effect efficacy and real-time routing information and data visualization. You mentioned that you had implemented a fair amount of that in pandemic, then the pandemic hit and first I would imagine the new variables into the mix to your operations and test that pipeline. So how does it perform? What impact did it make or benefit that you see. How does that experience and form your current your digitalization plans going forward. Don Slager : Yeah it performed well just through from a plumbing standpoint, right. The IT team did an incredible job that everything right we move people around and included the right platform right operating without a hitch. So the technical side of it operated very well and the performance side operated well to capacity. One those that had it implemented already, used it to really reconfigure the operations, right? As weight got heavy on residential and there was more demand there, and then things got contained or constricted in small container, large container, we were able to optimize routes in a great way and then the deployment itself back to your cost of what goes away. Our deployment was a typically hand to hand combat model where we would go out and spend a couple of weeks, working shoulder to shoulder. COVID didn\u2019t allow us to do that. So we've deployed those things entirely remotely. We did stop the pace. We kept going and the performance in a remote deployment has been on par, the deployment and the in person deployment. So as we think about continue to put tablets in the cab and all the further ways of digital operations, our ability to do that both from a cost and a steep standpoint improves and that's a great learning coming out go. Jon Vander Ark : Look when you think about that from a change management perspective, we've gone from sort of push to pull right, the things that we're producing here are value added in the minds of our frontline leaders and they're anxious to get those tools in their hands. So they're very willing and able to implement that but they're pulling that capability and so I am hopeful that our speed to change, the more and more we do these things, our speed of change can actually increase as well. Noah Kaye : That's great color and maybe just one more and you mentioned that a couple times here, the progress on moving the CPI book of business to an alternative pricing mechanism, now if I go back three years, you basically do you want to double your revenue exposure to an alternative index, but just given that you're highlighting that as one of the keys to continue move the margin profile up, can you share with us any targets a benchmark that you're really hoping to get to say over the next couple of years, how you want investors judge that progress and frankly how does what's happening now the current environment impact that? Jon Vander Ark : We haven\u2019t actually shared the absolute goal and look I would just ask you to look at the progress we've made as a testament to the ability to do it. There are a lot of factors, when contracts come due, the size of contracts and just the pace of change, the dynamic of the market, all those things are variables to get to work through but I'll tell you that again we're committed, we see the market moving and we're going to stand here every quarter and tell you about the progress we're making and you can hold us for that. Don Slager : Yeah I think the progress we've made during this pandemic is a good indication of our result and commitment. Because our municipal sales team is pretty busy at City hall because we still have some customers from a recycling standpoint that we need to get into a different risk in relationship with, still some work to do on alternative index, obviously. And as more people work from home and we're are going to envision probably being a little heavier those initial contracts completed, we're going to have a dialogue about getting pace of the work we do and that's going to be a very important piece. Again fairness is on our side. All we're trying to do is get paid for the work we do and we've got a pretty good track record when that's the argument our customers working with us. That's great and again that's upside. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Don Slager : Thank you, Grant. In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and we're well positioned as volume continues to recover. Despite volume declines, we grew earnings, delivered double-digit free cash flow, expanded adjusted EBITDA margins. We also reinstated full year adjusted free cash flow guidance, which includes the low-end of our original 2020 guidance range and then we mentioned that we raised our dividend for 16 years straight. That's a lovely stat.\\ Once again, I'd like to thank all Republic employees for their ongoing hard work, commitment and indication to our customers and communities each of our employees truly embodies the committed to serve spirit. Have a good evening and stay safe.",

Republic Services is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RSG. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Stacey Mathews, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Stacey Mathews : Hello. I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Don Slager, our CEO; Jon Vander Ark, our President; and Brian DelGhiaccio, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our performance. I would like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information we discuss on today's call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and may be materially different from actual results.

Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services, Inc. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Republic Services is strictly prohibited.  I want to point out that our SEC filings, our earnings press release, which includes GAAP reconciliation tables and a discussion of business activities, along with the recording of this call, are all available on Republic's website at republicservices.com. I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Donald Slager : Thanks, Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased with our third quarter results, which clearly demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our business. The Republic team is working hard every day, delivering quality service to our customers and communities. Our deep expertise and dedication, together with the strength of our market position and assets, made these results possible. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1, which is an 11% increase over the prior year, and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 230 basis points to 30.3%. These strong operating results, together with effective cash management, helped us deliver $1.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow through Q3, which represents a 14% increase over the prior year. We believe investing our free cash flow in quality acquisitions is the best way to increase long-term shareholder value. We continue to prioritize acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. Year-to-date, we have invested $154 million in acquisitions. We recently received regulatory approval on a leading recycling and solid waste provider in the Twin Cities area. Combined with the previously discussed pending acquisition of Santek, we now expect to invest $850 million to $900 million in acquisitions in 2020. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we expect 2021 will be another strong year of activity. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $500 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our Board recently approved a $2 billion, 3-year share repurchase authorization, which will begin in January 2021. This is consistent with prior practice. As we look forward, we remain optimistic about our business and continued prospects for profitable growth. Pricing continues to exceed cost inflation, volumes continue to recover and margins are expanding. Accordingly, we are raising our full year 2020 adjusted free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion.  Additionally, with better visibility through the end of the year, we are reinstating adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.37 to $3.40 for the full year 2020. With respect to 2021, Jon will provide some color in just a few minutes. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to congratulate the Republic team for being certified as a Great Place to Work for the fourth consecutive year. We believe an engaged and diverse workforce is the greatest indicator of our success and the most important element in driving lasting results. This is yet another recognition of the inclusive culture we are building at Republic, one where the best people come to work. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Don. During the third quarter, we successfully executed our pricing program, improved volume performance on a sequential basis, effectively managed costs and continued to make investments to drive future growth. Total core price was 4.5%. This included open market pricing of 5.4% and restricted pricing of 3.2%. Core price represents price increases to our same-store customers, net of rollbacks. Average yield was 2.6%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit and takes into account the impact of customer churn. As expected, volumes were down compared to the prior year, but our performance improved sequentially. In the third quarter, volume decreased 3.4%. This compares favorably to the 7.4% volume decrease we experienced in the second quarter with all lines of business showing improvements from Q2 levels. By September, volumes were down only 2.7% versus the prior year. Third quarter small-container volume decreased by 4.8% and was relatively consistent throughout the quarter. We continue to see most of the volume decline concentrated to customers in the education, hospitality and restaurant businesses. However, we continue to see positive signs in our customer base, including small-container customers.  Approximately 80% of customers that paused service have now returned, and approximately 45% of customers that decreased service levels at the onset of the pandemic have subsequently resumed. Said another way, only 1% of our small-container customer base is not receiving some level of service. Additionally, container weights were only 5% lighter during the third quarter compared to 13% lighter in the second quarter. This suggests continued improvement in economic activity.  Third quarter large-container volume decreased 5.4%. The volume decline was relatively consistent between the permanent and temporary portions of this business. By September, large-container volume was down 3.7% versus the prior year. Total landfill volume decreased 3.1% versus the prior year. This included an increase of 3.3% in MSW volume, which is offset by a decrease of 2.5% in C&D volume and a decrease of 11.7% in special waste volume. The decrease in special waste volume was due to jobs being deferred, not canceled, and the pipeline remains strong. Our customers continue to value our quality service and commitment to supporting them throughout the pandemic. Our Net Promoter Score increased 8 points from the prior year, and we maintained our low customer churn of 7%. We continue to invest in capabilities to deliver our customer-centric digital experience, which we believe will further differentiate us from our competitors. For example, during the quarter, we began piloting automated proactive communications to our customers. This allows customers to set up customized preferences to receive tailored communications through the channel of their choice. Further advancements in customer-facing technology were made possible by the strong foundation we built as part of our digital transformation, including our RISE platform. We continue to partner with our municipal customers to address the impact of COVID on our business. Third quarter residential weights remained up 10% versus the prior year, which was consistent with Q2. We also made further progress on renegotiating contracts with favorable pricing terms. We now have $855 million of annual revenue or 34% of our CPI-based contracts tied to a waste-related index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. From an operational perspective, we effectively managed cost to meet the change in underlying demand for service. Thanks to the team's unwavering efforts, we reduced cost to more than offset the decline in revenue. This resulted in a $41 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion of 230 basis points. This was enabled in part by our RISE platform, which allows us to dynamically adjust our routes. We are now 97% complete with the implementation of the RISE platform across the organization. We also maintained our record-setting safety performance by reducing safety incidents by approximately 20% versus the prior year. This drove a 10% decrease in risk management costs. Next, turning to our environmental services business. Third quarter environmental services revenue decreased $34 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 130 basis point headwind to total revenue growth. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and delays of implant project work. Since mid-August, we have seen rig counts begin to increase, but expect revenue to remain compressed through the end of the year. Finally, turning to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased 38% to $99 per ton in the third quarter. This compared to $72 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was partially offset by a 7% decrease in inbound recycling volume. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brian. Brian Delghiaccio : Thanks, Jon. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 230 basis points to 30.3% in the third quarter. The components of margin expansion included 70 basis points of improvement from favorable net fuel and higher recycled commodity prices and 160 basis points of improvement from the underlying business. Margin expansion in the underlying business was broad-based, and nearly all operating expenses improved compared to the prior year. Additionally, SG&A as a percent of revenue was 10%, an improvement of 40 basis points over the prior year. Our performance reflects cost controls put in place and reductions in nonessential spending while continuing to make investments for the future to ensure the long-term health of our business. Although we're not providing specific EBITDA margin guidance, I'd like to remind you that there's a 50 basis point headwind in the fourth quarter due to the timing of CNG tax credits. Even with this headwind, we expect EBITDA margin to be at or above fourth quarter 2019 performance. This would result in full year margin expansion and exceed our original full year EBITDA margin guidance that we provided back in February. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.1 billion, an increase of 14% over the prior year. Free cash flow growth was driven by an increase in earnings and improvements in working capital.  The contribution from working capital includes a 1.5-day improvement in DSO, a 2-day improvement in DPO and $68 million of deferred payroll taxes under the CARES Act. It's important to note that even without the benefit of the payroll tax deferral, adjusted free cash flow would be up nearly 7% compared to the prior year.  Cash collections remain strong. We believe our DSO performance reflects our customers' willingness to pay for the high-quality service we provide and the essential nature of our business. As Don mentioned, we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion for the year. It's important to note that this level of performance assumes over $1.2 billion of capital expenditures, which is an increase from our prior guidance and relatively consistent with the level of spend we contemplated in our original guidance back in February.  While we have already achieved over 90% of this full year guide, it should be noted that certain expenditures are back-end loaded. During the fourth quarter, we expect to pay approximately 70% of our full year cash taxes, receive approximately 1/3 of our full year capital expenditures and anniversary the benefit from DSO and DPO improvements. Our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance assumes we will defer approximately $100 million under the CARES Act in 2020. However, if our performance is trending at or above the high end of our guidance range, it is highly likely we would repay the deferred taxes early.  During the quarter, total debt was $8.8 billion, and total liquidity increased to $3.4 billion. This includes our new 364-day credit facility. Our leverage ratio was approximately 3.1x. We have plenty of capacity to fund outsized acquisition growth while maintaining leverage within an optimal range. Interest expense in the third quarter was $89 million and included $17 million of noncash amortization expense. During the quarter, we refinanced our 2021 bonds to capitalize on the low interest rate environment. This will reduce cash interest by approximately $22 million per year, which we'll begin to realize in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted income tax provision was $75 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 19%. Together with the $8 million charge from solar investments, we had a total tax-related impact of $83 million during the quarter or 21% of adjusted earnings before taxes. The charge related to solar investments is recorded as a loss from unconsolidated investments on our income statement.  The 21% all-in rate was less than our statutory rate of 27%, which resulted in an EPS benefit of approximately $0.08 during the quarter. We expect an all-in tax-related impact of 27% of EBT in the fourth quarter, which will be made up of the income tax provision and charges from solar investments. Let me now turn the call over to Jon to provide some initial thoughts on 2021. Jon Vander Ark : You've heard Don, Brian and me talk about the positive momentum in the business, which we believe will carry over into 2021 to drive continued growth in revenue, earnings and free cash flow. In particular, we believe we will improve free cash flow conversion and deliver high single-digit adjusted free cash flow growth in 2021. As usual, we will provide full year 2021 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : My first question is just on free cash conversion. I think if you look pre-pandemic, Republic sort of ran at like 41%. Your largest competitor is in the high-40% range. Maybe if you could talk about -- can you get to the high 40s? Is there anything structural preventing that? And I'm not looking at 2020 just because it's a very different year. But just looking at your historic free cash flow conversion relative to your largest peer, what should we be thinking about in terms of catching that up? Donald Slager : Hamzah, this is Don. Yes is the short answer. Cash flow conversion is a conversation we have here all the time. Our cash flow conversion is moving north. There's nothing structural that prevents us from getting above the 40%, midpoint into the high 40s. When we provide a detailed guidance with you guys in February, we're going to be talking more about that. But yes, you can expect the cash flow conversion to move up from its historical levels. Jon Vander Ark : And just to add to that, I think you'll see opportunities on both sides, right, the numerator and the denominator. We see opportunities to both increase the EBITDA margin as well as manage capital expenditures to drive that number. Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. And to Jon's point, Hamzah, that's the real leverage, right? So if you're expanding both, that's why we believe that we're going to be able to grow free cash flow by improving free cash flow margin at a greater rate than we're increasing earnings. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. That's very helpful. And just my follow-up question, I'll turn it over. Very strong margin performance, 30%-plus EBITDA. Could you maybe talk about the sustainability of that margin profile going forward? I know time and weight is a big part of your cost structure, and this is a unique time. But how should we think about sort of cost coming back into the system as you see volume improve? And how much of the margin increase we've seen is kind of structural in nature? Donald Slager : Yes. Good question, Hamzah. So a couple of things to keep in mind. One is seasonality. Third quarter is typically our high point in terms of margin. So you're going to see some natural regression if you get seasonality in the business. And to your point, during the pandemic, there have been a few tailwinds just in terms of productivity with lack of traffic as well as lower container waste and small-container while maintaining that revenue profile. So those certainly help us, and we expect to dissipate some as we go forward. That being said, we've learned a lot of things in the pandemic and do believe we found a different level of performance in terms of productivity and safety, which is associated to our risk cost. And some of that is the pandemic, and some of that is just the return on the investment we've made over the years in digital operations and our operating discipline. And those things are all starting to accrue to the bottom line. And again, we expect to have line of sight to a 30% margin over the next few years on a sustainable basis. Operator : The next question will be from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Patrick Brown : Hey, Brian, so lots of info in the prepared remarks, but I just want to be clear. So in the 2020 guide of free cash flow, you're assuming $120 million payroll deferral benefit this year? Brian Delghiaccio : $100 million, Tyler. Patrick Brown : $100 million? $100 million. Okay. So then, Jon, whenever we think about your comments about free cash flow for next year being, I think, up in the high single-digit range, so is that number assuming something like $150 million payroll deferral negative comp? Jon Vander Ark : Well... Patrick Brown : Is free cash flow looking better than high single digits? Or... Jon Vander Ark : Yes. This is the way you have to think about it, Tyler, is just that you would have the normal payroll taxes that you would pay in any given year, plus you would have $50 million that you would have to repay from 2020. Patrick Brown : Right. But your high single digit is a comp, right, versus prior year? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Yes, correct. Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. No, you're right, it's $150 million. Jon Vander Ark : Correct. Brian Delghiaccio : Starting point to end point headwind we're overcoming and still achieving the high single-digit free cash flow growth. Patrick Brown : Yes, yes, yes, that's my point. Okay. That's good. And then so in the table in the release, I think, Jon, you noted that resi yields were north of 3% this quarter. I think that maybe the first time, at least in a limited history, I'm looking at it. But I'm just curious, do you think that we have enough of that alternative index that separate the increased mix to kind of drive sustainability in that? Donald Slager : Listen, we won't have enough until we have 100% of the book. So we continue to march into City Hall and get a pricing index that we think reflects our cost structure and giving our frontline workforce a sustainable wage increase every year, which we do. And so -- and recycling is a big part of that. So recycling 2.0, we've talked a lot about getting to a right pricing mechanism in that.  And then, listen, we've been heavy at the curb in the pandemic as people have sheltered in place. And so the waste shed has moved from small business to homes. And we've got over 100 customers already that have given us price increases to reflect that elevated cost structure, and we're relentless. We are not going to stop continuing to ask for that price increase. So listen, there's some puts and takes any given quarter on when pricing hits sort of the resets of given markets. But our aspiration to get a yield that better reflects our overall business mix in residential is unrelenting, and we'll continue to work with our municipal customers on that front. Patrick Brown : Did resi margins go up? Jon Vander Ark : They did. Yes. Operator : Next question will be from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : So my first question here is on technology. Obviously, you've made some significant and meaningful investments on the technological front. If we were to put it into 3 buckets as being kind of revenue-generative as you provide a better service as a result of that technology, cost saving because you're becoming more efficient or safety-related, if you look at the $1 spent last year in technology, how would you bucket into those categories? And what evidence, say, for revenue-generative have you seen the success of that technological spend? Donald Slager : Yes. So we don't break down the specific nature of that spend. We certainly invested in all 3 categories, steady investment on safety, which has been going on for a number of years, heavier investment on the operating side and the customer side. And while there's some distinction between those 2, there's also a lot of relatedness between those 2. So when we put in our RISE dispatch platform and we put tablets in our trucks, that certainly helps us become more productive and efficient. It also provides a better customer experience, right? It allows us to improve our -- improve on our 99.9% on-time delivery rate. It also allows us to communicate with a customer in a different way in terms of proactive service notifications and verification over time, which again makes our product even better and drive even higher level of loyalty. So investments on all fronts in online buying and billing and taking calls out of the call center. So we're investing on all fronts and certainly have not pulled back on any of those investments in the pandemic, right? We've invested as much as efforts. So this isn't just about performance, it's certainly about running the business for the long term. Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. And I think you saw, Walter, in my remarks, I talked about spending a similar level of CapEx this year as we originally guided. Even though we've got lower volumes, a lot of that is because we're investing more in this digital transformation. And we think that based on the benefits we've seen so far, that there's much more to come, and that's why we're trying to accelerate that spend. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That's great color. And my second follow-up question here is on the M&A environment. Can you speak a little bit about your pipeline, I guess, specifically whether there had been a degree of pull forward of M&A activity in advance of the election and whether you think a lull might be created here post election as a result of that pull forward? Donald Slager : Yes. There was certainly some accelerated activity in wanting deals to close in a certain time period. I think there's far much less people who wanted to sell because they thought there was going to be a certain political risk and then, therefore, don't want to sell because they see the election coming out in a different way than they expected. But people typically sell for structural events, right? They have a change in their life circumstances. There's a generational transition where the next generation doesn't want to run the business. There's some life-changing events, something happens that triggers people to sell. And again, the political risk and what they think would be implications around taxes might accelerate timing a month or 2, but that isn't really driving activity in our experience. Walter Spracklin : So the pipeline, as you see it, really hasn't changed from October to December? Donald Slager : The pipeline has not changed, and it remains strong. Operator : The next question will be from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : I just want to focus on volumes. They're a bit better than I expected and better than your peers, even your sequential improvement was better. You're also one of the few calling for kind of gradual improvement here for the remainder of this year, whereas others seem to be more flattish. Is there anything notable that is driving this relative to the others? And just any high-level thoughts on the economy from your vantage point and views on different subsectors here going into 4Q? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Listen, we see steady improvement. Listen, there's puts and takes in different spots. So if you dial in to any specific geography, right, you might see some flat lining or if people have temporary shelter-in-place orders even in a slight pullback, but I think it's the power of the portfolio overall, both geographically and across business lines. And again, we have a really strong special waste pipeline for the fourth quarter. I feel very good about that. And we're just -- we're seeing steady improvements across the business. I think we remain cautious in the sense that there's certainly still some uncertainty about we're in a pandemic, right, and how the pandemic moves is uncertain. And so we remain mindful and watchful of that. But based on the trends we're seeing, we see pretty good progress momentum. And that's the external standpoint. The one thing I think we've done well is we've been very engaged with our customers, right? We have a sales team that is highly connected to meet their needs, which is if they need to dial back service, we're dialing back service. But when they're ready to increase service, right, we're connecting with them frequently to make sure that they're ready to come back online. We moved our call centers from all in-buildings to 98% work from home in about a 72-hour period without any drop of service. And our performance metrics are as good or better than ever in that environment. So that's also enabled us to serve the customer. Donald Slager : Yes. So let me add to that. The top line is better than what people may have expected. But again, the operation has been really strong, right? So we've talked for a long time about the strength of the company, the strength of the team. And we've talked about our resilience of the business model, but that's still all true. But what we're seeing now, to Jon's point, is agility, right? Jon mentioned how quickly we adapted to new ways of working, adoption, how quickly we're changing to new -- using and adopting tools like the RISE platform and then momentum, right? So we're -- all the investments, all the efforts of the last several years, call it, decade kind of compounding, coming together kind of this breakout moment with a crazy backdrop of COVID. But all that together builds this momentum through the year and carries us really well into 2021. Kyle White : Got you. And just a follow-up. I think you mentioned that you continue to see the biggest volume declines in education, hospitality, and I missed the third category. But is there any way to quantify your exposure to these kind of subsectors? And how have they performed in October relative to September? Jon Vander Ark : Well, let me take education, for example, right? I mean, normally, we have a pretty big seasonal upswing here in September as all those schools come back online. And we've just seen what you've seen, which is people are moving all over the place. Some schools are fully in person, some are fully remote, and then others have hybrid options that have every kind of variation in between. So we've been flexible with our customers to adjust our service level to better meet their needs. Donald Slager : It's clearly temporary, right? It's going to, at some point, get back to in-class learning, right? And then that business just comes back when it comes back. And it builds right into our route base, so it usually comes in at a pretty decent margin to boot. Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. And one of the things we had mentioned last quarter what the impact was from education. And if you take a look in the third quarter, it was about 20% of our small-container decline was due to education alone. Operator : The next question will be from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : I just wanted to ask Hamzah's question just in a bit of a different way. I mean just considering all these moving parts, considerably better margins than expected this year, is sort of a normal 30 basis points-ish kind of margin expansion outcome achievable in 2021? Brian Delghiaccio : You're talking about for the full year, 30%? Sean Eastman : I'm just talking about, can RSG expand margins sort of at a normalized, say, 30 basis point level year-over-year in 2021 in light of some of these nonrecurring cost savings in 2020? Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. Look, I think you do have to take into consideration, Jon mentioned it, right, there are certainly some things that are happening in the macro environment, right, things that are helping productivity, some of the lighter container weights. So there are some puts and takes. But we do feel that 30% margin, an improvement towards 30% margin is something that's in the near term, right? And it's going to be something that we're going to continue to move toward. '21 might have a little bit of noise in it just because you have some of those macro benefits modulating. But after that, certainly, 30-plus basis points a year is something that's certainly achievable. Donald Slager : We're on the cost. Sean Eastman : Got you. All right. Great. And is there any reason to think price won't trend up next year? I mean it was called out, the resi yield number was really a standout in the quarter. Does that give us some juice into next year? I mean what are the puts and takes there? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Our pricing philosophy certainly hasn't changed over the pandemic, which is to get a fair price for the great work that we do. I think you'll see continued strong pricing in the open markets. On pricing on the landfill side, I think that's a slight headwind on CPI, which we have a 10 -- 12- to 18-month lag in terms of when that CPI changes and when that actually hits our contracts on how those escalators work. So that will provide sort of a headwind, but there's no fundamental change in our pricing philosophy. And we'll expect to have strong kind of mid-2s yield at a minimum. Donald Slager : Yes. Take a look at the progress that was made in converting the book on the resi municipal business that Jon talked about. The 100 contracts or so that have already engaged with us and approved price increases because of the elevated volumes, that's a great new trend. And we're going to continue just like when others -- things like this occur, we'll push through that. And landfill pricing has held up very well, right? And we still think that there's room in landfill pricing and that a lot of the pricing still needs to emanate from the landfills based on the cost structure there and the difficulty of permitting and expanding landfills. I mean those -- that pricing will continue to stay strong. And overall, through all this sort of chaos, the market was very rational, right? And that's the backdrop. Sean Eastman : Yes. Excellent. Super helpful summary there. And again, nice work. Donald Slager : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley. Jeffrey Goldstein : Can you just compare how you're thinking about the volume recoveries between both small-container and large-container at this point? I know large-container had a larger initial drop, and now they're booked down about a similar rate in this quarter. So just going forward, would you expect a large-container recovery to pick up faster, especially given some tailwinds we're seeing, especially around housing? Or would you expect those to move relatively in lockstep going forward? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Look, there's certainly -- I mean when we look at single-family housing starts and some of the strength that we've seen in some of those prints, right, we've had in our investor presentations how that positively impacts our volumes generally about 12 months later. So we tend to lag. But the one thing when you take a look at small and large container, remember, a good portion of our large-container business is permanent in nature, right? So it's -- you're kind of talking more about the temporary portion of that, which tends to be the construction-related and then some of the other event jobs. That's where you might see some acceleration out more on the event side. But the permanent large-container and the permanent small-container tend to move at about the same rate. Donald Slager : Yes. It really just depends what happens with schools. It depends what happens with the restaurants. And a lot of restaurants have gotten very innovative in the North in terms of outdoor dining, and that will be more of a challenge as we move into the late fall/winter season here. So there'll be a few puts and takes that could impact us the next quarter or 2 in small-container in terms of that trend, maybe a little bit less than the large-container firm. But I don't think there'll be any fundamental differences for that. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. And the sequential gap continues to close, I guess. Jeffrey Goldstein : Okay. That was all very helpful. And then on the recent pledge to purchase 2,500 electric trucks, and I know you're a few years away from actual integration of those vehicles, but can you just talk about how you view those trucks relative to diesel and CNG in operations today? And maybe any rule of thumb we can think of in terms of financial benefit, if any, you'd be expecting? Or is it mostly just an environmental benefit from your point of view? Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. No, we're very bullish on electrification long term. We think that's the winning technology in the space because that's the only truly 0 emissions option out there. But we've said all along, it's going to be a challenge, and it'll take time, right? We're going to have to work making commitments in the space because we need to innovate and help innovate. We've got relationships across the value chain, right, that we're showing a leadership position in that over time.  We also have fundamental belief that if something is going to be environmentally sustainable over time, it's got to be economically sustainable. So we don't expect to do this by reducing returns. We expect over time to amp returns. Now there might be some puts and takes between higher upfront CapEx and then lower operating costs through reduced fuel cost or reduce maintenance costs over time. But again, we're very proactive in that space. Donald Slager : Now look, we're the seventh largest vocational fleet in the nation. And to Jon's point, we are the right kind of company to be innovating and to be pushing innovation onto the market. And again, when you get there, those benefits accrue in large ways because we've got 16,000 trucks on the street every day. Operator : The next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : I do have 2 specific my questions, but there's 2 I'd like to make sure I get -- everybody heard the answer correctly, if you would bear with me. My 2 specifics are 160 basis points in solid waste improvement. If you thought about traffic and that type of productivity, what's that give back out of the 160 when we're all driving full time and you guys have increased labor for that? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Michael, it's hard to -- we're looking at that, right? It's hard to tease that out exactly because again, we have a mix of 2 things going on. One, we've got lower traffic patterns because of people sheltering in place, and we also have the rollout of all of our digital tools driving higher productivity.  Listen, we hope to -- we're not going to sustain all of it, but we hope to sustain a lot of it on the productivity side. And one of the things we've seen is not a big difference between rural and urban market productivity, right? So we're seeing benefits in both. And I would have expected to see, if it was purely pandemic-related, a lot bigger lift for us in urban markets, right? And we're seeing benefits across the board. So again, we -- back to our path -- our plan to expand margins, a big portion of that is capturing some of that productivity benefit going forward. Donald Slager : Yes. So look, there's definitely some impact, to your point, Michael, with traffic. But look, the initial rollout of the RISE platform is the foundational element surprise. The stuff the team is working on now, the next things that they'll layer in now once the platform is rolled out and established is additive, right? So there's going to be layer after layer of additional feature benefit and capability on that digital platform that's going to drive new margin expansion and better operations, better customer-facing stuff, more information in our pricing tools and just better, safer operations. Jon, do you want to talk about a couple of those things? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We've just -- the tablets in our trucks, right, and giving our people the visibility both in the branch as well as the driver out communicating together, right, not talking, seeing where those trucks are. And so a large-container route, for example, will have 7 movements in a day. It's about getting 8 movements in a day in the same time period while improving safety, while providing better customer service. So that's a very tangible example. We're seeing those tools accrue to the bottom line. Brian Delghiaccio : Hey, Michael, one thing I just wanted to kind of clarify that, too, is that when we talk about the 160 basis points, call it, at the underlying business, that's not just solid waste, that also includes the impact from environmental services. So the only thing that doesn't include of the 230 basis points of total margin expansion is the impact of both net fuel and higher commodity prices had on margin expansion. Michael Hoffman : Okay. All right, that's helpful . And then the clarification question, somebody asked something about margin and margin expansion, and I was scribbling really fast. You were expecting margins to expand next year, and maybe 30 is a great goal, but you're not giving a goal, but you expect margins to expand. Is that -- the way I was writing it down, it sounded like you were going to be flat. Brian Delghiaccio : No. We expect margins to expand. We're not giving a guide on that topic, but we are expecting margins to expand. Michael Hoffman : Right. And the other... Donald Slager : It is -- Michael, that's the point of momentum, right, when you heard me use that word, twice Jon used it, Brian, look, underlying strength in our business, sort of developmental strength in our people, resiliency in the mid-business model, again, rational backdrop and then, again, proven agility through this downturn, right, you prove it. You can't question it, right? You could see how quickly the company turned and reacted and adapted, adopted, proven agility and momentum, right? And that is the key takeaway here. I mean there is really strong momentum in the business, in the team and in all the work that's been done over recent years coming together to carry us into 2021. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then my second one is on free cash flow, and it's got both a clarification and a question in it. Maybe your conversion rate has been less than peers, but your fundamental year-over-year growth rate has been better than your major peer for a decade, one; and two, you do have headwinds. Your leverage ratio has been consistently higher and you pay out more in closure and post closure in absolute dollars. So the question is, do you expect to be able to raise this number by high single digit and still have all of that in front of you? Donald Slager : Yes. Look, we're not going to change the structural issue with legacy landfills, right, overall, right? I mean they're going to have that cost, maybe somebody else doesn't have. And our formula of returning cash to shareholders, the way we do is a very time-tested formula, right? We're going to continue to invest in capital even through this tough time.  I mean, look, when we went through the Great Recession, we didn't stop investing in the business. We had strong enough cash flow to carry us. We continue to invest in fleet, all the other things. Through this year, we didn't shut it down. We actually, in some cases, accelerated some of the spending in some of the digital tools. And yes, I mean we're very strongly focused on cash flow conversion. And as I said earlier, we're going to get ahead of that 45% and going to carry us into northern 40% territory. Brian Delghiaccio : Right. And that's why I was saying, Michael, as I made those comments about both the combination of EBITDA margin expansion and being able to reduce expenditures, that combination is why we feel that there's going to be an accelerating event here on free cash flow conversion to drive that free cash flow growth. Donald Slager : Look at the things that Jon and Tim and the team have built momentum on. I mean look at -- we talked already about the -- changing the pricing mechanism on municipal, right, to a fair and equitable arrangement. That's underway. Recycling, making a lot of headway there. And it's not just the recycling markets that are helping us, right, they will, but we're, again, we're retooling that business, right, making it truly sustainable, right? That's happening. Now some pricing on the resi side for the elevated weights, right, all of those things.  And then all the underlying operational benefits. I mean safety is a great story. Employee turnover is a great story. Engagement is a great story. All of those things adding up, and those are all going to come to fruition, I think, regardless of COVID. And then COVID sort of kicked this into another gear. We found new agility that we didn't have and made some other operational changes because we, frankly, had to. And those are going to carry in the future periods. Operator : The next question will come from David Manthey with Baird. David Manthey : Last quarter, you mentioned that about 15% of your labor cost was overtime, and it was down 25%. Can you tell us by how much overtime was down year-to-year in the third quarter and October, if you care to share that data? Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. They were -- in the third quarter, it was down about 10% overtime hours year-over-year. David Manthey : Okay. And second, I realize you're not giving fourth quarter guidance. But due to the ongoing recovery here and your current mix of business, is it possible you might see lower-than-normal seasonality in the fourth quarter revenues based on those realities? Brian Delghiaccio : Well, if you think about seasonality, typically, what you see is an uptick in the second and primarily the third. So from a seasonal perspective, then you start to see it kind of come down in the fourth quarter. So your toughest bogey is generally the third quarter hit from a year-over-year perspective when you talk about seasonal volumes. So there typically isn't something that increases significantly in the fourth quarter from a volume perspective when you look at Q3 to Q4. Donald Slager : Yes. Except you might have some other just recovery because certain sectors open up, that book maybe shut down, right? Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. Donald Slager : It might be economic, maybe construction in some places. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Some of it is purely seasonal, which is in the North, there's construction activity that just doesn't happen because of the weather. Now there could be some special waste jobs that are teed up for us that we would have in the second or third quarter that have just gotten delayed. And now that people have more clarity going forward, that they'll hit, and we, again, we feel really good about that pipeline. So there should be some modest opportunities there. Donald Slager : Look, normally, seasonally, Q3 is our strongest quarter, 2 is our second strongest then 4 and then 1. Brian Delghiaccio : And 1, right. So we don't see certainly any headwinds as we look in the fourth quarter from a seasonal perspective year-over-year versus what we just went through in the third quarter. Operator : The next question is from Mike Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Don, for many years, we were hearing about you guys intentionally shedding business. Every call, there would be a lot of questions on why your volumes were underperforming some peers. I guess my question is, one, are you guys kind of through that intentional shedding? And two, how do you think that has positioned you guys going into this downturn and really coming out of the downturn? Donald Slager : Well, look, you heard Jon used this phrase, the power of the portfolio, and that's something that we speak to a lot, right? And when you spend decades and decades building the business and pulling the business together the way we did, 5 public companies, blah, blah, blah, you end up with some stuff that you got to clean up. We're kind of through all that. We've done some puts and takes in markets. We've gone to markets. We've exited markets. We used to talk about national accounts and stuff we had to shed. We're not going to be talking much about that anymore. Now the fact is because we have a strong pipeline in acquisitions, right, as something like Jon talked about last quarter, we're always going to have some business that comes with an acquisition that may be likely to be shed because it doesn't sort of fit the model. But overall, we think we've done a good job. We think we've got a good filter and test in place on the way in as we're selling new business with all the sales tools that have been launched over recent years. So we think we've got the safety mechanism on the organic sales side. There'll still be some stuff that maybe gets shed through -- as a result of strong M&A. But look, we are well positioned. Again, the power of the portfolio works. It's the mix of geographies. It's the mix of business, large-container or small. It's a strong approach with fixing a big piece of the business, which happens to be municipal. It's been kind of our nemesis with tough recycling contracts, bad escalators, that's starting the outcome around the corner here for us. And it just again shows the relentlessness of the team, as Jon already mentioned. So all that work, right, just adds to the strength of the portfolio. That power of the portfolio is real. Seasonality, winter events, weather events balances out when you've got a strong portfolio. And no different than the portfolio that you invest in yourself, right? We have invested in building a strong portfolio and then sticking with it and then continually improving it over time. And it's just going to -- it will just get better and better as we go. Michael Feniger : That makes sense. And Don, just piggybacking off that, this is kind of a big-picture question. I mean you've seen a lot of consolidation in your day, big and small. Some of your peers right now are integrating some large-scale acquisitions in Q4 in the middle of COVID. You guys have elevated M&A, but you passed on some of these bigger deals. I'm curious how you and the management team think that positions the company kind of into 2021. Donald Slager : Well, look, we -- I would say this, we've been -- we've looked at every decent deal that's come around. I would say there's probably been times where we've had sort of the lead seat on some deals. And on an ROI basis, we just couldn't get as comfortable with it as we'd like, and we passed. And in a couple of cases, other people came in and decided to go forward with it. Some cases, people paid more than maybe we would have, right? There's a lot of really high-quality companies out there that we compete with vigorously every day, and we've got a pretty good look at who they are, how they operate. We know the good quality. Those are the companies we're talking to. We're not going to win every deal, right? I would say there tends to be a natural buyer, and that might be a cultural fit. It might be a geographic fit. It might just be where the purchasing company is in the life cycle or, frankly, what promises they've made to the market that they feel they have to keep. We're not in a situation where we're being paid some high-growth multiple and we've got to do things that are unnatural. So we stick to what we know. We've got a great M&A team, a great team of people out there who know their markets. Our 10-area presence all have market plans that think about how they want to expand their business through whether it's landfill expansions and acquisitions or new lines of business. All that is up and running. So look, I remember, when we paused M&A, when we did the big merger over a decade ago and then we put our toe back in the water, year-after-year, I've come to you and said, and we're going to do X next year. And sometimes we missed it a little bit because we've said no to some deals that proved, frankly, I'm worthy in the end. We found some things in diligence that we didn't like and we backed off. And we weren't so hot and heavy to make the number as we were to do its best for the company.  And then there's years like this year where we're going to blow it out because opportunity arises. And these companies that we're buying today are high-quality companies and a really great fit. And that's how we're going to continue to play it. And we've taken some opportunity to expand the core a little bit. There's some great opportunity that the team has brought to us that expand our abilities in around the environmental space that we're fond of. So that's going to continue. And we haven't given you, again, guidance on that, and we will talk about that in February based on what the pipeline is. And  -- but when we say we're well positioned, I think you can take that to the bank. We're well positioned. Michael Feniger : And just off that, what do you expect to close in 2020? Can you -- or Brian, can you give us a number on how much rollover do we get on the top line? Is there a way you can just kind of frame that for us? Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. With that $850 million to $900 million investment that we guided to, again, it's going to be very heavily back-end loaded. We would expect, call it, 150 basis points plus of acquisition rollover on the top line. Michael Feniger : Okay. That's perfect. And just lastly, I know -- I might have missed this with October. Did you guys say was October volumes up versus September, kind of flat sequentially? I might have missed that. Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. They were somewhat flattish from September levels, but about a 100 basis point improvement from the Q3 average. Operator : The next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : I think you mentioned the 160 bps expansion in margin was inclusive of environmental services, which I got to imagine was a relative drag, at least versus the average. So any chance you can quantify the environmental services margin impacts in the quarter? How you think about that for the year? And then if you extrapolate the current run rate to '21, what does that mean for margin impact year-over-year? Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. So within the 160 of expansion, overall, there was a 20 basis point headwind from the environmental services business. Noah Kaye : And I know you're not giving formal guidance, but just thinking about it for the year, you would expect to be a continued headwind? Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. In the fourth quarter, yes. Yes, probably at a similar level, if you will. Noah Kaye : Yes. And so if we annualize that into next year, you may be looking, just on the significant drop-off, you may be looking at a little bit of a headwind again in 2021, but not massive. Okay. And just to clarify, the high single-digit growth in free cash flow year-over-year, that view, that does include the contributions from the chunkier acquisitions, correct? Brian Delghiaccio : Correct. Yes. Noah Kaye : Okay. Great. So one -- after specific questions, one more general one. I think as one of my peers noted, relative to some of the other companies in this space, you are looking for continued improvement here. If I just step back and look at the consumers' personal savings rate here in the third quarter, I mean it's doubled year-over-year. There is a lot of cash on a relative basis sitting with the consumer. Now some of it may be going into house down payments or what have you. But eventually, that cash has to come off the sidelines. And I guess I just want to see how you think that translates to the recovery into the eventual growth here.  You're talking about large-container maybe picking up, maybe it stays in the resi line of business, but just your thoughts there. Donald Slager : Look, we're not going to give you the exact formula because there's too much mix involved, right? But look, I mean our business grows based on population growth, household formation, business formation. So very simply, more people, right, job creation, wage growth, more people working, people sort of settling down after sort of the chaos. There have been a lot of chaos this year, right, COVID, social unrest, the election. I was suffering personally from a great deal of election fatigue, okay? And so I'm sure a lot of people were, right? So things are going to start to settle down. America ends up conquering all in the end. How much time will it take? To your point, people have a lot of savings set aside. People are waiting to see. We have good news from the Fed today. Look, as things get back to normal, right, and we get on a path, economy recovers and people find a way to continue to sort of save and grow their businesses, as Jon mentioned, people innovate, we see it all the time, we're going to be right there with it. Our market position, it allows us to take full advantage of all that organic growth somewhat naturally. And then our ability to grow through M&A, our ability to look at even expanding some of our core offerings, a lot of good there. And so we're well positioned. Strong balance sheet, strong asset base, strong market position, strong team, I can go on and on and on and brag about this group. So this quarter is a great showing of all the hard work that's been going on. And I said strength, resilience and now an expression of agility and real momentum in the business. And with a good backdrop, I think now, as things start to settle down around us, then it will be a good story to tell. And we'll be here in February to share with you the full year results and the outlook for '21 in more detail. And based on what we see today, I think everyone will be pretty happy with that. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Donald Slager : Thank you, Chad. In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance and continue to have a positive outlook on our business. We delivered double-digit adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth, expanded EBITDA margin and achieved EBITDA margin performance above 30%. We raised our full year 2020 adjusted free cash flow guidance, and we see strong free cash flow growth in 2021. Once again, we have proved the resiliency of our business and the strength of our model. I'd like to take a moment to recognize the hard work, commitment and dedication exhibited by our 36,000 team members this year. At the onset of COVID, we launched our Committed to Serve program to recognize our frontline employees who deliver an essential service to our communities across the country each and every day. And since then, their dedication has continued. Even through record-setting weather events, including fires and hurricanes and, frankly, you name it, they've never let up. And it's their consistency and willingness to take care of our customers, communities and each other that makes them truly relentless and makes me proud to work for Republic Services. I hope you all have a good evening. Stay safe out there. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Republic Services is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RSG. All participants in today's call will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please not, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Stacey Mathews, Vice President of Investor Relations. Stacey Mathews : Hello.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don. Donald Slager : Thanks, Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely proud of our strong finish to 2020. We further proved our ability to overcome adversity and execute in a challenging environment. 2020 tested the company's foundation and the team repeatedly stepped up to the task at hand and demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business. Through their hard work, dedication, and commitment, we delivered record setting operational and financial results. We outperformed expectations for the year and even exceeded the high-end of the original guidance we provided last February. During 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.56, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year, generated $1.24 billion of adjusted free cash flow, even after repaying all deferred payroll taxes, expanded EBITDA margin 130 basis points to 29.4%, improved free cash flow conversion to over 41%, increased customer retention rates to an all-time high at just above 93%, and achieved record setting safety performance. Profitable growth remains our number one strategic imperative, and we continue to believe that investing in acquisitions with attractive returns is the best use of free cash flow to increase long-term shareholder value. We prioritize acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. In 2020, we invested more than $600 million in acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains full and we expect 2021 will be an equally robust year of activity. We anticipate the year will start strong with Santek expected to close by the end of the first quarter. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $620 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to 2021. We expect another year of record-setting performance. Specifically, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.65 to $3.73 and generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.375 billion. We believe our strong results exiting the year provides the momentum to further grow in 2021 and clearly demonstrate our ability to create lasting shareholder value. Jon and Brian will provide additional insights later in this call. Before turning the call over, I want to thank each and every one of our 35,000 team members for their hard work and extra efforts during these unprecedented times. I also want to recognize our frontline employees for their continued heroic service as essential workers throughout the pandemic. Early in 2020, we launched our Committed to Serve program to recognize the contributions of our frontline team while also supporting our small business customers and the communities we serve. Toward the end of the year, as the vaccine roll-off began to signal hope, company leadership decided to, again, thank frontline team members with a $500 award, which they each received last month. This brings our direct financial support provided to our frontline employees to $45 million since the start of the pandemic. Nothing is more vital to the success of this company than our people, and that has never been proved more true than during this past year. With that, let me turn the call over to Jon. Jon Ark : Thanks, Don. Throughout the fourth quarter, we continued to see improvement in the business and reported positive combined growth from average yield and volume for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. During the quarter, total core price was 4.6%. This includes open market pricing of 5.4% and restricted pricing of 3.3%. For the full year, core price was 4.8%, which represents the highest level of pricing in the last 10 years. Average yield for the fourth quarter was 2.5%. Average yield measures the change in average price per unit, which considers the impact of customer churn. Looking forward, we expect average yield to remain strong at approximately 2.5% in 2021. During the fourth quarter volume decreased 1.8%. This compares favorably to the 3.4% volume decrease we experienced in the third quarter with all lines of business showing an improvement from Q3 levels. Fourth quarter small container volume decreased by 3.5%, which is a 130-basis-point improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter large container volume decreased 3.4%. Volume performance was relatively consistent between the permanent and temporary portions of this business. Total landfill volume decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. This included an increase of 1.7% in MSW and a 1% increase in C&D, which is offset by 9.8% decrease in special waste. Our pipeline for special waste volume remains strong. Looking forward, we expect the gradual improvement in the economy that we saw during the second half of last year to continue, leading to the volume growth of 1.5% to 2% in 2021. Next turning to our environmental solutions business. Fourth quarter environmental solutions revenue decreased $22 million from the prior year. This resulted in a 90-basis-point headwind to total revenue growth. This was primarily due to a decrease in drilling activity and delays in in-plant project work. Looking ahead, we believe our environmental solutions business can experience above average growth rates. We are particularly focused on the downstream business where customers are looking for integrated solutions, and we can leverage our broad capabilities and sustainability platform. Turning to recycling. Recycled commodity prices increased 67% to $110 per ton in the fourth quarter. This compared to $66 per ton in the prior year. The benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was partially offset by a 3% decrease in inbound recycling volume. Next, turning to margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. We successfully managed our costs for changes in underlying demand and more than offset the decline in revenue due to the pandemic. This was enabled in part by the implementation of our RISE dispatch platform, which was a critical tool to adjust our costs for rapid changes in volume. We are accelerating the use of technology to drive productivity improvements and efficiencies as well as improve the customer and employee experience. I'm especially proud of our safety results. During the quarter, we achieved record setting safety performance by reducing safety incidents 21% versus the prior year. This drove a 14% decrease in risk management costs. For the year, EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 29.4%. We believe we have found a new level of performance and plan to further expand our margin from here. We expect EBITDA margin of approximately 29.5% in 2021. Finally, in 2020, we published our first year of progress to our latest long-term sustainability goals. These goals address our most critical sustainability risks and opportunities and are aligned with the UN sustainable development goals. We believe these goals have the potential to significantly benefit the environment and society, while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business over the long-term. As part of our commitment to reduce carbon emissions, we have taken a leadership position in the industry to embrace electrification. We believe this emerging technology will be the preferred choice to power recycling and solid waste trucks and equipment in the future. In addition to our ongoing electric vehicle pilots, we recently made a minority investment and entered into a strategic alliance with Romeo Power to further explore electric solutions for our fleet. We remain committed to make further progress against all our sustainability goals in 2021 and beyond. Our sustainability performance continues to be well-regarded, as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones sustainability World and North America indices for the fifth consecutive year. Additionally, we were named the Barron's 100 most sustainable companies list for the third time.  I will now turn the call over to Brian. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks, Jon. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1. This represents an increase of $0.12 or 14% from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $3.56. This performance was $0.16 above the high-end of our guidance range. Approximately $0.07 from this resulted from operational outperformance and $0.09 was due to favorable tax items. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 29.9% and increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. This included underlying margin expansion of 130 basis points and a 20 basis point benefit from net fuel and recycled commodity prices. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was 10% of revenue, an improvement of 110 basis points from the prior year. This level of spending reflects our effective management of discretionary costs, while continuing to make investments to drive growth and generate efficiencies in future periods. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was 29.4%, an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. The outsize margin expansion is a direct result of pricing and excess of our cost inflation and dynamically flexing costs to optimize our cost structure. We are leveraging new ways of working in utilizing new tools and technology to be more efficient and agile. We also continue to make progress on converting our municipal contract structures to drive increased profitability and ensure an appropriate return on the assets we deploy. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.24 billion and increased $62 million or 5.3% compared to the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected EBITDA growth and favorable contribution from working capital. Working capital included a one and a half day improvement in DSO and a two and a half day improvement in DPO. The benefit we realized from positive working capital added approximately $100 million compared to our expectations, which enabled us to repay all previously deferred payroll taxes. Full year 2020 free cash flow conversion was 41.3%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion to further improve in 2021 and are planning to achieve mid 40% level performance within the next couple of years. As Jon mentioned, we expect combined average yield and volume growth of 4% to 4.5% in 2021. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our 2020 results even with lower CPI based pricing. From a timing perspective, we expect average yield to be relatively lower than the full year average in the first quarter. We also expect volumes to improve sequentially, but remain negative during the first quarter. Both expected outcomes are due to the tough prior year comparison. During the quarter, total debt was $8.9 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. In 2020, we refinanced debt to capitalize on the low interest rate environment and extend maturities. These activities reduced annual interest by approximately $60 million. About half of this benefit was realized during 2020. Our leverage ratio was 3.1 times. We have plenty of capacity to fund outsized acquisition growth while maintaining leverage within an optimal range. With respect to taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate was slightly negative during the fourth quarter and approximately 16% for the year. When you further consider non-cash charges from solar investments, we had an equivalent tax impact of 20% during the fourth quarter and 23% for the year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 26% in 2021, made up of an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and approximately $90 million of non-cash charges from solar investments. If you normalize for the expected increase in taxes, our 2021 EPS guidance represents high single digit to low double-digit growth. With that operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. I guess, the first question and you touched on it at various points in the prepared remarks, but maybe if you could just go a little deeper into sort of underlying trends that you're seeing, service increases, how much of sort of COVID impacted revenue is yet to come back, any way you want to frame that, and maybe how does that position you for 2021 and beyond? One of your competitors said that, waste is a reopening play. The market, obviously, isn't giving credit for that, but just -- sort of just give us a flavor of underlying trends and how you're positioned long-term. Donald Slager : Sure. Hamzah, thanks for the question. Yeah. We're feeling really good about the trends we're seeing. You mentioned service decreases -- increases. We continue to see more increases than decreases. We're seeing the business come back. We're seeing people get back to work. We continue to find, as we have throughout the last year, new ways to work more efficiently. We're going to continue to employ that into 2021, but we're planning for continued steady growth through the year. That's what we're seeing. I mentioned the pipeline being strong, so we're feeling really good about the business. And as we've talked -- as we exited last year, some of the efficiency gains that we've seen in 2020, we expect to hold on to. But looking at pricing, pricing has held up. The market is still very rational. The underlying fundamentals are solid. Our market position is better than ever. Our foundation is strong. Our team is more capable than it's ever been. And the market's coming back and we're going to be right there to get our fair share of it, as we go through time, but that service increase number is steadily rising, and pricing is holding up as alongside of it. And then I think, there's a little bit talk of inflation out there on the horizon. Inflation, as you know, is actually good for our business, a little inflation will help CPI pickup. So, we've got a lot of year-on-year improvements that we're seeing in the business. Jon mentioned RISE in his commentary. We are still seeing the benefits of that unfold here at 2021 and beyond. So -- but I think on the revenue front, on the customer front, I think all things are green for us right now. And it's just a matter of pace, right? And we'll just be reporting on that pace of recovery through the year. But if you look at the guide, right, we're looking at double-digit EPS and cash flow growth. We've got a pretty strong year in front of us, we think. Operator : Our next question will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon guys. Donald Slager : Hi, Tyler. Jon Ark : Good afternoon. Tyler Brown : Hey, Brian. So, in the implied guidance, how much of a rollover benefit from M&A you have baked in there? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. From a top line perspective, Tyler, we've got about 150 basis points of top line rollover in the guide. Tyler Brown : Okay. And to be clear, that incorporates what you spent late in 2020, and what you expect to spend in early 2021, just so to be clear? Brian DelGhiaccio : But that's just what\u2019s actually closed through the end of 2020. Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then Brian, I know you guys did such a good job on managing margins in 2020. I think you're maybe only guiding to say a 10 basis point improvement. My hunch is, there's quite a bit moving in there. So, can you kind of talk about some of the puts and takes there, maybe recycling to the benefit, core expansion, and then maybe what are some of the takes like maybe healthcare or M&A dilution? Just any help there. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. Yeah. Look, I'll give you the puts and takes there in a second, but just kind of to further Don's comment, one of the things I think you have to appreciate is when you take a look at our 2020 performance, we're coming off of triple digit margin expansion, which I think really differentiates us from our peers, and we're talking about furthering its margin expansion from here, and we don't think we're done after we get through 2021. But if you take a look at the puts and takes what's underlying that 29.5%, we're looking at underlying expansion of call it somewhere in the 50 basis point range. The things that are offsetting that, we've kind of aggregated net fuel and commodity prices together to your point, commodity is a slight tailwind. Actually, the headwind is more on fuel, and that's just really more of a timing thing than anything else. The combination of those two is about a 20-basis-point headwind to margin. And then on the acquisition front, we've got about 20 basis points of dilution in year one. That's predominantly just from the integration and the transaction in the deal costs that we experienced in the first year. So, while it's diluted in year one, we expect those acquisitions to actually be accretive to our average margin performance year two and beyond. Tyler Brown : Yeah. No, core expansion, that's kind of the message though. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. Core expansion of 50 basis points. And again, that's the -- really the important story here is that's on the heels of really strong margin expansion in 2020. Donald Slager : And then underlying -- or the headline story is -- 30% is right there in our sites, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Yeah. Yeah. I'm aware of that. Hey, Jon really quick. Do you have any specific thoughts about 2021 MSW landfill yield trends? Do you expect that to maybe step up? And I am curious how much of that line is indexed to CPI? Is it quite a bit? Jon Ark : Yeah. look, we have -- we're probably six or seven quarters into a substantial step up in landfill average yield, right. Over 3.2% for the quarter and we expect it to be strong again in 2021. And to your point, a chunk of that volume is certainly tied to contracted business and tied to some inflation-based index. So, as CPI goes up, we get inflation, that should put upward pressure on it. But I also just think people have realized landfills are expensive to operate. And so, we need to price for the investments we make into those assets, and that's put upward pressure on MSW price or landfill pricing more broadly again across the last couple of years, and I don't see that trend abating at all. Tyler Brown : Okay. Yes. Appreciate the time. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Hey, good afternoon. Hope everyone's doing well. Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to talk about on contract now that we're basically a year from when this pandemic started, has any of the terms or contract structures changed as a result as you kind of approach new renewals, maybe particularly on the resi side? Donald Slager : Yeah. We've gotten over a hundred customers to amend the terms primarily on municipal residential contracts, because weights have increased. Now in April and the immediacy of the shock when everyone was sheltering in place, weights were up about 10%. That's modulating to be down to 5%. But then that's still -- in those contracts with those are time and weight-based contracts. And so as we get heavy, we need a price for that. As that number dissipates and there's some modulators people get back to work, those -- more of those pricing renewals will come in the normal cycle of price -- a contract changes versus out of cycle contract changes. But that is not a high margin part of the business for us and all the players in the industry. So, we absolutely have to get paid for the work we do there. Brian DelGhiaccio : Kyle, I think if you actually take a look at the overall average yield performance, you've seen in that residential business, 3% plus pricing the last two quarters, and that's where you're going to see as we renegotiate and change the structure of those contracts, that's where you're going to see it. Kyle White : Got it. That makes sense. And then on electrification of vehicles, you touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks. Maybe you can just talk a little bit more about your strategy and how it's different from some of your competitors. And then also, I know you had the partnership in the quarter that ended, and I'm curious if there's any kind of ramifications from that? And then just maybe the rationale of the partnership with Romeo. Donald Slager : Sure. Yeah. Listen, we think electrification is exciting technology for a couple of reasons. One, it's truly the only zero-based emission technology out there. CNG is incrementally better than diesel, but only incrementally a better than that. So, it's the right technology long-term. And our application tends to be a perfect one for electrification, because range anxiety is a big issue in trucking for electrification. And we don't have that as our trucks come home to the same location every night and you can get into overnight charging. So, we're really excited about the technology. And we're going to get there. We've always said there's going to be multiple paths to get there, and there's going to be some uncertainty. The destination is clear. The path to get there has some uncertainty. So, we've got a number of different relationships going on, pilots with multiple manufacturers. We talked about the Romeo investment. And in terms of the specific, partnership that we exited, right, disappointing for us, but that didn't cost us anything. That contract was very intentionally designed. It was performance based and the extent they couldn't execute against the performance. It costs us nothing on that front. So, disappointing again, because we're cheering for everybody to get there because we think it's good for the planet. But we are confident that we've got the right set of partners and we're going to be excited -- update you on our progress as we move forward. Kyle White : Got it. I'll turn it over. Good luck in there. Donald Slager : Thank you. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So, on the M&A guide $600 million, you mentioned that it could be tuck-in. It could be new growth areas. First, can you give us a sense of what the rollover is there? I don't know if you touched on that, if you could repeat it? And really are you finding that the pipeline is -- as we come and exit through, is it getting -- is it changing day-to-day in terms of the availability of sellers, or are you going after any particular targeted areas or marketplaces that are starting to open up a little bit more? Just curious how things are changing kind of day-to-day with regards to the availability of sellers. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. So, let me just start with some of the numbers that you asked on the rollover. So, the rollover, right, by definition is that, which is closed in 2020, again, that's about 150 basis points. Okay. So, again, the actual revenue contribution from the $600 million will be -- which of the deals that we intend to close in 2021, that'll be based on the timing of when they close. So, again, we're guiding on the top line organic growth, which is that combination of yield and volume, how much revenue we get in 2021, again, on the $600 million, we'll be more timing based than anything else. Donald Slager : Yeah. The pipeline remains strong and it remains balanced. Balanced across kind of core markets we're in the recycling and solid waste space. And obviously that's the bread and butter of our acquisition strategy. And those tuck-ins are highly creative. We're also looking at new geographies and have gotten into different -- spend the geographies in the last two to three years, which again provides new growth opportunities. And then also new parts of the business. So, we mentioned environmental solutions, and those are actually core customers of ours. We've done -- work for them for a long period of time. It's really expanding our product line into those customers, because they've asked us to do it. They want a provider who can provide digital solutions, who's got a great track record on safety and sustainability. And we're finding it attractive to expand our product set through acquisitions there as well. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And then my follow-up just on capital allocation, obviously again, very resilient business, that came through clear. You're mentioning three times leverage and that looks good. I mean, there's been a whole range of kind of a little bit more aggressive to a little bit -- or a little less aggressive. What's your thought on how you weather this pandemic and what you can do to perhaps press the accelerate a little bit, especially with your pipeline you just mentioned, it is full and balanced. Could we see a little bit of higher leverage now that it seems that you can tolerate a little bit higher leverage to take advantage of that M&A opportunity? Donald Slager : Well, I would say one, we are weathering the pandemic and feel hopeful that we'll be on the other side of this thing before too long. So, as relates to leverage, we've always stated what our optimal leverage is. And we've been for the last couple of years and kind of keeping right in that three times, the good news is when you're buying good cash flow, good EBITDA, good reoccurring revenue, you can continue to grow, and even increase the overall debt level, but keep your leverage pretty, pretty stable. That's how we built this business, frankly, right? So, we are -- we have in the past for the right deal increased leverage a little bit with the commitment to get it right back in line over a short period of time, call it, 12 to 24 months. We've shown we can do that. If the right deal came along, we certainly would look at that. We're not going to overlap with the company by any means, but we've got a lot of dry powder. We've got a lot of capability. We're proven as it relates to getting deals done, getting deals through DOJ, accordingly getting assets sold as necessary and getting things integrated. We've got a proven model for that and proven capability within our team. So, yeah, I think as the world continues to change, as maybe some competitors get fatigued with what's ahead of them or change a regulation, sometimes drives smaller competitors to selling. A lot of it still is people coming to a point in life where they -- pardon the term, but they kind of age out, right? They've been in business for a long time and they start to think about selling their businesses, their retirement. So, we're right there to pick them up. Again, first or second position in a market is what we're looking to achieve. As Jon mentioned, we've gone into some new markets where we've taken a lesser position, but with the appetite to move into that number one or number two spot before too long, and that's still our approach. So, the pipeline is strong, the ability to get deals done, and integrate deals are strong and the balance sheet is strong. So we can't be in a better place. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Shows like excellent strategy. Appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question will come from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Thanks for taking my question and good evening everybody. Maybe if I could just follow-up on the electric vehicle strategy. A question -- maybe just on the Romeo investment, can you remind me if any of the technology that you developed there, would that be proprietary to them, or is that something you could share with other OEMs as you look to eventually convert your fleet over time? And then secondly, you made a comment in your prepared remarks about electric being kind of the only -- maybe the only zero-carbon propulsion system. Just wondering how you think about hydrogen fuel cells? It seems like that's making a little bit of a push in Europe in terms of terms of waste to vehicle. Are you testing anything from that perspective, or was electric kind of the horse you're riding on now? Donald Slager : Yeah. Let me start with the second part and I'll work back to the first part of. The -- so yes, lots of work in Europe and everywhere else. Listen, innovation is going to have lots of people looking at lots of different things over time. If you look at where the balance of the global OEMs are, the investment on electrification in our space is dwarfing. The investment on hydrogen, most of our hydrogen investment has really been in the long haul space. And look, if we remain open-minded, right, as the technologies emerge and evolve, but I think it's -- we're pretty competent. Electrification is going to be the right technology for our application. And then we're working through the alliance with Romeo. We're -- they're not going to become an exclusive supplier to us by any means that wasn't the nature of the relationship and deal. However, we are working on proprietary things together and including a pilot where we retrofit one of our vehicles, because that's what the electrification to get it to scale. It's going to take a commitment and willingness to innovate, right? Trial and error, learning, testing, right? We'll adjust and over time, right, we'll kind of overcome those hurdles, and we will get to scale with the technology. Kevin Chiang : That sound strategy and makes a ton of sense. And maybe just a housekeeping question, your comment on -- you commented that environmental should see -- I know a small part of your revenue stream, but it would see above average growth. Is there a way to think about maybe what that can look like? I don't know we going a quarterly revenue basis. I think it's been around kind of mid 20s a quarter the last couple of quarters here. Should we think of something like mid 30s or any goalpost might be helpful? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. The comment was a little bit more, I would say, on the top line as it relates. And again, back to the commentary was really that focused on the downstream portion of that business. So, again, as Jon mentioned, that's an area where we really feel like we can leverage our core capabilities. It's what we do already. So it's really just expanding that addressable market to those customers that are really looking for an integrated solution and really from a provider of someone like us. So, that's where we just feel like a combination of both organic growth opportunities, as well as through acquisition that we can see above average growth rates relative to what we may see on the solid waste side expressed as a percentage. Kevin Chiang : Thank you. I appreciate the color. Have a great evening, everybody. Donald Slager : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Silber : Thank you so much. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the accelerated use of technology. I'm excluded -- I'm assuming that goes beyond what you talked about on the EV side. I know you've talked about the digital platform before. Can you talk a little bit about how you think technology might be changing your business over the next few years? Donald Slager : Yeah. Sure. So we started with our dispatch function. And so -- from the operation side, and that's where -- that's the team that really builds routes and directs the trucks out every morning and adjust those trucks sometimes in the middle of the day, so that we can service our customers. And we got them into a very visual based mapping structure that allows us to build routes more efficiently and frankly more effectively for customers to improve our delivery time and speed.  We're now in the process of rolling out technology into all of our vehicles. And so, now we'll have two way communication between dispatch and the vehicle. And we think that as a number of benefits. One, it allows us to provide a better employee experience. It certainly allows us to take more costs out of the system, because we're more efficient. And then it'll also allow us to connect to all of the customer facing investments we've made over time that allow us to provide service notification, verification and reporting, and a number of the benefits that customers want, which we think will help further differentiate our offering in the marketplace. Jeff Silber : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up -- I'm sorry to go back to the M&A contribution. I know you said it's 150 basis points for the deals that have closed. But I'm assuming that excludes Santek. One, can you confirm that? Two, can you just remind us how Santek is and what you paid for the business -- So we'll be paying? Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. So, you're correct. Right, the 150 basis points that only includes acquisitions, which have closed. So that specifically exclude Santek. And we're not giving any sort of details on what we pay for Santek or for that matter any other deals. Jeff Silber : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Jeff Goldstein : Hey, good evening guys. Looking at your average yield guidance next year of 2.5%. How should we think about potential upside to that figure? Does it mostly revolve around increasing inflation? Is it around more success in your resi and renegotiations? Is it more commercial coming back online? Just what would be the most likely source of upside and looking at that estimate? Donald Slager : Well, it's all the above, right? There's a lot of mix issues that go into yield. Certainly, it is. CPI has an impact on our business as CPI moves up. And we have all sorts of the automatic escalator working through our resi space, that will happen. We've talked about now for a couple of years, as we've been changing the indices for the escalators and our resi base business to something that's more representative of the solid waste space. We've had a lot of success there. Jon's been talking about that now quarter-after-quarter, and we continue to have success. There even though CPI continued to get better. We still moved continually toward an escalator that made more sense. Recycling, we're going to -- we've got work to do still in recycling, right? It's all those things. I don't think it's any one thing that you can point to. Although, CPI by itself, if it gets north of two, two and a half will be a nice pickup for us. Jon Ark : Yeah. There's -- two things I point to our construction, right, which certainly looks strong and it's probably gaining strength. So that could provide some upside in the large container side of the business. And we feel really optimistic about our special waste pipeline. We've always talked about an election year. Some of those jobs tend to stall out, just given the uncertainty and our pipeline remains strong through 2020, but we did see some of those jobs push out and those jobs are now hitting. So as special waste gets more busy, that should put some upward pressure on pricing on the landfill side. Donald Slager : Look, on top of that, you think about kind of best ever service levels, right, that speaks well for extending customer loyalty. And that means better pricing and all the rest of it. So, there's just a lot of factors. Jon Ark : Yeah. I was going to say, the one thing to remind you of, of how CPI works through our business, is it lags, right? So the CPI print from 2020 is impacting our pricing in 2021. And even with that lower CPI based pricing, we're talking about margin expansion, strong EPS, strong cash flow growth, as well as improvements of free cash flow conversion. As we start to see inflation, right, that's only going to benefit 2022 and beyond. So, as you start to see those inflation prints, and if you see anything kind of north of two, right, because this year was only 120 basis points, anything north of two is only going to be a solid tailwind going forward. Jeff Goldstein : That was all. Super helpful color. Thank you. Then just, you said last quarter that overtime was down 10% year-over-year, and maybe I missed it. But where does that stand right now? And do you think moving into 2021 overtime can still tick -- is it going to tick up again, given that comp or do you think you've learned how to be more efficient there? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. We're still at about the 10% range. I'd expect overtime that we'd settle into the 5% to 10% kind of a pre-pandemic, post-pandemic change or a reduction in overtime. And we'll capture some of that benefit because we've just learned how to be more efficient, right? We've taken some routes off of Saturdays and Sundays, right, and put them into our kind of daily routine Monday through Friday. And that's certainly a more efficient way to service the customer. But also keep in mind we're always looking at the income statement and the balance sheet. We're going to make the optimal trade off on the asset. And so, you could have zero time -- zero overtime by running a truck 40 hours a week. But that wouldn't be a very good capital trade-off right? So, we think in the low fifties is really the optimal spot from an hours per week where that truck should be running and that balances out customer service and safety and employee experience and all those things. So, again, we'll sustain some of those savings and overtime savings, and I think that'll settle out between a 5% to 10% reduction overtime. Jeff Goldstein : Understood. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question will come from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead. David Manthey : Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. In terms of pricing, all else equal and longer term, do you have a preference for a CPI based price index versus a fixed 3% increase? And I guess, more broadly if inflation does pick up generally, could you just outline what you see as the major pros and cons to your business? Jon Ark : Yeah. I think on the pricing, I think, the first thing we want to do is we want to make sure that we secure a price increase that more than covers our costs increase. And even in a low inflationary environment, we have a strong belief that our people need to raise every year, but their expenses are going up. And so we want something that covers that cost increase and then hopefully increase a little more that allows us to expand margins over time. Our broad view is that we don't want to get too concentrated on any single indices, whether that be fixed or water through trashed or anything else. So we like a balanced approach. As long as it's something better than CPI or a fraction of CPI, which historically the industry has accepted, which we're no longer tolerating, right? We're making sure we're getting paid for the work we do over time. And then in terms of inflation, why Don mentioned that's good for us is because we've always given our people a fair wage increase, right? And so our cost increases with inflation don't really change a whole lot where we get more on the top line of the business, right, put upward pressure on our fixed -- our CPI or water, sewer trash related indices. And I think even in the open market just puts more upward pressure on pricing, on what customers are willing to pay. Donald Slager : Look, water, sewer trash has consistently outpaced CPI. And again, we talk about a waste related indices, it's fair. That's really the -- that's really the point, right, is in 3% to 4% fixed, it is fair. We can negotiate with customers in fairness and we can make the commitment we need to continue to update our fleet. The modernization that Jon talked about, pay our people market rates provide good benefits and do all the great things we do to keep our people showing up every day, just like they did throughout this pandemic, right? The way service providers in America didn't get near enough respect or appreciation from people at large. They showed up every day with very little complaining, and were true heroes. And to Jon's point, we are going to continue to reward that over time. And a fair rate works. And the underlying issue is really the market is rational. And it's allowing us to continue to move that needle little by little by little. And we've got a big portion of our book now corrected. David Manthey : Okay. Thank you for that. And you noted that you expect to retain efficiencies that you gained in 2020 going forward, and specifically you outlined overtime as one of those areas. What are the other cost items where you see the greatest retention of benefits that you captured during the pandemic? Donald Slager : Yeah. Certainly on T&E, I would say we're not the only company on that front. But there's things -- historically, most companies and we were in this bucket, they had two modes of meeting either it was a conference call or it was in-person which involved a lot of time and hotel costs and airfare costs and everything else, and the emergence of Zoom and Teams and the other technologies have allowed people to work in new ways. And there's certainly benefits from being together. And so, we expect over time, that some of those costs will come back from the business, but certainly not all those costs. So we're challenging the way we work. And the other thing, over time will be real estate. There are some roles that we think will be better permanently done from home. We did an unbelievable job of transitioning our team from an in-office environment, primarily to an at-home environment. And some of those roles, we think long-term are best suited to be at-home and we'll have some real estate savings associated with that. Jon Ark : Things like that will affect turnover continually positively right? So we've seen good benefits from that. So it's a number -- again, a number of things, but a lot of sustainability there. Brian DelGhiaccio : And as Jon mentioned earlier, the benefits from routing that impacts more than just labor, that also impacts maintenance and fuel. And if you look at our results, right, you can see the improvements that we're seeing in that cost as a percentage of revenue across all of those P&L line item. David Manthey : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hey, gang. Thanks for the questions. If I'm playing clean up, Brian, can I ask you a couple of housekeeping? So we all hear the same message. Like what's the share count in the earnings guidance, what's your run rate interest expense per quarter. So we get those right in our model. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. Michael, what like you said, we're not going into that level of detail on the guide. Again, I think just, keeping it to the EPS and the free cash flow and some of the organic growth is where we're keeping that, as compared to going through some of the individual components. That said, I mentioned on the -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are assuming that 26% equivalent tax rate, that's that combination of both the effective tax rate as well as the non-cash charges from solar investments. But again, we're kind of keeping it a little bit more to a higher level guide. Michael Hoffman : Okay. But are you assuming share buybacks in that number? Or should we -- I mean, it does matter because it could be a 2% or 3% movement. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. We've got a modest amount of share purchases. Again, as we've talked about previously the first use of that free cash flow is going to be for acquisitions. We talked about that robust pipeline of acquisition activity. So, again, that's going to be the first use, is going to be to fund that. So, it's not going to be necessarily, I would say, as significant as what you've seen in years prior to 2020, but still a modest amount of share repurchases assumed in 2021. Michael Hoffman : Okay. On the margin, just for clarity, your original guidance was midpoint was 28.5. Do you beat that by 90 basis points? Which I presume what's happened is there's nothing like a crisis to get you all focused on a cost structure that was coming out of the model regardless, but it's now come all out in 2020, you're going to carry and hold it, keep it and build from it. Is the right way to read all this? Brian DelGhiaccio : Correct. Jon Ark : Yeah. I'd say the one exception of, Michael, look, there is a little bit of tailwind benefit here on the safety side and on the productivity side with lower traffic patterns. And as people return to the office, right, when -- to what pace that happens, we'll see, right? There may be some headwind, but I think that's the minor part of the story, right? I think the majority of those safety productivity benefits, right, we plan on capturing, because success begets success, right? We figured out a new way of working in those teams. And those -- our teams are committed to capturing those benefits. Donald Slager : You think about -- to your point, Michael, we were -- when we moved originally from answering the phone at 300 locations to three, we said, Hey, someday, we're going to think about work from home solution, but that wasn't in our mind to do in 2020 until it had to be, right? We were -- that was sort of in our mind a couple of years out, right? There'll be other things we're working on. And then all of a sudden it had to happen. And as we reported, we moved to working from home in those three locations with like 72 hours. And that was a great learning. It was a great find. It was a great pickup. Now we'll benefit from that going forward, right? We'll figure out what that all means. As Jon said, as things sort of modulating, and we find this new-- this next new plateau, if you will, and then we'll grow from there and from there, right? But yeah, we did better than we originally thought. And the story continues to improve from here. As I mentioned, there's still a lot of upside in this business. Jon talked about RISE, talk about all these other things that we're doing that are still in early innings that are continued to pay benefits into the future. Brian DelGhiaccio : And Mike, I mentioned it earlier. I think it was Tyler's question, right? So, back to on the heels -- and I think you were just asking this question -- on the heels of that triple digit margin expansion in 2020, right, we expect further margin expansion. Within the guide there, there's 50 basis points of margin expansion with -- from the underlying business in 2021. And then there's a couple of pieces that are somewhat offsetting that, but very strong performance, especially given what we did this year Jon Ark : Think about RISE, I mean, we started to roll that out and then COVID hit, and then we pumped the brakes and then we kind of went full up, right? And we continue to implement that. I mean, the team that did that, did an outstanding job, we thought sort of spring last year that we'd have to, I'd say pull the plug on it, but just really put it aside while we were dealing with the uncertainty of COVID. Instead, we move forward. We actually increased the speed and actually got it. That phase of it all implemented and pretty impressive. Michael Hoffman : Got it. Last one for me. You did $128 million in 2020 in the environmental solutions business. Is that -- you've confused me with your answers, that number going to be up or down in 2021? Brian DelGhiaccio : It's going to somewhat flattish is what we are expecting on the environmental solutions. Donald Slager : Yeah. Michael Hoffman : Which is pretty significant since you're running $25 million a quarter for three quarters. So you've got to overcome a really tough 1Q to be flat. So that's the importance of that statement. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Cool. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks so much for taking the questions. First of all, congratulations to your entire team from the frontline folks on up for the performance in a really tough year again. I guess, I have a little bit of a long-term or even the medium term growth strategy question here, which is, I think we understand that there's always a component of churn that is structural and driven by bankruptcies. I think, if you said back in April that you'd be exiting the year at a 93% retention rate, we would have been surprised. It's interesting now commercial bankruptcies are actually down year-over-year in the U.S. and still just listening to what you've said about your own cost structure. I mean, if more companies act like Republic and continue to not spend on hospitality, travel and some of the other expense in the past, where business formation and where growth happens in the economy is still going to change from what we might have expected previously. So how do you calibrate for that? How do you position the business to capture where the growth is going to be? Donald Slager : Overall, think about where we are, right? And think about the balance we have. We always talk about the power of the portfolio, right? That is number one. And number two, across the markets we're in. We have a good concentration in what I've called Sunbelt markets, but markets and people move to whether it's the Northwest, down the West Coast, across the South and up into the Carolinas, we're well-positioned in places like Texas and Florida, right? A lot of people moving there these days. So, we're still got strong positions in Metro markets, right? This thing's going to settle down. People are going to become more rational in their behavior again. And well-positioned to pick up all the growth in the markets we're in. So, that -- the way that growth comes will change. Downturns and these kind of shocks to the economy that we've lived through we know for our entire lives here and there, are different. This one's different than the last one. So there's still strong demand for housing, right? And we've always talked about how single family home, housing starts and household formation clearly tracks with our growth. So that paints a pretty strong picture. Household formation lends to business formation. There's a lot, I think, pent-up demand and the consumer, consumers are pretty good shape, right? When you think about wage growth and think about what's happened in savings accounts across the nation, I think there's a lot of people just chomping at the bit to get out. And so, while we may have pulled in a little bit on teeny, the average consumer is going through, I think, they're going to get out there and rush to some new opportunity, right? Noah Kaye : Yeah. Donald Slager : And so we're not too concerned and -- about that. I think the free market always finds a way and we're right smack dab in the middle of the free market, right? Noah Kaye : Yeah. I mean, the household balance sheets are in great shape as you point out relative to past crises. And you mentioned the housing sector activity plus potential RISE and CPI, plus a full year of reopening. And then that will point to kind of a multiyear growth acceleration for the waste industry. So, I think, your comments around the portfolio and how you can leverage off of that are well taken. Donald Slager : Look, the other thing too is like, when we went through the Great Recession, right, that thing was -- pardon the term, but that's by a thousand cuts. I mean, it just kept going and getting deeper and longer and sustained. And is this thing ever going to get over? There's probably some people that have some of that feeling about COVID, but we went from -- Hey, surprise. COVID is here to the bottom falling out across the market, defining that bottom, in a pretty short order and then battling back. It wasn't this ongoing three, four year slump of this. We're coming out of it, right? And there are still people who are dealing with tragedy, there are people dealing with hardship, and we're not minimizing any of that. But all -- all-in-all over the top of it, the economy is coming out of it and we're coming out of it with it. And we're seeing those things reflect in our business. And so, that's our viewpoint for 2021 and beyond. Noah Kaye : Great. Well, thanks again for taking the question. Operator : Our next question will come from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. Nice work. Really, really good work. Donald Slager : Hi, Sean. Sean Eastman : It's getting long. So, I'll just ask one. I'm just curious, if you look at your private competitors or maybe if you looked at your acquisition pipeline -- the companies in your acquisition pipeline. I mean, it sounds like the pricing discipline goes all the way down to the small independents, which is great. I\u2019m just curious, if you look at this ability RSGs had to dynamically flex costs and really having on an offense on some of these technology initiatives in 2020. Has it been similar with those private companies? I mean, have you observed a similar approach from them through this last year or not? I'd be curious to get your sense on that. Donald Slager : I think it\u2019s a mix, to be honest. I think some people panic frankly and did mass layoffs really quickly. Other people kind of plow their way through. I think the broader theme is they\u2019re not making some of the investments we\u2019re making into sustainability, for example, or into the digital platform that we\u2019re making. These are multiyear investments. And these are eight figure investments over time that become really, really expensive that we need broad scale to get value out of investments over time. So, we see them. Again, I think, pricing has held up well. I think, in general, people have tried to do the right thing in terms of taking care of their people on balance. But we\u2019ve been able to kind of do both where they -- we\u2019ve seen that more just focus on getting the garbage or the recycling off the ground rather than thinking longer term about where to take their business. Brian DelGhiaccio : And look at our CapEx, right? I mean, we didn\u2019t take a CapEx holiday in 2020, right? We didn\u2019t hit that free cash flow number by not spending on the company. We continue our investments in fleet and systems and some of the innovations that Jon talked about. Of course, we invested heavily in our frontline, in our people. We\u2019re committed to serve. And we saw some of that from some of our smaller providers. As Jon said, it\u2019s a mixed bag, I mean, overall, I think it depends how healthy and strong you are going into it. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we were coming into this from a position of strength and stability and alignment across our team and a really strong culture going in and that led the way for us. And again, back to the power of the portfolio, we\u2019re well-positioned, good balance sheet, all those things in our favor. So, position of strength matters, and from there, now we'll get back to 2021 and we'll do it again. Sean Eastman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Our next question will come from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Stephanie Yee : Hi. Good evening. I'll just ask one question. Do you envision Republic getting to 30% EBITDA margins? And can you talk about what drivers will get you there as you have to offset some of the headwinds when business activity picks up? Is there a timeframe that you have in mind for reaching that target? Donald Slager : Well, we're right on the cusp of 30% EBITDA margins and 29.5% our guide. We think, yes, we will certainly be at 30%. What are some of the drivers? As we continue to improve our recycling business, we are well into that. We can give you more detail, but we are running out of time on the call today. But we\u2019ve made good progress there, good progress on -- as Jon mentioned the approach we\u2019re taking on the alternative indices in the resi space, good progress there. The RISE platform while we've guided rolled out. It\u2019s only sort of the early phases of that, that is going to be something that we\u2019ll build on once we get connected digitally the customers and all the parts of our business, we will just continue to add enhancements that drive margin, that drive quality -- customer experience that drive customer loyalty, will drive price, right? The safety story is a good story. Fleet is a good story. And then M&A, right? As we build, we\u2019re going to do a nice balance of new platform acquisitions, new markets, but also our bread and butter is still tuck-ins in markets we\u2019re already in. Come in at a higher margin, they are quicker to integrate. So there is just a handful of things that are in our favor. And we'll continue to invest properly in the business. We told you we had 30% in our sites as we are right there, and 30% margin will be here before you know it. How\u2019s that? Stephanie Yee : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. Thanks. I appreciate you squeezing me in. And just on the 1.5% to 2% volume and the fact that Q1 is going to be slightly negative. Can you just help us understand how that\u2019s going to play out through the year? I mean, do we need a pickup in some commercial and some business units in the second half to get us to that 1.5% to 2%? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. So, Mike, let me take this one. So, again, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we're expecting the performance to be better than what we saw in the fourth quarter of this year, but still negative, right? As we look at the kind of the distribution of volume, we would expect our best volume performance to be in the second quarter and that\u2019s just because of the comp, right? So that\u2019s when we saw the biggest decline in 2020. So, you\u2019ve got the easiest prior year comparison. And then it gets a little bit tougher as you move into the second half, but our expectation is that, it still remains positive. So, again, we are projecting that the economy continues to gradually improve and that is baked into our guide on the top line. But as you kind of said meaningful type volume recovery to get there, I'd say, no. Most of that has already occurred based on what we\u2019ve seen in 2020, with some modest improvement going forward in unit recovery. Michael Feniger : Thanks. Thanks, Brian. And just, I know this has been asked before, the $600 million spend, which does not include Santek, it\u2019s translating to 150 bps of the top line. I mean, you guys just did over $10 billion of sales. I'm just trying to translate the $600 million, the 150 bps top line. And I know you are not going to give us acquisition multiples, I get that. Maybe I\u2019m just a little slow here just like getting that $600 million spend, the 150 bps, is that like just very conservative? Are they are like on divestitures? I'm just trying to triangulate some of that. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. Yeah. So, let me clarify. Okay? Michael Feniger : Yeah. Brian DelGhiaccio : The 150 basis points is the rollover impact of acquisitions that closed during 2020. That includes acquisitions that closed in February of 2020. And that\u2019s nothing to do with Santek. Santek did not close by December 31. It is not in that 150 basis points. Based on the timing of when it closed in 2020, you get a rollover benefit, just because you didn\u2019t report a full year in 2020, that\u2019s the 150 basis points. If you were to just annualize the revenue of what we acquired in 2020, it\u2019s over $200 million. Michael Feniger : Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. Yeah. Thank you. Brian DelGhiaccio : As we look forward, though, into 2021, our $600 million investment that we\u2019re anticipating, that does include Santek as well as other deals. We are not talking about right now about the revenue contribution that we are anticipating from those deals, because some of it\u2019s just based on when it closes in 2021, how much it will contribute in here. Michael Feniger : That was helpful. Thank you, Brian. I appreciate that. Thanks. Thanks everyone. Operator : Next question comes from Scott Levine with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Scott Levine : Hey guys. DonaldSlager: Hi, Scott. Scott Levine : I have one question for you, actually on recycling. So, we've seen commodity prices come back very nicely. China has essentially pulled back from the market. Even though we are at a lower price point on most recycled commodities than we were in say 2017. Does the new environment gives you -- being more stable give you more confident in investing in recycling? Or what are your expectations now that kind of the whole China import ban scenario has kind of played itself out in commodity prices are on meant there? Donald Slager : Yeah. There are two things. One, is certainly even strengthens our result to go into City Hall and get a pricing mechanism that we think works for both parties. Historically, the industry is price recycling on the backend, which has caused a lot of volatility in the business, that is otherwise quite stable. And we think the fairest pricing model that we get paid a fair return to pick it up, a fair return to process it. And then we share in the commodity value in the backend. And as commodity prices get higher, it\u2019s easier to talk to customers, particularly in municipalities about getting that model, right? And then long-term, we are bullish on recycling. We see a world that has population growth and material scarcity and a big desire from a lot of different aspects around reuse and recycle. And we think we are going to be a big part of that and a big player in that. We just have to make sure that to be environmentally sustainable, it is economically sustainable and we get a fair return for the work that we do. Scott Levine : Fair enough. Thanks. I will leave it there. Nice work guys. Jon Ark : Thank you. Donald Slager : Thanks, Scott. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Donald Slager : Great. Thank you, operator. When we look back on 2020, it's clear to see just how instrumental the foundation we\u2019ve built over the past decade has been and enabling us to thrive in the midst of so many challenges. The pandemic's impact on Republic was just like that of the rest of the world, disrupting the lives of our customers, our communities and, of course, our people. But we were able to react from a position of strength, taking care of all of our stakeholders. Our strong foundation did more than just set us apart, it actually allowed us to prevail. We believe our 2020 performance clearly demonstrated the resiliency of our business, and position just well to deliver continued growth in 2021. This momentum is bolstered by an improving economy, as we move into an era of recovery and growth. As always, we managed this business to create long-term value for all our stakeholders while providing essential sustainable services for our customers. I thank the team for their tenacity and their enthusiasm, as we head into this New Year. Thanks for joining us. Hope you all have a good evening and stay safe out there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

We believe these non-GAAP metrics are useful in evaluating our reported results.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Feeler : Thank you, Eric and good morning to everyone joining the call today. Before I dive into some prepared remarks on the quarter, I'd like to personally thank all of my colleagues within US Ecology for their dedication to health, safety and operational excellence, despite the disruptions from the ongoing global pandemic, weather events and other constraints. For those that are following our webcast presentation, please direct your attention to Slide 5. The positive momentum we saw in our business in the second half of 2020 has continued into the first quarter 2021, with improving trends and overall business conditions across a substantial portion of our business. Overall, our first quarter results were slightly ahead of our expectations. These solid results were achieved on the efforts of our broad-based team, that navigated the continued pandemic challenges and new challenges such as the extreme weather events impacting our Texas-based operations and customers and supply chain disruptions that are proving to be headwinds for many of our industrial-based customers delaying them from returning to pre-COVID levels. Total company revenue was $228.6 million for the first quarter of 2021 and was down just 5% year-over-year when compared to a strong pre-pandemic first quarter last year. Our Field Services segment was a bright spot with organic revenue growth of 4%. Our emergency response business was strong on the backs of continued COVID-19 decontamination work. We completed just under 2,700 projects and generated approximately $12.5 million of revenue during the quarter. This was a 13% sequential improvement over the fourth quarter last year and was the strongest quarter since the pandemic began. In our Waste Solutions segment, base business revenue was down just 3% year-over-year, as beginning to benefit from the improved economic conditions. Looking sequentially at our base business, it was down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, much less than the sequential decline of 5% we experienced in the same period last year. Dissecting our base business by month, March 2021 was the strongest month of the quarter, recording both sequential and year-over-year growth. We anticipate base business will build on the results in March and record year-over-year growth in the second quarter, putting us on track to achieve our 5% to 7% growth target for the full year of 2021. Event Business revenue was down 9% in the first quarter compared to the prior year and was up 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2020.We continue to see positive developments in our pipeline with increased bidding activities, with market reopenings and expectations for more normalized business conditions as we approach the summer construction season.  Our energy waste business has now reported its third quarter of sequential EBITDA improvement, with increased treatment dispose and disposal volumes on improved rig count and related business activity. This allowed us to return to a positive EBITDA contribution during the quarter, generating approximately $1.3 million of EBITDA. Though revenues were down 64% in the first quarter compared to last year, they were up 29% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing. While we are nowhere near pre-pandemic levels, the positive developments are welcome side and are better than we had expected to see last year. Overall, we reported total company adjusted EBITDA of $33.2 million, down 23% from the prior year, which was ahead of our internal plan. We continue to generate strong free cash flow of $13.7 million during the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Eric, I want to provide an update on some of our latest sustainability initiatives which we are working on in 2021.On the governance front, in February, we had announced the appointment of Mack Hogans to our Board. Mack brings extensive experience in leadership, strategy, M&A, governance and ESG programs. This addition along with others made in 2020 demonstrate our ongoing focus on board refreshment and our commitment to board diversity, not only with regard to gender and race, but also experienced and expertise as well. These ongoing steps we are taking to improve diversity both within our Board and our employee base has strengthened us as a company. On the environmental front, we have substantially completed gathering our vehicle fleet and emissions data and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Our vehicle fleet represents the most significant impact to the environment, given that our landfills have minimal greenhouse gas emissions, particularly when compared to solid waste landfills of our peers. With our baseline data in hand, we are working with our capital planning group and advisors to develop emission reduction targets below our baseline levels, despite expanding our fleet to support our growing field services business. We are also advancing sustainable waste solution services we offer to our customers, including investing and beneficial reuse technologies like aerosol recycling, container recycling and distillation recovery systems, which we believe are responsive to demands in the marketplace and are not only good for the environment, but also good for business.  Finally, on the social front, we know that it's essential in a sophisticated and competitive market sector like ours to have leading human capital practices. The starting point for us therefore is to look as widely, inclusively and creatively as possible to identify, attract and retain, promote and protect our top talent. Anything we do that needlessly limits our talent pool or just diminishes the effectiveness of our team members and their career prospects can adversely affect our employment value proposition as well as our overall culture. This means that our diversity, equity and inclusion are a core to our value creation and sustainability efforts and this is evident in the strength of our programs. To give a couple of examples, we offer a wide variety of industry-leading programs to meet our employees individual needs wherever possible. We have created regular and robust feedback loops, so that we can gain insights from all of our people, including our fresh size. And we continue to evolve our training, mentoring, promotion and retention programs to increase diversity, respect and inclusive ways of working throughout our company. We are proud of the special culture we have created, that is built on inclusion, respect, protecting the environment and continuous improvement in everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric. Eric Gerratt : Thank you, Jeff. Starting with consolidated results on Slide 8. Revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $228.6 million. Revenue for the Waste Solutions segment was $104.1 million for the first quarter of 2021, down 5% compared to $109.4 million in the first quarter of 2020. The decrease was due to a 17% decline in transportation revenue and a 3% decrease in Treatment and Disposal revenue.  The decline in our Treatment and Disposal revenue was driven by a 3% decline in base business and a 9% decrease in event business in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter last year. The Field Services segment delivered revenue of $118.2 million in the first quarter, up 4% compared to $114 million in the first quarter of 2020.  This increase was driven by increases in our emergency response, small quantity generation and total waste management service lines. Total gross margin contracted approximately 280 basis points to 23% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year. This was primarily a result of lower waste volumes in both our Waste solutions and our energy waste segments. Selling, general and administrative spending or SG&A was $51.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 and included $1.2 million of business development and integration expenses. This compared to $52.4 million in the first quarter of 2020, which included $2.9 million in business development and integration expenses. Adjusted loss per diluted share was $0.07 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.12 in the same quarter last year. Adding back the impact of intangible asset amortization, cash earnings per diluted share was $0.14 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.33 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was $33.2 million in the first quarter, down 23% from the first quarter of 2020. Turning to Slide 9. We exited the quarter with a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity. Despite the lower operating results compared to the prior year, we were able to generate strong adjusted free cash flow of $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. We had cash of $82.4 million and over $140 million of available capacity on our revolving line of credit at the end of the first quarter. Net borrowings were $702. 9 million at March 31, 2021, which was an improvement over our net borrowings at December 31, 2020. Our bank covenant leverage ratio was 4.5 times at March 31, 2021, well under the 5.5 times covenant level for the quarter. We expect the first quarter of 2021 to be the high point in terms of leverage and that will be below 4 times at the end of 2021. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Feeler : Thank you, Eric. We are encouraged by the positive trends we are seeing with quarter-over-quarter improvement across most if not all our business lines. With this and the improving industrial trends combined with our ongoing success in our NRC integration activities, we have reaffirmed our 2021 business outlook. This includes a forecast of growth for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2021. Diving into our integration activities in more detail. We continue to make terrific progress and we are seeing our revenue synergies really gained momentum here in the second year. We continue to see a path to meet our three-year target of $20 million of EBITDA synergies by the end of 2021, one year ahead of our original target. Slide 10 has a detailed breakdown of our 2021 guidance that was released in February of this year and that we are reaffirming today. I am so proud of the entire US Ecology team and their ability to step-up, innovate and drive value during these times. As the industrial economies recover, we have the right assets and services in the right places to capitalize and thrive. We continue to be a trusted partner to our customers and together we are building a sustainable future for all. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : I appreciate that you got, you opened the year a little bit ahead of plan, you're reaffirming the guidance and I don't think companies are supposed to be trying to chase their guidance up prematurely. How would you reflect on the trend inside the guidance though? Is this have more momentum to the upside than not given what you're seeing? Eric Gerratt : I mean we're one quarter into it, another month behind us after today with April on here. And what I would say is, is the year is looking, the way we intended it to look maybe it's a little bit better. I mean there's a lot of green shoots that are out there. And our first quarter results, they were strong results given the fact pattern. But you also put into context some of the continued start and stop activities that we've seen with the ongoing pandemic, but we also had some major weather events that disrupted everything. So all in, I'm really proud of what we delivered in the first quarter. And I think it does set us up for a strong 2021. But there is still nine months to go. And we're going to continue to execute our strategy in our plan. And we have conviction in our guidance range that we released just back in February and reaffirmed it yesterday. Michael Hoffman : And when we think about cadence, is there anything particular about what happened is exited 1Q and what you know since March April, essentially done about, how to think about the cadence, is this sort of originally when we all have these conversations in February, it was kind of a steady, almost ratable March through the year. Does it picked up a little bit speed in 2Q or does it still stay pretty ratable as far as the top line? Jeff Feeler : Thinking about the cadence of the top line, normal seasonality will play in and will drive it. So yeah, we're expecting Q2 to be sequentially better than Q1 and Q3, sequentially better than Q2. And they're talking about cadence from March to April, I would say, we're seeing similar patterns. And w -- when you get into the first quarter and look at it by month, March was the strongest month that we had. So all of that is pointing in the right direction. There is nothing that's given us a lot of pause there in their. And I would say that we're on track to deliver that range and execute on our plan. Michael Hoffman : And then you mentioned and it's not the first time I've heard this, but some of the supply disruptions are slowing the recovery of some of the customer base. That doesn't looks like that's going to get any relief in this calendar year. And is that, that's all accounted for in the guidance as well as that that you weren't looking for a big lift on reopening per se more of an overall improvement in the industrial economy broadly? Jeff Feeler : So all of that factored in Michael in what we're seeing. And I think that that when you think about the choppiness we referred to in Q1, we saw it with a lot of closures and kind of the high rates of infection that we saw in the pandemic, we've seen that alleviate. But on the supply chain information, it is impacting our customers. If you go and read the detailed commentary on what industrial customers are staying through ISM and things like that, they claim, they can't meet their demand because one supply changes disruption, but also labor shortages. And those are some of the things our customers are challenged with to regain and get back to I'll call pre-COVID levels and growth there upon. And so, those are things that are all factored in. But we're seeing it in our customer base and it creates ongoing choppiness. Michael Hoffman : And then last two for me. Texas got snot beat out of it from a weather issue, power shutdown and you are not hiding behind any weather commentary. But I'm just curious if you hadn't had a loss of power for a week or more, what the difference in the numbers might have been? Jeff Feeler : We haven't even tried to attempt to quantify that Michael. From our operational perspective, some of our business lines were down 10 and 10 days to two weeks, others reopened fairly rapidly, especially in our services arm and we had a little bit of freeze damage from the weather. But the reality is February was definitely impacted pretty hard in that region. We did see a nice uptick in March in that area, which probably is a little bit of pickup on there. But when we look at the whole of the equation, it's probably a setback because some of that business will never regain, because our customers were shut down. But for the most part, we still think that business conditions are robust enough down there that we'll be able to recover. Michael Hoffman : So closing the loop on that, you had a good quarter better than your plan and you had to deal with all of that. So if without it, it would have been that much incrementally better? Jeff Feeler : Absolutely. Michael Hoffman : Debt repayment, are there any structural limits on any of the terms of the debt make whole agreements anything like that that can allow you to keep walking these numbers down as you generate cash? Eric Gerratt : No. Michael, this is Eric. We're able to pay the facility down as quickly as we'd like. So there are no limitations on either obviously on the revolver, but even on the term loan B. The only limitations we have for the first year, there were some limitations on that, but that's, it's now wide open and we can pay down as quickly as we want. Michael Hoffman : And one last one, you opened the year saying we expect decontamination work to trend down. It was actually better in 1Q than your thought. Is it trending down or is it holding up? Jeff Feeler : No, it's actually trending down. So we saw a surge in January and the first part of February, and it's been trending down since then, which is what we anticipated and it really follows the case loads that are out there. And from the good side of things that for me humanity standpoint is we are seeing ourselves getting ahead of this pandemic at least here domestically. And so, if we see a risen case load, I would imagine that business line will benefit from it and otherwise they will be replaced by hopefully resurgence of industrial-based activities. Thanks, Michael. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : So just to be clear, there's not really much additional de-con work in the guide for the rest of the year? Eric Gerratt : No, I mean, no. Tyler Brown : Okay, that's helpful. And then, I mean, I know the reopenings difficult to discern free all. But and you don't talk a lot about monthly trends, but you did kind of make some mentions about March. Is there any way you can kind of let us know what base did in March or is it not really, just any color on exactly how much base was up in March? Jeff Feeler : From a year-over-year perspective, directionally, it was up about 10%. Now, the reality is if you go back to March of last year, we probably, we were starting to shut down in the second week or halfway through. So probably, March last year was a little bit lower when you look at the monthly cycle on that. So I think that's elevated. When you look at our base business for the full year, we are still confident that we're going to be able to deliver growth for between 5% to 7% on that and that's with us being down 3% in the first quarter. So everything is trending the way we expected it. It could be a little bit better than what we said on that side of things. But overall, when you equal everything out, we're still very confident in what we have for guidance out there. Tyler Brown : And so, Q2 implicitly is like plus double digit range on the base side? Jeff Feeler : I would expect a very healthy rebound in Q2 from a growth perspective. Tyler Brown : And then, just, again, I don't know if you can put a finer point on Q2 just to help us with our models. But you say it should improve sequentially. I mean, are we talking something like $5 million to $10 million of EBITDA sequentially just to help us kind of get, because Q2 is just a really funny quarter? Eric Gerratt : I think that's, this is Eric, Tyler. I think that's probably a reasonable range. If you look at our second quarter last year, we did EBITDA of just under $39 million. And so, I would expect us to be quite a bit better than that and that we can see laid out is probably reasonable. Tyler Brown : Okay, that's helpful. And then, so Jeff, you talked a little bit about investing in your people and about your kind of human capital and how you're really focus there, which is great. First off, I'm curious how many drivers do you actually employ roughly? Jeff Feeler : We're right around 250 to 300. Tyler Brown : And so, how hard is that, is that group to retain and recruit in the current environment? I mean, we obviously cover the truckers. I mean there is a lot going on out there. I know it's a different business. It's more of a go home at night business. But curious, are you seeing like real, substantive pressures on hiring retaining in that particular group? Jeffrey Feeler : We continue to see challenges in that group. And you nailed it. It's It's a demographic that it's not growing. And there's a lot of competing pressure, not only from our side of the world, but many other industries in there. So yes, we're continue to see challenges in there. Simon, maybe you can elaborate on some of the things that we're doing. Simon Bell : So this is Simon. It is a challenge as Jeff says. What we're doing is we're certainly launching programs that kind of provide retention. We're launching programs to kind of pay for schooling and encourage our employees to get their CDLs, really creating committees to better understand what is important to the driving community and what we can do to support them. As you mentioned, we do have both long haul and short haul. But certainly we think we can differentiate ourselves in some of the short-haul and really just listening to their drivers needs. And so, as Jeff said, it's something we are fiercely focused on, but, and we will be for a while I suspect. Tyler Brown : So some of those jobs, like I said are a little bit more LTL in nature, where I guess are coming home. But there is a subset, where you're actually laying those guys down at night that that long haul piece, it's probably a little bit tougher to recruit? Simon Bell : Absolutely. I mean, you think of our retail program in particular that -- those guys will be on the road for several days and then definitely a more challenging? Tyler Brown : Interesting. Okay. And then back to the NRC synergies. So correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm going off top of my head here. Eric, I think you of the 20, I think is the number you may be got 10 last year. I think you were guiding to something like 3 to 5. But then, Jeff, it sounded like there is more optimism there. So I'm just curious, are you basically tracking ahead of what you had originally thought on the synergies for this year, are we kind of right in line? You're just hoping that by the end of the year, you will be fully run rated. Eric Gerratt : So we're tracking a little bit ahead of what we thought for 2021 and it's really driven on the revenue side of things and I talked about the momentum, that's definitely continuing. And we're seeing a lot of opportunities emerged as we continue to really get more of a cohesive sales group across the organization and driving those results.  And we're seeing opportunities there. So we do believe that by the end of the year, we'll have achieved that $20 million run-rate and there is potentially upside to that next year. Jeff Feeler : And as a reminder, Tyler, the $20 million number was one that we put out at the time of the acquisition that we thought we'd be at that run rate by the end of 2022. So we feel like we're a year ahead of schedule. Tyler Brown : And then just my last one. Maybe coming back to the energy business. So I think you talked a little bit about it Jeff for kind of talked about on the periphery. But obviously, oil prices have moved. I'm just curious if you're starting to see any green shoots out there in the oil patch. Are you starting to see any building confidence that maybe that business could be a positive delta to what you're expecting for this year? Jeff Feeler : Well, Tyler, there's definitely green shoots in there. I mean, we definitely were ahead of plan and what we have anticipated on that business. We've seen rig counts increased dramatically from the low point, but they've increased, they've increased sequentially as well. And it's in both of the basins, both the Permian and Eagle Ford that we're -- that we planned. The reality though and the sanity check is we're still at 50% levels of where we were pre-pandemic. So all the trends are good. The activity is increasing. We're seeing a lot of green shoots out there. But we still have a ways to go to get back to that pre-pandemic level. Tyler Brown : And then, just real quickly, can you remind me what the mix is? Is it roughly half and half Permian versus Eagle Ford or is it skewed one way? Jeff Feeler : From a revenue standpoint, it's about half and half on there. So where our strength right now is in Eagle Ford, because we have two assets that we're put in place just before the pandemic set in and the Permian. Those are -- they are and they are trending positive, but they're still not to where we want them to be. Tyler Brown : And is the CapEx on that business roughly set as then you've kind of developed the footprint of the landfills probably built-out the first cells. Are you kind of good on the CapEx side, so that when we do see volumes come back in it, there is not a tremendous amount of capital mean? Simon Bell : Tyler, this is Simon. We are certainly planning and moving forward with our landfill construction this year. So we're going to make sure we have capacity for whatever the demand is. And we're also continuing with some refurbishment of equipment. And certainly, we're planning for a recovery and we're spending our capital accordingly. Jeff Feeler : And to just clarify that a little Tyler. The landfill Simon is referring to is the one in the Eagle Ford that that's the first one that was built. And so, it's current cell is almost, it's been operating for what four years and so it's just the next cell at that facility. Tyler Brown : Good deal. All right, guys. Thanks so much for the time. Jeff Feeler : All right. Thanks, Tyler. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Silber : Actually, just wanted to follow-up from one of Tyler's first question, about hiring and wage inflation and retention. We talked about truck drivers. Are you seeing, if it is anywhere else throughout the company? I know, we've got a lot of other companies complaining that it's tough to find good quality skilled workers out there. Jeff Feeler : I think everybody is competing for the same talent. I mean, the reality is, not only is are we competing against other companies, but my personal opinion is I think that there, we're competing against some of the government subsidy programs that are out there and that will hopefully will free up here the summer timeframe. But I think the combination of those two is creating a challenging condition to recruit frontline workers. Jeff Silber : Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned the government subsidies. So I wanted to ask about the infrastructure plan. I know it's still early. I know there's just some proposals. Is there anything in there that you think might either help or hurt your business? Jeff Feeler : Steve, why don't you address that? Steve Welling : Sure. Hi, this is Steve Welling here. What we've read so far is we look to potentially increase super fund clean-up work. There is possibly a proposal to add back the super fund tax on corporations, which will provide money for those types of cleanups. There is also when you do infrastructure improvements, usually, that means there's things that get turned down, cleaned up first before you improve. So like bridges, there could be lead paints and other waste streams that come from that. Also seeing that there is some information about improvement at schools in urban areas, which they want to remove all the lead piping. So it looks like that would, it would be a benefit to us for sure. It's just we don't have much detail yet. Jeff Silber : Sure nobody does, but that's actually good to hear. And finally, I think you alluded to this a little bit earlier. But you mentioned some of the starts and stops in terms of reopening. Are there any specific areas to call out that are doing better than others? Jeff Feeler : So what we're seeing is the West has seen some positivity and really the Gulf. And they're the ones that are starting to have been reopened and are reopening more. When we saw the start and stop is we have a lot of operations in the Michigan corridor and they've been a hotspot. And so, that was a challenge in the first quarter. But they're getting things under control. And we anticipate that that to improve here overall. And then, internationally, Canada continues to struggle. They're not -- they don't have the same vaccination rates that we do here. And I think Ontario just walk back down or the province of Ontario. And so, they've been struggling there. But the underlying business still seems to be gaining traction and positive momentum even though they're going through some starts and stops. Jeff Silber : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks so much. Jeff Feeler : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : The next question comes from Tyson Bauer with KC Capital. Please go ahead. Tyson Bauer : On the whole theme of pricing and inflation and treatment cost, whether it'd be freight or wage or other, some of the companies in the coverage universe have benefited from the inflation effects, others have suffered because of it. What is US Ecology stand as far as, are you able to pass those through, get a benefit in rising pricing environment or are you trying to absorb some of those treatment costs and that's may put a little pressure on? Jeff Feeler : Steve, why don't you talk about the pricing in what we -- the strategy we've been doing this year and I'll have Eric kind of chime in on where we're seeing some inflationary challenges. Steve Welling : So in prior years, we've done more across the board tag price increasing and this year it has been totally different. What we did is some selective price increase in certain markets, on certain waste streams and then some specific geographies, where the customer base wasn't as impacted as others. So we have taken price increases in the first quarter. Most went into effect between January 15th and February 15th on base business only. Event work, we bid case by case. But we have been doing a number of things and we're also looking, whether we potentially, one of the possibilities for maybe another increase in mid-year. But we've been able to pass the number of things along. In terms of the transportation, generally, we have a separate charge like on fuel surcharge. That does -- when things go up or down there recovered. But for the most part, a lot of our pricing, on waste disposal side, we have the ability to do adjust. We do have some select service lines, where we're in a longer term contract. But that's not the majority of our business. Eric Gerratt : And Tyson, Just in terms of kind of the categories where, we're feeling the most pressure in terms of costs. That we've talked a lot about labor, that that's probably one of the biggest right there with it insurance. Insurance is one that that everyone frankly whether in our industry or not, we're seeing pretty significant increases and have over the last couple of years, this year is not exception. Steve talked about transportation. We feel like we do have some opportunities there just based on where our contracts work to recapture, a lot of the increases there. So the reagents in commodities, that's another area. I would say, as the companies grown and as we've kind of diversified at that, that's not a significant of portion as it used to be US Ecology, but it is still a meaningful cost that we're continuing to watch and monitor. And there's some pressure there as well. Tyson Bauer : Well, piggyback they targeted price increases. You only do that when you have the ability to do so. What are you seeing us as the greater leverage opportunities for you as far as certain business segments or waste streams that you can take advantage of? Jeff Feeler : Well, like I said what we did already was in the mid-west, we've looked at some select waste streams and particularly known it has solidification, where there seemed to be opportunities. And we're just that much more than 3% to 5%. In West Coast, we're able to look at our customer base and do some things across the board in the West, that maybe we're not able to do in the Gulf. Right now, we're seeing the Gulf recovered, which was not at all in the first quarter, we're struggling a bit in the beginning. And then, we had to freeze. So we maybe looking to see if there's opportunities there in the future. But it's a case by case review. And we're just trying to see how things evolve as the roads get doing back to normal here. Tyson Bauer : Do you anticipate, even thought they don't call it the green act that we may see some materials or other things that have not previously been considered as it is fall into that category going forward? Simon Bell : Tyson, this is Simon. There was long term, yes. I think there will be some certainly you think fast, but I'll say it's a, that's a generally fairly slow process in terms of changing the regulations. But certainly, I would expect this administration to be more aggressive on that front. But I certainly can't point to specific things in the near term. Tyson Bauer : Last question. On the event pipeline, are we still looking at a lot more of the smaller jobs maybe the 5 million - 10 million or less as opposed to some of the larger discrete projects that are multi-year and have that? Jeff Feeler : We still have a combination of both. We have some multi-year projects that are continuing this year, that we have a multi-year project that we had done work in prior years that was off a bit last year is kicking back in in the next three weeks. And then, we have another new long-term project that will be kicking off in the third quarter. So I would -- I don't think anything is really different in terms of that, it's a mix of all the above. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Peter Rabover with Artko Capital. Please go ahead. Peter Rabover : Just a couple of questions. One small one, how much was the Texas freeze or the storms, was that a beneficial or a negative impact for you guys in the quarter? JeffFeeler: Peter, we didn't quantify it, but it would have been negative in the quarter. Peter Rabover : Just thinking through next year. And then, maybe like a longer-term question. I mean, what are you guys thinking in terms of capital structure? I know you suspended dividend last year and were cash conservation mode. And I think you're back to be in fairly free cash flow positive and growing. And so, just thinking, what's your ideal capital structure, what are your plans for capital allocation any, you have some warrants out there or so? Just anything you guys can comment on that will be appreciated. Eric Gerratt : So our capital deployment plan is really focused on organic capital investment, paying down debt, doing small tuck-in acquisitions if they come available and then we'll be looking at returning any capital to shareholders likely in 2022. Jeff Feeler : All right, thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Feeler for any closing remarks. Jeff Feeler : Well, I just want to thank you for your interest today and looking forward to updating you in future conferences here in the second quarter. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Throughout yesterday's earnings release and our call and presentation today, we refer to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per diluted share, cash earnings per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow. These metrics are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are therefore susceptible to varying calculations. A definition, calculation, and reconciliation to the financial statements of adjusted earnings per diluted share, cash earnings per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow can be found in Exhibit A of our earnings release. We believe these non-GAAP metrics are useful in evaluating our reported results. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Feeler : Thank you, Eric, and good morning to everyone joining the call today. I would like to begin first by personally thanking all of my colleagues on the US Ecology team who are working hard to continue to keep people and our environment safe for our communities. Our emergency response teams are currently responding to the wildfires that are impacting the western parts of the United States and Canada, protecting critical infrastructure that we all depend on. My thoughts and well wishes are with these team members and all of those that are involved for their continued safety in these challenging times. Turning to our second quarter results, for those that are following the webcast presentation, I'll direct your attention to Slide 5. Strong industrial trends and solid momentum continued to accelerate in the second quarter of 2021, allowing us to drive revenue growth across each of our business segments, with total revenue up 13% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Due to project deferment and unfavorable service mix in the quarter concentrated primarily in our Waste Solutions segment, our results came in below expectations, both from a margin and EBITDA perspective. We do expect to see continued improvement in the coming months and quarters. Turning first to Field Services, our strong execution in this segment delivered double digit revenue growth and EBITDA growth when stripping out a contingency consideration gain recorded in the second quarter of last year. This growth was reflected across substantially all of our service offerings. We are encouraged by the recovery and remain confident in our ability to more than offset the COVID-19 decontamination work that we had last year. Our energy waste segment delivered results ahead of expectations and reported its fourth quarter of sequential EBITDA improvement with rising disposal volumes driven by improved rig counts and related business activity. We remain encouraged by the trends in our energy waste segment with oil remaining above $70 per barrel. Our waste solutions segment returned to revenue growth in the second quarter with strong base business revenue growth, up 7% from the second quarter last year and is up 3% sequentially from the first quarter earlier this year, reflecting broad improvement in our end markets, including metals manufacturing, mining and E&P, general manufacturing, and chemical manufacturing. With this growth, our base business is up 2% in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months last year, keeping us on track to achieve our expected base business target growth of 5% to 7% for the full year. The growth in this segment reflects an overall improvement in the industrial sector that we are seeing in our services side of the business as well as those industrial production metrics that are being reported. However, some industry headwinds remain as customers continue to manage through supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and transportation shortages, while others, like our refinery based customers, are managing their maintenance spending to focus on free cash flow generation. We expect these headwinds to lessen over the coming quarters. Additionally, our base business growth is being further constrained by third party incineration capacity, which is causing restrictions in our waste receipts across the industry. Our waste solutions segment was impacted during the quarter by a 13% decline in event business compared to the second quarter last year, due in large part to projects shifting to the back half of the year and into 2022, along with the early completion of a few larger projects. The event business revenue decline had a disproportionate impact on our second quarter margin due to an unfavorable service mix as replacement projects were at a lower average selling price and margin profile compared to the second quarter last year. Overall, the second quarter we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $34.2 million and generated free cash flow of $11.6 million. Despite the year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA, we continue to see strong fundamentals driven by the industrial recovery as seen by our solid base business and services revenue growth, which is expected to continue into the second half of the year. Before I turn the call back over to Eric to further review our financial results, I want to provide a quick update on some of our latest sustainability initiatives. Providing environmental solutions for our customers' complex needs is at the heart of what we do, and we have compiled a nearly 70 year history of regulatory and operational expertise. This week, we released our 2020 ESG Supplement Report, which is available on our website that builds upon our previously issued sustainability report and includes more detailed disclosures based off SASB, an independent nonprofit that develop sustainability accounting standards. I want to take a quick moment and point out a couple of highlights from this report. On the environmental front, in 2020, we protected our environment by ensuring safe treatment, recycling, and final disposal of more than 4.6 billion pounds of customers' hazardous waste. We also treated more than 68 million gallons of wastewater and recycled more than 22 million pounds of metal and more than 1.7 million gallons of oil. We are pleased to report that 39% of our power consumption used in our facilities in 2020 came from renewable energy sources. We are making significant progress gathering our baseline greenhouse gas emissions data in 2021 and are on track to publish these results and reduction goals by the end of the year. On the social front, our Inclusion and Diversity Committee continues to promote our shared values of diversity, equity, and inclusion and improve engagement with employees. We are dedicated to promoting a culture of safety. And while we are already significantly better than industry average statistics, we continue to bring down the number of safety incidents and accidents across our organization. We also recognize the difficulties of the ongoing pandemic has had on our team members and have provided more than 46,000 hours of incremental COVID related paid time off for our team members to deal with these uncertain and trying times. We are proud of the special culture we've created here at US Ecology that is built on inclusion, respect, protecting the environment, and continuous improvement, and we look forward to continue building on this strong foundation. With that, I'll turn it back to Eric. Eric Gerratt : Thanks Jeff. Starting with consolidated results on Slide 8, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $240.8 million. Revenue for the waste solutions segment was $108.4 million for the second quarter of 2021, up 5% compared to $103 million in the second quarter of 2020. The increase was driven by a 4% increase in treatment and disposal revenue and an 11% increase in transportation revenue. As Jeff mentioned, the growth in our treatment and disposal revenue was due to a 7% increase in base business, partially offset by a 13% decrease in event business in the second quarter of 2021 compared to last year. The Field Services segment delivered revenue of $124.7 million in the second quarter, up 20% compared to $103.5 million in the second quarter of 2020. The increase was across most of our field services business lines. Total gross margin was 23% in the second quarter, down from 26% in the second quarter last year. Gross margin for our waste solutions segment was 33% in the second quarter of 2021, down from 41% in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting a less favorable service mix, which resulted in lower treatment and disposal margin as well as lower gross margin on transportation revenue. Treatment and disposal margin for the waste solutions segment was 38% in the second quarter of 2021, down from 45% in the second quarter of 2020. As Jeff mentioned, the decline in mix of event business had a disproportionate impact on our margin, and we estimate that approximately five full points of the treatment and disposal margin decline was a result of lower average selling prices on replacement projects compared to the prior year. Gross margin for our field segment improved to 15% in the second quarter, compared to 14% in the second quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative spending, or SG&A, was $51.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 and included $785,000 of business development and integration expenses. This compared to $49.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, which included $3 million in business development and integration expenses. In the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.2 million on the settlement of an earn out contract related to the legacy NRC business, which was recorded as a reduction of SG&A expenses for the quarter. Excluding this gain as well as business development and integration expenses, SG&A increased 3% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter last year. This increase was primarily related to higher incentive compensation and benefit costs. Adjusted EBITDA was down 12% from the same quarter last year, which included the $2.2 million earn out contract settlement I just mentioned. Excluding this gain from the second quarter of 2020, adjusted EBITDA was down 6% in the second quarter of 2021 attributable to the decline in event business and a less favorable service mix in our waste solutions segment in the second quarter compared to the second quarter last year. Turning to Slide 9, we exited the quarter with a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity. Despite the lower margins compared to the prior year, we were able to generate adjusted free cash flow of $11.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. We had cash of 85.2 and $83 million of available capacity on our revolving line of credit at the end of the second quarter. Net borrowings were $699.2 million at June 30, 2021. Turning now to our business outlook, as included in our release yesterday, we are revising our 2021 full year guidance as shown on Slide 11. We now expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA to range from $165 million to $175 million, down from our previously issued guidance of $175 million to $185 million. Adjusted free cash flow is now expected to range between 42 and $57 million, down from our previously issued guidance range of $60 million to $77 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share is now expected to range from $0.37 to $0.60 compared to our previous range of $0.65 to $0.88. Revenue is expected to range from $940 million to $990 million, which is consistent with our previous range. Our guidance revision is primarily due to the deferment event of event business to 2022, early project completions, and large scale emergency response work that did not materialize in the first half of the year. With respect to event business, we estimate that approximately $3 million of adjusted EBITDA will shift out of 2021 and into 2022. The majority of this shift is due to ongoing pandemic related challenges that have resulted in delays in mobilization or delays in regulatory approvals at our customer site. In addition, two of our event projects coming into 2021 finished earlier than anticipated, which will impact our full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook by approximately $3 million. Our guidance also assumes that we will likely - we are likely to see additional delays in deferments in the second half of 2021 as project sites continue to navigate logistical challenges due to truck shortages in the US and Canada. While these factors are impacting our outlook for the remainder of 2021, our business fundamentals remain strong, and the pipeline of event business opportunities and improved bidding activity should benefit us in 2022 and beyond. A lack of large emergency response projects in the first half of the year is also responsible for approximately $3 million of our downward revision to adjusted EBITDA guidance. As Jeff mentioned in his opening remarks, we are currently deploying teams to respond to the wildfires in the West, and we're still early in the storm season that typically runs through October. Finally, we are expecting additional costs and inflationary pressures in the back half of 2021 in areas such as labor, supplies, and treatment reagents. Though we can recover some of these increased costs or future pricing adjustments, the timing of these adjustments may not be completed in 2021. We remain encouraged by the underlying industrial trends and pace of business activity and we are seeing conditions strengthen across all of our segments. We anticipate additional recovery and growth in our base business and remain on track to achieve our 5% to 7% growth target for the full year. While growth in our services businesses has been limited by challenging labor conditions, we remain confident of the potential of this segment as we look ahead. Our energy waste business continues to show positive trends and will likely exit the year above our initial targets. Before I turn the call back to Jeff, I'd like to again reiterate that our business fundamentals remain strong, and we are seeing continued improvement across all segments. We continue to expect better financial performance in the second half of the year, both from improving fundamentals as well as historically strong seasonality that typically benefits us. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Feeler : Thanks Eric. We are encouraged by what we're seeing in the fundamentals of the industrial recovery and the current trajectory that we're on. We communicated at the beginning of the year that the biggest risk to our 2021 outlook was replacing and growing upon record levels of event business in 2020. While we are disappointed that continuing effects of the pandemic have shifted projects into the second half of the year and in 2022, we are encouraged by the bidding activity and opportunities and the overall health of the pipeline. As Eric mentioned the large emergency response events that have not developed in the first half of the year pose the risk to the second half and if they did not materialize. While these headwinds are mitigated by strong base business and services work, along with the positive trends we're seeing in the Energy segment, these risks to our initial guidance are difficult and were difficult to overcome in the remaining six months. Turning to our longer term outlook, we are still marching toward our five year targets with organic revenue growth of 5% to 7% per year, driving $100 million of free cash flow and achieving double digit returns on invested capital by the end of 2025, while lowering our leverage levels to two to two and a half times, we remain confident in our ability to achieve these targets. Before I conclude and open up the call for questions, I'd like to recognize our talented team here at US Ecology. This past quarter, I've had the ability to finally get out and travel to our facilities and sit down with our team members. I continue to be impressed by our people in how they continue to protect human health in the environment, while navigating through ever changing circumstances. We have the right people and the right assets to respond to our customers' needs, and we continue to be a trusted partner for our customers. And together, we are building a sustainable future for all. With the remaining focus on executing our strategy to drive long-term growth and value creation, I am looking forward to all that's to come. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And the first question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hey, Jeff and team. Thanks for taking the Q's. Can we tease out on the guidance, since no change in revs, but changing EBITDA? Clearly, there's a bridge there where something is better, but something is worse and then the mix works down to the $10 million. So on the $10 million in the EBITDA you said $3 million is emergency response. What were the pros and then the other negative that get me to the net of the $10 million? Eric Gerratt : So yeah, so the deferral on the event business from this year into next, Michael, is about $3 million of EBITDA. There's another $3 million on event business for projects coming into the year that were included in our initial guidance that have completed early. And so that's about another $3 million. And then you've got the $3 million for the large scale emergency response that was in our guidance that we didn't experience in the first half of the year. And then the rest is really a function of some of the inflationary pieces and things like that that I discussed. Michael Hoffman : Okay. But sales are staying constant. So there's - if I gross this up into a revenue impact, there's an offset in revs that's happening as well, which means there's an offset in EBITDA, right? Eric Gerratt : Correct. Michael Hoffman : So this - the negative is bigger gross, but there's a positive - I'm trying to tease out that there's a positive going on here as well. That's part of the business outperformed, the part of the business underperformed. Eric Gerratt : Correct. And Michael, if you look at the revenue guidance, so there's the kind of summary guidance table in the release and if you look at the revenue by segment, for our revenue guidance the total is the same, but there is a bit of a shift between waste solutions to field services within that guidance range, which, again, that field services revenue comes at a lower margin than the waste solutions. Michael Hoffman : Got it. All right. I got - I'm on my 14th earnings call this week, so I haven't gotten to that yet. Okay. Corporate overhead, your number looks like it's really big as a percentage of revenues. Can you talk through what are the big chunks and maybe how you put things that some might put in OpEx versus put it in so that people appreciate this isn't some big target for an opportunity to slash and cut - Eric Gerratt : Yeah. One of the things, as we look at our overhead or our SG&A, and it's hard to compare it to peers because I don't always know exactly what's included in theirs versus ours. But I know for us, the large component of SG&A, I mean, it includes labor for, obviously, the corporate functions as well as a lot of the administrative expenses and people at our facilities as well and within our regions. The other thing that's included in our SG&A is we have a pretty large chunk of intangible amortization, that relates to non-permit related intangible assets that the biggest jump in those was when we did the NRC acquisition in 2019, but we have upwards of $8 million of intangible asset amortization that flows through SG&A through the first six months. If you strip some of that noise the intangible amortization, business development integration expenses out of our SG&A, we're at about 16.5% of revenue at the end of 2020, we're around 17% year to date through 2021. But I think some of that noise that's within our SG&A and our overhead is that intangible asset amortization, which is a pretty big number. Michael Hoffman : Okay. What's the incremental business - what's the incremental margin for business coming on in energy waste? Eric Gerratt : I'm sorry, Michael. I didn't hear that. Michael Hoffman : I'm sorry. The incremental margin for energy waste as business recovers, what's that look like? Lots of the peers are in a similar business, talk about that being 70%, 80%. Is yours that good? Eric Gerratt : Yeah. I don't know that it's 70% or 80%. But if you look at our revised guidance and kind of what we did in the second quarter for the energy waste segment, I mean, we had a pretty good recovery in our EBITDA margins. They were back in the mid 20s. And so I would expect - and as we look back at that business pre-pandemic and pre-acquisition, it's an EBITDA margin business that's closer to our waste solutions segment, so low to mid 30s in a normal environment, potentially higher, but we already made a lot of progress getting it back in that 25% range. The new guidance that we put out yesterday for that business, our EBITDA margin is 25% to 28%. So some pretty good improvement with more upside as it improves. Simon Bell : This is Simon here, Michael. Some of the comparables you're talking about, would they include the services component because I'm not sure that all of them do, which would also impact that incremental margin when comparing to just the disposal assets. Michael Hoffman : Yeah. Most of them it would be about disposal, so that's fair enough. And then on waste services side, based on commitment that you're going to do 5% to 7% for the year and you've done what you've done for first half at a plus 2% get to the midpoint, you're doing 12% base business in the second half? Eric Gerratt : Yeah. It's somewhere around 10% to 12%. And really, I would expect that Q3 will be the largest. And part of that is it's typically our strongest quarter, and that's a lower comparable if you go back to 2020. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So it's just a tough question, and I would like - I hope it comes across plate, not sounding nasty. Why model in a guidance for big things that require an event to occur you can't control? Jeff Feeler : Good question, Michael. The reality is we modeled that in based off history. If you go back to all the way down into 2015, a lot of events have happened and a lot more than what we modeled in. And last year was with all the conditions being shut down and depressed, we didn't see much materialize. So if you go back look in history, those things occur. And so the reality is we believe those to occur in a more normal state, and we model them out what we believed at the time would materialize this year and still may materialize in the back half of the year. Michael Hoffman : And that's the wildfires or weather events? Jeff Feeler : Yeah. It could be a whole bunch of different things. It could be chemical plant accidents. It could be a lot of things. I mean, we've had events in the past that a singular accident outside of a major pipeline break could be $20 million to $50 million, I mean, they are big events. We didn't anything like that in. And the reality is more smaller we define it as something over $1 million, which can happen. And we talked about this in our guidance and what was out there when we first launched it. Michael Hoffman : Yes. Yes. You did say at the time, specifically on the event side, I think, more so than the emergency response. What's the risk that these transportation restrictions on capacity there is just lack of drivers for paying people stay home persist through d fall into early '22. And therefore, does that - that doesn't provide any relief on the project activity? Or are there time lines on some of this that are mandated by a court order or what have you, where this is going to happen in '22 if it doesn't happen in '21. How do I think about that project number? Jeff Feeler : Yeah, Michael. We have a number of different projects that are going to be mandated by regulatory drivers oppose it. But your bigger question is what the industries are facing with right now with driver shortages is real. I mean we're not the only one navigating it. Everybody else is navigating it, and it does create a headwind and we called it out. So when you look at risks into just project based work and even to a certain degree, our base business that has some inherent risks. I know that everybody is trying to - is looking forward to government programs getting released and other things like that, so hopefully more people enter the labor market. But that is a real risk that we're navigating, along with others in the space. So I can't quantify what that can do, but the reality is it's inherent in what we're dealing with right now. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff Feeler : All right. Thanks Michael. Operator : The next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. Jeff Feeler : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Silber : You talked a little bit about the truck driver issue. From a labor constraint perspective, are there any other pockets of labor where you're having trouble finding people or filling jobs? Simon Bell : Yeah. Jeff, this is Simon. The drivers are certainly the most challenging in terms of labor shortages. But the short of it is, yes, we're seeing challenges across the board, chemical operators, equipment operators, just general labor. It's different in different regions. But certainly, we're having some pockets where we're having challenges, and we're not able to fully realize the full potential of jobs out there. We've got a lot of programs moving, which we think are going to help us there. But, yes, it is beyond drivers. Jeff Feeler : And I'll just add, Jeff, on that is we have a couple of hundred plus positions open that we're actively recruiting for. And it comes back to that fundamental is there's 9 plus million people in the United States alone that are sitting on the sidelines today. And all the data shows that there's over 9 million of job openings. So the reality is there is some impacts that we're hoping that we'll release here in the coming months on there to help mitigate what we're seeing. But we're competing for talent. We're trying to get talent. If we had more people, we would be able to drive more revenue. We are being held back on our growth potential right now because of labor. And we're trying to diligently compete for that and be able to get good talent in and being able to service our customers. But it is a reality we're facing right now. Jeff Silber : All right. That's helpful. And if we can shift gears over to the pricing environment, I mean, we're hearing from everybody that they're able to put through price increases. I wouldn't say very easily, but - in a fairly easy method to some extent. Can you talk about what the pricing environment is out there, both from your perspective and from a competitive perspective? Jeff Feeler : Sure. I'll let Steve address and I'll fill in. Steve Welling : Sure. So we did take some price increases in Q1 and Q2 in select markets. And depending on the service line, we do have the ability to potentially do additional increases in the second half of the year. We've been looking at that. It's a balance of whether \u2013what's the competitive market because we want to make sure we don't price ourselves out and losing work. What are the timing notifications because on our waste disposal business, we have, in some cases, 60 to 90 day notification to make an adjustment? So we're looking at what we can do. There are a number of areas we can move quickly. There are certain other service lines, though, that we are stuck with an annual adjustment. So it just really depends. But it's something that we have flexibility there. Jeff Silber : Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks. Jeff Feeler : Yeah. Jeff, I'll just add a little bit to this. I think the global takeaway on this is we do have the ability to push pricing through as Steve just talked about. And it depends based on contractual arrangements and that type of thing and the timing thereof. The caution we put up is we're \u2013we've been able to manage all the inflationary pressures for the most part to the first half of the year. Really, the notifications we're starting to see now and what we kind of put a headwind in part of our guidance is we're starting to see more of those starting to come through in the back half of the year. And we're really analyzing what the overall impacts are and timing of when we can actually start adjusting price, especially since we already did one price increase earlier this year. The last thing we want to do is be in raising prices every week on our customers because it's not good. So we're trying to get our arms around all of that determine the best strategies of when we go to market to make sure we can fully capture what we're seeing. And that's why we put a headwind it may not be fully implemented by 2021 and really focused on 2022. Jeff Silber : All right. That's really helpful. Thanks so much. Jeff Feeler : Thanks Jeff. Operator : The next question will come from William Grippin with UBS. Please go ahead. William Grippin : Great. Thank you. Just had one here on the EBITDA guide, it looks like the guidance implies a pretty significant second half ramp in margin versus the first half. I mean, you just talked about cost inflation pressures possibly accelerating here in the second half. Could you just give a little color on, I guess, what's driving that half-on-half increase in the margin? Eric Gerratt : Yeah. I think the biggest - one of the biggest things is just additional activity that we typically see seasonally in the third quarter, and we're projecting a really strong fourth quarter as well. And so as that - particularly on the event business side picks up, some of that large scale ER picks up, it comes in at a higher incremental margin. So that's really the biggest driver of that lift you see from the first half to the second half, which isn't uncommon that we typically see each year, a decent sized lift in our second half over the first as the event business and the activity in the third and fourth quarters pick up. William Grippin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our next question will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey. Good morning, guys. Jeff Feeler : Good morning. Eric Gerratt : Hey, Tyler. Tyler Brown : So I hastily kind of put together this little Q - like the guidance from Q1 and the guidance from Q2. And I just want to kind of go through this because I got to understand the guide pieces. So if we start in waste solutions, you're looking for, call it, an $8 million, and this is all at the midpoint, so an $8 million revenue and a $6 million EBITDA. I think you fleshed that out pretty well, $3 million of deferral, $3 million of kind of projects that have ended early. So you assume about a 75% incremental margin there. So first off, is that a good placeholder for incrementals and decrementals in that waste solutions business? Or is there something unique there? Eric Gerratt : I got to think about that, Tyler. That sounds pretty reasonable to me and not uncommon with what we see. So I think, yes, as that event business scales up and scales down, it can cut both ways at a pretty high incremental margin. Simon Bell : I mean, it's really defining the operating leverage these landfills have those incremental tons that come through really flow down to the bottom line. Tyler Brown : Okay. So that makes sense. Now I'm confused on field services. So you raised revenue, but you lowered EBITDA by like $4 million. So why would that be? What exactly is going on there? Eric Gerratt : So some of it, Tyler, well, a portion of it is the large scale ER that didn't happen in the first half that, again, similar to some of our event business comes through at a really high incremental margin on the waste solutions side. So that is a piece of it as well as just some of the mix and some of what we're seeing and some of the cost and inflationary challenges that we're expecting in that piece of the business that Jeff touched on a bit in terms of drivers and labor and some of those things. And if you look at the guidance - the revised guidance versus the previous, it's about 100 basis points of margin that went down in this version of the guidance versus the previous. Tyler Brown : Okay. That's helpful. And then on the energy waste side, again, kind of just like a funny change to the guide because you raised revenue by $3 million, but EBITDA by $6 million. And you guys talked about - I mean, again, I'm just kind of confused as to why that would go up so much. Eric Gerratt : Yes. It's again, incremental. It's that incremental margin as it's recovered. We're also feeling a lot of the benefits of some of the cost cutting that we did last year on both labor side, rentals things like that. And so you've really seen us pick up traction really since the second or third quarter last year and seen that improving margin and so incremental revenue comes through at a better margin than it did say a year ago. Tyler Brown : Okay. So you have those incremental cost cuts layering in, okay. And then just, again - just kind of, this is hastily put together, but it looks like the overall corporate costs also we're going to be higher, but I would have thought that incentive compensation would have been a cushion there or is that not the case? Again, this is all relative to the last guide, not to last year, but relative to the last guide. Eric Gerratt : I would say there's some incentive compensation shift there, but that's about at least through the first six months in the guidance about where we kind of expected coming into the year. We are seeing some headwinds in terms of some of our benefits costs, some of our insurance costs, and then just overall labor. Tyler Brown : Okay. So that's a lot where some of that inflation is picking up, okay. Okay. Well, that all is very helpful. So real quickly, I think you had talked about $50 million of EBITDA in Q3, is that a good placeholder? Eric Gerratt : Yeah, I would say, right around there is about right. We actually - our guidance and our forecast, which - just to be clear, so our forecast is - our current forecast is the midpoint of our guidance and if you look at it and break it down by quarter, we're actually showing that Q4 will be a bit stronger than Q3. But Q3 is kind of about in that $50 million range. Tyler Brown : Okay. Super helpful. And then on the interest cost and tax rate, just to make sure we have that I know you changed your credit agreement a little bit. Eric Gerratt : Yes. So the credit agreement, really, the big change, the big positive change is we extended the revolver out another five years. We also, while we're at extended - or increased the covenant permanently. So it steps down and there's actually a chart in the appendix of the presentation for today that shows the new levels. But in terms of interest, we're expecting interest expense to be pretty similar to what we guided before, maybe a bit less. And then on the tax rate, we are seeing some of the change in the EPS guidance is we are seeing or expecting a higher tax rate than we were coming into the year in last quarter. A lot of that is due to, as we look at the forecast and where the revenue is shifting. Some of it is shifting into some of our higher tax jurisdictions, Canada is one good example. And we continue to see our state effective rate continue to increase. So there's about a 250, 300 basis point increase in our tax rate for the year now versus what we thought coming into the year. Tyler Brown : Yeah. Okay. It's all like something was going on there. Okay. That's helpful. And then on the CapEx, so you held CapEx at the, call it, $87 million, how does that look - does it actually trickle up in 2020 and then kind of start to trickle down later or more into the mid part of the decade? Or how should we think about that, again, assuming no acquisitions, but just kind of looking at the business today? Simon Bell : Yeah. This is Simon. I would say 2022 is going to be another heavy spend on the landfill side. So I would expect probably a slight increase over 2021, then 2023 kind of returning lowering maybe to mid 80s and then really seeing benefits into the '24, '25 because of the reduction in the landfill spend. It was just a case, and it would be a long explanation, but we have to - with the most efficient thing and it made the most sense for us to build a large portion of the landfill in '21 and '22, pulling some of that spend forward, but we should see the benefits moving into '23, '24. Tyler Brown : Okay. That's helpful. And then my last one here, I know there's some talk about truck drivers and such. I know a thing or two about that. But one other aspect is the railroads. So I'm curious, the rail - if you look at train speeds and dwell obviously, the rails are struggling. There's a couple of things. I'm curious if you're seeing increased accessorial charges or if you're seeing just an overall slowing in rail velocity if that is problematic for you as well? Simon Bell : Yes. Again, this is Simon. Tyler, it's something we're watching very closely, and we've heard about some of these slowdowns. But the corridors that we're using today, I'm not seeing a lot of impacts, not seeing a lot of delays that may be in part because a lot of the material comes from out East and heads East and maybe they're not dealing with the wildfires like they are out West. So something on the rail side today, I would call it stable, but carefully watching it. Tyler Brown : Okay. Yeah. It could be your traffic mix, not to get into a long discussion about this, but yes, that makes sense. Steve Welling : Our business really isn't too dependent on the timing of the rail. I mean, it could result in the need for extra cars to rent. But for the most part, as long as it's leaving the customer site, they seem to be happy. Tyler Brown : Okay. All right, guys. Thank you so much for the time. Jeff Feeler : Thanks Tyler. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Feeler for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Feeler : Great. I just want to thank those for attending the call today and look forward to updating you in coming quarters. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities of customer zeal, digital and sustainability to drive growth and value for our stakeholders. During the third quarter, we delivered revenue and EBITDA growth of approximately 14% compared to the prior year, generated adjusting earnings per share of $1.11, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year, and produced $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value creating acquisitions, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've invested over $900 million in acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increase free cash flow. This is the highest level of acquisition investment in over a decade. On August 31, we completed the acquisition of ACV Enviro. This strategic acquisition broadens our capabilities and offerings in the environmental services industry. It also provides us with a platform to pursue additional growth. We are excited to welcome ACB to the Republic team. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust with opportunities in both recycling solid waste and the environmental solutions businesses. We now expect to invest over $1 billion in acquisitions for the full year. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we have returned $622 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to prioritize customer zeal to drive profitable growth. This includes increasing customer loyalty, driving willingness to pay and attracting new volume as the provider of choice. Our customer retention rate remains at a record setting level of 95%. During the third quarter, we delivered outsized revenue growth throughout our business. Total core price remained at an all-time high of 5.2%, and average yield increased to 3.2%. Volume increased 4.3% compared to the prior year, which exceeded our expectations and acquisitions contributed an incremental 350 basis points to total revenue growth. The outlook for organic and acquisition growth for the remainder of the year is strong. Turning to digital, we continue to realize the benefits of our investments in technology. In the third quarter, we made meaningful progress on the rollout of the next phase of our RISE platform. We have now implemented tablets and approximately 70% of our large and small container fleet. We expect to be substantially complete by the end of this year, with plans to further deploy to the residential fleet beginning in 2020. Next, turning to our sustainability platform. We continue to partner with developers to capitalize on landfill gas to energy opportunities. We currently have 17 projects in the pipeline with more opportunities thereafter. On top of the royalty revenue these plants will generate a majority of equity investment opportunities to further participate in the project economics. We also recently opened a solar project on one of our closed landfills in Bellevue, Illinois. This project consists of 30,000 solar panels, and will produce enough energy to power 2200 homes annually. We remain committed to increasing the recycling and circularity of key materials as part of our ambitious 2030 sustainability goals. We recently opened the first solar power compost facility in California to further our progress and address the growing community needs. This facility will provide critical organic processing capabilities to residents and businesses in the greater San Diego area. Our strong financial and operational results would not have been possible without our dedicated Republican employees. We continue to invest in developing both existing and new talent and creating innovative solutions for the increased demand for skilled workers. We recently unveiled our Republic Services Technical Institute, which is the industry's first ever diesel technician school. This subsidized program is already building a strong pipeline of high demand technician talent for Republic. Additionally, graduates will have up skilling opportunities to further grow their career with Republic. These types of innovative investments and talent lead to external recognition for our company. Republic was recently certified as a great place to work for the fifth consecutive year. This is a meaningful achievement, as employee recruiting and retention remains a prominent focus in today's labor market. Finally, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Given the continued strength in our business, we now expect to exceed the full year guidance we upwardly revised last quarter. Accordingly, we're increasing 2021 full year financial guidance as follows. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of 410 to 413. And adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.5 billion. I will now turn the call over to Brian. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks Jon. Core price during the third quarter was 5.2%, which included open market pricing of 6.5% and restricted pricing of 2.9%. The components of core price included small container of 8.2%, large container a 5%, and residential of 5%. Average yield was 3.2%, which increased 60 basis points from the second quarter. Third quarter volume increased 4.3%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 5.4%, an increase in large container of 3.9% and an increase in landfill of 6.6%. For reference, small container and MSW volumes in the third quarter were both above a 2019 pre-pandemic baseline. Moving on to recycling, commodity prices increased to $230 per ton in the third quarter. This compares to $99 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 160 basis points to internal growth during the third quarter. Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Third quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $27 million from the prior year. This was driven by both organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same store basis environmental solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 30.4% and increased 10 basis points over the prior year. This included a 90 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, a 50 basis point headwind from net fuel and a 30 basis point headwind from the impact of recent acquisitions, primarily driven by deal and integration costs. SG&A was 10.2% of revenue. This represents an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year, which was exclusively due to higher incentive compensation accruals. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion and increased $247 million or 22% compared to the prior year. This was primarily driven by EBITDA growth in the business. With respect to our full year cash flow guidance, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year CapEx and cash taxes during the fourth quarter. It should also be noted that we increased our expected full year capital spending in our upwardly revised guidance by over $50 million. This increase relates to capital to support growth opportunities. Free cash flow conversion through September continue to track ahead of our original expectations and increase 330 basis points over the prior year. During the quarter total debt was $9.3 billion and total liquidity was $2.4 billion. Interest expense decreased $11 million due to refinancing activities completed last year, and our leverage ratio was 2.8 times. With respect to taxes. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5%. We had an equivalent tax impact of 27% when you include non-cash charges from solar investments. We expect our fourth quarter equivalent tax impact to be approximately 25%. This includes the effective tax rate and non-cash solar charges. I will now turn the call back over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Brian. We continue to create value for our stakeholders by executing our strategic priorities, which drives profitable growth and increases returns. We are expecting the positive momentum in our business to continue to produce profitable growth in 2022. At this point, we anticipate producing above average revenue growth, leading to high single digit adjusted free cash flow growth compared to our full year 2021 performance. As usual, we'll provide full year detailed 2022 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that operator, I would like to open the call to question. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Jon Vander Ark : Good afternoon Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey, Brian, thanks for the detail on the 10 basis point improvement. But one, kind of how should we think about margins in Q4? Will they likely hold sequentially? And the number two, and I know you'll give more details on this, but big picture, you've got a strong CPI rollover, you got a rational open market, do you expect in '22 to make progress on that 32% margin goal? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, Tyler, let me kind of answer the first part of your question there. I think you embedded two or three questions in there. So at least with respect to sequentially, there's a normal step down sequentially from Q3 into Q4, as well as we talked about the fact that we're doing more deals than originally anticipated. So we expect the highest level of deal and transaction and integration costs in the fourth quarter. So again, while we expect to see in the underlying business, we're expecting to continue to see really strong performance, we do expect a sequential step down Q3 to Q4. Jon Vander Ark : And then on your second part of your question, Tyler, yes, outlook is strong for next year, certainly, we've been strong on pricing in the open market portion of our business already. And we'll continue to do that. And then as some of these escalators kick in the lag effect of 12 to 18 months, so some of them kick in into 2022, that provides more upward pressure on pricing, which we think will lead to margin expansion in 2022. Tyler Brown : Okay, and then just from a modelling perspective, how much revenue today would likely roll over next year? Brian DelGhiaccio : If you just take a look at the deals that have been completed through September, it's 160 basis points. Tyler Brown : Okay. And then my last one here, so Jon, it's interesting. If you look at the big three, I think you guys posted actually the best volume growth this quarter and you actually had the toughest comp. So I'm not asking you to necessarily compare and contrast you with the peers. But was there a line or a vertical that just gave you this outside strength that you saw? I'm just kind of trying to - it's not really your strategy to priorities volume over price, I just want to make sure that that's - make sure I've got that all straight? Jon Vander Ark : Well, you certainly have the last parts, right, which is we're always going to start with price over volume, right. I mean, the thesis broadly of our company and the industry is that we can price ahead of our cost inflation. And I think we've proven to do that in a kind of rapidly changing environment this quarter. So we certainly feel good about that, in the short-term in the long-term over time. And on the volume side, listen, we certainly left some volume on the table. If we had more labor, we would have gone after some more opportunities on that front. So very strong demand environment and I think the GDP print was 2% for the quarter, a lot of that's on the consumer side. I think the industrial side of our economy is very, very strong right now. And so our volume is pretty broad based pretty strong across the board. Tyler Brown : Okay, all right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Hey, good afternoon. My first question is just on SG&A leverage going forward, maybe you could just walk through any potential COVID related costs that came out of your system that are now coming back? Maybe there's some costs that are permanent in nature pose sort of looking at the business through COVID that you've instituted, just give us a sense of how to think about that going forward? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, I'd say there's some modest puts or takes, and we're already seeing some of that, for example, small container rates are coming back and long-term, that's a good thing, because it's a positive sign for demand. But that's certainly a financial headwind for us in a very short-term period that we already saw some of and we think that modulates over time. Certainly some - with a Delta variant, we had some elevated PTO cost, right in the quarter of people who were sitting out and still getting paid overtime. So that's the headwind that abates over time. Listen, there's traffic patterns come back, does that slow us down a little bit, maybe I would have guessed, we would have seen a lot of that. But our RISE platform is really delivering a lot of productivity into the business. And then more from a central function standpoint we'll shrink our real estate footprint incrementally here as we have some of our more transactional colleagues working from home permanently, but that's pretty modest broad strokes. Again a little bit of travel will come back, but we'll also take advantage of teams and do things in different ways over time. So again, lots of individual puts and takes, but I don't see - certainly I don't see any big structural headwinds that are going to come after us. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah and Hamzah to your question specifically on SG&A, we've had a number of those costs come back into the system as far as some of the travel related costs. So we're seeing that in the current period. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks most of the increase we saw really had to do with incentive compensation really didn't have to do with any of those ongoing SG&A expenses. So we feel pretty good about our performance and our ability to leverage, right, SGA going forward as we continue to grow the top line and migrate towards that 10% of revenue. Hamzah Mazari : Got it, very helpful. And just my follow up question. You mentioned landfill to gas, you mentioned 17 projects in the pipeline. Historically, I think you've just outsourced and taken royalty revenue. I think you referenced that you have equity stake opportunities. Is that something you've done before? And why not just bring them in house given some of the ROIC and strong sort of margin profile of some of that - some of those projects? Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, that's a great question. So historically, again, we've been more opportunistic and side by side in this. As the world is moving into a more sustainable operation, we're certainly doing our part and hopefully leading the way. This has become more critical for us going forward. So not only do we have 17 project, and we got another slate behind that that we're evaluating. And we'll participate in a different way than we have historically, probably in an equity basis, but probably not full ownership. And why I say this, we have a limited number of landfills. And so this is a great growth opportunity for us to pursue, but there's a ceiling to it, once you've kind of built it out on all the landfills, that makes sense. That's it. We like to put all of our financial capital and our human capital in places that we think grow in an evergreen way. And so that's where we'll put our attention. Combine that with the fact that there's a lot of external financial and human capital resources, who are anxious to partner with us. And we think that's probably going to be the winning combination for us going forward. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. And the other thing too, Hamzah, is that partnering up with a third party, we can actually move faster than if we were to sit there and go our own way. And that's one of the reasons we want to move quickly on this opportunity. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. I just had a clarification question. Historically I think at Q3, you've talked about preliminary 2022 sort of maybe top line, is that a change in sort of how you're thinking about guidance? Or maybe historically you haven't done that? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. No Hamzah, I think we talked in our remarks as well, but we talked about here was providing visibility into where we see free cash flow going at this point. But that said, I think you also hear the tone. We're optimistic about the momentum in pricing. Volume is strong. And there's additional opportunities. And again, when you look at just the acquisition, rollover, as well as the pipeline of acquisitions that are there, we feel that 2022 is going to be very strong on that front as well. So contribution from multiple facets that at least relative to a historical growth weight rate, we feel it's going to be outsized. Hamzah Mazari : Got it, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley. Jeff Goldstein : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions here. So labor expense has clearly been a key topic in the quarter. But within your COGS, labor, I noticed actually declined as a percent of revenue year-over-year. So maybe you can just talk about how you've managed to contain that? Is it primarily from raising price? Is there anything around scheduling or maybe doing proactive wage increases that you call out? Maybe just talk a little bit more about the success managing that in the quarter? And then I guess going forward, is there any reason to think you won't be able to manage it as well? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, thanks for your question. I think you have to look way back to low CPI environments. And we've always had this fundamental belief that we want to give our people a fair and certainly steady increase every year. So we were raising their wages that 2% or 2.5%, even in low CPI environments, so people have been focusing in parallel on employee engagement and making sure this is the place that the best people come to work. So you put those two things together, and we think our employee value proposition has been really strong. And while turnover has been elevated, it's been modestly elevated. And we've really - we would have taken more people if we could to pursue some incremental growth opportunities, but our attention has been really strong. Now, that being said, we're facing the same pressures of the macro environment. So we've looked and done surgery and targeted markets where we think we weren't as competitive or maybe turnover was elevated. But you kind of take those costs increases, and you offset it with what we think is our digital ops in our RISE platform, which is really driving productivity, we look at our performance. And in the quarter versus 2019, right, we're just seeing we're getting more work right out of the same labor hour. And that's been really productive. And I think you're seeing it hold in a very challenging environment. And then, on top of that, of course, we're pricing because the market bears it and we're want to support future wage increases for our employees. Jeff Goldstein : Okay, that that all made sense. And then now that you've had Santek for a few months, I think it closed back in May. I'm curious for the path forward, I'm bringing those margins back up to Republic levels, and any sense of synergies you'd expect out of that business. And then remind me in terms of pricing within the Santek book, was that in a place you were happy with? Or is there room to re-price some of that business as well. Just an update there would be helpful. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, we're really excited about that acquisition, great set of assets, gets us into certainly some geographic markets that we weren't in before. And that creates a basis or a platform for further growth, both organic and additional tuck-in acquisitions. As Brian mentioned, there's always startup costs in the first year. And the bigger the deal, the more the startup costs, because we really don't have to get multiple sites in the systems integrated. And there's a lot of employee benefits and related costs. And we really try to front load all those and get all those done at once. A, to get those behind us, but B, to create a great employee experience. And so if those linger forever, they feel like they're not really part of the company. We think that leads to higher turnover time. So we'd get after that and have a very proactive and intentional plan. And we're ahead of that plan. And I think you'll see in '22, that'll be a nice, certainly tailwind for us as those costs come behind us. And given the nature of that company, the fairly landfill centric, the margins are really attractive. Jeff Goldstein : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : Yeah, thanks very much operator and thanks for taking my questions, everyone. I'd like to turn back to acquisitions for a moment. When you look at the pipeline, which you mentioned, is quite robust right now. I was wondering if you could be able to provide a little bit of color on the pipeline perhaps discuss whether are these all smaller tuck ins? Are there any larger chunkier targets end markets that interest you? And as a follow up, is the regulatory review and scrutiny at all impacting your ability to do deals in this environment right now? Thanks very much. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. Walter the pipeline is - I mean, the performance has been very strong this year. And the pipeline looking forward is very strong. And I would say the power and characteristic of that is very, very balanced, right. It's balanced, certainly weighted more heavily toward recycling and waste just given that's where the bulk of our business is, but certainly plenty of opportunities in the environmental solutions portion of our business as well. It's certainly balanced across size, plenty of small tuck-ins. I think a number of what we'd call medium sized deals, and then listen, we maintain a perspective on everything. So could there be some larger deals that come through over time? Yeah, those are obviously more episodic, and can be - could be challenging from regulatory review. On balance, we have a very crystal clear point of view of where the regulation sits. And so if we think there's a deal that really is not going to get through, we just don't spend energy and time pursuing that opportunity. And or if we do have limited regulatory scrutiny on a deal, we've baked that right in, we understand what we probably have to divest and we go right to the regulators and say, here's our perspective. And then they can draw their own perspective. But we plan that right into the model. So we're never surprised on the back end of that. So, yes, there is heightened scrutiny versus four or five years ago on larger transactions, but more broadly, it's not slowed us down at all from I think, what is a different level of acquisition than we've historically done. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And here's my follow up on special waste, it looks like it was a good quarter for you on special waste. Had some nice tailwind there, but it can be lumpy business. How do you look at contribution from special waste from quarter-to-quarter? And is there any flags that you would give us in terms of how we model it in quarter to next? Are you fairly confident that that's going to be a good tailwind for you here over the next several quarters? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, I think it's a good tailwind, again, we saw kind of - we were acted as ever. We saw times of uncertainty. I think if you go back 20, 25 years, special waste typically pushes right, jobs get sold and they get confirmed, but they just don't drop and get delivered. And so I think what you're seeing now is those things are starting to move. And so feel good about that. The pipeline is very robust going forward. It's a project based business. So by definition, right, there's going to be quarters that are a little higher versus others. But I think the outlook for the next 12 to 18 months is very, very strong. Walter Spracklin : That's fantastic. Appreciate the time as always. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. The challenge, when you have two is can you actually ask a question with 14 different questions in it? Jon Vander Ark : You're quite good at that, Michael, I trust you. Michael Hoffman : My attempt to do that is on organic growth. Thinking about a baseline exit momentum going into '22. You parse price and volume would - are we in the right neighborhood as we're starting with a three handle on twice and then volume, ex special waste lumpiness, still has momentum from new business formation, service interval trends being positive, but we haven't seen a peak in that activity, so that creates tailwind. That's the right way to think about going into '22. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. Certainly on the pricing, we would expect something starting with a three and then on volume look, we're coming out of a - we're in a V shaped recovery. And obviously, as the further along, you get this arithmetically, right, that slope starts to flatten. But I think there's still plenty of momentum, I talked about the labor side of being a little constrained there versus a pre pandemic year, you're going to see outsized volume growth in 2022 to for months. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. And the follow up to that, though, is probably not as high, though, as what we're going to see in '21. It's somewhere in between. Michael Hoffman : I couldn't hear you're Brian, could you say that again? Brian DelGhiaccio : No, I just said to Jon's point, most of '21 was a recovery of units that were lost during the pandemic. My only point was that the volume at least the way we're thinking about it right now, would be somewhere in between what we're doing in '21, or what we're going to deliver and '21 and that hit historical average. Michael Hoffman : Got it. And then last one for me is on free cash flow. And you think about a baseline of a conversion ratio. And you've talked about getting into the mid-40s. It appears that you're going to be there this year. So is that now the new - you've got to it and in that context going forward, you're spending more CapEx this year, but did you pull any forward? Or should I think of CapEx is the same rate of spend percent of revs and '22? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, I think that CapEx is really more a function of growth, incremental CapEx, and these acquisitions with you, oftentimes, there's a plan and there's development projects associated with those, which are great. Those are more one time in nature, right, and then you get the benefit the returns of those in future years. And from a free cash flow conversion standpoint. Yes, right. We think we've hit a new baseline and we have plans to further expand that going into 2022 and beyond. Michael Hoffman : Okay, so how did I do? Did I get enough question in the two? Brian DelGhiaccio : That was excellent. Michael Hoffman : Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Jon Vander Ark : Hey, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Can you talk about what pricing announcements you've made to your open market customers in October? And as you folks look at the inflation that everyone across the industry is seeing, how much you feel like you need to push open market pricing over the next couple of months to make sure we've got enough room to execute as we hit the meaty part of the inflation cycle. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, I would say you got to look back, right, we've already done that. We jumped on that pretty much in the mid to end part of the first quarter, understanding where inflation was going and you're seeing our open market not 100 BPS of incremental pricing versus the prior quarters, right because we're pricing not only existing customers, but also new customers, right. Our capture pricing tool, as we saw steel go up for example, on containers, right, we put that right in and so immediately we're selling at different price on the street, right to cover the cost of that incremental steel, right with a return against it. So we're not diluting returns as we price that through so listen, we're putting more price out. That price is being realized in the marketplace. And again, we have a good broad backdrop right when you things like bacon is doubling and all kinds of things are going crazy, rental cars and from just a consumer purchasing standpoint where prices are going or as these price increases are relatively modest against that backdrop, and I think that's a good reason why they're holding. Yeah. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. And Jerry just a follow up there, again, we've been quick to act in the open market. You really haven't seen the contribution yet from the restricted portion of the business. That's still to come in '22 with a rollover benefit in the '23. Jerry Revich : And just to clarify, so the current level of core price increases for over market 6.5. And obviously, we'll see the restricted acceleration from here, but it is the 6.5 now at a high enough pace to cover this heightened level of inflation? Or should we look for open market increases to be higher than the six and a half we're posting now. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah you could see it incrementally tick up. But we're also managing costs in a way, right, where we're taking the price and the cost inflation expanding margins, right. As we go, not only looking back, right, we're almost a 200 basis point expansion. If you look back a couple years, and we think we've got more room to run in that going forward. Keep in mind, we've price to existing customers, it's not a onetime event, right. We price rapidly kind of an open market, roughly a 12th of the book goes out every month, right. It's our ability to be flex up on that is really, really high. Jerry Revich : Okay, great. And then you alluded to recycling investment opportunities in the press release. Could you just expand on that? What's the range of opportunities in terms of building facilities organically or seeing recycling rate increases out of your existing footprint versus acquisitions, can I trouble you just to flesh out that opportunities there please? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, we think there's a five or six core markets we're in that we would like to have an asset that was one over time we'll probably build if we could buy it, that would also be an opportunity, but probably something we'll build. Certainly seeing acquisition opportunities, smaller ones for recycling centers as we do some more medium sized deals going forward and apart because we want to make sure we've got a place to take the material off of our back and not always be dependent on a third party in those markets. And apart because we think these resources have increasing value over time, right. In a world where plastics, for example, the consumer packages, companies are really in a need for post-consumer content. And we haven't, and we're an aggregator. So over time, that material is more valued, we think we're going to be able to capture a piece of that as we move forward. And the other thing I'll add Jerry there's plenty of opportunities on our existing facilities, to drive in more automation to kind of change the CapEx and OpEx trade off. Those are tough jobs. Those are higher turnover jobs. And so it allows us to reduce the labor force just incrementally in those facilities, but then also produce a better product with more state of the art equipment. Jerry Revich : I appreciate the discussion. Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks, Jerry. Operator : And our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. David Manthey : Good afternoon. Thank you. First off, can you give us some early thoughts on CapEx for 2022? I don't know if you expect that to drop back into 11% to 12% of revenues range. And if you're willing to share with us a couple of your spending priorities for next year. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, David look, we'll get into details when we're back together in February on the components within the free cash flow, but I would sit there and say, as you think about over time, right, as Jon mentioned, we've made really good progress on free cash flow conversion. We expect to continue to make progress and start to drive that free cash flow conversion into the high 40% range, some of that is going to be by reducing our CapEx as a percent of revenue. David Manthey : Okay, second, how do you think about your commodity basket as you move into next year? I mean, do you budget for flat or do you assume it's going to be lower than that? Just how do you think about the commodity basket broadly as you look to the out year? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, just right now, right, what we're kind of looking at is more of in line with a year-to-date average as compared to current pricing. But again, once this plays down, we have a couple more months on our belt, we'll be able to give you a better perspective when we're back together in February. David Manthey : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : Hi, team nice quarter. A couple of modelling ones for me. Brian, I think you mentioned 160 basis points of acquisition roll over. Is that a net number or a gross number? And then secondly, I guess it's safe to assume that you guys are going to do something better than that, because you're indicating that next year is going to be an elevated level of deal activity as well. Is that correct? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, so the 160 is essentially, both gross and net, quite honestly. But yes, if you think about - that only includes deals that have been closed through September. Sean Eastman : Okay, got it. And, okay, so we'll have more upside there by the end of the year, and then whatever you guys do next year, we'll layer on to that. Alright, got it, and then just drilling in on margins. I don't want to put you guys into a box before you're given the guidance, but maybe just thinking about the normative 30 to 50 basis points of operating leverage in the business just naturally. I mean, what would be the moving pieces to think about relative to that? I mean maybe recycled commodities are a tailwind in the first half. I'm not sure. Maybe the acquisitions you've done are modestly diluted into next year. Now, just trying to think through those moving pieces that would be helpful. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, I mean, the core of the business, right, you should think of margin expansion or pricing ahead of our cost inflation, which we're certainly very committed to doing. And then there's some other pieces on that right commodity prices, right could create a drag, depending on whether that basket goes, but fuel was a drag in the quarter, right. You know that, in general, we price fuel and our fuel recovery fee is a pretty good broad hedge to fuel. But we have a little bit of drag as we go up, and then it happens a little bit of lag as we go back down. So depending on where fuel goes, but I'd say there's probably more chance that neutral or tailwind added in the next year. And then acquisitions, right, like I said, right, we kind of load up all those integration costs in the first year. And so we expect that to be a little bit of a headwind to the overall margin for a portion of that - the headwind in the equation, in the next year, but nothing dramatic, right. We're still committed to expanding margins next year with all those pieces put together. Sean Eastman : Okay, excellent. Very helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions. I think your footprints just to align naturally, with some population and demographic trends. And so that may partly playing years, the great organic growth trends we've seen from there. But I wonder if you could talk a little bit about new business formation and new business origination for the company. And specifically Jon, how you might be leveraging your digital platform to help drive that new business formation, rather than new business origination for the company? Is there anything that you're doing differently now at Republic than you might have done in years past to help identify and build new business? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, we've certainly advanced the cause with our digital tools, I mean, our sales team is on the sales force platform and got a lot of lead generation tools across the different verticals in our business that populate new leads going forward. And we've certainly seen some of that, frankly, I think there's more of that to come, right, as we get through delta. And consumer confidence even gets higher here. And we quote, unquote, get back to travelling and back to business. So we're optimistic, there's more upside of that going forward. But we think we're getting certainly our fair share of the growth of more because we've got 1000 plus sellers out there working very local market to find opportunities, one at a time. Noah Kaye : Okay, and then, I guess, in the context of the ACV Enviro acquisition, I wondered if you're able to share your vision for what kind of scale you want to have in this segment over time and often you've talked about environmental services TAM being around 20 billion and the fact that the customer base wants to consolidate? Who uses for services given sustainability and other drivers, but do you want this to be a billion dollar business with a few years? Is that out of range of what you're thinking? Can you talk a little bit about your ambition? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. No, I think that's actually a really good starting point. I think a billion dollars in three ish years, I think is a reasonable target. We certainly will not race or reach to get there by any means. We certainly wouldn't be afraid to clear that if we think we have the right opportunities going forward. It will be a mix of organic growth and acquisitive growth more acquisitive than organic just in time percentage basis as we scale that business. And listen, that's been a really good fit for us in the early days, not only have they performed well, but we expected to see a lot of integration opportunities with our waste recycling business. And we're seeing a lot of those come through opportunity, internalize disposal, cross sell with customers, and it's just going to strengthen the value proposition of both sides of our business. Noah Kaye : Okay, thanks so much. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Noah. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to special waste volumes as well as C&D. Just curious have you guys seen any impact on these volumes from the tight labor market and kind of the stressed supply chain across the business and the environment? Jon Vander Ark : No, not really. I mean, listen, the supply chain is impacting us in weird ways. Like where we have a solar project we're putting in and we can't get them the equipment is trapped on a boat outside of Long Beach. So that project might not go in this year. But those are more incremental one off things and get we're blessed to be in a business that is a service based business, right and not materials based, or we will be probably suffering, like some of the other companies that are, so we feel good about that, but not in a special waste or C&D side. We think there's more demand coming back in that business without question, but I don't think the supply chain disruptions at attach anything to that part of the business right now. Kyle White : Got it. And then on the solar investments, I think initially you're targeting 125 million for this year, is that still the right target? And should we expect that target to go higher next year? Brian DelGhiaccio : It might be modestly more than that. As Jon mentioned we've got some of these projects right now, it's all based on what gets placed in service by the end of the year. I would say a good number to use through the cycle is in that 150 to 175 range. And that's all - yeah, predicated on some of the tax laws that are in place today. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Stinger with Bank of America. Michael Stinger : Hey, guys, yeah, thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate the outlook raised. But just to put a finer point on it, I might have missed it. Is EBITDA margins up year-over-year on the fourth quarter? Or is there just a lot of integration acquisition costs that kind of creates some noise on the quarter? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. I think it's a couple of things. It's yes, what you said on kind of the integration costs, but also, when you take a look year-over-year, we've consistently seen since the fourth quarter of last year, heavier container weights, that sort of thing. So that that probably will put a drag on the performance relative to the prior year. Michael Stinger : Okay, got it. And just to be clear, I'd like - Brian, just on the 32% margin target you guys might have already fleshed out is this - is the track 2024, is that how to think about it, can it be much earlier, or in some inflationary pressure and just a lot of this acquisition? Obviously, it's lower than you integrate, I get it moving higher, like how do we think about the margin in the context of that 32% target? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, it was it, I think it's - we're not going to put a specific year on it. But we are certainly trending in that direction. And I think you're going to see steady ratable improvement, right. I don't think you're going to see any big jump, or I don't think you're going to see us flatten. And it's going to be a consistent set of levers, which is we are going to continue to grow. We're going to price out of our cost inflation and give our people a fair wage increase to drive productivity right alongside that, and listen we're growing in a different way than we ever had before. Over time, we think that gives us leverage on SG&A, which further helps with the margin expansion. Michael Stinger : I guess like last, if we could squeeze it in, when I think about these acquisitions for solid waste and environmental services, can you help us - Jon is like the environmental services is this lower than average margin when we think of some of this stuff outside of the oil and gas more the downstream is that lower margin, you guys can bring it up over time to kind of thinking about that portion of the business that you guys are growing relative to like the non-hazardous solid waste. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, so we start with everything on intrinsic value and returns, right. That's where we start from a fundamental standpoint. And any deal we do is going to have to clear that hurdle right individually and then naturally collectively it will over time as a platform. These businesses in general do have a lower margin profile than recycling and solid waste, they also have a different capital intensity. So when you think about free cash flow conversion, right, it looks very similar. And we do think there's certainly an opportunity to raise those margins over time. And, again, we have been incredibly consistent over the last decade on our commitment to pricing, right. And that we won't flinch or back off of that, right as we grow in the broader volume of services space, right, we are going to be able to price because we're going to provide a differentiated service and that supports us not only giving a fair wage increase to our employees, but then expanding margins and providing great returns to our shareholders over time. Michael Stinger : Thank you. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. So I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vander Ark for some closing comments. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Isley. In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter performance. We delivered double digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. We continue to manage the business to create long-term value for all stakeholders and expect continued profitable growth in 2022. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to our customers. It is our team of dedicated employees that make these results possible. Have a good evening and be safe. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks Stacey. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter performance capped off a very strong year financial results and operational execution. We outperformed expectations throughout the year and exceeded the high end of our upwardly revised guidance. During 2021, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $4.17, which increased 17% over the prior year, produced $1.52 billion of adjusted free cash flow, which increased 23% over the prior year. Expanded EBITDA margin 60 basis points to 30%, improved free cash flow conversion 350 basis points to 44.8% and increased customer retention rates to an all-time high of 95%. Profitable growth remains our strategic priority. And we continue to believe that investing in acquisitions is the best use of free cash flow to create long term value. In 2021, we invested over a $1 billion of acquisitions to further enhance our market position and increased free cash flow. This is the highest level of acquisition investment in over a decade. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust with opportunities in recycling and solid waste, and environmental solutions. Yesterday we announced our agreement to acquire US Ecology. This acquisition propels Republic into a leading position in the environmental solutions space, and as a platform of high quality assets and difficult to replicate infrastructure. I will discuss this strategic acquisition in more detail before we open up the call for Q&A. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we returned $800 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We delivered outsized growth and profitability by executing our strategy. Our strategy is supported by three differentiating capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability. With respect to customer zeal, our customer retention rate remained at a record setting level of 95% and NPS remains well above pre pandemic scores. During the fourth quarter, we deliver an outsize revenue growth throughout the business. Core price reached an all-time high of 5.4% and average yield increase to 3.4%. Volumes increased 3.6% compared to the prior year, and acquisitions contributed an incremental 490 basis points to total revenue growth. Full year combined yield and volume of 6.7% was the highest level in company history, and over 200 basis points above the next highest year of performance. Turning to digital, we continue to make meaningful progress on the rollout of the next phase of the RISE platform. We've now implemented tablets in approximately 90% of our large and small container fleet. With these new capabilities, we generated operational efficiencies, and delivered over 1 million automated proactive notifications to customers last year. We will begin to point tablets to the residential fleet early this year, and expect to be complete by mid-2023. Next, turning to sustainability. We continue to partner with developers to capitalize on landfill gas to energy opportunities. We expect four of these projects to be completed this year. With another 14 in our pipeline expected to be completed over the next couple of years. We see an opportunity for another 40 projects beyond the current pipeline. We're also making recycling investments beginning in 2022 to afford integrate in the plastics value chain. These investments will provide a platform for future revenue growth with attractive returns and drive a more sustainable role for future generations. We will absorb these investments when our normal level of capital spending. Our sustainability performance continues to be well regarded as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the sixth consecutive year. Additionally, our MSCI ESG rating was upgraded to an A, which is the highest rating in our industry. One of the primary factors leading to the upgrade was an increase in our human capital management score. This reflects our strong culture that embraces inclusion and diversity. These strong financial and operational results would not have been possible without our dedicated employees. In appreciation of their hard work throughout the pandemic, we paid each frontline employee $500 Committed to Serve Award in the fourth quarter. Combined with the award paid in January of 2021, our frontline employees received an additional $1,000 during the year. This brings our total support provided through our Committed to Serve initiative to $50 million since the beginning of the pandemic. This strength of our 2021 results clearly demonstrates our ability to create sustainable value and provides the foundation from which we will continue to grow. That said we expect another strong year of performance in 2022. Specifically, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.58 to $4.65 and generated adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.675 billion. This represents high single digit to low double digit growth over our 2021 performance. It's important to note that this guidance as well as any assumptions we discussed in today's call, do not contemplate the impact from the pending acquisition of US Ecology. We will provide updates to our guidance if needed once the transaction closes. I will now turn the call over to Brian. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks, Jon. Core price during the fourth quarter was 5.4%, which included open market pricing of 7% and restricted pricing of 2.9%. The components of core price included small container of 8.6%, large container of 5.6% and residential of 4.8%. Average yield was 3.4%, which represents a 20 basis point increase from our third quarter performance. In 2022, we expect average yield of approximately 3.4%. This is an increase of 50 basis points over our full year 2021 results. Fourth quarter volume increased 3.6%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 4.6% and increase in large container of 3.7% and an increase in landfill of 6.7%. We expect organic volume growth in a range of 1.5% to 2% in 2022, which remains well above our long-term average. Moving on recycling. Commodity prices were $218 per ton in the fourth quarter. This compares to $110 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 110 basis points to internal growth during the fourth quarter. We are assuming $187 per ton for recycled commodities in 2022, which is consistent with the full year 2021 average. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $65 million from the prior year. This was driven by organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same store basis Environmental Solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 28.1%. This compared to 29.9% in the prior years, margin performance during the quarter was impacted by a 70 basis point headwind from higher incentive compensation expense, and we expect incentive compensation expense will return to target levels. Margin performance also included a 50 basis point dilutive impact from recent acquisitions, which included deal and transition costs. It should be noted that we pulled forward certain integration costs originally planned for 2022. The remaining impact of margin was primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in risk management costs. The current period includes a one-time true up for an insurance captive net increased expense 20 basis points in the prior year included a 30 basis point favorable reduction in reserves which did not repeat. We expect risk management expense in 2022 to be relatively flat with our full year 2021 performance. For reference purposes, fourth quarter margin performance at target levels of incentive compensation and excluding the one-time Committed to Serve payment would have been 29.4%. The remaining difference to prior your margin performance relates to the impact of recent acquisitions. SG&A during the fourth quarter was 10.6% of revenue. This represents an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year, which was driven by higher incentive compensation approvals previously discussed. Full year 2021 EBITDA margin up 30% expanded 60 basis points compared to the prior year. This resulted from pricing levels in excess of cost inflation and effective cost management, which demonstrates our ability to gain operating leverage in the business. To put our operating leverage in the context, we estimate wage inflation net of productivity was approximately 3%. Our average yield of 3.4% more than covers this level of cost inflation, which is why labor and maintenance were both down as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter and for the year. In 2022, we expect EBITDA margin will continue to improve and our targeting margin expansion of 30 to 40 basis points over our full year 2021 performance. The components of expected margin expansion include pricing in excess of cost inflation, adding 60 to 70 basis points, and incentive compensation expense returning to target levels, adding 50 basis points, partially offset by acquisitions decreasing margin by 40 basis points and net fuel decreasing margin by 40 basis points. DD&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.2% for the year. We expect DD&A as a percentage of revenue of approximately 11.5% in 2022. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.52 billion and increased $279 million or 23% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business and a reduction in interest expense resulting from refinancing debt. Full year 2021 free cash flow conversion increased 350 basis points to 44.8%. We are targeting high 40% level conversion within the next couple of years. Total debt was $9.6 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. Our leverage ratio was 2.9x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and noncash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 24% during the fourth quarter. This was in line with our expectations and resulted in a 26% equivalent tax impact for the year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 26% in 2022, made up of an effective tax rate of 21% and approximately $120 million of noncash charges from solar investments. Let me now turn it back over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Brian. Before we open up a call, let me provide a little more color on our recent announcement. With the addition of US Ecology\u2019s national footprint of vertically integrated assets, leading disposal infrastructure and comprehensive capabilities, we are better positioned to serve our customers with one of the most complete sets of products and services. This strategic acquisition provides a platform for additional organic and acquisitive growth, with cross selling opportunities for existing customers who want a single partner to manage their environmental service\u2019s needs. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and free cash flow and to create significant value with double digit returns for our shareholders. We are excited to welcome Us Ecology\u2019s talented employees to the Republic team and expect the deal to close by the end of the second quarter of this year. Expanding our environmental solutions business is a strategic priority. And this acquisition is a key addition. That said the investments we are making are not limiting growth or reducing focus in the traditional recycling and solid waste businesses. This is not an either or but both and approach. We plan to make outsize investments in both businesses to accelerate growth and create lasting value. We remain disciplined allocators of capital and will only make investments in organic growth opportunities and M&A that increases intrinsic value and improves returns. With that operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Thanks so much. I'm sure there'll be a bunch of questions about US Ecology. But I'd like to focus on the core business for now. And starting with pricing. Notice the yield was really strong, especially at a full year basis. But that core price you called out at an all-time high with noting, the yield was very strong in collection. Just what's your view on post collection pricing and yield going into 2022? Do we start to see that a nudge up as well? Because certainly there's rising operating expenses there just like there is everywhere else. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, certainly, you'll see some momentum in the first couple of quarters. And I think you'll see that momentum accelerate in the second half of the year, a lot of those customers are attached to CPI or something a derivative CPI. And like our collections business, there's 12 to 18 month lag, so that elevated print from the last year will then start to flow through, and you'll see really nice economics on the yield side, especially in Q3 and Q4. Noah Kaye : That's super helpful. And that leads into next question was really how to think about the readability or the cadence of yield trends over the course of the year. I know you're not like some peers, and you tend to do your PIs rapidly through the year. So is that 3.4%, full year number, since you're doing 3.4% here in the fourth quarter, is that fairly smooth and stable over the balanced years? Anything that you would call out? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, the same thing, which is the portion of our book that's attached to CPI or something related to that, you will get more momentum in the second half. So I think you'll see really good pricing numbers here in Q1 and Q2. And then you'll see that start to accelerate in Q3 and Q4, the open market side will end up being more ratable, with the caveat that we're living in a very dynamic world, right, and we see inflationary costs inflationary pressure, right, the core thesis of this business is that we are going to price ahead of our cost, right? We did a great job of that last year as costs start to accelerate in pockets. And we'll do the same thing this year. Nothing broad based, right. We look at every market uniquely and dynamically and make sure that our people are getting paid. And then again, we're pricing ahead of our costs. Noah Kaye : Yes. And one more to sneak in. And Brian, you call this out. But I want to go back to because I think it's important, just around the margins and the impact from the hire incentive comp and the bonuses, I think, you said it was 130 bps. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Noah Kaye : So just, a, was that, and how much of that was anticipated and b, when you talk about that sort of being a tailwind to March this next year, I guess how do you think of that in the context of continued support for the labor force given the tight labor market and of course ongoing support amid the COVID pandemic, which is still, although easing with us. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, let me kind of talk about the incentive compensation piece first and then we can talk about the Committed to Serve award. So clearly, from an incentive compensation perspective, we put a plan together that assumes target, right. And as you've seen all year long, we've outperformed. And with that came additional incentive compensation accruals which will be expensed or were expensed in \u201821, the cash for that will be paid in \u201822, which is one of the reasons when you take a look at our free cash flow, the growth on a more normalized basis is actually even in excess of what we're presenting, because we've got to absorb that extra cash payment in the first quarter. On the Committed to Serve again, that was a discretionary item, right, that we decided to do, certainly in recognition for the hard work that our frontline employees did during the pandemic. But we are not planning on making any of those additional or incremental awards of going forward. Brian DelGhiaccio : Largely because that's baked into the plan, right, we've got elevated increases for all of our frontline people given it\u2019s an inflationary environment. And again, we're pricing ahead of that. And even with that plan, we're planning to expand margins. So that's why we assume that, again, as the situation moves and becomes dynamic, we'll adjust accordingly. Noah Kaye : Dynamic is definitely the right word. I\u2019ll turn it over Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Can talk about the cadence of the margin expansion that you folks are looking for over the course of the year, obviously the fourth quarter will have the easy comp that you just mentioned. But what about as we head into the first quarter, if we apply normal seasonality, it looks like your margins might be starting to year down 50 to 100 basis points year-over-year in the first quarter unless we get outsized pricing contribution, is that right? Can you just talk about the cadence of the year-over-year margin performance that you're looking for? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, Jerry, you're on the right path there. I would say in 2022, we're expecting normal seasonality with respect to both the revenue as well as the EBITDA margin, I think when you look at the last two years, right, so \u201820, and \u201821, you had anything but normal, right? So you really have to go back and look at that seasonal cadence prior to that, which again, when you think about a seasonally we tend to see our highest revenue margin performance in the third and second quarters, Q4 thereafter. And then usually Q4 is a little bit the lightest for the year, really, for two reasons, you've got the winter months. So you're not seeing that uptick in particular landfill volumes, as well as you've got the highest percentage of taxes in the first quarter. Payroll taxes, right, yes. Jerry Revich : Yes, appreciate it. And then separately on the acquisition announcement, can you talk about the path to get to double digit returns what amount of bolt-on activity do we need? Or how much more do we have to go from a synergy standpoint to earn that double digit return that typically for transactions that size takes most companies at least three to five years to get to. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, no, that double digit return is based on the current pro forma, which again, is on the $40 million of cost synergies, which don't include any of the revenue synergies including cross-sell, or bolt-on acquisitions, which we have a number in the pipeline down the road, so that would all those things will be opportunities to accelerate, get to double digit more quickly and then accelerate the overall returns to even higher level. Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon. Just real quick, Brian, but to be clear, the margins in \u201822 are assuming a normal like 100% incentive comp accrual? Brian DelGhiaccio : That's correct. Tyler Brown : Okay. Jon Vander Ark : Hold the fire. Yes, we'll take, Tyler, but we're planning on 100% that is correct. Tyler Brown : Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then I know while we're on the talk of margin here, I know in the US Ecology release, you laid out that 47% free cash flow conversion by \u201824. But you didn't really make any mention of the margin targets. Now I get it that US Ecology is probably, I'm going to say 70-80 basis points dilutive to margins, but that does \u2013 does anything preclude you from a treat achieving those call it 32% margins longer term? And is that something that investors should still think could be a reasonable expectations like mid-decade? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, Tyler, absolutely in the solid waste and recycling side, right? We're on our marks, right? And we're going to get there. And you're right, this acquisition right in this space in general has a slightly different value creation formula a little bit lower margins, but less capital intensity, right. And so that starts to converge more into free cash flow conversion, you'll see us move later in the year to segment reporting, right, that calls those things out and really makes it clear to the investment community, what kind of progress we're making on each front. And so just arithmetically right, we'll get there just slightly slower than we would have otherwise. But our sights are still set toward that target overtime. Tyler Brown : Okay, yes, segment detail would be helpful. And then Jon, I think it was only 90 days ago, though, you mentioned that you wanted to get environmental services up to $1 billion franchise, over I think the next like three years, clearly pro forma, this is going to get you there. You mentioned a platform for deals in the release, you mentioned it again, on this call, but like, where do you envision the business longer term? Are you targeting a certain percentage of sales that you maybe don't want to exceed or just big picture there? Jon Vander Ark : No, listen, we're -- this deal, right, is a very unique set of assets, right? And gives us a really attractive position, right? And we don't think there's deal of a size or scale right out there in the future, and we're certainly going to take this, should we be able to close it and integrate it, get our people connected the systems, right, make sure that we're executing above the pro forma, right. And then along the way, of course, there's other deals that can fold into this, while we're aggressively growing, right, the solid waste and recycling business. So we don't have any defined target of what percentage of the business this is. But the bulk of this business, just arithmetically is going to be our traditional recycling and solid waste business. And we're going to continue to kind of grow both sides of that as we move forward. Tyler Brown : Okay, and then by last one, just real quick. You talked about the $40 million of synergies from the deal, but you never really put a finer point there. So where exactly are these synergies coming from? Are they more SG&A? Are they other operating costs? Are they even CapEx? Brian DelGhiaccio : No, it's too broad fronts, think about half of it as a duplicative corporate costs, right? This is costs of being a public company, IR treasury and all the normal things that you would think to take out and then the other $20 million would come more at the field level because you see, we have a Gulf Coast region, right? We have a Northeast Region and environmental solutions business, right. They have a national footprint. And we'll obviously think about harmonizing and integrating those. Right, that's a relatively small number, right? When you think about it in terms of cost takeout, because we think this is a huge platform for growth for us, right? We're not going into cut and flip or buying to keep and build. Now, as we go and we learn more, if there's more opportunities to do things a bit more efficiently, we'll certainly take advantage of that. Tyler Brown : Okay, all right. Appreciate the time. Jon Vander Ark : Yes and I think Tyler the other thing we do just the $40 million is exclusively cost synergies, there are no revenue synergies baked into the plan. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much. How to ask two questions and get 10 of a minute. You ended the year at 44% free cash flow conversion, your guidance is up almost nine. But cash flow from ops are only up about 5.5, capital spending is almost flat. So I'm trying to understand what's happening in capital spending. What do you think the cash conversion ratio does in \u201822? And is the cash flow from ops as a percentage of revenues kind of the same in \u201822? As it was in \u201821? How was that to combine on question? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, so Mike, let me kind of put it to you this way here. And I mentioned that we've got the additional cash incentive compensation that we're paying in \u201822. That's related to \u201821 performance. It's about $40 million of extra cash, which impacts free cash flow conversion by 100 basis points. So we think we're going to be able to from overall perspective, get to that 45% plus even absorbing that $40 million extra that extra 100 basis points of free cash flow conversion. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And that'll show up in the cash flow from ops number. Jon Vander Ark : That\u2019s cash for ops, right and working capital where you see it. Tyler Brown : Right. And then what -- why is capex relatively flat year-over-year? Jon Vander Ark : Well, remember we talked about in the current year, right? So again, if you take a look at our original guide, and then what we ultimately spent at the midpoint of that we were kind of $90 million more of CapEx. So we had the ability one to fund additional growth. So again, let's take a look at our volume performance. So from an organic perspective, we had additional growth opportunities, as well as pulled forward some capital that was originally going to be spent in \u201822. So that's why it's relatively flat in \u201822, is because some of that spending actually happened in \u201821. Michael Hoffman : Got it. That's what I thought it was. Just wanted to make sure that was clear. And then, Jon, I think it is important for everybody to understand that don't focus on margins focus on the discipline of Republic's cash on cash returns. And just to put it in perspective, I mean you now have about $1.3 billion in ES revenues. And what do you got maybe, two, if you get US Ecology close, two and a $2.5 billion invested. And all like-to-like basis, the same investment is probably 2x on a per revenue basis in garbage. So that's the way people want to put it in perspective, am I thinking about that correctly. Jon Vander Ark : Well, I probably have to do a little math offline, Michael to confirm or deny your thesis. But I think broadly speaking, you're in the right zone, which is people get very caught up in the margin. And listen, we understand the margin as a way to measure the business. And we don't run away from that, we own that. And we've done a great job of expanding margins the last couple years, right, kind of creeping up on 300 basis points as we get into next year, right. But we don't run the business for the core, we don't run it for any single metric, we run it for the long term and intrinsic value. So that's where cash on cash returns. And that's where value creation comes in. And so business that might have a slightly different optics, which is structurally a little less, lower margin. And then but less capital intensity, that free cash flow conversion is a better metric that serves to harmonize those two things, and get much closer to returns or a view toward returns. And, look, we think there's margin opportunity in this business, right? We think that we're going to continue to look for efficiencies, and we're going to think about make sure that we take our mindset around revenue management and our skills and capabilities and our belief that we have to price out of our cost, right and be expanding margins that allows us to reinvest in the business, right and take care of our customers over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So just touching on that. I know, you just kind of said it. The answer to my question being how do you grow margin? And how do you take advantage of that margin opportunity in the environmental services business? You said, both synergy and pricing, but if you were to kind of frame it, is it 50 :50? Or is it really a business that needs to be repriced and properly priced to get those margins up? And/or is it more on the cost energy side that you're looking to get those margins higher? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I talked about the $40 million that we have right in front of us. And then of course, as we go, and we'll look for opportunities, now, we're acquiring not just assets we are acquiring deep expertise, right in the hazardous waste value chain, and around compliance and operations and commercial capabilities. And so we're very, very mindful of that. And the last thing I want to do is step over a $20 bill to grab a nickel. So we're not going to be very short term focus, we're going to think about long term. And as we find more and learn more, right, we'll certainly report out on that. On the revenue side, but we haven't put anything into the pro forma, right, we see opportunities across multiple fronts. And strategically, the reason that we're into this business is because of the connectivity of solid waste, and recycling customers that have asked us to go here, they want a one stop shop, they want somebody who we now think we will have the leading set of products and services in the environmental services space to serve our customers. So the cross-sell opportunities become immediate, and we've seen that with ACV and any other previous acquisition that we've done in this space. We talked about the following acquisitions and that being a real opportunity. We think there are really interesting capital investment opportunities on the post collection side of that business that allow us to compete more broadly right across incineration some other parts of the value chain we're excited about. And then plus we will bring our skill and capability of revenue management to the table understanding that there is no work for free. So we'll look at every individual job that we do and make sure there's sufficient returns on that over time again, that becomes important to allow us to pay our people and to reinvest in the business. And we haven't quantified any of those yet, right, because we're thinking concentrate, and hopefully closing this transaction and integrating our colleagues. But we think there's a lot of upside over time. Walter Spracklin : That's great color. And then my second question here is on scalability of future acquisitions, what solid waste versus the environmental services side? Is environmental services, is that a much more scalable? Where integration of acquisitions, future acquisitions is better, it's easier to integrate, it's much more upside, is that rather that way on solid waste more. So I'm looking to gauge where your opportunity set and incremental dollar will be spent now, if there's a lot bigger opportunity in one of the buckets through acquisitions than the other one? Jon Vander Ark : Well, I think the great news is that we're not capital constrained, right? So that we don't to have $1 and choose where to put it. We look strategically, where's the fit? And does it meet our discipline returns criteria. And then if it's both we invest in both over time, I think this space looks very similar to what's always in recycling look like a decade or more ago where there's a lot of fragmentation. And we've already seen this rolling in smaller players, right provides a ton of synergy. And we've got a pipeline that we see some sometimes building on a regional footprint, sometimes it's adding even further adding your product and service offering that will be great fits. And our pipeline and acquisitions is robust on both fronts. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : Hi, team, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to make sure I understand the price versus underlying inflation expectations over the course of the year. So if we're expecting 60 to 70 bps of margin expansion from pricing ahead of cost inflation, the average yield guidance is 3.4%. Does that mean we have 2.75% inflation kind of assumed or maybe just helped me understand that -- those assumptions? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, so Sean, remember one of the things you have to remember when we disclose average yield, we're using total revenue as the denominators, when you take a look about where we price and you look in that solid waste business, if you did an unrelated business, it would actually be 70 basis points higher than our 2021 performance and about 20 to 30 basis points higher than on total revenues. So that's the way you have to put it into context. So the 3.4%, you got to make 3.6% or 3.7% call it based on related revenues. And you look at that pricing in excess of cost inflation that would imply closer to a 3%, inflation, cost inflation. Sean Eastman : Okay. Jon Vander Ark : Kind of wage and benefit number, there's probably slightly higher, keep in mind, we're not talking a lot about it, but we're still getting a lot of productivity benefits to RISE. And that's one of the great stories through the pandemic is it's allowed us to pay keep paying our people as their bills go up, while managing the cost structure because we're just getting more efficient at the work. Sean Eastman : Okay, great. Yes, I'm glad we flesh that out, very helpful. And maybe just on Us Ecology, in light of your comments around environmental solutions, being less capital intensive, but also mentioning that there are some interesting CapEx opportunities around this particular acquisition. I mean and then there's been seems like, there's been a lot of noise around the US Ecology, capital spending historically. So, I mean, what should we expect as a baseline and sort of variability around CapEx from Us Ecology? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, look, I think there's been some elevated capital with respect to building out right, some landfill. So through the cycle, we would expect the capex to run circa 9% of revenue or so on that business. And again, it's going to be less than that in that 4% to 5% range on the field services piece and a little bit more on that Waste Solutions piece. But on average call about 9%. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Hey, thank you very much. I just had a question around as you think about synergies on revenue, from haz waste and solid waste, do you have a sense of how many customers can subscribe to sort of both services? And then also in the past there's been people that have looked at medical waste and solid waste together. And that hasn't worked quite worked out. What's different about this space? Do you have a lot of manufacturing customers that sort of, are asking you to do both? Just give us a sense of revenue synergies? You don't have to quantify it just help us understand that? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. So I think versus your previous thesis, I think, when you start with this sounds like an interesting bundle, let me try to go sell it right, that may or may not work, right, we start with asking the customer, what they want, what they need, and how they want to buy, and have worked our way back into this. So it's true, certainly for our broad set of industrial customers, right, who produce an ongoing recurring set of waste streams. And this really has accelerated over the last decade, they want fewer people into their plants. And second, they're like taking a very hard look at the sustainability footprint of their supply base, right, that's a big part of their sustainability story. And so people who have the ratings we have who have the record, we have become really meaningful for them. And keep in mind, we're still a very, very small percentage of their overall cost structure. So the idea that they'd be willing to pay a little bit more for somebody who can handle their needs compliantly and provide the speed they need, right? That's the value proposition. And that's what we've seen proven out with the ACB transaction immediately, right. And we think we'll get that to just at a much bigger scale with a US Ecology transaction. It also applies to some event type work. I think about the infrastructure bill and brownfield sites remediation, the same thing, you have a contractor there, but who's really unwatched to understand speed, and a single provider that can handle all the different waste streams becomes a really big strategic advantage. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. So can you give us a sense of post US Ecology? What is your market share in haz waste? And where do you think it can go? And do you -- I know Us Ecology is heavy on landfills, they're heavy on event work. They have this NRG business that they over levered to buy, how are you thinking about the portfolio? Does incineration matter or not? Does haz waste landfills mean more? Is NRG a good business? Just walk us through like how you're thinking about the portfolio? Because they do have a few businesses? And haz waste is obviously, a very big market that has a number of other players and also the captive incinerators. It's very different than solid waste, as you obviously already know. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, sure. So I mean, it starts with their historic bid, this was a really in the post collection, hazardous landfill site, they have TFTs intended bands and other things around that. But those five sites, right, give them about a 36% market share position, right in hazardous post collection, right? That's when the strength of their business really, really strong. And we're excited about that. They bought a company called NRC, which has largely field services, which the thesis of which is getting close to the customer, we believe and agree with that thesis, right. And we've seen that and prove that out that that works. Right. We were there with the ACD deal. And we see that in our Gulf Coast region as well over time, that NRC transaction brought with it a couple of other types of businesses, they've got a little bit business in Europe, and they've got some things, marine standby business focuses on oil spill recovery, right? Those are things that we'll go in and quickly take a look at and evaluate and understand, hey, what is the -- what's the fit with the rest of the business? Is it connected from a customer standpoint, from an asset sharing standpoint, I take a very fair view of this something we think we can build and grow will be excited about it. Or if this is something that might be a little more standalone and not very scalable, and somebody else might be the more natural owner of that will of course evaluate that as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Chang with CIBC. Kevin Chang : Good evening. Thanks for taking my question here. You [Indiscernible] out, you talked about some of these revenue synergies and as you build up your environmental solutions, capabilities, the vertical integration, and I guess you spoke a little bit about this. What does the customer get out of it? It sounds like you might give them better service under one umbrella? And maybe it's just not clear to me why that would be. But do they also have like a cost savings? Like does a bundle program offer a level of pricing discount that they wouldn't get it? These are two different vendors, just what does the customer get out of this having this all come out of Republic versus maybe dealing with Us Ecology and Republic separately, let's say? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I know the thesis and it's true in some industries, where hey, the more you put together, the more you bundle, the more price pressure you could be under. And we see this in our business today, actually, that the more products a customer and services a customer buy the average price per product or service goes up, not down, right. And keep in mind waste and recycling broadly, are a very, very, very small portion of a customer's cost structure. If you run a manufacturing facility, you think first about all of your direct costs could be steel, or copper, anything else, and then you think about your labor, and then you think about your SGA costs of IT and everything else. Waste and Recycling, right? We're talking about basis points, right on someone's overall cost structure. So a small price premium on a very small number is still a very, very small number. So for them, it's around compliance, right? Think about producer liability, right? When they produce a waste stream, especially more complex and complicated ones, they have the liability of that forever. So having somebody who's going to handle that in a sustainable and appropriate manner is of enormous value to them, the speed right of being able to get things out of their facility, and keep the container empty, because a full container can sometimes shut down the manufacturing process. So there's enormous value created by speed, ease of service, right, digital interface, and billing. And those are all pieces that we start to put together for people. So that's the value proposition for customers. Kevin Chang : No, that's a great clarification answer. And as you know, the compliance has got to be a big part of the value proposition. My second question, maybe it's more of a philosophical question. But the industry and you're seeing it yourself, you're getting strong pricing, the covering inflation, the churn is at record lows as well, so you kind of get the best of both worlds. But I guess what trend level would force you to reevaluate your pricing strategies, you said 95%, I think it\u2019s a Q4 number like, at what point or what level of churn would you read things the pricing, you're putting out into the market in order to maintain a certain level of market share or volume? Jon Vander Ark : Well, we look at that all the time, right, we understand and we're very sophisticated pricing, both pricing new customers, as well as pricing existing customers. And the latter becomes more important for us, obviously, because we have such a long customer tenure, right? That's what that high customer retention drives are underneath that is long customer tenure. And so we have all kinds of experiences with customers around test and learn, right, we take A and B sampling, in terms of understanding a price that customers are willing to pay, and then at what price does that start to drive churn, right and start to drive defection. And there's an incredible amount of science underneath that process that's been developed over the last two decades. So it's really not the top down number we look at. And if we go 92, we change pricing across the board or the opposite direction, right? It's much more surgical almost at a customer by customer level, right. And that's what produces the pricing number while driving great volume growth. Operator : Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. David Manthey : Yes, thank you very much. Two quick ones here. Jon, you mentioned at the beginning something about forward integrating into the plastics supply chain, could you tell me what that means? I'm completely clueless about that. And second, on the eco deal. It looks like margins, free cash flow and returns are lower than core Republic were out of the box here, organic growth may be a little bit more attractive and the platform for bolt-on acquisitions seems to be one of the best attributes of it. Could you just compare and contrast sort of the pipeline at eco, you've gone through your due diligence, talk to them about deals versus what you know about the average MSW deal. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, sure. So on plastics, listen, the world has a single use plastics problem, right? And you don't have to read too many websites or magazines or watching the television shows to figure that out. Now, it's very different nature of those firms are very different across geography. But in the US, the problem is right circularity right, we produce single use water bottles or anything else. And we don't capture enough of those. And that plastic ultimately gets lost or gets downgraded, right. And there's huge pressure on the CPG companies to drive more reusable product. And rather than just using virgin plastic, and the constraint, and all this is aggregation, and supply. And so we are uniquely positioned in the value chain, because we have that material. Today, that value chain isn't very well constructed. So you have products that moves very inefficiently, we sell that product for a relatively low value for what it's ultimately worth, when it returns into the hands of the CPG companies. So a lot of dialogue, a lot of discussion going on across every stage of the value chain, right. But we think where we've got an opportunity to take a next step, and move forward with some pretty simple processing, that is going to allow us to capture a higher selling price, and take more volatility right out of those sales through longer term contracting. I'm not going to get any more detail right now than that. But stay tuned here, because I think in the next few months, you're going to hear far more color on that topic And then on Us Ecology, listen, we have a really robust and capable business development team, both out and geographically dispersed, as well as here in Phoenix that maintains a perspective on every company big and small, and builds a pipeline. So we've been working on this for years on the environmental solution side of the business. And have we're very disciplined buyers, very patient, but we've had discussions right with dozens of companies. So this isn't talking to Us Ecology and saying what's in your pipeline, of course, we'll do that. But we have our own robust pipeline, right that we know will fit in well, right to the US Ecology platform, right post closing. At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll now turn back over to you for closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Sara. In closing the strength of our 2021 performance demonstrates the power of our platform, and the value our strategic investments are creating. We exceeded our upwardly revised financial goals by delivering double digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, EPS, and free cash flow. We continue to manage the business well to create long-term value for all stakeholders and expect continued profitable growth in 2022. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to our customers. Results like these are made possible by our team of dedicated employees. Have a good evening and be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

I want to remind you that our public management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When these events are scheduled, the dates, times, and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks Stacey. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We had a strong start to the year which keeps us well-positioned to achieve our full year goals. The outcomes we're delivering reflect our focus on profitably growing, the recycling and solid waste business and expanding our environmental solutions business, so we can offer the most complete set of products and services to our customers. The investments we're making in the business are taking hold and creating undeniable value, while further strengthening our three differentiated capabilities of customer zeal, digital, and sustainability. During the first quarter, we delivered revenue growth a 14%, generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, which is a 23% increase over the prior year and produced $531 million of adjusted free cash flow, which is a 14% increase over the prior year. We continue to believe that investing in acquisitions is the best use of free cash flow to create long-term value. Earlier this week, we closed the acquisition of US Ecology. This acquisition propels Republic into a leading position in the environmental solutions and adds a platform of high quality assets. We have customer overlap between our $1.5 billion manufacturing vertical and US Ecology's $1 billion book of business. We estimate our cross selling opportunity at $75 million to $100 million. We're excited to welcome US Ecology employees to the Republic team and will benefit from their deep expertise in specialty waste handling. We also invested $66 million in other acquisitions during the quarter. We also have approximately $400 million of deals in the advanced stages of closing, all of which are in the traditional recycling and solid waste space. In addition to investing in acquisitions, we returned $349 million to our shareholders, this includes $203 million in share repurchases and $146 million in dividends. We are experiencing meaningful traction developing our differentiated capabilities where actions are leading to outcomes. Our aspiration is to live in a world-class customer experience which we call Customer Zeal. Our customer retention rate remains at a record setting level of 95%. This has enabled us to generate the highest level of pricing retention and company history and generate outsized revenue growth throughout the business. During the first quarter, core price reached an all-time high of 6%, and average yield increased to 4.2%. Volumes increased 3.6% compared to the prior year and acquisitions contributed an incremental 390 basis points to total revenue growth. Regarding digital, we completed the rollout of RISE tablets in our small and large container fleet. We continue to see tangible benefits of this proprietary technology for our customers and within our operation. We will begin deploying tablets in the residential fleet later this month and expect to be complete by mid-2023. We recently went live with the finance and procurement modules of our new ERP system, which will streamline back office activities and empower local leaders with enhanced data. Next, turning to sustainability. We continue to believe that environmental sustainability and economic sustainability go hand-in-hand. We are passionate about doing things that are good for the future generations in a way that generates profitable growth for our business. In March, the company announced our plans to expand our participation in the plastics value chain with a nation's first integrated plastics recycling facility. The Republic Services Polymer Center will address the growing demand for recycled plastics, while enabling CPG brands to meet their sustainability goals. Based in Las Vegas, this will be the first of three to five centers nationwide, and is scheduled to open in late 2023. We expect this polymer center will generate an incremental $50 million of revenue with an EBITDA margin at or above total company performance. Earlier today, we announced our joint venture with Archaea to develop 39 renewable natural gas projects that are landfills. These projects generate attractive returns and accelerate achievement of our ambitious 2030 sustainability goal of increasing biogas for beneficial reuse by 50%. The projects are expected to come online between 2023 and 2027, at which point approximately 70% of our total landfill gas collected will be beneficially reused. This joint venture together with our 17 landfill gas to energy projects under development are expected to generate approximately $100 million of incremental EBITA. We continue to be recognized for our commitment to sustainability, Republic Services was named a Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list for the fourth time. I will now turn the call over to Brian. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks Jon. Core price during the first quarter was 6%, which included open market pricing of 7.6% and restricted pricing of three and a half percent. The components of core price included small container of 9% large container of 6.8% and residential of 5.3%. Average yield on total revenue was 4.2%, which represents an increase of 80 basis points when compared to our fourth quarter performance. Average yield unrelated revenue with 4.5%. The outperformance and average yield is a direct result of higher core price increases in the face of more persistent cost inflation, dynamically adjusting rates for new work to match demand and increase price retention which illustrates customer willingness to pay for high value services. We expect average yields remain above 4% for the remainder of the year. First quarter volume increased 3.6%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 4.1%, an increase in large container of 4.6% and an increase in landfill of 4.7%. This level of volume performance was in line with our expectations. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $201 per ton in the first quarter. This compares to $133 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 40 basis points to internal growth during the first quarter. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. First quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $64 million from the prior year. This was driven by organic growth from increased activity and the contribution from acquisitions. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 40 basis points to internal growth during the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 30.4%. This compared to 30.7%. In the prior year, margin performance during the quarter included underlying margin expansion of 70 basis points and a 40 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, which was offset by a 70 basis point headwind from net fuel and a 70 basis point decrease from recent acquisitions. Within the underlying business, we are seeing wage inflation of approximately 4%. price increase is more than offset this level of cost inflation before considering the impact from productivity improvements. SG&A expense excluding US Ecology deal and integration costs was 10.2% of revenue. This was flat with the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $531 million and increased $67 million or 14% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business. Capital expenditures of approximately $200 million during the first quarter represents 15% of our projected full year spend, we remain on track to spend our full year budgeted capital expenditures. Total debt was $9.6 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.8 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and non-cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25% during the first quarter. As Jon mentioned, we closed the acquisition of us ecology earlier this week. Our initial perspective on the contribution from us ecology for the remaining eight months of the year, is as follows revenue of approximately $720 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $130 million, which includes $5 million of realized synergies. We also expect EPS contribution to be flat to slightly positive. As a reminder, EPS includes the impact of intangible amortization, and relatively higher interest expense, as debt associated with the acquisition is expected to be highest during the first year. Annualized, this would represent a year one contribution of $1 billion of revenue, and approximately $170 million of EBITDA, which includes $10 million of first year synergies, we still believe there at least $40 million of cost synergies that will be realized during the first three years. We intend to incorporate the contribution from US Ecology into our full year guidance in July. Once the impact of purchase accounting is better known, and other areas subject evaluation are substantially complete. With that operator, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon. Jon Vander Ark : Good afternoon Tyler. Tyler Brown : So, the landfill gas announcement, obviously pretty exciting. I think in your sustainability report, you guys already have something like 75 projects operating today. And if my math is right, which is always scary, but I think that maybe makes up a little more than half of the municipal solid waste landfills that you collect data on. So, number one, am I closest in the right ballpark? And two, this this deal with the 17 projects in development pretty much account for the remaining landfills in your fleet with enough ways to support a project, or some of these 39 at existing -- I'm going to call them, dirt gas operations, where you're upgrading to R&D [ph]? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, good question. So the 75, eight of those are solar projects. We put those together in our sustainability, portfolio is 67 today, right? We talked about another 17 in development, right? And then this project we announced with Archaea is another 39. Four of those projects of the 39 are basically recapping existing projects of the existing 67 I talked about, so it's mostly new and incremental. So, that kind of -- if you fast-forward to 2027, you got a few more that come become an inert, because that's the goal of the landfill, obviously, is to sunset it. So, that would take us from 67 today to 116 and 2027 with everything we're talking about. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. Yes, very helpful. And then just financially, what will we kind of see what you put up the money in one big chunk? Or do you do that as we go along? And then Brian would you just recognize it as like an income in non-controlling interest? And then they'll basically pay you a dividend back? Or how exactly what the mechanics were? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, no, we'll do it ratably investing, it's not just one big chunk, right into this joint venture. And then essentially, we get, you know, there's two forums of our return on that there's a royalty agreement, which is more typical of what we have on our typical projects, or existing projects, rather. And then we'll be in the minority equity investor in these and then Brian, you could talk about, we're going to hit the geographies. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So for the royalty similar to what we have today, Tyler, the royalty will just come through revenue, right. And you'll see that then most -- there's really no cost offsets, and most of that flows down to the EBITDA line item. And then for the portion where we've got that minority interest, that'll be a one line pickup, which will be -- again, it'll be included in our EBITDA, but it'll be separately distinguished so that you can actually see what its contribution is. Tyler Brown : Okay, okay. That's helpful. Guys that\u2019s very helpful. Lastly, you're just -- we were kind of perusing the US Ecology tend to look like they kind of struggled this quarter that really pinched on cost. I think EBITDA was maybe down 10% year-on-year. So, what's the kind of the confidence around turning that business around quickly? I think you gave some color around the contribution, which seems like you're kind of expecting things to get a little bit better as the year plays out. But just maybe talk about the first 100 days there, what the plan is to really kind of get that this is turned for positive momentum? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, no, listen there first quarter was kind of right on what we had in the pro forma, right in terms of how we valued that businesses. And we're relatively conservative how we think about things. Integration begins now we had teams all over the country, welcoming our colleagues together. And frankly, it's been going on for weeks within the parameters of what we can do with DOJ and antitrust in terms of pre planning for the integration. So, we're already driving that through, we've got the four areas outlined, geographically, we've got those teams defined the leader and the Director for, right and where all the assets and divisions flow up through that. And so that includes integrating our own environmental solutions business into that. So, we took the best of best in terms of both, assets and people in terms of how those things are structured. So, we are well, on our way on that front. One of the big opportunities there is to integrate the great set of post collection assets that have with the field services, resources. And you know, COVID was kind of a trip up for them to be able to do that in a full way. And we've got the benefit of you know, not being out of COVID, but being in a very different stage of COVID. And so again, integrating those things together and, applying our considerable revenue management capabilities to that business, looking at the go-to-market approach, all those things are underway right now. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, one thing I would add to just on the performance in the first quarter, Tyler, as well as that the performance got better throughout the quarter. Tyler Brown : Okay, and just real quickly, just to clarify, Jon, I thought you said $75 million to 100 million and $100 million and synergies and Brian said $40 million -- was just cost or what--? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, let me -- yes, the $40 million is just cost and like we value every deal, right? We have really understand the standalone intrinsic value of an enterprise and then right we value cost synergies, because we've got line of sight to that incremental to that $40 million, right, we see $75 million to $100 million of cross sell opportunities, right, probably realized over two and a half to three year period -- revenue, synergies, sorry. And then in addition to that, we've better than good any pricing. And we'll take a very hard look immediately, in terms of understanding that we're getting a return on all the work we do, and where there's an opportunity, especially in an inflationary environment, to make sure that we're getting our costs covered and more. Tyler Brown : Right, right. Okay, great. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. You mentioned the 4% wage inflation and that seemed really good for this environment and what we've heard from others. Can you give any color on maybe how you've been able to limit wage inflation if you've had any strategies around that et cetera? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I would say the seeds that were sown many years ago, right, we think about being a place where the best people come to work and making sure that our people get a fair increase every year. So even in very low inflationary environments, where CPI was running sub 1%, we always gave our people, a 2% to 3% increase in their wages, and the added benefits probably north of that. And so I would say, very fit and healthy cost structure coming in to this inflationary environment. And then we're very disciplined and surgical, we believe in market pay. And so we understand market pay and market dynamics, right across all the 800 dots on our map of where we operate. And so we've made individual indelible across the board kind of ratable cost of living increases every year. And then we go in and do additional moves, where we need to make sure that we're staying very competitive in the market. And we're still going through that, right. That's an ongoing process, ongoing science. And we believe in the local team. We also believe in the discipline and the expertise of our HR team. And we'll be able to do a centralized review, that we're doing things in a smart way. And I think you'll see us do some more of that in the third and fourth quarter here. All of which will result in a scale pricing ahead of our cost inflation of better productivity, which will allow us to expand our margins. Toni Kaplan : That sounds great. I wanted to ask also on the renewable energy side, just given the really strong increase in gasoline and diesel prices, has that changed your approach to renewable energy projects? Has it caused any thoughts about pulling forward investments in new facilities or more alternative fuel vehicles? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, one of the reasons we're really excited about this joint venture as we think it allows us to get after a portfolio of landfills, right that we bid this out, and in a very competitive process, and really excited about our partner, but that we take on all of those projects, and those projects of varying returns. And some of those things, probably we wouldn't have independently gone after in a standalone basis, just given the size and scale. So, we're able to go deeper into our fleet of landfills with projects, which is exciting, we're also able to go faster, right, we can get after all 39 of these and the next, in addition to the 18 that we have in flight, or something we haven't flight, we feel really excited to be able to go after that opportunity that quickly because of that market. As it relates to fleet, we are long on electrification, about 20% of our fleet is CNG and we certainly have that as part of the portfolio. But all of our energy going forward is on electric vehicles. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hi. Thank you. And I also want to thank you for the very kind gesture you did a few weeks ago. I appreciate it. The 4% wage inflation, how does that translate into internal cost of inflation -- total internal cost inflation? Brian DelGhiaccio : Relatively consistent, Michael, when you take a look -- I mean, I think just to put it into perspective, I talked about expansion in the underlying business of 70 basis points, I think you take that 4% cost inflation and compare that to that yield unrelated revenue, which is four and a half, and then you get, 10, 20 basis points of productivity, that is the expansion that we're seeing in the quarter. Michael Hoffman : Okay. You anticipated part B of that. But I will ask you to RISE is fully rolled out in small and large container? Does it take that rate of productivity improvement and walk it up now, because you have it more comprehensively distributed? And then this is all about taking minutes out and lowering engine hours and the like? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, listen, when you first put it in, right you there's a little learning curve, and then you get your biggest wave of productivity improvement, right? When you can start to standardize the work and get the routing efficiently. And then in those existing sites, you just start to see incremental improvement over time. We're really happy about our productivity number this quarter. Given that we had a lot of the headwinds of traffic coming back, right people coming back to work society opening up and still be able to overcome that and still see some productivity is a great signal to us or indicator of what RISE is delivering was a we'll see this more in the residential fleet. And then as we go forward, there's a kind of a 2.0 of RISE of starting to get more into advanced analytics. How do we even take the analysts and build those routes more scientifically? How do we start to do more benchmarking across geographies, to understand what the true performance improvement opportunities are? And yes, I think you'll see steady radical improvement as we go forward. Brian DelGhiaccio : And we the way we're looking at it right now, Michael, is that we probably have more opportunity left than we realized life-to-date. Michael Hoffman : Got it. And then last one on the landfill gas to energy development, you're putting up 27% of the capital? I'm assuming you control the gas and these other guys need the gas, they can't do what they want to do, even if they got a lot of money. So, what's the economic split? Brian DelGhiaccio : For that investment, we have a 40% ownership in the JV. Michael Hoffman : Okay, and Jon, you've talked about that $100 million number over and over again, consistently, but it now looks like the whole thing is a lot bigger. Because I thought the $100 million related to your 17, you were developing, and now it were, or is this an incremental $100 million plus or $100 million for the 17? Jon Vander Ark : No, this is $100 million total, Michael. So again, that -- the 17 was, call it about $25 million incremental. And then this new JV call it $75 million, for a total of $100 million for all 56 projects that are under development. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Jon Vander Ark : Hey, keep in mind, Michael, these are -- we're into medium sized sites. So these are kind of, , sub 2,000 SCFM sites. And what we'll see over time is kind of randomly going through some of the legacy projects we have on bigger sites, they'll reach their natural end of -- the project needs to be recapped. Many times, it'll be electricity project that will take into RNG and then those will be bigger sites that will go into this joint venture. Michael Hoffman : Got it, All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Han [indiscernible] filling in for Hamza. So my first question is, could you just comment on the quarterly cadence of operating leverage and margin this year? And then just what your labor turnover is running versus pre-pandemic? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, let me take that, you know, the margin question here. So, again, if you take a look at the first quarter, and how we performed, what we see going forward, and we're on a sequential basis is that the fuel really started increasing in March, right now, we're kind of saying it's going to stay elevated. That's the assumption right now for the rest of the year. So sequentially, we see a 30 basis point headwind, from the impact of fuel. Now, we're also seeing better level of pricing. So we think that we can mostly offset that. But that margin would stay relatively flat, if you will, from our q1 performance, that's on the traditional recycling and solid waste space. If you then layer in the, you know, the US Ecology acquisition, that's going to create about a 70 basis point impact margin for the remainder of the year. Jon Vander Ark : Labor -- in terms of labor turnover, but it's a little bit of a mixed picture, right, slightly elevated to pre-pandemic levels and some roles, certainly down and other roles. I'd say, look for the labor market remains tight, right? And that we would hire some more drivers, for sure, if we could get them and so back to running the business for the quarter of the year running it for the long-term. So, we're looking at all the markets and seeing where we have any elevated turnover understanding, right? If we need to put a little more wage into those markets, we will now wage is not always the answer as part of why people work. It's not all the reason why, it can be shift schedule, it can be their leader can be lots of things. So, we're very mindful of that. But again, we feel like we've got certainly a very good handle on inflation relative to pricing and our ability to cover our costs. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, and then just, on the hazardous waste exposure, can you just talk about what that level of exposure is compared to what your portfolio is right now? And how big it could get, understanding of the solid waste portfolio will also grow? And then just, you know, if you could touch on the cyclicality of that hazardous waste business? Jon Vander Ark : Well, I'd say hazardous, we didn't have any exposure. Technically, I think your question more broadly is environmental solutions versus recycling and solid waste. Right now, we got about a $400 million business in that space with the acquisition of US Ecology fast forward, that takes us to about $1.4 billion opportunity in that space. With a we think when the integrating field services and the post collection side of that it's got a relatively similar profile in terms of volatility in that space, and that there's a mix of project based work and a mix of recurring revenue, probably slightly higher, but when you mix the two parts of the business together, right doesn't meaningfully change our profile any respect. And in terms of growth prospects, we start with recycling and solid waste. We've never been more excited about our growth, growth prospects. They're both organically and through M&A. In addition, this platform with US Ecology gives us great geographic coverage and an opportunity to do follow-on tuck-in acquisitions to build out some product and service lines or to fill out a few smaller geographies. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Good afternoon, everyone. Jon Vander Ark : Hi, Jerry. Brian DelGhiaccio : Hi, Jerry Jerry Revich : Hi. I'm wondering, if you could just talk about on US Ecology, look, maybe it's too soon, but what's the nature of their landfill agreements? How quickly can you apply RSG's pricing mechanism to the landfill part of the business based on the contract structure? Is that something you're comfortable discussing on this call? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. Look, we are very well-run assets. So we start with compliance, right? Great compliance, a great set of assets, right, that are well maintained, great compliance culture, great compliance capability and technical capability that we've acquired with US Ecology. So we're really excited about that and that really is the foundation, right? That allows us to go to customers and offer them solutions that they're comfortable with that we \u2013 because they have producer liability, right? So we will maintain right, their waste streams in a way that is very compliant that they feel good about, that doesn't create liability for our customers that allows us then to price for the value that we're delivering to our customers. So we'll take a hard look at that. Again, we start with not the asset. We start with the customers, and we work our way back into the assets. And that begins right away, and it's a mix of contracted business in spot. And obviously, the spot, we can look at very quickly. The contractor side of that will take a little more time. But over time, you'll see, I think, steady improvement in that area. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then on the RNG contracts, the $100 million assumption can you just touch on what that assumes in terms of gas price per MMBTU? And would you mind just commenting on if you have any off-take agreements at this point or how you're thinking about the opportunity set? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, the JV just got announced, right? And we haven't developed the project yet. So we don't have any agreements. But I can give you some of the assumptions, right? We've got pretty conservative assumptions about gas flow, which we think we could probably beat over time. This assumes a $2 Brent price. It will be a mix of fixed versus spot, probably more fixed than spot over time, but we'll decide what that looks like together. Jerry Revich : Okay. Super. And lastly, can you talk about how you expect the pricing cadence to play out over the course of the second quarter based on actions that you've announced to customers? And if you can touch on, when you expect inflation to peak if you have that type of visibility? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. Jerry, as I mentioned in my comments, we expect average yield to remain above 4%. Again, if you can take a look at the restricted portion of the business where we have those index-based price resets, 60% of our portfolio resets in the second half of the year. So if you can look for relatively consistent performance throughout the year, but I would sit there and say probably slightly higher in the second half than we saw in the first half. Jon Vander Ark : Terrific. Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : You bet. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. If I look at your average yield to core price, I guess, conversion rate, I know that's not a great way to look at it. But that's been trending up nicely. You hit 70% in the first quarter here. And I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned retention at 95%. Does that suggest this is close to an upper bound of that conversion rate? Or are there are there things you can do to continue to narrow that gap? Jon Vander Ark : There's certainly things we can do to improve it, which is just when we talk about our strategy around customer zeal and digital and sustainability, those are all things our customers value deeply, and we think are differentiated. And not every provider can offer that. And as we create a better offering, right, our customers are willing to pay more and stay longer. So that's the essence of what we do. Now there is a structural \u2013 there are things like people move, right, or businesses close. So there's things structurally, right, that I don't think we'll ever get to 100% loyalty. But at one point, we were sub 90% and then we got to 92%, and then we kept climbing the curve, and that's the aspiration to continue to get a little bit better because the offering is that much stronger. And as you know, the economics of loyalty in this industry are very, very strong. When customers stay longer, that's certainly very valuable for us. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. And there's two components to that calculation. There's retaining more but there's also pricing at a higher level for new business, right? Both of those go into the equation. So as we expand the environmental solutions business, as we have the most complete set of products and offerings. We think that we offer to our customers we have a better value proposition, and we can then charge more for those services from a new business perspective. Kevin Chiang : Right. No, that makes sense. You're obviously seeing great momentum there. Just my second question, I think you mentioned earlier you're all in or at least you're focused on electric vehicles here. And I'm just wondering as a buyer of that technology, what do you think the bottleneck right now is for mass adoption? And I guess when you're evaluating what's in front of you, like what are the KPIs that matter the most? Is it just things like battery density? Or do things like supply chain resiliency given all that's happened in the past 9 months, like does that play a greater role? Or would you prefer a vendor that, for example, had vertically integrated their battery technology so that they're not dependent on somebody else, which creates execution risk on your orders? Just wondering how you kind of look at that evolution here. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. Well, good question. Both are relevant. Certainly, functionality, right, and the bottlenecks of weight and range, right? But for us, the operative metric is a truck has got to be able to deliver a full route in a day, right, without having a mid-day charge. That kind of creates the economics of it because whatever benefit you get, you burn up on productivity on a midday charge. And again, we feel very optimistic about where we're headed on that front. Of late, we are working really hard on some short-term exemptions with state and local municipalities. Again, I've already made some progress on that front as well, and I don't think that will be a hurdle or a barrier. We're very mindful of the supply chain with our partners to understand that, hey, what's our confidence in them being able to deliver this over time and obviously, the world has changed a lot in the last, not only two years, but the last 71 days. So we're cognizant of that and certainly baked that into our plans, but still all that being said, optimistic about the progress of starting to buy electric vehicles at scale within the next two and half, three years. Kevin Chiang : Perfect. That's it for me. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : The next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi, guys. Nice start to the year here. Would it be possible to drop the US Ecology outlook commentary to free cash flow both for this year and on an annualized basis? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. Look, in these first couple of years, let's just take this year for example, we're thinking conversion in call it, the 20% range. And again, there's some elevated capital spending in particular with the landfill. We're building out landfill disposal capacity, which takes us into 2022 and 2023 that then modulates. And as we've talked about before, we still see 47% conversion as a consolidated company by 2024. Sean Eastman : Okay. Got it, helpful. And maybe putting US Ecology aside, and just looking at stand-alone RSG, could you refresh any of the components of the year-over-year margin bridge for the full year? We had the $60 million to $70 million from pricing ahead of inflation. I think we had $50 million from normalizing incentive comp, and then that was offset by 40 basis points from net fuel and 40 basis points from acquisitions. Is there anything in that bridge you'd be able to refresh for us here? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. What I would probably say is that, the big things that change relative to our initial assumption is that fuel at current prices creates an additional 50 basis point headwind and think about pricing in excess of cost inflation offsetting that outside of US Ecology. So, relatively consistent expectation for the full year, just getting there a slightly different way. Sean Eastman : Okay. Got it. Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks very much. I want to ask about some of the volume trends in the quarter. I know that the comps weren't too tough, but you did outperform, I think, relative to the industry. So I wonder if you could touch on what you're seeing in the markets. What are net new business trends? What are you seeing in terms of business formation? Where might have actually surprised a little bit to the upside on volumes in the quarter? And I guess the last part of that is, how much of this is really just being in the right markets? And how much of it is potentially attributable to share gains? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Look, I think you're still -- you're seeing this company of the country rather open up kind of post-COVID. And some of that we saw last summer, but some we didn't, I think, I mentioned this before California, right didn't really open up, because they were thinking about opening up the, Omicron variant have hit them, right. And we didn't see quite the lift -- see the lift, we do there. So you're certainly seeing some of that comeback. And that is, we're benefiting from our geographic footprint on that, including where our population is growing, right, our Sun Belt exposure helps, as you see people going into Texas, in Arizona and other places that at large volumes. And then listen to all of our investments into customer zeal and digital right are showing up in terms of organic growth. And that we\u2019re winning on the street. I think it's very tough to compete right now in a challenge labor environment. I think, there's some people on equipment challenges, right, given supply chain shortages. And we feel very good about our equipment deliveries, feel good about our team, but it is a tight labor market. So we would take more drivers if we could this place, but feel pretty good about how we're being able to sell them service customers. Noah Kaye : Yes. Now that leads into my next question, which is on the M&A front, you mentioned, and they wanted to get last year, the $400 million of short-term potential pipeline. But what do you think about the current challenging operating environment in terms of its impact on M&A? We certainly seen some pretty healthy activities started the year. But how do you see that potentially affecting the pace and the pipeline of the M&A opportunity? Yeah, I think it remains strong. And we remain very encouraged about our outlook in that space. And as I think a number of things have helped us and probably helped the industry in the last three years, right. First, you had the fear around tax reform, and that driving some selling activity. You had COVID, and that making it a very challenging environment. And now you got an inflationary environment with a constrained labor market, where it's just getting tougher to compete, right? Add to that all the digital investments we're making at a scale that's very tough for other people to replicate, that are providing a better product to our customers. And I think that drives the opportunity for us to not only grow organically, but also have a very attractive M&A pipeline going forward. Noah Kaye : Great, thanks. Nice quarter. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Calleja with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Calleja : Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, I think you mentioned Ecology, I think it's 70 bps dilutive to margins for this year. How do we think about your margins now, as you guys integrate Ecology, especially this year? And in context of your 31%, 32% target getting back there, is pushing out a year? How can we kind of think about it with the integration now this business? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So Mike, we're going to sit there and we are going to separate when we think about reporting, we're going to separate the environmental solutions space into its own segment. So as we think about the recycling and solid waste space, we have direct line of sight to that 32% margin. But this is structurally that the business is different on the environmental solution space, but we think there's opportunity. And so this is something where we'll take longer to get there on a consolidated company basis, sure. But we look at continual improvement, not only the realization of the synergies, the cost synergies, but as Jon mentioned, we didn't include any of the revenue synergies, whether it be any additional price into that performance. So, again, you'll be able to see the case, and we'll talk about our expertise [Technical Difficulty] as we provide annual guidance. Mike Calleja : Perfect. That's helpful. And then just lastly, Brian, I think, eco reported $150 million of EBITDA in 2021. So the $130 million of EBITDA over the eight months, what level of organic growth are we assuming and the margins look like it's a little higher than last year? I might not be comparing apples-to-apples there. So any calls you can address on that pick up? And just lastly, I know I think Jerry asked earlier. I'm just curious, like, how does pricing work on this business? We know the restrictive and the CPI in the open market. And on the solid waste side curiously, if you can add color on, on how that kind of plays out on that environmental services book. Thanks, guys. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So let me talk a little bit about the EBITDA. So again, there's seasonality in the business. So let's talk about what we're expecting for a full first year contribution on an equivalent. So before any synergies, we would sit there and say, we were expecting about $160 million worth of EBITDA that would compare to the 150 odd million that you were referring to. So that would be the year-over-year growth. We then layered in again, a full year would be about $10 million of first year synergies. What that means for the eight months based on the acquisition date, that's what translates into that $130 million of EBITDA, which includes $5 million worth of real life synergies. Jon Vander Ark : And then, Mike on pricing, I think the best analog is think about the solid waste and recycling space. So you think about the post collection assets of U.S. Ecology and special waste, right? Those are event based deals, and special waste has some recurring streams. And it has some event based streams, if you're only in post collections, right? You're a taker in both of those, and you're typically giving more spot based pricing, sometimes more continuous streams are contracted, but contracted typically for shorter periods of time. And then the generator or the collector of those streams bids that out. The opportunity here is to integrate into field services, right, they have the assets, but driving that full integration, which allows you then to drive pricing from the customer, which drives more longer contracted and more consistency in the price, right, reduces the volatility of that demand. And so that is the focus right understanding generators of consistent streams of specialty waste, hazardous handling, and being able to supply them, right, and integrating that, right, into the landfills. And overtime again we saw this over a decade and a half. And it's always recycling space. That's how pricing power emanated is integrating those two things and not thinking about those two things as separate. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Stephanie Yee : Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask how the team came up with the $75 to $100 million of cross-selling opportunity. Specifically, is that kind of a realistic estimate, or is there conservatism in that number? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. So it was certainly bottom up. It wasn't a top down one. And we're in this space, right? We've been in big -- pretty big footprint in the Gulf Coast now for few years. Last year, we acquired ACB, which gave us a footprint in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic. And so we're seeing it, right, we've already gone to market together. And we're seeing opportunities to serve customers, because we now have the broadest set of environmental services, products and services. And so customers -- bigger customers value that one stop shop offering, they want fewer suppliers in their facility, they like the assurance of what we can do with those materials. So we're seeing that winning in that space. We think we're used to ecology. Now you just have much bigger patch of land, right? We've got about a billion and a half manufacturing business. They're about a billion in revenue, right. And we lay that across in terms of number of customers and take a fairly conservative estimate in terms of the types of penetration we can get across that. That's how we came up with 75 million to 100 million. Brian DelGhiaccio : And as Jon mentioned, the proof points have been there with the acquisitions that we've already done in our existing business to be able to see that that cross-sell opportunity is real. Stephanie Yee : Okay. That's helpful. And if I can ask, now that you closed on the acquisition, do you feel comfortable talking about whether you would consider divesting any parts of U.S. ecologies business? Or whether that's even part of the consideration that you're evaluating down the line? Jon Vander Ark : Sure, yes. There's a smaller international business, and they have a standby business. Both are good businesses. I think the question is, are we the national owners of those assets? So we'll start with international and put that under our view and understand, hey, how integrated is that? Whatever else we do and give it, get it, we're not an international player, right? We're North American player. We'll take a hard look there and the and the next level of I have to stay and -- again, we always start with a customer, what's the customer interaction and overlap and then we go into assets in terms of what we share in facilities, right, and then we'll get into the ability to disintegrate that sometimes it's something so tightly connected, right? It's tough to divest of that. But if it's unrelated on the customer side of the assets I typically answer is it's easier to devise that so we'll put both of those under review in that sequence and while we'll update you accordingly. Stephanie Yee : Okay, okay, great. Thank you. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Betsy. In closing, we are proud of our first quarter performance, which demonstrates the value our strategic investments are creating. We continue to manage the business to create long-term value for all stakeholders. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to partnering with customers to create a more sustainable world. We look forward to seeing everyone at Waste Expo next week, as we proudly recognize our four drivers of the year and celebrate Don Slager's well-deserved induction into the NWRA Hall of Fame. Have a good evening and be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the value created by our differentiated capabilities and ability to harness the positive momentum in our business. We delivered outsize revenue growth both organically and through acquisitions, while generating underlying margin expansion. This was achieved by pricing in excess of our internal costs inflation and continued savings from productivity initiatives. The fundamentals in our business remain strong, and we remain well-positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities in the marketplace. During the second quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 21%, generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.32, which is a 21% increase over the prior year and produce more than $1.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year to date basis, which is a 14% increase over the prior year. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in value creating acquisitions, and returning cash to our shareholders. Year to-date, we invested $2.5 billion in acquisitions, which includes the acquisition of US Ecology. The integration of US Ecology is well underway and progressing as planned. We're encouraged by early cross selling results, and remain confident that we will achieve at least $40 million of cost synergies. We have one of our most robust acquisition pipelines ever with opportunities to close transactions this year and into 2023. We now expect to invest over $600 million in acquisitions apart from US Ecology for the year. Substantially all of these deals are in the recycling and solid waste space. Year to date, we returned $495 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we recently announced an increase of the dividend for the 19th consecutive year. During the second quarter, we reported organic volume growth of 2.4%, which was broad based across geographies and market verticals. Simultaneously, we demonstrated our ability to price. Core price reached an all time high of 6.2%, an average yield increased to 5%. This is the highest level of pricing and company history. At the same time, we're experiencing higher than expected inflationary pressures that continue to persist. That said, we expect to continue to price more than our internal cost inflation, ultimately leading to full year results that are projected to exceed original expectations. We now expect adjusted EPS in the range of $4.77 to $4.80, and adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.7 billion to $1.725 billion. This represents an increase of approximately 4% from the midpoint of the prior guidance. Finally, we believe creating a more sustainable world is both our responsibility and a platform for growth. We've recently published our latest sustainability report, highlighting the progress we're making toward our most significant opportunities to positively impact key stakeholders and the environment. We reported a 9% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from our 2017 baseline, which keeps us well-positioned to achieve our interim target of a 10% reduction by 2025. We also highlight progress made on climate leadership goals, including circular economy, and renewable energy. These goals are supported by investments were making in Polymer centres and landfill gas projects, which are progressing as planned. In addition to having a positive impact on the environment, the innovative solutions are a platform for growth. Our efforts continue to be recognized externally, as Republic was recently named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the third consecutive year. I will now turn the call over to Brian who will provide details on the quarter. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks Jon. Core price during the second quarter was 6.2%, which included open market pricing of 7.8% and restricted pricing of 3.5%. The components of core price included small container of 9.7%, large container of 6.9% and residential of 5.6%. Average yield on total revenue was 5%, which represents an increase of 80 basis points when compared to our first quarter performance. Average yield unrelated revenue was 5.4%. As Jon mentioned, we continue to dynamically adjust price on new and existing business to offset higher levels of cost inflation, we've seen our operating costs and capital expenditures. Second quarter volume increased 2.4%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 2.8%, an increase in large container of 2% and an increase in landfill of 5.7%. Our customer retention rate remained stable at 95%. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $218 per ton in the second quarter. This compares to $170 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the second quarter. Next, turning to our environmental solutions business. Second quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $260 million from the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On the same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 50 basis points to internal growth during the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the environmental solutions portion of our business was 17.1% during the quarter. This includes our existing operations in the Gulf and northeast together with the addition of US Ecology. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 29.6%. This compared to 30.6% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 140 basis point decrease from acquisitions of which 60 basis points relates to US Ecology, and a 110. basis point headwind from net fuel. It's important to note, that even though net fuel was diluted to margin, we recovered over 95% of the dollar change fuel expense through fuel recovery fees. These margin headwinds were partially offset by a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices, a 60 basis point contribution from relatively higher incentive compensation expense in the prior year, and most importantly, underlying margin expansion of 60 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the solid waste and recycling business was 30.8%. SG&A expenses excluding transactions costs from US Ecology were 10% of revenue. The 70 basis point improvement demonstrates our ability to effectively manage costs and gain leverage while growing the business. With respect to our outlook, our guidance implies sequential growth and adjusted EBITDA dollars of 5% to 5.5% in the second half of the year compared to our first half performance. This would continue to drive double digit EBITDA growth on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we now expect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 29.3%. The change in margin from our initial expectations relates to the impact of US Ecology and fuel. Year to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.15 billion and increased $143 million or 14% compared to the prior year. This was driven exclusively by EBITDA growth in the business. Year to date capital expenditures of $505 million represents 35% of our projected full year spend, and year to-date cash taxes of $79 million represents approximately 25% of our projected full year spend. We now expect full year capital expenditures in a range of $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion. This represents an increase of $130 million from the midpoint of our prior expectations. The increase includes $75 million related to US Ecology. The remainder of the increase relates to investments to support growth, and higher than anticipated costs for trucks, equipment and landfill cell development. Total debt was $12 billion and total liquidity was $1.6 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.3 times. We expect to revert to three times leverage within the next 12 months. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and non cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 23.9% during the second quarter, and 24.6% on a year to-day basis. A lower than anticipated tax rate was mostly timing related, and provided a $0.05 EPS benefit during the first half of the year. We expect this timing benefit will flip in the second half, resulting in an equivalent tax impact of 29% in the third quarter, and 26% in the fourth quarter. We still expect a full year equivalent tax impact of approximately 26%. With that operator, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I was hoping you could give a little bit of extra color on the expectation for how pricing plays out. I know you gave some great detail in terms of where the open market versus restricted was in the quarter. But just how you think that plays out during the rest of the year? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, strong. Because of that momentum on the pricing side, obviously, we're putting out more price than we ever have on the open market side and retaining at a higher percentage than we ever have. Which I think is a function of both the macro economy and inflation, and all costs going up for customers, as well as the fact that we continue to differentiate our service offering and provide something unique in the marketplace. And I don't see that changing for the remainder of the year. And then we'll get a nice pickup the second half of the year on the restricted side of the business. As those contracts kick in with underlying escalator something tied to CPI or CPI derivatives like average trash or water sewer trash, that will provide some momentum there as well. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And then in terms of US Ecology, just any additional color on surprises versus now that you've started the integration, versus what your expectations were before? Jon Vander Ark : Generally, unplanned. Let's see -- very excited about the people. I think maybe one surprises we've been able to retain even a higher percentage of people than we expected. Again, there's good natural synergies in the deal we've talked about that. But the reason we bought this as a platform for growth, and we really respect their compliance culture, their expertise, and obviously a very unrivalled set of assets. And their team has been absolutely energized to get connected with us very strong cultural alignment. And we did a lot of work pre-merger in terms of organization structure and model and design. And we've got those teams staffed up and ready to go, and we're out moving in the marketplace. So, I'd say on balance. Its got a little more momentum than I expected at this point. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everybody. And just on the pricing question, I guess a lot of your contracts and just as you alluded are coming in the back half pretty strong. I guess that sets you up very nicely for 2023, in terms of carryover of those price -- any pricing you're doing through the year and in the back half the year. So when we look at the 2023, is there any reason why we shouldn't kind of see a continued elevated pricing rate for 2023? Obviously lapping some tougher compares as we get through the back half of 2023. But tell me if I'm wrong, but should shouldn't it remain elevated, given the late in the year pricing this year remain elevated through the first half of next year? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. I guess the one cautionary note, obviously, that we're living in very unique and uncertain times. And I think in the last 36 months have taught all of us some dose of humility. All that being said, the outlook from what we see right now is very, very positive. And so, you're right, the restricted portion of that book will continue to flow through. We're not going to change our stripes on the open market side of this business, right. We started, we lead with price. Our people deserve a fair wage increase. And that profit allows us to reinvest in the business and drive sustainability and all the things that we care about. So that won't change. And listen, I think we've got momentum on all three fronts. we've got momentum on the pricing side of the business. We've got momentum on the volume side of this business. And obviously, the acquisition activity, has also been very strong. And the rollover effect in the next year sets us up for what we think will end up being probably a double digit revenue year in 2023. Walter Spracklin : That's great color. On acquisitions, dovetails into my next question actually, is just how you're looking at acquisitions now in two ways. First of all, taking a fairly large one here with US Ecology, does that in any way kind of delay you from the cadence of acquisition or the pace and cadence of acquisitions at all? And secondly, related to that, does it -- does US Ecology now shift your attention a little bit to perhaps examining different types of acquisitions, some in hazardous, some in solid waste? Or do you kind of refocus re-center on solid waste for opportunities going forward? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. I think we talked about when we did the deal. This wasn't either or it was both end. And the timing of the deal was predicated on all the momentum we had in the traditional recycling and solid waste side of the business. And our outlook has never been stronger and more positive there for deals. I thought about what we're going to close this year and a strong pipeline in the next year. And that's where we certainly, the bulk of our acquisition spend will certainly come in that space. Now, the benefit is we've got a second platform with which we can pursue further follow-on and tuck-in acquisitions. And certainly we have a pipeline there. I think it's the only, I think it's very unlikely in the near term is we do another deal of scale in the environmental solution side of the business. Because we think we've got a great platform with US Ecology. We're building that out. Again, we'll be able to tuck in pieces along the way and in a very analogous way to the solid waste and recycling space of getting great post closure synergies on those deals as we pulled those right in. Walter Spracklin : Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the time as always. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong quarter. I'm wondering if you just talk about, as we think about the pieces for 2023, you alluded the top line. Can you just talk about the tailwinds that you folks are going to have from your investments in landfill gas and in the -- more facilities. How many facilities do we have coming online over the next 12 months as we just layer on additional tailwinds to the business as we think about what 2023 might look like at this point? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, Jerry, specifically around some of the landfill gas projects and Polymer centres and things of that nature. Anything that's going to come online is really going to be in the latter part of 2023. So the contribution to 2023 is pretty limited with respect to those projects. Now, obviously, setting up 2024 and beyond, right, that's where it starts to get more exciting with respect to those investments. Really next year is more about pricing in excess of cost inflation, the realization of the synergies with US Ecology deal. Jerry Revich : And on that note, obviously, really strong margin performance this year, but given the high inflationary environment overall, it certainly limits. How aggressive we can get on pricing ahead of cost? What's the opportunity to make up for that next year, as hopefully, inflation slows from high singles to mid singles? Could we see a 60, 70, 80 basis point margin expansion versus half that you would typically target? Brian DelGhiaccio : I think the thing you have to remember, Jerry, is that on that restricted portion of our business and those indices that those contracts are tied to, they tend to lag. So again, when you take a look at what we're doing with the inflationary environment that we're experiencing today, and we're seeing that across our book, and we're able to drive underlying margin expansion this year, as we start to get those relatively higher price increases next year, we think that actually sets us up very well for continued margin expansion into 2023. Jerry Revich : So just to be clear, it doesn't sound like we should be thinking about commercial and industrial lines of business, pricing slowing significantly. So, we're just going to get the additional kicker from the restricted business kicking in and continued level of pricing that we've seen in C&I this year. Is that right? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. The only the only caveat, I'd say is, I mean, the labor market remains constrained. And we do see some signs of that easing, right? And I would hope that that would continue to ease throughout the year, and create the opportunity in the next year, but we will do whatever. We want to run this business forever. So we'll do whatever we need to do to retain our people. So the level of margin expansion that we have in 2023 will be predicated on exactly how tight the labor market is and what we need to do with wages. Jerry Revich : Super. Appreciate the discussion. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : Hey, good afternoon. My first question is just around the restricted book. And then also as part of that just cost inflation. So, when you look at your cost buckets, do you sort of believe its -- most of those buckets have peaked, labor included? And then as part of that, when you look at your restricted book, how much of that book is on indices that are not CPI? And when they reset, do they kind of cover cost inflation that you're seeing? I know they lag. Or does it not even matter, because the open market is so strong that it will help you recover whatever you're not currently? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Let me start on the wage piece. So we're -- listen, we're seeing inflation right in the high fours. And we feel good about that number in part, because going into this high inflationary period, we thought we had a very healthy cost structure. Healthy meaning not too high, but also not too low, right. Our team does a really good job of understanding local market dynamics. And we want to be the employer of choice in those markets. Now, obviously, we've had to take up, put wages into the market this year beyond our initial plan, just given the dynamic environment. And I would say, listen, we see that certainly flattening, and kind of ending the year into the high fours on that front. Assuming that inflation comes down, if that will start to modulate as we go forward. So I think we are past the peak of this thing with the caveat of we're living in uncertain environment. So Hamzah, within that 50% book that has a contractual pricing restriction, 34% of those are directly linked to CPI, 18% are some form of alternative index. So I think just over 50% has some inflationary component baked into it. And then the other 48% is some other pricing mechanism. So it could be a fixed rate. It could be a rate review or cost plus contract, but that's basically the composition of that 50% of our book. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. And just my follow-up question. On US Ecology, you mentioned early signs of cross selling. Could you just remind us what you sized up revenue synergies at? And at the same time, is the sales cycle different than solid waste? Or just maybe -- maybe just give us some examples of the early success of cross selling? Thank you. Brian DelGhiaccio : Sure. We value the deal, obviously, based on the standalone intrinsic value, plus $40 million of cost synergies. That being said, we think they're the revenue synergies over time will outpace that. Part of that is on the revenue synergies. So we've said, $75 million to $100 million of cross sell realized over three years. We've already gotten 15 of that. So very good early momentum on that front. And it's cutting both ways. Customers that US Ecology have that we're bringing in our services. But even more so customers that we have, we're now selling a broader set of services too. So we're in early days on that. We haven't really done a full rollout across all on our sales teams. So very excited about the momentum to hit that number. And then on pricing, we believe these are scarce assets. And again, you need to price to be able to reinvest in these assets over time and grow. And so, we put out a double digit price increase earlier this week that will go into effect in early September into the marketplace, because it's imperative that we do that. It's inflationary environment, right? We're going to reinvest in the business, and we're going to expand these margins over time. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Thank you all. So many things to think about and choose from. So, I'm going to pick free cash flow. If the old midpoint $2.65 billion, you subtract $130 million for more CapEx. That means there's about $193 million of upside from performance between solid waste and environmental services. Can you split between them where that came from? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. That's all solid waste, Michael. Michael Hoffman : All solid waste. Okay. So that's just shows just how dramatic the leverage of this price has been to convert that into cash. That's the other observation. Brian DelGhiaccio : Agree. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Margins. So the US Ecology margins or the ES margins, which is basically mostly US Ecology, were came out better than if you were looking at old models for that business coming into 2Q. How much of that is -- it was a really good market for those kinds of services, and everybody had a really good quarter, all the peers versus anything that you all did do affect change? And then how do I look at your combined margin of 29.3% [ph], and convert that into what's the dollars of EBITDA? Brian DelGhiaccio : Well, let me start with the latter part first, when you want to talk about the dollars of EBITDA. So we talked for the full year, or I'm sorry, in the second half of increasing EBITDA 5% to 5.5% over our first half performance. So, I think first half was a $1.913 billion. Second half, that would imply $2 billion to $2.20 billion for a full year 3.91 to 3.93. So, when you take a look at that 5% to 5.5% sequential growth, of 3.5% of that is just the additional amount from US Ecology just for having that for longer in that period of time. And then the rest of the business 1.5% to 2%. When you think about that 1.5% to 2% on a like-for-like basis, that's relatively consistent what would we see in a normal year. And then, on your margin questions. So when you take a look at the 17.1% for the environmental solutions business, that's -- again, I would say there wasn't much that that we were able to affect in that period of time, it's only two months. So most of the synergy capture that we expect, the cross selling opportunities that Jon mentioned, and then again, the pricing opportunities, that's more on the come. So again, I would say that was more just the strength in the business from US Ecology, which could also be just reflective of strength in the industrial market. Michael Hoffman : It was very good. We crossed their peer group. So it doesn't surprise me. It was good. I just was wondering how much you were able to influence already. Okay, thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks, Michael. Operator : The next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I might have missed it. But just the updated yield and volume guidance for 2022, seems like both are going up here? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So, we expect that with the -- the 5%, that we just reported here in the second quarter, we would expect, as we talked about that to accelerate in the second half of the year for the reasons we discussed, so we expect to stay over 5% for the balance of the year. So, full year that would average to right around 5% on a full year basis for average yield. And right now, when we take a look at volume, we're expecting that to be at the high end of our original guidance range. So right around 2%. Sean Eastman : Okay. Got it. Very helpful. And updated margin guidance, 29.3%. I believe it was 30.3% to 30.4% before. I think Ecol was supposed to be 70 basis points of that gap. Is that what it ended up being in there? And that leaves maybe 35 basis points of fuel. But I assume fuel was actually more than that. And you're actually covering a lot of what the incremental fuel drag was with price. So if we could just flush that out, that'd be helpful? Brian DelGhiaccio : Sure. Yes. You actually had a couple of those numbers there. So US Ecology is 70 basis points, 70 basis point drag from our original expectations. Net fuel is actually 50 basis points worse than we originally thought. We actually have 120 basis point drag between the two. And we're making that up with the rest of the business to get to that 29.3 for the year. Sean Eastman : Got it. Nice work. Thanks for the help. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Calleja with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Calleja : Yes, thanks, guys. Just when we think about the acceleration that you mentioned, the back half with the yield, obviously, you call -- can you help us find just like the rollover of what that would look like for 2023 just based on really where we're exiting the year at and what we see with US Ecol after two months? Brian DelGhiaccio : Are you talking about just overall revenue? Or are you just talking about specifically around yield? Michael Calleja : Both, if you could, just because of the core price as you accelerate, I mean, you putting these price increases through this year. So there must be some rollover benefit just by even not even increasing next year, just by run rating on the end of this year. And also for U.S. Ecol, I'm curious if there's any change in terms of the 12-month impact that we were thinking of when you originally guided? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Just a couple of things I want to clarify. So, when we're talking about core price and yield, that is on the solid waste business. That's what's included in those numbers. I want to point that out, because any change in environmental solutions revenue, whether it be price or volume is on a single line item when we sit there and reconcile the change in revenue. So, as we're talking about 5% yield, as you think about the sequential improvement from the CPI-linked contracts, we think to the second half of the year, that's probably about a 20 basis point increase or so in yield second half versus our second quarter performance, within a further step up, probably somewhere in that kind of mid fives as we sit there and look at 2023 [ph] today. Michael Calleja : Got it. And Brian and Jon, I'm curious, if we look back at your historical peak margin of 31% EBITDA range in 2010, 2011. I know one main factors, why margins were below that over the last decade was the low CPI. So, as we move into a CPI range of 3%, let's say, in a multi year basis, which was consistent with prior cycles, how different is the business setup today in terms of streamline operations, routing, costs, like how different is this business today with for a CPI 3%, 3.5%, long term compared to where we were in prior cycles? Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Stronger on both fronts. We're certainly stronger on the customer side, which leads to revenue on all fronts. It's a healthier customer mix. Again, I don't think that we talk enough about the economics of loyalty in this business. Every revenue dollars equals. Some customers are willing to stay with you longer. That's why core price is interesting, but yield becomes the ultimate pricing metric. And that's the one that really connects to the P&L, because it factors in the customer that you gain and lose. And you gain and lose those customers at very different rates with the same cost structure. So, yield becomes very important. So we've got the healthier customer base. We've got better tools, right and better technology that help us work with our local teams and price vary dynamically across all of our 300 plus market, so we feel better about that. And then we're more efficient. The rise of digital platform has been a big game changer for us. We've taken out $40 million of cost. And we think over the next 18 to 24 months, we got another $60 million to take out just in terms of driving efficiency and getting the same amount of work done in a shorter period of time. And so, where CPI goes? Listen, we've lived in all kinds of different environments here. I can tell you, it'd be really low, right. Doesn't work very well for the industry. And we've seen that period. The current number obviously isn't great either. Even though the results are good, we're out of balance as an economy, right with labor constraints and an unsustainable way where it's impacting consumer spending everything else. So modulating something into a 2%, 3%, 4%, I think you're going to find very healthy dynamics for our business, and really good performance. Michael Calleja : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Jon Vander Ark : Hi, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey, Brian. So I just want to clarify and be clear on modeling question here. But what is the expected revenue contribution in 2022 from M&A based on the guide? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So if you take a look at the total contribution from acquisitions, it's a 9.3%. Or that which is close, has close and that includes US Ecology. If you were to exclude US Ecology, that would be about 300 basis points. Tyler Brown : Okay. And then is there -- you mentioned a benefit in a rollover in 2023. Can you decide based on what's closed, what rolls over? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So including US Ecology that would also be about 300 basis points. Or, again, US Ecology plus deals close today. Tyler Brown : Yes. Okay. And then going back to the prior question, did you say that you think your restricted book will be up circa mid 5% next year? Brian DelGhiaccio : So overall, and we kind of talked about the cadence of average yield. And so, again, with a with a 5%, average yield than the second quarter, we see second half improving 15 to 20 basis points compared to our second quarter performance. And then as we look forward to 2023, again, assuming that things stay relatively stable on the open market portion of our business, that's where we think of average yield right now in kind of that mid 5%. overall Tyler Brown : Yield. Okay, that helps. You talked about just over $3.9 billion in EBITDA for this year. If I do that calculation, it kind of implies, call it a 43% to 44% free cash conversion. I think last quarter, you reendorsed that 47% for 2024. So, can you kind of build that bridge that three to 400 basis point uplift and conversion. I mean, is that lower leverage? Is that a better closure, post closure, cash taxes, CapEx. Just how do we get there? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. A majority of that would be as we revert to that three times leverage, right, so we're going to reduce the interest expense. At the same time though capturing the synergies, that's all going to be a creative to both EBITDA margin as well as to free cash flow conversion. So, the combination really of the US Ecology integration, the reduction in interest expense over time, is that line of sight to that 47% free cash flow conversion. Tyler Brown : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I think we're 100 days in on US Ecology. Any high level thoughts about portfolio rationalization. Do all the lines make sense? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. So there's a couple of things that are a strategic review, right. And we'll announce those when we've taken a decision on those items. The vast majority of what we bought, we like, and we're going to keep and operate. And there's a couple of things that we're taking a look at that might not be the best fit, somebody else might be the natural owner. Tyler Brown : Okay. Last one, I promise. And it's a bit of a strange question. But is there an extra workday in Q3, because of how 4th of July fell? Brian DelGhiaccio : I think Q3 is relatively flat year-over-year. Q4, there might be a quarter of a difference. Tyler Brown : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Stephanie Yee : Hi, good afternoon. I want to ask about how you're thinking about capital allocation in terms of debt repayment versus acquisitions. Is the leverage ratio coming down really just coming from EBITDA going up? Or are you planning to repay debt? And also how are you thinking about share repurchases? Brian DelGhiaccio : I would say that on the reverting the three times leverage is most likely a combination of both. So again, the debt that we assumed as a result of the US Ecology acquisition, paying down probably not all of it, but a portion of that, as well as just the growth in the underlying EBITDA dollars is certainly going to help the leverage calculation, but think of it as a combo of both. Stephanie Yee : Okay. Brian DelGhiaccio : Go ahead, if you just have a follow up question. Stephanie Yee : Oh, sorry. I just going to -- I think you're going to comment on the share repurchases. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. As far as share repurchases. So, we were a buyer in the first quarter. We said that we are going to prioritize at this point the debt repayment, relatively short term outlook on that as far as 12 months or less. But we always remain opportunistic on repurchasing shares, and we will continue to do so. Stephanie Yee : Okay. And if I can just ask one more question. I know you provided that free cash flow conversion target in 2024. You did really outright state and adjusted EBITDA margin target. But if we add in kind of the $40 million of cost synergies, are we looking at total company EBITDA margin kind of getting close to or above 30% over that same timeframe? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. And I think that that's a realistic goal for us as we think about just through the cycle, being able to expand the EBITDA margin 30 to 50 basis points per year. So over that two-year periods you can see that that 30% is a realistic target. Stephanie Yee : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks for taking the questions. First one is sort of guidance, housekeeping item. Does guidance contemplate the reinstatement of the CNG tax credit? And if you're not including it, what if that were to be renewed with the contribution be incremental in terms of EBITDA? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. No, we did not include that in the guide. We're going to wait until that's actually law at this point. For us, that's about a $15 million annual impact if it were to be fully reinstated. Noah Kaye : Okay, great. And then, you mentioned pricings exceeding internal cost inflation. Just looking at some of these cost line items. I mean, you're getting leverage in labor, in maintenance and repairs. I wonder if you could give us some color on how you're seeing the rate of internal cost inflation from 1Q to now 2Q and where do you think it goes in the back half of the year? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We certainly, we come out with a annual wage increase in the first part of the year, obviously, for people. And as the market -- inflation has persisted and these markets have remained challenge, we've been going into select markets and putting in additional wages where we need to. And, again, we'll do whatever we need to do to retain our people who run the business forever, not for the quarter, not for the year on that front. So, that's certainly gone up from the first quarter, the second quarter. We now see kind of what we're doing with that flat lining throughout the rest of the year, kind of ending the -- end of the year with wage inflation in the high fours. Noah Kaye : Good. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Betsy. We are proud of our second quarter performance. We continue to manage the business to create long term value for all stakeholders. I would like to thank our 39,000 employees for their continued hard work and commitment to provide our customers with first-class service to create a more sustainable world. Have a good evening and be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our strong results in the third quarter demonstrate our ability to profitably grow the business and effectively manage our cost structure even with increased volatility in the broader marketplace. Cost pressures remain elevated and more persistent than we originally anticipated. In the face of those cost headwinds, we are leveraging our tools and technology to price ahead of cost inflation and drive margin expansion in the underlying business. From our perspective, customer demand remains strong and supportive of continued volume growth. The sound fundamentals in our business, together with a laser focus on the customer, position us well to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. During the third quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 23%, including over 12% from acquisitions; generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, which is a 20% increase over the prior year; and produced more than $1.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, a 23% increase over the prior year. We remain confident that investing in value-creating acquisitions is the highest and best use of our cash flow. Year-to-date, we invested $2.6 billion of acquisitions, which includes the acquisition of US Ecology. The integration of US Ecology is progressing as planned and we remain confident that we will achieve at least $40 million of cost synergies. Our initial pricing actions have been successful. We will continue to increase prices to ensure that all stages of the value chain earn an appropriate return. We are also gaining traction cross-selling our products and services, achieving over $25 million in new sales to-date. Apart from US Ecology, we have invested over $400 million of acquisitions this year. Substantially, all of these deals are in the recycling and solid waste space. Our robust acquisition pipeline continues to support outsized levels of activity over the coming years. Year-to-date, we returned $640 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest for the future and advance our strategic initiatives to build distinctive capabilities in customers yield, digital and sustainability. With respect to customers yield, we delivered organic volume growth of 2.2% during the third quarter. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. We also demonstrated our ongoing ability to price in excess of underlying cost inflation. Floor price increased to 6.9% and average yield increased to 5.6%. This is the highest level of pricing in company history. Moving on to our digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools and improve the experience for both customers and employees. Our proprietary RISE tablets have been fully deployed across our large and small container route and deployment to residential route is 26% complete. The remaining residential routes are on track for completion by mid-2023. We have also launched Track My Truck. This technology connects the customer to their large and small container truck utilizing a GPS-enabled RISE tablet. This is a major milestone that serves as a foundation for further digital offerings to our customers. As it relates to sustainability, development of our renewable gas projects remains on track. We expect the first tranche of these projects related to our joint venture to come online beginning in late 2023. We are pleased to work with BP on these RNG projects, who recently announced its intent to acquire Archaea. This provides additional opportunities to work together on decarbonization and environmental services initiatives. Regarding polymer centers, we are accelerating the development of these projects and now expect to invest an additional $40 million of capital this year to start working on future locations. Finally, our company values guide everything we do. I am proud of our recent certification as a Great Place To Work for the sixth consecutive year. This is a significant achievement as employee retention and recruiting remains a top priority in today\u2019s market. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks, Jon. Core price during the third quarter was 6.9%, which included open market pricing of 8.7% and restricted pricing of 4%. The components of core price included small container of 10.7%, large container of 7.6% and residential of 6.7%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.6%, an increase of 60 basis points when compared to our second quarter performance. Average yield on related revenue was 6.3%. The team continues to dynamically adjust price on new and existing business to offset higher levels of inflation in our operating costs and capital expenditures. Third quarter volume increased 2.2%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 2.3%, an increase in large container of 1.7% and an increase in landfill of 6.8%. Our customer retention rate remained strong at over 94%. Moving on to recycling, commodity prices were $162 per ton in the quarter. This compares to $230 per ton in the prior year. Recycling, processing and commodity sales were a 130 basis point headwind to internal growth during the quarter. We are now forecasting fourth quarter commodity prices to be approximately $90 per ton. This would result in a full year average commodity price of $165 per ton. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business, third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $343 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 60 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 18.7%, a sequential increase of 160 basis points. This includes our existing operations in the Gulf and Northeast, together with the addition of US Ecology. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 29.2%. This compares to 30.5% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 150 basis point decrease from acquisitions, including 90 basis points related to US Ecology and a 40 basis point headwind from lower commodity prices. These margin headwinds were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase from net fuel and underlying margin expansion of 50 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the Recycling and Solid Waste business was 30.5%. SG&A expenses, excluding transaction costs from US Ecology, were 9.8% of revenue. This is a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year and reflects continued cost management as we grow the business. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.67 billion, an increase of $309 million or 23% compared to the prior year. This was driven almost exclusively by EBITDA growth in the business. Similar to prior years, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year CapEx and cash taxes during the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, net capital expenditures of $808 million represents a little more than half of our projected full year spend. And year-to-date, adjusted cash taxes of $115 million represents 50% of our projected full year spend. Total debt was $11.8 billion and total liquidity was $1.9 billion. Variable interest rates on our debt increased 1% during the third quarter and an additional 50 basis points in October. As a reminder, a 1% increase in interest rates results in $36 million of additional annual interest expense. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.2x. We expect to revert to 3x leverage by mid-2023. With respect to taxes. Our combined tax rate and non-cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.1% during the third quarter and 24.8% on a year-to-date basis. We expect an equivalent tax impact in a range of 28% to 29% in the fourth quarter and an equivalent tax impact of just under 26% for the year. I will now turn the call back over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : We are proud of the results we delivered during the third quarter, which exceeded our expectations. Stronger contribution from price more than offset persistent cost inflation, which we have seen stabilized, but not retreat from elevated levels. That said we remain comfortable with our full year financial guidance we provided in July even with the recent drop in recycled commodity prices and increase in interest rate. Looking forward to 2023, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Recent decreases in recycled commodity prices, increased interest rates and rising fuel costs will have a direct impact on our business. While these headwinds may modulate our performance expectations, we remain confident in our ability to price ahead of cost inflation. We still expect to deliver above-average levels of growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We plan to provide detailed 2023 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon guys. Hey, Jon, I just wanted to start on US Ecology, curious how things are progressing there. It sounds like your September price type stuff. But can you just talk about how that action was received in the market and did that cover both disposal and field services? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Integration broadly is going well. I am really happy with what we purchased in terms of certainly the asset quality and also the people and culture and capabilities. And we are able to do a lot of the integration planning work ahead of the close so that we have got a team that\u2019s hit the ground running and I think the results are certainly showing that. Yes, we did put in the pricing action that was on the disposal side of the business, where we start there. We have certainly taken some more tactical pricing actions on the field services side and we have seen no degradation in volume from that. So, the market has been very receptive to that. I think it fulfills our thesis that these assets and services have a lot of value to customers. And if you provide great work, they are willing to certainly pay a fair price and we will be continuing with pricing actions into 2023 and beyond to make sure that we are getting positive returns in every stage of the value chain. Tyler Brown : Okay, good deal. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the pricing side, obviously, another good print, but I am curious about a couple of things. Number one, do you think that the 6.9% that you posted this quarter could be the high watermark? As we look to \u201823, what do you think that 50% of the book that\u2019s restricted? What do you think that you will see on pricing in that piece as we look to \u201823? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. I think the \u2013 we will get a little momentum here in the second half \u2013 on our ship side in the first half of next year, that will be 4.5% or north of 4.5%, we think, just based on the roll through of where the all the different indices that we have at this point start to hit. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. And Tyler, just to put that into context, in the third quarter, the restricted pricing was 4% and in Q2, that number was 35%. So, you can see the nice acceleration as we move forward. Tyler Brown : Yes, perfect. Okay. And then last one, just on the acquisition drag, I think, Brian, did you say 150 basis points, why was that so big? Brian DelGhiaccio : Well, you have the combination of US Ecology was $90 million of the $150 million. We also have some of the environmental solutions transactions that we did late Q3 of last year. So, most of that, the other $60 million, starts anniversarying in the fourth quarter. Tyler Brown : Okay. Alright, perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. First, I wanted to ask about the strong volume that we have been seeing this year. I wanted to ask about your view on the sustainability of that. I think it\u2019s been progressively maybe coming down, but I think overall fairly good. So I just wanted to ask about that? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Volume remains strong certainly in our recurring side of the business, but also in the places that are more transactional like special waste and temporary large container. We are still supply-constrained there and that\u2019s still broad-based. Now as we think into next year, right, we are planning on those growth rates modulating a bit just because we are reading the same things you all are around some economic pullback. But frankly, I would have expected to see some of that already. We remain very, very positive in that volume environment right now. Brian DelGhiaccio : And all the demand signals that we watch as far as new business, new business and the small container business continues to exceed lost business and service increases are exceeding service decreases. So the demand is definitely there. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And on the OCC, I know you mentioned the expectation for, I should say, commodity basket, you mentioned the $90 a ton for 4Q. Is the sensitivity that you give in the filings, the $10 million impact to revenue and profitability for $10 a ton, is that fair \u2013 like is that going to still hold for this or is there a sensitivity on certain levels of where it is? And also, if you could help us think about the main components within the basket? Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. No, that sensitivity will hold, right? So right now, if we were to sit there and look at $90 a ton, if that held true for all of \u201823 compared to the $165 average that we\u2019re projecting for \u201822, that would be a decrease of about $75 million of both revenue and EBITDA on the commodity line item. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks for taking the question. Can I follow-up on that one. So the $75 million theoretically of revenue flowing right to EBITDA on the commodity line item, can you talk about offsets to that in terms of processing fees or other structures you have? I know you\u2019ve done a lot of work to delink the commodity exposure. So any clarification you can provide there would be helpful. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. No, that\u2019s a net number. So if you remember, if you go back and look at our filings a couple of years ago, the sensitivity to a $10 change was $20 million. So we\u2019ve cut that in half, and that\u2019s by being able to go in and actually share, right, in that volatility with the customer. So that\u2019s where you really see that change. When we talk about that $10 equaling about $10 million worth of EBITDA, that is a net number. Noah Kaye : $10 million of EBITDA, but not $10 million of revenue? Just to clarify. Brian DelGhiaccio : It\u2019s both. It\u2019s $10 million of revenue and EBITDA. Because again, if you think about what we did is that when we actually went in and changed the structure of the recycling contract, we basically just put that into the base rate. So that\u2019s how we actually wound up offsetting some of that volatility. So that\u2019s why when you look at the sensitivity now, it\u2019s the $10 change is $10 million to both revenue and EBITDA because just isolating the commodity impact, the service fee that we\u2019re charging to either actually the process the material or to collect that material is going to stay unchanged regardless of what the commodity price is. Noah Kaye : Yes. Very helpful. There is been some discussion of \u2013 you mentioned interest expense looking at next year, but also bonus depreciation stepping down. Can you talk about that? And any other puts and takes you think about for free cash flow conversion as we look to next year? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Look, if you \u2013 just from an interest expense perspective, if you take a look at year-over-year, and if this is assuming a 125 basis-point hike in the fourth quarter, that would be about a $70 million increase to interest expense year-over-year, which, in isolation, it\u2019s about a 100 basis-point headwind to free cash flow conversion. That said, though, we had a plan that called for pricing in excess of cost inflation and to drive very strong growth. So even though these are some new headwinds that are presenting into our plan for next year, we still expect very strong growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Noah Kaye : Yes. I mean in reiterating, I just want to make this point right and please nuance as it makes sense. But in saying you\u2019re comfortable with this year\u2019s guidance and point to above average growth for next year, I mean it\u2019s really pricing and operating leverage in solid waste that\u2019s making up some of these headwinds, if you will. And I just want to get your view on whether or not there is incremental pricing that you can put through looking at \u201823 to shore up some of those gaps. Jon Vander Ark : Well, I\u2019d also say it\u2019s also growth and margin expansion in Environmental Solutions. Nothing offset it, right? We\u2019ve got plans there to continue to cross-sell continue to price, right, and drive our cost synergy numbers there. So you\u2019ll see nice margin expansion in that part of the business as well. We\u2019re committed to price ahead of cost inflation under almost any steady scenario, obviously, right, in a black sponsor area, where we get into crazy levels of interest rates, right? We will come back and talk then. But we\u2019ve been in a pretty high interest rate environment and lower interest rate environment, and we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of \u2013 in both scenarios or both cases, pricing ahead of cost inflation. And we\u2019re doing that playing a long game, right? We have customers. This is a loyalty business. So we\u2019re always going to do things that maximize the lifetime value of the business and, therefore, drive intrinsic value versus doing anything unnatural in a quarter that might drive short-term results but aren\u2019t really good for the shareholders longer-term. Noah Kaye : Appreciate all the color. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Chang of CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chang : Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on the comments you made on the small container yield improvement, continues to be outsized well \u2013 I, mean, you\u2019re going to get good pricing everywhere, but especially seems continue to be outsized. Just can you just explain to me why that is \u2013 why are you seeing even stronger pricing of small container relative to your other... Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I think it\u2019s a combination of things, Kevin. I think it\u2019s certainly customer mix. We want to be with customers who are willing to pay more. We\u2019ve got pretty sophisticated tools in our sales and marketing teams to identify those customers and present them with an offering where they are willing to pay more. More transactional parts of the business, for example, brokers, we just pushed that out of our portfolio because they are renters. For renting, those customers, they are not going to be with us for a long time. And so the mix certainly helps us. And then the offering we put in front of customers in terms of digital tools, the sophistication of our pricing that allows us to give very targeted pricing to a customer and understanding billings to pay. All of those things drive yield, which is the ultimate pricing metric. Core price is a means to an end. The ultimate metric which ties to the P&L and margin expansion is yield. Kevin Chang : Okay. No, no, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just my second one, the 160-basis-point sequential improvement in EBITDA margin in Environmental Solutions. You talked about some of the early wins in terms of pricing and cross-selling and cost-cutting. Just as you think about that 160, like is there a bucket that primarily drove that? Would it be primarily the cost-cutting and then build off of business, some of the other synergies roll through or was it kind of a mix of things that drove that 160? Jon Vander Ark : No, it\u2019s a mix of things. All have contributed and that really that balanced approach is what we look for going forward as we look to take a business, again. That was in the mid- to high teens. And over a longer period of time, we think there is no reason that business can\u2019t be in the mid to high 20s, right? That\u2019s where over a period of years, we think we can take the business. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, remember, too, there is obviously seasonality in that business, just like there is in the recycling and solid waste business, and so Q3 seasonally tends to be that highest quarter. So I think as we get more quarters as well, you\u2019ll start to see the growth year-over-year. But I think you\u2019re definitely going to see as, Jon mentioned. You\u2019re going to see a combination of pricing actions. You\u2019re going to see some of the cost takeout that we\u2019ve done as we realize some of the and benefit from some of the cross-selling. Kevin Chang : Thank you for taking my question and congrats with the good results here. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : So I went back here as fast as I could do this while we\u2019re on the call. I think for 10 years, you all have given some kind of indication of what the next year is going to be in the third quarter. So this is like the first time you\u2019re not in 10 years and yet \u2013 then you say sales EBITDA and free cash flow will be up. So can you help us a little bit on how to understand what\u2019s the messaging? What\u2019s that mean, up a little, up a lot, up like \u2013 how do we make sure we get the right place to land on \u201823? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We had talked about last quarter, we thought we\u2019d potentially a line of sight to double-digit revenue growth, right? We\u2019re probably off that a little bit in terms of what our expectations are for a couple of reasons. One is commodity price, those coming down. They obviously have a revenue impact and a margin impact. The second is some of the acquisitions that we had hoped to close in the fourth quarter get pushed out. So we feel very confident that those are going to be deals that close, but they are going to roll into the first quarter; in one case, the second quarter, which just pushes the rollover effect of that revenue benefit. And then the market, I think, is getting a little more uncertain, as you see, from a broader macro standpoint. All that being said, Michael, we feel really good about high single-digit revenue growth kind of in line with that EBITDA growth and free cash flow growth. So \u2013 and those, if you think about, to get back to a 10-year period, right, those are certainly above average numbers for the performance in a very challenging environment. So we\u2019re very optimistic about the rate. It\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re not giving some more formal type of indication, if you go back 5 years, it\u2019s a pretty predictable recurring revenue business. So you got a lot of visibility we\u2019re living in very dynamic in different times in terms of what\u2019s happening with interest rates and labor tightness and inflation and all those things. So I think that\u2019s just \u2013 commodity prices. Given all those uncertainties, we thought we\u2019re going to be in a better position 3 months from now to provide more clarity. Michael Hoffman : Fair enough. But at least we\u2019ve got some guardrails we can live in based on what you just shared, so thank you for that. And then you did give us a sense of restricted price first half, 4.5%, but the rate of inflation can be accelerating in the second half. So the assumption would be that restricted price in the second half would be greater than the 4.5% at the current trend hold. Is that the right observation? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. I don\u2019t know that\u2019s going to be significantly different, Michael, throughout the year. I would kind of put again in that 4.5% to 5% range, right, for the full year. Again, we\u2019re exiting Q3 at $4. So you\u2019ll see some acceleration, but I think it will be moderate acceleration throughout the year. Michael Hoffman : And one last thing on price. Is your starting open market price, your exit rate from 4Q? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. For the most part. I mean, look, if you look at where we\u2019re saying right now with a 5.6% average yield on total revenue, call it around 6% on related revenue in total. If you think about the open market portion of that, we would see that participating next year or contributing relatively in line with what we got this year. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then one just tweak as you getting asked about volume. I mean you\u2019re getting \u2013 you\u2019re still seeing your good correlation in household formation, new business formation. You alluded to positive enteric interval changes, new business exceeding loss business, but the rate of change will start to narrow because we were off of a pretty healthy recovery in the second half of \u201821 into the first half of \u201822. So we\u2019re going to start normalizing into a more narrow rate of change, but the trend underlying is still positive. Brian DelGhiaccio : Absolutely, Michael. That\u2019s our expectation when we think about \u201823%, that\u2019s sort of a modular. And we think you start seeing that in the fourth quarter, Michael, and then again, getting to a more normalized level of growth. Michael Hoffman : Great. Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. Thank you for taking my question here. Let me start on the cross-selling opportunities. I think, Jon, you mentioned earlier, $75 million to $100 million eventually. You\u2019re at the $25 million mark now. Are you still on track from a timing perspective and achieving that full run rate of cross-selling? Or if it\u2019s changed, can you comment on that? Has it been pulled forward or push back at all and why? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We said we\u2019d achieve that by 2024. That\u2019s the time frame that we said, could be at \u201825 already given that we\u2019re still working through some integration, rolling this thing out. We have not touched many of our customers yet. We\u2019re really, really pleased about our progress, and I would say quite optimistic about hitting both the level and the timing of that. Walter Spracklin : Perfect, perfect. On the OCC prices, your peer yesterday or earlier mentioned that your contracts or their contracts are structured so that the further OCC goes down, the negative impact that sensitivity that you highlighted kind of contracts, the lower OCC goes. I just want to make sure, are your contracts designed similarly that, that plays out in your contracts as well so that it\u2019s not as strict? You mentioned $10. But does that $10 contract when OCC prices go down \u2013 the further that OCC prices go down? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. And that\u2019s what \u2013 in the guidance itself and that we put out there, I would sit there and say, on the way up and the way down, that $10 equating to $10 million of revenue and both EBITDA is good sensitivity to use from a modeling perspective. So again, the type of work that you\u2019re doing can dictate that, whether or not you\u2019re brokering or that sort of thing, those sort of things can be different company to company, but that\u2019s our sensitivity. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And last question here is you mentioned BP\u2019s purchase of Archaea there that you\u2019re optimistic working with them and all that. Anything that you can add? Have you spoken to the folks at BP at all? What kind of new ways would you look at partnering with them? Or is it just what you had before is pretty much what you have now and expect to have going forward? Or is there something additional now that you have a new owner? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. yes, we\u2019re talking at many levels, including talking to their CEO. They have to probably tick up big, bold, ambitious plans around sustainability and decarbonization, and we think there is a number of ways that can work together. Certainly, in the core JV itself, and they are fully committed to that, and we\u2019re getting the best of both worlds because the colleagues from Archaea that they are going to acquire are going to stay. So we feel really excited about that team, but bringing more resources to bear that will certainly help us hit our marks and maybe move a little faster on that front. And then they have a big business. So they have got a big Environmental Services business. So there is ways to partner together there. They have a major network of gas stations, and gas station is actually a major plays that plastic leak out of the value chain and don\u2019t get recycled. So there is ways to pilot and innovate there. And we\u2019ve done nothing formal together on those fronts yet, obviously, but have like-minded ambitions in terms of making the world more environmentally-sustainable and doing that in a way that drives growth for our shareholders as well. Walter Spracklin : Yes. So it\u2019s an opportunity to get creative and advance that initiative. That\u2019s great. Okay. I appreciate the time. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Hi, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about, for the recycling line of business at the commodity price that you mentioned for the fourth quarter, do you anticipate the business being in a net profit position? Can you just comment on that? And then nice to hear about the reiteration of guidance despite that headwind of $20 million, $30 million from recycling. Can you just talk about what part of the guidance has evolved ahead of expectations? It sounds like it might be yield, but I would love it if you could flesh that out. Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So just your first question there at the $90 commodity price, yes, that portion of the business would remain profitable at that level. And then the second part, when you talk about the evolving guide, you\u2019re talking about with respect to \u201822? Jerry Revich : Correct. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So you\u2019re talking about just the puts and takes? Jerry Revich : That\u2019s right. Yes. So it sounds like you\u2019re able to overcome the recycling headwinds. It feels like yield has accelerated at our expectations, but I\u2019m wondering if I could just get you to expand on that. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, better overall yield, better volume performance as we were able to overcome the commodity headwind as well as the higher interest rates in the third quarter. As we now look in the fourth quarter though the big drop really happened recently, so September into October. So again, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve maintained the guide because the outperformance from Q3 is basically funding what we expect now for Q4, and we feel pretty good about the full year guide. Jerry Revich : And then conceptually, as you think about pricing for the long-term into \u201823, obviously, you don\u2019t want to drive churn. But it sounds like based on your prior comments that we are going to think about pushing pricing in municipal solid waste to essentially fund the recycling headwind, is what I think I am hearing from you. But can I trouble you to put a finer point on that, please? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We think we are always going to try to price ahead of our cost inflation, Jerry. And obviously, demise our headwind on that front. But we don\u2019t think about it is because now there is a short-term headwind that we are going to go out and go put a bunch of price in the market that we could be destructive from a long-term value creation with our customers on that front. So, we feel good, like I said, into \u201823, that even with these headwinds that we are going to have high-single digit growth on revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Just given that we are overcoming that commodity headwind, I think speaks to the strength of the business. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. I mean we talked about the fact that we have seen elevated cost inflation in the business. We see that rolling into \u201823. And right now, we are making our plan is if that cost inflation stays in the business for the full year. So that\u2019s where the pricing ahead of cost inflation that\u2019s where that comment is. Now look, if inflation is lower than we think or it starts to abate, then that could be some upside to our current plan, but that\u2019s not how we are going into it. So, we do \u2013 versus our original expectations, we do expect the impact of both lower recycled commodity prices and higher interest rates have an impact on where we thought we were headed as of nine days ago. But as we just kind of talked about with Michael, we still think the outcome is going to be very strong, especially in the context when you look at an average growth rate and revenue, EBITDA, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion. We think they are all very strong metrics, all growing. Jerry Revich : Super. And lastly, I am wondering, can you just talk about the evolution for off-take agreements in landfill gas in addition to capital deployed by BP. Kinder Morgan has obviously bought some assets as well. Can you just provide an update on off-take agreement visibility? It sounded like the market was moving into the 20s per MMBtu on a multiyear basis. I am not sure if you feel comfortable commenting on that. And how the shape of the market has evolved since the last public update a quarter ago? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : No, we are still on track and still the same view that we are going to fix a portion of this and play spot on the market with the rest of it, which has been probably we think that, that balance between maximizing returns as well as predictability over the cycle and managing risk on that. Certainly have alignment with BP on that same philosophy on the back end of these facilities. Jerry Revich : Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi team. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to come back to the comment about the \u2013 a couple of those acquisitions that slid to the right a little bit. I am curious, could you help us with the annualized revenue associated with those? I think we have got 300 basis points kind of locked for rollover with ECOL, but just trying to flesh out what that number could ultimately look like. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. From a rollover perspective right now, that\u2019s what we are planning is that the 300 basis points of rollover, as Jon mentioned, there were a couple of deals that were in the offer and they still are where we thought they might close in Q4. They are now looking like they could be early to mid \u201823. So, we will keep you updated on that progress. But right now, we are building the plan with 300 basis points of acquisition rollover. Sean Eastman : Okay. Got it. So, you don\u2019t want to give any hints on the magnitude of those acquisitions that are in the hopper? Jon Vander Ark : Well, we will tell you when they are closed. Sean Eastman : Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then I just wanted to make sure I understand the ECOL contribution within that bridge to 2023. Obviously, we get a full year of revenue. But I am just curious how you guys are thinking roughly about the growth rate in ECOL\u2019s top line and I think we have got a lot of different pieces to work with here. But just in terms of where we are going to end up on ECOL margins this year, what you guys think that will be for the full year next year? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So, of that 300 basis points of rollover, call it, $250 million of it is related to U.S. psychology. If you just think about in the context of consolidated company margin, we look at that additional four months of rollover, having about a 30 basis point headwind on total company margin in \u201823. Sean Eastman : Okay. Got it. And does that assume status quo margins for ECOL year-on-year? Brian DelGhiaccio : Slight step-up as we realized a portion of the synergies again. But for the most part, that\u2019s going to be in the ZIP code. Sean Eastman : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question comes from Kyle White of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to pricing. Just curious, are you starting to see any kind of pushback from customers? It seems like everyone six months ago is willing to pay higher prices? And now the environment has changed. Is it somewhat \u2013 so curious how those dialogues have gone? And if you have seen any kind of pushback that you would mention? Jon Vander Ark : No, we are still \u2013 like we said, we put out the highest in our open portion of the business, put up the highest gross price we ever have and have the highest realization rate as the percentage that we ever had, which is an astounding number on that back. So, pricing is certainly sticking at elevated levels. The only place we have got challenges in small micro markets where we have had some challenges with turnover, given labor constraints. Obviously, when you are not providing the service that you want in a given market, right, you are going to cause the customers to reconsider and go elsewhere. And so that\u2019s why we are into, 2023, still planning on relatively elevated inflation levels because we run the business forever. And we want to make sure that we provide customers world-class service, and that will keep them staying and stay longer. Kyle White : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the \u2013 you talked about this a little bit. So, as you think about 2023 in kind of underlying solid waste expansion margins, I think this year, you are probably running about 60 basis points \u2013 50 basis points to 60 basis points. And so if you are pricing at these elevated levels of inflation that you are seeing today and that carries into 2023, would that equate to, again, 50 basis points to 60 basis points with the potential to go even higher if we are in a more moderate inflationary environment next year? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We sat across the cycle, 30 basis points to 50 basis points is what we think about doing in recycling solid waste. And we will do that over time, right, at an elevated level in environmental solutions. Could that creep higher next year if pricing stick and inflation comes down in the back half, it certainly could. We are not expecting that in terms of building a plan around it, but that would cause that gap to widen and allow for a little more margin expansion in the second half and certainly then going into 2024. Kyle White : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead. David Manthey : Yes. Thank you. You previously outlined that your revenues have about a 90% correlation with housing starts on a 1-year lag. Is it correct to say that you believe that this is very strong pricing and maybe some environmental solutions can change that historical correlation? And just either way, as starts have clearly been declining and mortgage rates continue to surge, are there any incremental actions that you are eyeing relative to the back half of next year? Brian DelGhiaccio : Eyeing as far as \u2013 because again, look, that\u2019s been a historical correlation. But again, I think that\u2019s been in a, call it, a relatively stable macro environment. And we are \u2013 we have been in anything, but kind of have these puts and takes with inflation. So, again, at this point, as Jon mentioned, we are going to continue to price in excess of cost inflation. From an overall demand perspective, again, we have actually seen the demand very strong throughout \u201822. We are not really seeing any signs of that abating. So, again, that\u2019s how we are building our plan. Growth levels probably won\u2019t be as strong as they were \u2013 or certainly won\u2019t be as strong as they were in \u201822 just because we were still recovering units from the pandemic, but we still expect underlying unit growth in \u201823 year-over-year. David Manthey : Got it. So, maybe directionally, you still think there is some correlation there, but not necessarily of the magnitude depending on starts, is what I am hearing. Could we talk about the interest rate? You said 1% change in rate is $36 million in interest expense. What was the reference rate in the third quarter from which to build to the fourth quarter in 2023 then? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So, again, right now, what we are expecting is another 125 basis point increase, right, in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s how we built our plan, and then that being relatively stable throughout 2023. If you think about what that means relative to where we were exiting Q3, that\u2019s a good 125 basis points for the \u2013 when we think about where we are in Q4, good 125 basis points from where we were exiting Q2. So, the impact of that as we think about year-over-year is a $70 million increase in total interest expense, which is about a $50 million increase to cash flow once you net out the related taxes. David Manthey : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good afternoon. Jon Vander Ark : Go ahead Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : I wanted to touch on your tech investments and digital tools. I appreciate the update on the RISE platform. It would be helpful if you could share, I don\u2019t know, any KPIs or benefits that you are seeing from the early rollout of those tools on the efficiency side. And as we think to 2023, kind of what\u2019s in the pipeline from the digital tools and some investments that might be in the works? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We have certainly seen over the last 18 months productivity benefit, which allows us to get more work done in the same amount of time with great customer service and doing it safely, primary value for our drivers. So, we \u2013 from a cost standpoint, we think we have taken out almost $50 million at this point. And we think over the next 18 months, we have got another $50 million that we can take out of the business as we get full deployment and full utilization of this. And then when you connect it back to the customer, all that information allows us to communicate with a customer, right, with this Track My Truck we talked about. That allows the customer to see where we are and when the pickup is going to occur. And it not only allows in some cases, them to look for themselves, right, where their vehicle is and when the pickup is coming, but even if they decide to use a different channel and call our customer service center, then we are able to have our agent look up there and give the customer it will be there tomorrow or range, but give them a far more precise time that the truck is on the way and get the customer assured. So, a lot of what we get is that, right. We really run so precise that we are there within a 5-hour, 45-minute window every week or multiple times a week for a customer. And so when we miss that window, even if we are going to be there that day, the customers call and they are concerned. So, this allows us to provide better information take cost out of the system and \u2013 we are not going to talk about those today, but you are going to see more innovation come off that, that make the customer offering differentiated that we think can directly hit the P&L in terms of customers staying longer. Stephanie Moore : Great. Thank you. And then just touching on the M&A side, maybe on the traditional waste, are you seeing any changes in demand or interest levels in this environment? Jon Vander Ark : No, I think the pipeline is certainly strong, and there is significant willingness to sell. We are obviously maintaining a lot of discretion, right. Some companies don\u2019t fit us from a profile standpoint, from a value standpoint. They might not be a good fit for us. So, we remain very discriminating in terms of what we buy. But the pipeline is very, very strong. It\u2019s getting harder to do business. If you think about the digital investments, we just talked about. That\u2019s becoming a second moat. It\u2019s not just the post-collection infrastructure. All of those investments we make are very expensive. They take a lot of time. They take a lot of expertise. So, that makes it tough, or the current labor environment makes it more challenging. The current supply chain being constrained, right, we are only slightly delayed in deliveries of equipment because we are a great customer for our suppliers, right. We buy trucks year-in and year-out, where some of the smaller players will go years about buying and try to buy in the spot market. Well, now they are locked out. Those factories are full, and they are at the end of the line, and so you suffer to get labor. And those people you hire have to drive old equipment that\u2019s in need of repair and/or replacement, right. That\u2019s a big advantage for us to take over those businesses. Stephanie Moore : Understood. Well, thank you so much. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Brian, you guys just did, on a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow of $1.67 billion, really strong. I think your guide is $1.7 billion or so. You might have touched on it earlier. Is there anything I am missing on the fourth quarter that we should be aware of, of why you are not releasing the free cash flow outlook? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So, Mike, I had actually mentioned it in the remarks. So, the CapEx that we spent year-to-date, so through three quarters and the cash interest represents only about half of our expected full year spend. So, in the fourth quarter, we expect a disproportionate amount of both CapEx and cash taxes relative to the average you have seen. So, that\u2019s why you see a relatively modest Q4 contribution and why we have maintained the guide as it is on free cash flow. Some of that, as Jon mentioned, accelerating some of the investments in Polymer Center throughout the year, some of the things we have done in order to fund this outsized growth. But so you can reasonably expect a little bit more CapEx than we originally anticipated, partially being offset by a little bit less cash taxes than we originally anticipated. Michael Feniger : And I guess, Brian, just to follow-up with that and to put a finer point, do you plan to grow your free cash flow next year? Will that growth be in line to EBITDA growth, because obviously, in the context of where you guys are kind of targeting your free cash flow conversion over time. Thank you. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. First question, yes, we definitely expect to grow our free cash flow. And yes, it should be relatively in line with the growth in EBITDA. We would have expected to grow it a little bit more. Obviously, the impact of interest expense and recycled commodity prices impacts that, but we are fully expecting to grow. Michael Feniger : Thank you. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. End of Q&A: Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Andrea. I would like to thank the entire Republic Services team for their efforts and commitment to driving lasting value for all of our stakeholders. Have a good evening, and be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending and you may now disconnect.",

I want to remind you that Republic\u2019s management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Republic team finished the year strong by executing our strategy designed to profitably grow the business. We outpaced expectations throughout the year, delivering results that exceeded our full year guidance, even in the face of increased volatility in the broader marketplace. During 2022, we achieved revenue growth of 20%, including a 10% from acquisitions; delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 16%; generated adjusted earnings per share of $4.93, which is an 18% increase over the prior year; and produced $1.74 billion of adjusted free cash flow, a 15% increase over the prior year. We continue to believe that investing in value-creating acquisitions is the best use of our free cash flow. We invested $2.7 billion in acquisitions in 2022, which includes the acquisition of US Ecology. The integration of US Ecology is going well, with cost synergies tracking ahead of plan. Revenue contribution from US Ecology outperformed our expectations by nearly $50 million for the year, with almost all of the overperformance occurring in the fourth quarter. We continue to adjust prices related to US Ecology and our broader Environmental Solutions business to better align with the capital invested and resources deployed. Pricing actions taken to date have been successful as our customers recognize the high value of service we provide. Additionally, we are building momentum cross-selling our complete set of products and services, with approximately $40 million in new sales to date. Aside from US Ecology, we invested $500 million in value-creating acquisitions during the year. All of these deals were in the recycling and solid waste space. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Regarding Customer Zeal, we continue to enhance our culture of delivering a world-class customer experience to win new business and drive customer loyalty. Our customer retention rate remained strong at 94%, and we exited 2022 with our highest NPS scores of the year. We delivered outsized organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter, with simultaneous growth in both price and volume. Core price on related revenue increased to 8.4% and average yield on related revenue increased to 6.7%. This is the highest level of pricing in company history. Organic volume growth was 1.5%. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. Moving to digital. In early 2022, we implemented the finance and procurement modules of our new ERP system, which streamline back-office activities and provide our local leaders with enhanced data. Currently, we are building our new asset management system, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and drive better warranty recovery. We expect to implement the new asset management system beginning in 2024. We continue to make progress on deploying RISE tablets in our collection business. We finished the implementation for all large container and small container routes during 2022 and completed 37% of residential routes by the end of the year. The remaining residential routes are scheduled to be complete by mid-2023. This is a key component enabling further connectivity with our customers, including real-time service notification. The adoption of RISE has helped drive operational efficiencies and cost savings worth approximately $50 million annually. Sustainability is core to our strategy and one of our differentiating capabilities. We believe Republic Services is in a unique position to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth, while making a positive impact on the environment. For example, our polymer centers are advancing circularity of plastics. This is the first time a single U.S. company will manage the plastic stream from current site collection to delivery of high-quality recycled content for consumer packaging. Development of the first center in Las Vegas is on track and is slated to come online in late 2023. Development of our second polymer center is already underway. This facility will be located in the Midwest and will serve as a hub for aggregating and processing recovered plastics in the region. This center should come online in late 2024. The investments we are making to develop these polymer centers is being absorbed through our normal capital expenditure process. Additionally, the development of our renewable natural gas projects is progressing well. All 57 of these projects are being co-developed with partners, with the majority structured as a joint venture. We expect 4 of these projects to come online by mid-2023. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be a workplace where the best people from all backgrounds come to work. Employee engagement improved to a score of 85, with 97% participation. Turnover rates in the fourth quarter improved to the lowest level we've experienced in nearly two years. As a result, we are better staffed to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the seventh consecutive year. Our 2022 results clearly demonstrate our ability to create sustainable value and strengthens the foundation from which we will continue to grow our business. Looking forward, we expect to deliver high single-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow in 2023, even with the headwinds from lower recycled commodity prices and higher interest rates. More specifically, we expect 2022 revenues in a range of $14.65 billion to $14.8 billion. This represents high single-digit growth compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion. This represents high single-digit to low double-digit growth compared to the prior year. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.15 to $5.23 and generate adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion. Our acquisition pipeline continues to support outsized levels of activity in both Recycling and Solid Waste and Environmental Solutions. We are targeting at least $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in2023. Our 2023 financial guidance includes a rollover contribution from acquisitions that closed in 2022. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter and year. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.4% for the fourth quarter. Core price on related revenue was 8.4%, which included open market pricing of 10.4% and restricted pricing of 5.1%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 11.8%, large container of 8.6%, and residential of 7.8%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.9%. Average yield on related revenue was 6.7%, an increase of 40 basis points when compared to our third quarter performance. In 2023, we expect average yield on total revenue of approximately 5.5%. We expect average yield on related revenue of approximately 6.5%. This is an increase of 80 basis points over our full year 2022 results. Fourth quarter volume increased 1.5%. The components of volume included an increase in small container of 1.6%, an increase in large container of 60 basis points, an increase in residential of 1.2% and an increase in landfill of 3.9%. For 2023, we expect organic volume growth in a range of 50 basis points to 1%. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $88 per ton in the quarter. This compared to $218 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 180 basis points during the quarter. 2022 full year commodity prices were $170 per ton. This compared to $187 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $95 per ton. We believe that current commodity prices are temporarily depressed due to a global supply/demand imbalance and that prices will recover in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we are assuming average recycled commodity prices of $125 per ton in 2023, with prices starting at $95 per ton in the first quarter and steadily increasing throughout the year. At $125 per ton, this would result in a decrease in full year 2023 revenue and EBITDA of $45 million when compared to the prior year and a 30 basis point headwind to EBITDA margin. In the first quarter of 2023, this would result in a year-on-year decrease of nearly $30 million in revenue and EBITDA and a 70 basis point headwind to EBITDA margin. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased approximately $320 million over the prior year, which primarily related to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 60 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.3%. This compares to 28.1% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 130 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which included 100 basis points related to US Ecology, and an 80 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. These margin headwinds were partially offset by a 20 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 110 basis points. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in the Recycling and Solid Waste business was 28.7%. This compares to 28.6% margin in the prior year or 10 basis points of margin expansion. Margins improved in the Recycling and Solid Waste business even with an 80 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. Fourth quarter SG&A expenses, excluding transaction costs from US Ecology, were 10.9% of revenue. This included 40 basis points from additional incentive compensation expense due to full year financial outperformance. Full year SG&A expenses were 10.2% of revenue. This was favorable 20 basis points compared to the prior year and reflects continued cost management as we grow the business. In 2023, we expect EBITDA margin to be approximately 29.2%. The 10 basis points of expected margin expansion include a 40 basis point decline related to acquisitions, primarily related to US Ecology, and a 30 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. These headwinds are more than offset by margin expansion in the underlying business of 80 basis points. While we expect full year expansion compared to the prior year, margins are expected to be down in the first half due to the impact of acquisition rollover and recycled commodity prices. This is most notable in the first quarter where these headwinds impact margin by a combined 210 basis points. Depreciation, amortization and accretion was 10.7% of revenue in 2022 and is expected to be relatively consistent at 10.8% of revenue in 2023. Full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow was $1.74 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business. For 2023, we are projecting adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion or approximately 8% growth at the midpoint. We believe this level of performance is very strong given the expected impact from lower recycled commodity prices, higher interest rates, and higher cash taxes as bonus depreciation begins to unwind. Total debt at the end of the year was $11.9 billion, and total liquidity was $1.7 billion. Floating debt interest rates consistently increased throughout 2022, and we now expect net interest expense of approximately$480 million in 2023. This is an increase of approximately $90 million compared to the prior year. As a reminder, a 1% increase in interest rates results in approximately $33 million of additional interest expense. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was approximately 3.1 times. We expect to revert to three times leverage by mid-2023. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and non-cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.1% during the fourth quarter and 25.1% for the full year. This lower than anticipated tax rate resulted in a $0.06 benefit to our full year 2022 EPS. We expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 26% in 2023, made up of an adjusted effective tax rate of 20% and approximately $170 million of noncash charges from solar investments. Finally, we expect a majority of the EPS growth in 2023 to be back-end loaded. This results from having the toughest prior year comparisons on recycled commodity prices, interest rates, and taxes during the first half of the year. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, guys. Jon Vander Ark : Hey, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Brian, so obviously, pricing really strong here. I think full year pricing in the open market would stay just over 9% in the restricted piece, call it, 4.5%. But I am curious if we were to kind of decompose that next year, how those numbers would look? Will we kind of see a convergence in those two? Or could we actually see the restricted pricing lead with all the CPI lookbacks? Brian DelGhiaccio : No, we would actually expect the restricted pricing to increase from the levels of where it is in the fourth quarter. So, again, on related revenue, it was 5.1% restricted in the fourth quarter. And we would expect that to improve 50 to 100 basis points in 2023. But we do expect the level of pricing to be driven by the open market, similar to what you've seen in 2022 and, for that matter, the prior years as well. Tyler Brown : Yes. Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then on the shape of kind of how the yields will progress, will we have a more, I'm going to call it, historically normal cadence where pricing -- and I'm talking total pricing, say, above 5.5% and then it tapers off below 5.5% as the year finishes out? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Listen, I guess you're talking about then on total revenue, so I'll give you that piece. So, yes, it starts highest -- actually, our high watermark is in the first quarter based on our expectations. And then it sequentially declines from there, but we're expecting that pricing remains above 5% in all quarters. Tyler Brown : Yes. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And just real quick, how much M&A rollover is in the guide? And just to be crystal clear, the $0.5 billion that you expect to spend, none of that is included in guidance. Is that right? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So, I'll answer your second question first. That is correct. We have not included that. So, what is included are deals that closed by the end of the year. It's $440 million worth of revenue or 300 basis points of growth, that's the rollover, and most of that being US Ecology. Tyler Brown : Right, okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks for taking the questions. So, with the US Ecology outperformance of $50 million, can you give us a breakdown of how much of that outperformance was price versus volume? And then maybe you can tell us what you're expecting in terms of ES segment growth specifically for 2023. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, it was a mix of both price and volume, but more pricing to come, right? We've taken a lot of pricing action, but we still have some contracted portion of that business and fully seen that. So, you're seeing both the cross-sell that we talked about, and you're seeing the pricing hit with really strong performance. And the plans for 2023, that business is performing ahead of our plan, more broadly both the US Ecology acquisition and the broader ES space, I think, is going to be a very positive contributor. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So, if you think about -- Noah, I was just going to add. A good portion of the growth, right, that you're going to see year-over-year is coming vis-\u00e0-vis the acquisition rollover. But if you think about total contribution from an organic perspective, right, we're expecting 50 basis points on total revenue. So, that's about, call it, $70 million, and that would be just at the point when US Ecology anniversaries forward. So, that's still kind of a high single-digit type organic growth. Noah Kaye : That's very helpful. Thanks. And then since you mentioned the synergies were tracking ahead of plan, can you quantify that for us? And I guess, any chance you could give us an updated cost synergies number as to where you think this will get to within the timeframe? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So, just to give you an idea, when we actually provided the guidance when we closed the deal, we said we thought we'd get about $5 million worth of synergies in 2022. We actually got closer to $13 million, $14 million. So, you can see nice outperformance there. And a lot of that was just actually getting the integration activities done quicker than we originally anticipated. Jon Vander Ark : And we said total synergies would be $40 million, cost synergy would be $40 million. I think that number wound up closer to $50 million. Noah Kaye : Perfect. I'll give it back. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. Good afternoon everyone. I want to just focus on the M&A there in the $500 million guide. What drives your target for $500 million? Is that on a leverage basis that you'd like to keep yourselves close to? Or is it more just your best guess as to what kind of deals in your -- in the target areas that you want to do are available in 2023? Jon Vander Ark : I'd say it is based on a passionate view about intrinsic value, right, and driving intrinsic value over time and conservatism, right? So, we never want to put out a number that people go and they have to hit, and therefore, we start chasing deals. So, I want the team to feel comfortable at any point in time passing on a given deal because it doesn't mean a return criteria or there's a set of terms or business conditions or practices that we're not going to want to be owners of over time. And so I think we've always put out a number over the last three or four years, I think you've seen a pretty steady beat against that number. My expectations for the team, I think, are slightly higher than that. But we always want, again, put out a conservative numbers the team feels no pressure to reach. Walter Spracklin : And has there been any shift in valuations, be it with higher interest rates, be it with more deals having been done? Is there more difficulty? Is there -- has valuations come off? Has availability changed? In other words, the pipeline that you look at going into 2023, is it very much different than what you saw in 2022, excluding obviously, US Ecology? Jon Vander Ark : No, pipeline is very strong. We've got a mix of small- and medium-sized deals across Recycling and Solid Waste and ES, right, and that's kind of at different stages in the process and feel good about that. The premiums or the multiples are still kind of hanging in the same ZIP Code because we're looking at premium assets. We're not just buying revenue. We're very particular buyers, and we want to get something that's quality. And one of the first questions one has asked is why would we do this ourselves? And if it's something like a residential subscription business or a temporary roll-off business, we should go get that with our sales team, not pay a premium for that. So, we're looking for infrastructure. We're looking for route-based businesses with customer contracts that we know that we will integrate in the business and drive value over time. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And just the last one here. Just on your guidance, I know you had, had a double-digit in there. You kind of walked it back last quarter. You've kind of brought it back again confidently here this quarter. Just what's changed your view here that gives you the confidence behind this guide, that you perhaps kind of didn't have when you had the third quarter report? Jon Vander Ark : Well, maybe a slightly different view of the history, right? We never gave an official guidance. We said we had line of sight at one point to double-digit, right? That was in a different commodity price environment. And so given the commodity market being depressed for six to nine months, that certainly gave us a different outlook, right, just based on the math of the commodity prices. And I think we've talked about here a high single-digit number going forward. Now, if we end up doing more M&A early in the year and that has the year impact and we get to double-digits, we certainly could, but I think we've been pretty consistent with how we've approached it. Brian DelGhiaccio : And the other thing I would just add to that as well is that on the October call, we said that we've got a perspective that we're going to achieve high single-digit growth. And if you look at the midpoint of everything we put out there, it's high single-digit growth. So, to Jon's point, I would sit there and say it is exactly in line with where we thought we would be in October. Walter Spracklin : Fair enough. That\u2019s all my questions. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. I wanted to ask first on capital expenditures. I know 4Q is usually sometimes seasonally high, and this quarter seemed maybe particularly high. I was wondering if that was related to the asset management system in the polymer centers, or if there was something else in there. And how we should be thinking about CapEx for 2023? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, certainly investing to grow the business, right? We're always disciplined but never afraid to spend that money. One of the bigger drivers of that was the second polymer center that we're putting in the Midwest. We just -- we've seen so much demand for the offtake of our first one that gives us a lot of confidence that the market is really getting value and need that product. And the returns in our business case, we think, are going to be north of what we originally pro forma-ed. So, that gave us the confidence to accelerate that investment moving forward. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, and the other thing is, we talked that there were some supply chain disruptions throughout the year, impacted things like trucks and some of the heavy equipment. And we actually were able to take or seed, take title of those assets in the fourth quarter. So, as you think about building the 2023 plan, most likely, we'll be more back-end loaded like you've seen in the last couple of years, but maybe not to the extent that you saw in 2022. Toni Kaplan : Super helpful. And I wanted to ask on volumes. I know you gave the 50 to 100 basis points for 2023 of volume. I wanted to just ask sort of what you're seeing with regard to commercial and industrial. I know some of your competitors talked about like a little bit of a softness in 4Q, but maybe a little bit better in January. I wanted to hear your experience on that. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, there's different moving pieces for sure. Obviously, there's been a little bit of a slowdown in the construction market as you've seen housing starts kind of pull back in the second half of last year, and we've certainly baked in some softening of that into the 2023 environment. But listen, the industrial market is very, very strong right now, right? You saw the consumer number this morning. I mean the consumer is engaged. So, we still see lots of economic activity. Travel and leisure, right, is kind of bursting at the seams. So, we remain mindful, right, that there's certainly recession talks on the environment, but we're a pretty broad-based barometer of the economy, and we're seeing a lot of strength right now. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. And even though we're seeing a little bit of softness on some of the construction activity, we're still seeing above-average price. If you take a look in the temporary large container business, we're nearly 9%priced during the fourth quarter. Toni Kaplan : Sure. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Chiang of CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Thank you operator and good afternoon everybody. I was just wondering, when you talk about the pricing initiatives within ES, just wondering what percentage of your revenue do you think you need to reprice to get to the levels you wanted? And how long do you think it takes to kind of get through all of that? Jon Vander Ark : Well, we'll look at every dollar of revenue on every customer and really try to understand -- again, we look at pricing with two lens. One is, from a customer and an insight standpoint, right, what does the market bear? What does our offer have from a value standpoint versus our competitors? And then we also want to look on the internal side and say, what is our cost? We're including a capital charge and make sure that we're getting a fair return on that. And so we're going to go systematically through every customer and every dollar of revenue. And I think the encouraging thing is we put out some double-digit price increases, and we're seeing it stick, right? Customers are really valuing the integrated offering. And keep in mind, whatever they spend with us is a very small percentage of their cost structure. And so safety and speed and sustainability and our digital tools and all those things that we're investing in, right, those are big differentiators that allow that price to stick. Kevin Chiang : All right. That makes a ton of sense. And then I apologize if you've given this number before, but when you look out longer term and you're through some of the cost synergies and some of the revenue upside opportunities, do you have a targeted ES adjusted EBITDA margin that you're thinking about? You did 17.5%in -- or roughly 17.5% in 2022. Does this get to the mid-20s when you're kind of through many of these initiatives? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I think what we're -- listen, over time, long-term, I think these businesses converge in terms of returns. I think you'll get free cash flow conversion to get there first because this is a slightly different OpEx-CapEx trade-off in this part of the business. And then over time, I think -- for a longer period of time, I think getting the margin to converge, I don't think is out of sight or out of reach as well. Now, that's not going to happen overnight, right? We are going to kind of ratably, right, systematically take this up. So, I think the goal in the next four or five years to get that in the mid-20s is very reachable. Kevin Chiang : Excellent. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hi, thank you very much Jon and Brian, Aaron for taking the questions. Brian are we at about a $1.6 billion run rate in ES revenues when I roll in the M&A? And then what does that$1.6 billion grow organically? I just trying to put all the pieces together from your transcript, and I think I have myself a little confused. Brian DelGhiaccio : We're probably closer, Michael, to -- in the $1.5 billion range, a little over $1.5 billion. But organically, like I said earlier, we're thinking that's a 7% to 8% organic type grower here in the near term, and with opportunities for even some of the additional cross-sell opportunities to be additive to that. Michael Hoffman : So -- okay. So, the following that then, in your margin for the whole year, 29.2%, what do you think the Solid Waste business and the Environmental Services business do individually to merge together? Brian DelGhiaccio : So, in the Recycling and Solid Waste business, we're expecting overall about 30 basis points of margin expansion, right? And in that business, we have to overcome the 30 basis point headwind from commodity prices. So, the underlying business is growing kind of 60 to 70 basis points. Now, in the Environmental Solutions business, we're expecting 100 basis points of margin improvement, and there is the acquisition roll over of US Ecology, which is kind of a negative 70 on that portion when you compare it to what we had in the Gulf. So, we're expecting margin expansion in the underlying business thereof 170 basis points. The reason why that only comes to 10 basis points overall is we just have a greater mix or a greater percentage of ES business in 2023 than we did in 2022. Michael Hoffman : Yes. Yes, I get that. And then can you bridge for us the $1.724 billion of free cash in 2022 to get to the midpoint of your guide? What is the cash interest, the cash tax, the incentive comp above plan? And then I'm assuming everything else is made up by organic growth productivity. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Yes, let me give you a couple of pieces of that, certainly. So, interest -- and I'm going to give you some pre-tax numbers. And for argument's sake, you can just sit there and take, call it, 70% of it. You do the after-tax. But interest up $90 million, right? So, that's an increased outflow there. Incentive comp is about a $35 million outflow compared to target levels. And then bonus depreciation, you wouldn't tax effect the impact of bonus depreciation, but that's about a $35 million increase in cash taxes. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then-- Brian DelGhiaccio : So, when you take all those pieces, that creates -- now I'm going to kind of flip a little bit to conversion, and that creates, call it, about a 300 basis point headwind to conversion, all of which being offset by just the EBITDA growth in the business as well as some benefits in working capital, some of those benefits being unlocked. We talked about finishing the finance and procurement modules during 2022, and we think that there's an opportunity, in particular, on the DPO side to drive improvements in working capital. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then just squeezing one in, sorry. The $125 per ton, how much of that has to rely on OCC moving? And what would your target be for OCC to make the $125 in your guide? Brian DelGhiaccio : Well, I mean, just to put it in perspective, right, OCC, fiber, right, represents about 70% of our basket of goods, right? So, most of this, we are expecting to come more on the OCC side. But even just to put it into --all of it into perspective, if you take a look at what we're expecting from a guide perspective compared to current prices, it's a relatively modest recovery, right? That's $30 million worth of EBITDA and about 20 basis points to margin, $20 million of free cash flow, if things were to stay at current levels. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Good afternoon and good evening everyone. Brian, if we just go back to your margin cadence discussion, the headwinds in the first quarter, really, the first half, that implies we're going to be exiting the fourth quarter of 2023 with margins up something like 150 basis points year-over-year heading into 2024. So, I'm wondering, are we setting up for 2024 to be an outsized margin expansion year because we're essentially making up for a lost year from a commodity price impact in 2023? Anything that you'd add to that bridge as we think about what the margin progression might look like. Brian DelGhiaccio : Sure. And a couple of things, Jerry. I mean, you've got two variables, right, when you take a look at that. You have the -- what we're expecting in 2023, but also what happened in 2022, right? So, we're expecting commodity prices in 2023 to be at the highest point of the year. They were at the lowest point in 2022, so you can't just go to the margin expansion. But yes, exiting the year in 2024, we think it's going to be kind of a nice jump-off point heading into 2024. But I wouldn't just look at the overall margin expansion because you've got two years in your math there that you got to take into consideration. Jerry Revich : Sure. But you're going to have the same comp benefit in the first half of 2024, hopefully. And if we think about the profitability of the recycling business in the fourth quarter with this ultra-low recycled cardboard prices. Can you just update us on what was the margin profile of the business, roughly, just so we can get a feel for where it's troughing in the cycle, given all the work you've done there? Brian DelGhiaccio : You're talking about on the recycling side of the business? Jerry Revich : Yes. Brian DelGhiaccio : It's still a profitable business at these levels and still an attractive return. So, again, we would expect -- through the cycle, we talked about we expect these depressed prices to be somewhat transitory and, again, return closer in line to a 10-year average. Not even back to the levels it was when it was over $200 a ton on our basket of goods. Jerry Revich : Super. And can I ask around the gas part of the business? Nice little bonus we got from the EPA in terms of eRINs. How much gas to electric power do you folks generate in terms of your share of the power that you generate? And what's your take on what's a reasonable value capture opportunity for you and your peers? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Of our existing projects, the vast majority are gas electricity. Now the -- where RINs have gone, all of the new projects in the pipeline were contemplated to be gas powered and/or methane RNG. The great news with our partnership with BP, we've got option value, right? eRINs coming online. And we're both very open-minded to understanding where those markets move and the local geography and even places where we make power on fleet to figure out whether we want to convert some of those opportunities rather than RNG to go to electricity as well. But we see it as, over time, a benefit for us because it will have two pathways. Jerry Revich : I'll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead. David Manthey : Thank you very much. My question is regarding residential volumes that have inched up here in the last couple of quarters. Is that a trend you expect to continue this year? And when you look at that 1% overall midpoint volume outlook, does that contemplate commercial container volumes being flat or negative at any point in 2023? Brian DelGhiaccio : No, I mean what you're seeing mostly on the residential is some relatively larger contracts. You're seeing that in the numbers. So that's expected to anniversary in 2023. So, we don't expect that to continue throughout the year. And yes, when you take a look at our volume cadence, we expect that small container will remain positive, right, throughout 2023. When you take a look at overall volumes, we think to have our highest volume performance early in the year. And again, that's a step down throughout but remaining positive in all 4 quarters. Jon Vander Ark : I'd say residential, that's been, I'd say, over the last decade, the most disappointing part of the business in terms of where margin and return has gone and that hasn't expanded at the same rate as the other businesses. There's a lot of reasons for that, with commodity prices and inflation and everything else. But listen, we don't do work for free, right? We put upward pressure, right, on all those contracts and look at those contracts just like we were an acquisition, right? We're going to put capital into it and what type of return do we get against that. And if we can't meet our return thresholds on that, we won't do the work. David Manthey : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Kyle White of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Hey good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just curious what you're seeing on open market pricing heading into 2023 as inflation starts to come down and maybe there's a bit more uncertainty regarding economy and volumes going forward. Are you seeing any change in behavior from maybe some of the smaller competitors in this environment relative to last year? Jon Vander Ark : No, last year, we put out the highest level of pricing we ever have in small container in the open market, and we had the highest percentage of retention of that price that we've ever had in our history, which is really a staggering number. I think it speaks to, right, the value of our service that we're providing. It also speaks to the broader context with everything else in plating. Those numbers were quite consistent across the quarters, right, in terms of our ability to retain price, right? And we're seeing strength here in the early part of the year on that. So, we're mindful of the environment. But look, at all of these smaller competitors, right, they have truck costs that are going up. They need to buy new equipment after some supply chain challenges, right? They have labor costs that are going up. So, they need the price to cover their costs, which I think is support of a broader pricing environment. Kyle White : Yes, that makes sense. And then on leverage, how are you thinking about leverage in this environment? What's sort of the right target for you before investors should expect meaningful capital return through buybacks? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, we've talked about kind of that sweet spot for us being right around three times. We're a little bit over that right now, but we expect to be there in the next, call it, six months, at which point then we would look to kind of return to that normal level of looking at the repurchases and so on and so forth. Kyle White : Sounds good. I'll turn it over. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. I certainly appreciate the level of details of your 2023 expectations. I think a lot of puts and takes in this environment. So it might be helpful if you could just outline the areas where you kind of see the greatest source of upside, inflation moderating, some tech investments. And then on the flip side, where you see the greatest risk to maybe hitting these targets as well? Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, from an upside perspective, and we mentioned this earlier, is that we are expecting inflation to remain persistent throughout 2023. And so again, Jon just talked about the fact that we're pricing at higher levels in 2023 -- early in 2023 than we did even in 2022 because we expect inflation to remain sticky. So if that does come down, that is certainly an opportunity in order to sit there and to drive better performance than we anticipated. But you do have to remember, some of that inflation on wages, and wages typically go in annually. So, once you put that wage out in the marketplace, you're not pulling that back. So, there is some stickiness to the inflation, but certainly, as it relates to some third-party costs, some of the maintenance-related expenses, transportation expenses. If those come in, that would certainly be a source of upside. Stephanie Moore : Great. And then on the downside? Brian DelGhiaccio : Sorry. We just talked a little bit about recycled commodity prices. Again, we've expected a recovery, but we've also dimensionalized it for you so you realize it's a relatively modest recovery that we're expecting. But if they stay at current levels, that would be a little bit of some downside relative to our expectations. Jon Vander Ark : And I just said the broader macro environment, obviously, we've been through a pandemic and war at the doorstep of Europe and China virtually shutting down and supply chain challenges and inflation. So, I think we're prepared for uncertainty in a dynamic environment. Again, we're running the business, not just for the quarter or the year, we're running it through the cycle and making decisions accordingly. But we're mindful that we may have to adjust or adapt the business if do things emerge. Stephanie Moore : Absolutely. And then just on the second polymer center going up, starting to go up this year. Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the initial KPIs or returns you're seeing from -- or expect to see just given the demand from your first center and kind of what drove you to decide to open up the second here. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, across, we think we're going to have at least 4 centers across the U.S. We think when they all get up and running at scale, it's kind of a $250 million incremental revenue business for us. We think the EBITDA margins are going to be certainly north of 30%, right? Very attractive IRRs on those investments, and I think we're going to beat that pro forma, right? And we know from the conversations we've had and the pricing that we're getting right now, we're starting to take orders, obviously, for the center in Las Vegas. I'm very confident we're going to beat those numbers in the pro forma. Stephanie Moore : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Yes, thanks for taking my question. I understand that you guys have been pricing ahead of cost, and there's been a lot more discipline in the industry. But is there like a step function change in terms of how Republic is pricing from a few years ago? I mean, you guys went through some years of intentional shedding some business. I'm just wondering if the quality of the business now, you feel that you can have a wider price versus cost spread than maybe the Republic Services a few years ago? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I think it's a good question, Michael. Certainly, and you highlighted it. Certainly, customer mix is a hidden element or hidden factor in being able to get price. And we went through some intentional shedding, right, which has negative drag on our volume for a few quarters when you look a few years back. The quality of our revenue is much higher than it was historically, and we feel good about that. And that's all the way across from national accounts to small container to getting out the last remain broker work out of the system to municipal and getting a fair escalator into those contracts. So, I think the overall health of our pricing across the portfolio, well, not perfect, of course, but it's much, much better than it was a few years ago. And then you combine that with the capture and the tools that we have to really start to grind out a few extra bps here and there across our 13 million customers, who have understanding and willingness to pay. And then on the other side of that, with the RISE platform, driving productivity and changing our cost position in the business. So, when you've got a healthier customer mix, right, and better ability to price with a cost structure that I think is healthy and getting healthier. I think that does create the context for continued margin expansion over time. Michael Feniger : Great. And Brian, you touched on it with the question earlier, but just to dig a little deeper. Can you actually talk about the cost inflation, how that kind of trended through the fourth quarter and what you're seeing in early 2023? What you guys are kind of embedding there? Because I think you're saying you're not really embedding a rollover there. Just curious what you actually saw through the quarter in early 2023 that we'll kind of expect or what you guys are at least embedding in the guidance there? Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, if you think about for the full year for 2023, we're in that, call it, 5% to 5.5% inflation-type range. And again, when you take a look at the 6.5% expected yield on related revenue, that's how we're driving that 80 basis points or so of expansion in the underlying business. That's about the level we saw exiting the fourth quarter, and we expect it to remain relatively consistent throughout 2023. Michael Feniger : Thank you. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Andrea. I would like to thank our 40,000 employees for their efforts that enabled our strong 2022 results. The success of our strategic investments is made possible due to their hard work and commitment to serving our customers. Have a good evening and be safe.",

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We started the year strong and are pleased with our first quarter results. Our performance reflects our ability to grow across our business while enhancing profitability. We remain well positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities in the marketplace by providing the most complete set of products and services to customers. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 21%, including 11% from acquisitions, generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.24 and produced $496 million of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to believe that investing in acquisitions is the best use of free cash flow to create long-term value. We invested $224 million in acquisitions during the first quarter. All transactions were in the recycling and solid waste space. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of outsized levels of activity in both recycling and solid waste and environmental solutions businesses. We continue to see opportunity for well over $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2023. We are making great progress on the integration of U.S. Ecology and increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. We continue to adjust prices to earn an appropriate return on the valuable services we provide. The acceptance of our pricing actions remains high with very little customer defection. Cross-selling our complete set of products and services continues to run ahead of plan with more than $60 million in new sales to date. We have now achieved over $40 million of annualized cost savings. As a result of the actions taken in the Environmental Solutions business, EBITDA margin improved to just over 20% during the first quarter. We continue to generate outsized growth by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiating capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability. Regarding customers' yield. We remain laser-focused on providing a world-class customer experience to drive increased loyalty and organic growth. Our customer retention rate remained at 94%. We continue to see positive trends in our Net Promoter Score, supported by improved service delivery. Our front-end colleagues, including drivers, technicians and the customer experience team are determined to fulfill our daily commitments to our customers. We delivered robust organic revenue growth during the quarter and simultaneously increased in both price and volume. For price and related revenue increased to 9.3% and average yield on related revenue increased to 7.4%. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 1.8%. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. Turning to digital, we continue to make progress on deploying RISE tablets in our collection business. Over 75% of our residential routes are operating with RISE tablets. The remaining routes are on-track to be completed by mid-year. This technology is the foundation that will allow us to further enhance our digital service offerings and improve our customer experience. Moving on to sustainability. We are investing in differentiated capabilities to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth. In February, we announced our plans to significantly scale our electric fleet through our long-term agreement with Oshkosh. We will begin operating 2 fully integrated electric recycling and solid waste collection prototypes later this year and expect to start buying a scale in 2025. This announcement supports our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification through a multi-supplier strategy. Development of our Palmer centers in Las Vegas and the Midwest remain on-track with the centers becoming operational in late 2023 and late 2024 respectively. The 57 renewable natural gas projects being co-developed with our partners are advancing. We expect at least six of these projects to commence operations this year. Our approach to sustainability includes our aspiration to be the employer of choice in the markets that we serve, and we are seeing positive results. Turnover rates continue to improve, and we are now below 2019 levels. As a result, we are better staffed to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. We continue to be widely recognized for our comprehensive sustainability performance. For example, we were recently named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list, Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies list and Fortune's list of the world's Most Admired Companies. A positive momentum in our business continues to build as we harness the power of our differentiated capabilities. We will continue to invest for the future profitable growth to deliver the results that create unmistakable value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide financial details for the quarter. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 8.2%. Core price on related revenue was 9.3%, which included open market pricing of 11.7% and restricted pricing of 5.4%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.6%, large container of 9.6% and residential of 8.4%. Average yield on total revenue was 6.5%. Average yield on related revenue was 7.4%, an increase of 70 basis points when compared to our fourth quarter performance. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business. Volume on total revenue increased 1.6%, while volume on related revenue increased 1.8%. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 1.6%. an increase in large container of 80 basis points and an increase in landfill of 8.6%. Landfill was primarily driven by a 21.7% increase in special waste revenue. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $105 per ton in the quarter. This compared to $201 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 90 basis points during the quarter. Current commodity prices are approximately $115 per ton. We believe that commodity prices will continue to recover in the second half of the year as the global supply/demand imbalance continues to correct. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. First quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $309 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 50 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 20.6%, a sequential increase of 350 basis points. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 29%. This compares to 30.4% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 130 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which includes 90 basis points related to US Ecology, 60 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 30 basis point decrease from an additional work day, partially offset by a 40 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 40 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow was $496 million in the first quarter or approximately 25% of the midpoint of our full year guidance. Free cash flow conversion was 47.6%. Total debt was $12.1 billion, and total liquidity was $2.5 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.1x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.3% during the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. With that operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Hi, there. Thanks so much. Pricing seemed really strong this quarter. I know you talked about it sort of decelerating through the year, but just wanted to get your latest thoughts. Any additional color on pricing and how second quarter looks as well? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, certainly a very strong environment still. We expect kind of maintain that momentum for the first half and for lots of reasons, we think that sequentially comes down into the second half, right, as some inflation starts to modulate and in our restricted portion of our business, obviously, right, CPI comes down in terms of where the comps go, but we also expect cost inflation to modulate through the year. So we think we'll have pretty good price margin spread throughout the year, which will lead to a positive result for the year. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And I wanted to ask if you could just give us an update on how you are thinking about the specialty waste opportunity, talk about any of the synergies and areas of potential future opportunity there. Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, a really strong quarter for us, obviously, right, over 20% and broad-based, and a portion of that is certainly the cross-sell opportunities that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And that we're offering customers a comprehensive and integrated offering and part of that is showing up in our recycling and solid waste business and going to our special waste into our landfill. And that's the benefit of our offering where we can take things into liquid hazardous waste, we can take solid hazardous waste, we can take special way so we can provide a range of solutions to customers, and that still put us in a pretty differentiated position in the marketplace and excited about the momentum that the team has. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. And also what I would add to that is that our pipeline for special waste opportunities remains very strong. And about 20% of that pipeline is a direct result of cross-sell opportunities. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. Congrats, again. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick Brown : Hey, good afternoon guys. Sorry, I just want to be clear. So are you effectively just reiterating all the pieces of the guidance? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, we feel we're certainly -- feel good about the guidance at this point. Patrick Brown : Okay. Okay. This wasn't totally 100% clear. But kind of going back and following on the previous question, I know pricing was strong out of the gate. But can you talk a little bit about unit cost inflation? So I think you guys guided to something like 5% to 5.5% unit cost inflation for '23, I think on the last quarter call. Do you kind of still see that or you still seeing maybe inflation starting high and then it kind of easiness as the year goes on? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, start where you ended. It's certainly starting higher and modulating throughout the course of the year. I think it's going to be a little higher than the 5.5%, probably closer to 6% would be our best look at this point right now and a few different factors on that. Certainly, truck delivery would be one where we got about 90% of our trucks last year, and we think we're going to get probably that 10% from last year and about 90% of this year, and we're growing. So that means we're buying some older trucks. Operating some older trucks to service those growth opportunities, and they have a higher cost per engine hour. And so that's elevated maintenance costs. It's higher cost, not necessarily unit cost inflation on the part, for example, is just operating more expensive vehicles. And hopefully, in 2024, the suppliers catch up, but we can kind of get back on track. So that would be one example why it's just a little bit higher than we predicted. Patrick Brown : Okay. All right. That's perfect. Just my last one is here. Going back to environmental services. So there's a lot of traction there. It seems like that franchise is maybe run rating $1.5 billion in total revenues, and I don't have the calculation on the fingertips here. But is that kind of like a low-low 20% margin today. I think you had talked about maybe getting that to 30% longer term. So do you still see that, Jon? And kind of what are the couple of the key drivers to get you there? Is it just we need to go through a couple more cycles of pricing? Or just any thoughts on timing and how we go from call 20 to circa 30. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Listen, I think pricing is certainly going to be a huge lever in terms of how we get there and the primary lever. I think a little bit of scale benefit, obviously, which allows us to leverage our overhead. We've built this thing for growth. So as we continue to grow, we get some leverage on our overhead spend in that space as well. And just additional integration opportunities across recycling and solid waste business. We haven't really taken advantage of all of those things yet. And then, the last thing will be just cost management. Cost discipline and making sure that we are pricing work appropriately in understanding the cost position of all that work so that all of our individual opportunities and projects are profitable. We've made great progress on that, but there's more room in front of us. And this was the investment thesis when we did the deal, obvious. So we did it based on Intrinsic and $40 million of cost synergies we've just gotten there quicker than we expected. We've gotten the 40 rate. I think we're going to end up closer to 50, when we're said and done. And then, we thought there was upward pressure on pricing. We thought there was cross-sell opportunities. And we said we'd get $75 million to $100 million over 3 years. We've already gotten 60, which tells you with a good pipeline, which tells you that we're going to get to that 75 to 100 quicker than we expected. And we know that when we price, so we anticipate there will be some customer fallout churn, but the net dollars work over time. We've just seen very, very little churn, which speaks to the fact that this is a valuable offering. It's a very small portion of the vast majority of our customers' cost structure and that we're going to continue to price for the value we deliver. Patrick Brown : Yes. Lots of momentum there. Appreciate the time guys. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. There's been maybe some mixed messages today in earnings -- previous earnings around the macro, the health of the macro. I have a feeling your answer may be not so mixed, maybe a little more unambiguous. But can you talk today about the health of the customer, the sustainability of your pricing? You mentioned that your retention rates are at 94%. So they're sticking. But looking at your -- both the pricing and some of the volume trends you reported, they're very robust. And so would just love your perspective on what you're seeing in the staying power of some of these trends. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Let me put a caveat on first, which is we remain humble and dynamic, right? The last 3 years have bought a lot of people that there's fundamental uncertainty in the market and I read the same things you do, which is people have been talking about a recession, you're announced for 12 to 18 months. So we have our eyes and ears open and that will be nimble should that occur. All that being said, we see a lot of positive signs. We're seeing strong growth and pricing. Let me give you a number or a perspective. In our open market, we're sending out more -- a higher gross price increase than we ever had before. and our realization rate, which is the percentage of that pricing that sticks. Customers don't call back to negotiate, et cetera, is the highest it's ever been, which is somewhat of an astounding number to think about, they were putting a lot of price. That price is sticking in the marketplace for growing. We talked about special waste in that pipeline being strong. We're starting to see a commodity rebound, which we put a modest rebound in our plan, and I think we feel really good that the outlook there looks strong on that front. We've seen a little decline in temp units year-over-year. We anticipated that in our plan with where residential and commercial construction were going at the end of last year, but our yield number is very, very strong there. So we're doing some of that to ourselves in terms of yielding on those assets. So we're pretty confident in the very near term and cautiously optimistic around the demand environment for the remainder of the year. Noah Kaye : Yes. And then maybe just a little bit of a follow-on, but also housekeeping. Can you comment to what MSW tons did? And then did the quarter have any benefit on the cleanup related to the train derailment in Ohio? I don't know if remediation work ended up being significant. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Let me address the MSW. So MSW volume was up 1.2%. I think more importantly, though, MSW yield was up 5.6%. So very strong pricing in that portion of our business. Jon Vander Ark : And then the specific to derailment in Ohio, I think is the one you're referring to, a de minimis impact in the quarter. Noah Kaye : Okay. So it was really all just strong demand in kind of the environmental services part of the business. And can you give us sort of a sense of how much of that was price? Jon Vander Ark : Very strong, very broad-based. Listen, we've gone out with multiple double-digit price increases, which is sticking. Obviously, that business is more unique, and there's a lot of mix elements because you're doing a lot of individual project work and a lot of things like special waste on the hazard side that come in. So we haven't yet developed our yield metric, which we aspire to do over time in that portion of the business. And I'd say the industrial economy from our seat in the park is still very strong. Now it's not universally strong on boarded, for example, would be a spot that's a little bit down. So we're seeing some of that in the Midwest, which has a lot of manufacturing capacity there, but other parts are very, very strong on the industrial side. Noah Kaye : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much operator. Good afternoon everyone. I wanted to go back to the recession question and really talk about I know your resiliency is quite admirable during the cycle. Just curious with you have a little bit of a different book of business now compared to '08, '09. And just wondering what your thoughts are on whether the resiliency of your earnings profile is as good as it was back then or if the addition of US Ecology has added any volatility there? And particularly on special waste, I don't know if you've answered many questions about your sensitivity to a recessionary environment on your special waste volumes, if you have any color on that? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Walter, I would say the first thing to keep in perspective is that Environmental Solutions revenue in total is about 10% of our book. You got to keep that in mind. That being said, a good portion of this revenue stream is, as a consistent and recurring nature to it. And increasingly more, we're trying to get closer to the customer to make that more of an annuity type revenue stream. Is it exactly the same? Maybe not, but is it pretty close, I would say yes. Walter Spracklin : And sensitivity on special waste, any sense there? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I think you got moving pieces there. Obviously, when the economy goes down, people will get cautious and things that have discretion to them, you're going to see some delays. But the vast majority of our special waste those are jobs that need to get completed. They need to get done. So it's not a matter of the job getting canceled. It's a matter of the job getting pushed. And I'd say the counterbalance of that right now is just all of the infrastructure spending and government funding. We see a lot of those opportunities just starting to emerge, but we really haven't taken advantage of a lot of that spending hasn't flowed all the way through to jobs being committed here. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Those are my two questions. Thanks very much. Appreciate your time. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jon Vander Ark : Operator, why don't we move on to the next question. Operator : Okay. The next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. Nice start to the year. I kind of hate to do this. But just pressing on the guidance, I mean not much of a mention on kind of where we stand, to me kind of feels like we are running ahead schedule. So I just wanted to run that by you, is it fair to say that perhaps with the momentum in environmental solutions. Clearly, price volume looking stronger that we are kind of tracking a little ahead of that initial outlook for the year. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We feel really good about the start to the business and said what remains quiet positive as you know, it's a seasonal business, so you get a ramp-up here in Q2 and Q3. And we want to see that ramp-up fully take hold. We are starting certainly see some of that ready but that gets into full swing here in May and the summer month in the northern part of the country. And so we'll come back in July when we talk again and see our progress there, and we'll tell you if we have any update at that point. Sean Eastman : Okay. Understood. And perhaps the moving parts on the year-on-year margin bridge in the first quarter would be helpful to assess. I mean, did those kind of commodity inputs come through as expected? That one would be good to jump into. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. From a commodity perspective, we're tracking almost exactly the way that we thought we would. So we thought we would start the year right around this, call it, $100 a ton, sequentially increasing with a full year average of about $125 per ton. And so right now, we would say with what we saw in the first quarter on average plus where current prices are at $115 per ton. It's playing out exactly the way we thought it would. And so when you think about the margin cadence of that, in this quarter, it was a 60 basis point headwind. We think it's a relatively consistent headwind in Q2. That drops to, call it, a 20 basis point headwind in Q3 and then flip positive in Q4 at those levels. Sean Eastman : Okay. Perfect. And one last quick one for me. I just want to make sure I understand this big special waste print in the quarter. I mean, are you guys saying that as a reflection of the cross-sell opportunity really coming through on the Environmental Solutions strategy? Brian DelGhiaccio : Certainly in part. That's why you're going to see it. When you actually sell into the recycling and solid waste business, what you're going to see is that's where a good portion of it is going to come in. That's a lot of the volume aspect of it. But at the same time, we're seeing that -- again, we're talking about total revenue being up about 22%. It's a pretty good split between both price and volume. So it's a combination of both, and that's going to be a reflection again of just healthy activity, which includes the benefits of that cross-sell. Sean Eastman : Okay. Understood. I appreciate the insight guys. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to touch a little bit on the M&A environment. I think you noted that you expected to execute on. I think close to $500 million in M&A this year and not included in the guidance. So maybe if you just wanted to touch on what you've seen for the first quarter of the year and kind of any changes or expectations there? And I know you noted that a lot of those acquisitions is in the recycling and solid waste business. But what about more so in the specialty waste? Is that an opportunity this year as well? Jon Vander Ark : So yes, we put out in our initial guidance. We anticipated spending $500 million. I think we'll exceed that number as we go throughout the year. We have a really attractive pipeline, both in recycling and solid waste and environmental solutions. And so I think you'll see some of those deals come across through the remainder of the year, and we get things are at different stages. We're all the way in the front end of conversations to the back end of letters of intent, and we report on things once we sign and close those deals. So you'll hear more in the second quarter. And the exact timing of where that flows between Q2, Q3 and Q4, obviously, we don't predict that because things can people forward or they can move out a few months here or there. The pipeline remains strong. I think both for '23 and all the way into '24 at this point. We feel really good about the pipeline. Stephanie Moore : Got it. And then maybe touching back on the pricing and the cost environment as well. And you just noted on 2024. And obviously, a lot of things could happen between here and there. But how would you think about that just general structural spread cost between pricing cost as we move through 2024, given some of the maybe headwinds this year and what next year in theory could be a more normalized environment, if that exists anymore, but how would you view just how that spread has changed over time versus maybe historically? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Look, we remain committed to pricing ahead of our cost inflation to allow us to expand margins across the business. So we've talked about 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion that's kind of the pace that we go after, and that would be our initial ingoing assumption in 2024. Now a lot can change between now and then in terms of could we get more than that, if we can do that and maintain and improve the health of our overall business, we'll certainly do that, but more to come down the road here on 2024 perspective. Stephanie Moore : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds. Please go ahead. Tony Bancroft : Thanks so much for the opportunity, a very nice quarter. Just a question on PFAS. Could you just sort of review, I know there's a lot of news, articles coming out about that right now and some potential rulings and some regulation coming out. Just maybe review what that potentially means for you in landfill cost structure, potential opportunities, maybe that would be helpful. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Very important regulation. And again, we're not opposed to regulation, we happen if it's well constructed, so we have a seat at that table. And we're involved in those conversations to make sure that we don't, as a company, or even an industry get penalized for something that we catch. We didn't create the problem. People should be happy that we've got the modern infrastructure and systems to protect the environment. Net-net, we see it as more of an opportunity over time, especially with our Environmental Solutions business and being able to serve customers. Could that have some elevated costs in our landfill, Yes, we've got a really good history of passing those types of costs, regulatory costs. on to customers. And so more to come on that as we move forward. But we're very much in the conversation and we'll be active in shaping the legislation in a way that it enhances the business versus penalizes the business. Tony Bancroft : Thank you for that. And then I guess my second one, just on electrification. You touched on in your comments. Just maybe again, an update on that. You've talked about in the past, but how is that going? There's been some, I think people are talking about infrastructure issues and making it all sort of work. What's your view on? Is it on track? Is it off track? Or just maybe you could give us some thoughts on that. Jon Vander Ark : Still very much on track. We've got more than 20 trucks right around the country right now that are electrified through multiple manufacturers. We talked about our Oshkosh partnership and that the first kind of bottoms up zero emission designed vehicle and excited about that. And that number of 20 will go north of 50 next year, by 2025, we'll have several hundred vehicles. And it is important. It's not just the vehicle, it's the system. So you need to have the infrastructure, you need to have understanding government regulations, you need to understand the incentives, and we've been working for years on those things and have multiple infrastructure projects already going on, anticipating where we're going to put vehicles in working closely with customers. So we feel we're on track. And listen, innovation is hard. There will be some bumps and twists and turns, but we're really, really confident that this is a product that the customers want to buy and that this is very viable, again, for us to operate in a way that enhances our business versus penalized. Tony Bancroft : Thanks so much. Congratulations, Jon and team. Operator : The next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. When you look at your M&A bogey for this year and you say you have pretty good visibility in the pipeline for next year as well. What does the pipeline look like in terms of distribution across your businesses? And has that changed as you've engaged in conversations. Jon Vander Ark : Well, if you go back from 5 years ago, it certainly has changed when we were predominantly vastly recycling and solid waste player, and we've obviously grown the Environmental Solutions business to Del's point, right, that's still about 10% of the business broadly. The pipeline is probably an 80-20 mix of 80% recycling and solid waste and 20% environmental solutions. So that will grow faster just because there's more geographies to fill in. There's a few product lines to build out. So there's more kind of inherent growth in that in terms of our starting point. But the balance of the business will still be recycling and solid waste and feel really confident about that. In any given time period, that could ship a single deal could flip it to 80-20 in any given quarter. But if you look across a longer time horizon of 3 to 5 years, I think that 80-20 makes us a pretty good barometer. Tobey Sommer : Right. Thank you. Year-to-date, if you look at your employee base, what has the trend been like in not just employee turnover or perhaps improved turnover and attrition rates, but also the heavy lift that it is to recruit and hire new ads and train them. Are both of those sides of the equation getting easier? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Turnover is down. Employee engagement is up from a very high watermark. So people are engaged, right, turnover is down, and this is the recruiting situation in the last 4 to 5 months has substantially improved, number of applicants per open rec, right has substantially improved. So there's still pockets of tightness around so it could be very geographically dependent. But from a broad-based macro level as the situation versus 6 months ago is substantially better. Tobey Sommer : Is there room for continued improvement, or are we already at healthy metrics if you make a longer-term comparison more than just sort of the Great Recession in 6 month ago period. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We talked about turnover being below 2019 levels. We aspire to continue to grind that down kind of 30 to 50 basis points of product turnover long-term would be great for us. Turnover is never going to be zero people move and have changes in life circumstances, and there's always opportunity bringing new talent, but we'll look to bring that down. But we feel like right now, we're at a very healthy level and that we can continue to improve from here. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Thank you. I'm wondering if you could talk about the performance in the quarter. So your margins were up about 2 points sequentially 1Q versus 4Q, which is a good bit better-than-normal seasonality? Is it possible to parse how much of that was price cost and the municipal solid waste part of the business. You mentioned the ESPs. I wonder if you could just flush out the rest of that bridge in terms of that performance versus normal seasonality? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Jerry, we mentioned sequentially the Environmental Solutions business improving 350 basis points. But also in the fourth quarter, remember, as we outperformed the year, we had heavier incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter. So I would say there were some things that were more unique in Q4 as far as expenses are concerned off to a strong start this year. I think that's why you're seeing more of that sequential improvement. This year, we would expect just more normal seasonality and a Q4 that looks like what you've seen in the or 3 to 4 years as compared to what you saw last year from a margin perspective. Jerry Revich : Super helpful. And then can I ask you, it feels like cost are stabilizing. Should we look for the price/cost gap sequentially to improve in the second quarter as a result of that dynamic? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. When we think about some of the cost inflation, we see some of the anniversarying, which is just a little bit more of when we saw some of those cost increase going into play last year. So yes, we start to anniversary some of those things in the second quarter. We started seeing a lot of that more on the wage side. We also start to see some of that modulate from a comp perspective on transportation costs beginning in the third and fourth quarter. So we would expect the inflation levels to decrease as we move sequentially. Again, it's not that we're seeing a significant price decrease in the current period. It's just that we're anniversarying the cost increase that went in the prior year. Jerry Revich : Got it. And lastly, can I trouble share with us the incremental tailwinds to your business from the plastics and landfill gas investments that are scheduled to come online for '24 versus '23 and '25 versus '24. When do we get the most significant step up relative to the cadence? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So if you think about -- let me start with the plastic side on the polymer center. We start to see that in '24, start to layer in with, call it, $15 million or so of EBITDA, and then it really ramp up into 25 and into 26 and until you get to a run rate of, call it, somewhere in that $75 million plus type EBITDA range. When you take a look at from a gas perspective, again, most of that, you're starting to see, again, you start to see the first projects come online towards the end of '23. So most of the contribution coming in '24, you could see $25 million plus type of incremental EBITDA in '24 and then sequentially in a $15 million to $20 million per year until we get to that $100 million worth of total contribution by 2028. Jerry Revich : Super appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on Environmental Services, obviously, a good showing in Q1 here. You continue to make good progress. I get the sense earlier on when you acquired US Ecology, there was a fear that this business was more cyclical. Just wondering, as you cross-sell more and as you kind of pull this under the RSG umbrella, do you think it changes the cyclicality of that business? Like does the customer look at that service differently if they're also buying other RSG services? I know it's early days, but just wondering how that experience has been, just given the broader economy has been shaky here. Jon Vander Ark : I think two things are true. When you're just predominantly a post-collections player, everything you see can look variable and cyclical because it could be a recurring revenue stream, but that provider might farm that out or source that out to a few different places looking for price. When you get closer to the generator, then you do you have control of that product. Now could they take that somewhere else, of course, they could over time. But when you provide excellent service and you have an integrated offering, you become stickier. And so huge opportunity that we're seeing right now to take things that might have looked more cyclical or volatile or variable to become more consistent and recurring in the revenue stream. That doesn't mean that will be 100% of it like we have in our current business. We have some of that base work. On the landfill side, we'll certainly have some of that. But over time, the profile will migrate closer to the recycling solid waste side. Kevin Chiang : Okay. That's helpful. I apologize if this is somewhere in your release, but if I look at your organic growth composition, let's call it 80-20 split between yield and volume or price and volume. What would that look like today in your Environmental Services business, if I deconstruct the organic growth between volume and price. I apologize if I missed this earlier. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, I would probably say, it's probably relatively similar just from the perspective of some of these are project-related jobs. That being said, we've seen really good pricing in that business, but we've also just seen an increase of activity at the same time, which is really a function of now offering the most complete set of products and services in the space. So again, we're seeing a combination of both, and that's what's really driving the outsized revenue growth in that portion of the business. Kevin Chiang : Thanks. Congrats on a great start to the year. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Feniger : Hi, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Brian, the growth on the ES side and now layering in the incremental EBITDA from plastic recycling and the landfill DAS in '24 and beyond. Does that change how we should be thinking about the free cash flow conversion and the improvement you guys are seeing there and potentially going forward? Brian DelGhiaccio : Well, look, I mean, we said that rewind the clock 2, 3 years ago, and we were up high 30% free cash flow conversion company. We've moved that into the mid-40s, and we said we have line of sight into the high 40% and beyond. And we're working on these things. And again, those are some of the things that we're going to do in order to achieve that level of performance even while we're overcoming some headwinds to getting into that high 40% interest expense is a headwind to free cash flow conversion, the expiration of bonus depreciation, which is phasing out over the next 5 years. Those are all headwinds. And even in the face of those things, we think we can achieve that level of performance. And everything you just mentioned is the way we're going to get there. Mike Feniger : Great. And I realize the regional banking crisis tightening lending standards is likely not an issue for you and your customers. Do you hear of any issues for some of your smaller regional competitors, ability to finance and buy new trucks, trying to expand. Just curious how the changed competitive dynamic or even some of the M&A opportunity going forward? Jon Vander Ark : And I don't think we've seen that show up specifically. There's probably an example somewhere in our M&A pipeline. Of that being the case, I do think it's becoming more challenging, right? Because given supply chain challenges, because we got 90% of our trucks. If you were a spot buyer of trucks, you're in a really tough spot. You're going to be driving that truck, not as a matter of months, but a matter of years before you can get allocation on that. So digital, we've talked about that a number of times. That being the second moat in the business and our investments in that space and the ability to service customers and connect it to our operations and core systems, I think those are all things that make an attractive time for smaller players to sell. Mike Feniger : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Michael E. Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hey, JVA. Hey, Del. Thanks. On the ES business, there's a bunch of pieces here. One, can you help fill in the gaps on what contributed to the 350 basis points sequentially. And then the idea of margin improving. I just want to make sure I understand mix. I mean, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I thought about third of this was fixed asset disposals, so high margin and 2/3rds is sort of billable hour services that are good returns but lower margin. I'm trying to figure out where that mix goes in order to achieve the target that was suggested earlier in the call. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, Michael, first of all, I think that it's a little bit more, I would sit there and say in the 50-50 rather than the 30-70 between those two aspects of the business. I think you have a combination of things. First, let's talk about what happened sequentially. So we talked about price increases that we put in late in '22 as well as early '23. So a certain aspect of that was certainly timing. Also, as you just think about increasing utilization as we're actually achieving the cross-sell, some of that is that we're utilizing some excess capacity that's in that system. So it's the flow-through of that incremental revenue is at a very high margin. We're seeing the combination of the both. So Jon mentioned it when we were on the call, some of the way that we're going to get there is also just by scale. When you take a look at the size of our areas, when you take a look at our four areas, they're managing less revenue than their counterparts on the recycling and solid waste space, which gives us capacity to grow into that and leverage that SG&A. So we built that area structure to look a lot like the recycling and solid waste side, even though they're managing less revenue, which gives them opportunity to grow without adding any additional SG&A costs. Jon Vander Ark : And Michael, on the field services side of the business, but some of that would be getting MSAs with large industrial customers who we know are going to have a set of projects throughout the year. They're going to be in different spots. But if you look over a 10-year period, you've got a relatively consistent demand profile of their level of project spend, cleanup, plant turnarounds, et cetera, when you have the MSA and the relationship, that revenue stream then starts to look very recurring versus it's just an event or a job. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And that's always been the secret challenge or challenge for the billable hours world as they struggle with utilization of their billable hour resource. So what I'm hearing you say is you're striking a balance on how to maximize that. Jon Vander Ark : Correct. Michael Hoffman : Okay. On the price cadence for the remainder of the year to get to the 55. Can you help us with the mix between open and restricted through the remainder of the year, so we sort of understand how to think about that, that gets us to the total of 5.5 million for the year? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. We expect sequential increase into Q2 on the restricted portion of the book, and that kind of hit high watermark, and then it will decrease sequentially. Our expectation is it will decrease sequentially into Q3 and Q4. We think the high watermark on the open market is here in Q1, and it decreases sequentially but modestly. So again, I would sit there and as we talked about earlier, I guess, 60 days ago at this point that the spread between the high and the low by quarter is not that significant. Call it, 50, 60 basis points, plus or minus, from the midpoint, and that's what we would expect for the full year. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And just to be clear, so I got these some of your numbers coming at us, high watermark for the beginning of the year, sorry, I'm flipping pages. There's 11.7 in the open and 5.4 for restricted. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, that is correct. That's on core price, Michael. Michael Hoffman : That's core. Not yield. What was the yields? Brian DelGhiaccio : Correct. Well, the yield in total, we don't break the yield up between the two. Yields in total with 7.4% on related revenue. On total revenue, it was 6.5%. And again, if you're building it into a most -- go ahead. Michael Hoffman : No, no, go ahead, please. That's what I was going to ask. Brian DelGhiaccio : I was going to say the reason we do, we break the two out that if you're building it on a model and you're using the base, the entire base period revenue probably have to use the total revenue number. Again, we disclosed the related revenue because we don't calculate price on all components of revenue. So again, if you want to get the true effectiveness of our pricing programs, that's why related revenue is applicable. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then, Jon, you made a comment earlier to an answer to your question, said 6%, and I missed, is that 6% inflation or you thought yield would maybe land at 6% by the end of the year? Jon Vander Ark : No. We said cost inflation, we think, throughout the year, end up around 6%, [indiscernible] going into the year, 5.5%. So we're seeing a little elevation there, primarily here in the first and the second quarter. But again, we're pricing ahead of our expectations as well. So we're getting the performance that we expected, just a little bit different path to get there. Michael Hoffman : Right. Which would suggest the guide of 5.5% probably works its way up to staying on top of that. Jon Vander Ark : We'll update you in July. Michael Hoffman : Had to try. See you in Orleans on the weekend. Thanks. Operator : At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Vaishnavi. I would like to thank our 40,000 employees for their commitment to deliver an essential service in the markets we serve. Our results are a direct reflection of the team's ongoing efforts to deliver best-in-class service to all our customers. Have a good evening and be safe. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

Our strong second quarter results demonstrate the value created by our differentiated capabilities and the execution of our strategic priorities. We continue to successfully grow our business both organically and through acquisitions while enhancing profitability. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 9%, including more than 4% from acquisitions; generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 10.5%; expanded EBITDA margin by 40 basis points; reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.41; and produced $1.26 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, a 10% increase over the prior year. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in acquisitions to create long-term value. Year-to-date, we invested $927 million of acquisitions, all transactions were in the recycling and solid waste space, including the acquisition of assets in Colorado and New Mexico from GFL. The M&A environment remains active with opportunities in both the recycling and Solid Waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. We now expect investment in value creating acquisitions to exceed $1 billion for the year. We are making great progress on the integration of U.S. Ecology and increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. Pricing realization in this business remains strong. Customers value our complete set of products and services. We have achieved over $110 million in new sales to date as a result of cross-selling our products and services. The sales pipeline is robust with opportunities for organic growth and expansion of services within our existing customer base. We achieved more than $40 million of annualized cost synergies and EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business improved to more than 22% in the quarter. The strong results we achieved in the first half of the year, along with the positive momentum in our business, supports a full-year financial outlook that exceeds our original expectations. We now expect revenue in a range of $14.775 billion to $14.85 billion, adjusted EBITDA in a range of $4.34 billion to $4.36 billion, adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.33 to $5.38 and adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion. Our updated financial guidance includes the contribution from acquisitions closed through June 30th. The results we are delivering are made possible by executing our strategy supported by our differentiated capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability. Regarding Customer Zeal. Our efforts to deliver industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth. Our customer retention rate remained over 94% and we continue to see positive trends in our Net Promoter Score, supported by improved service delivery. Organic revenue growth remained strong during the quarter and simultaneously increases in both price and volume. Core price on related revenue was 8.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.1%. This includes landfill MSW yield of 6.2%. This is the highest level performance in company history in this category. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 50 basis points. Turning to Digital. We have reached a milestone in our efforts to create digital tools to enhance our customers and employees' experience and deliver meaningful financial benefits. The deployment of RISE tablets in our Recycling and Solid Waste Collection business was completed during the second quarter. The next phase of our digital operations is expected to drive additional productivity savings through route adherence, improve safety performance, and provide more predictable service delivery for our customers. In total, we believe the benefits of our digital initiatives are worth approximately $100 million, with $50 million already achieved and $50 million to be captured over the next three years. Moving on to Sustainability. We continue to invest in differentiating capabilities to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth. Earlier today, we announced a joint venture with Ravago called Blue Polymers. This groundbreaking partnership further supports our efforts to lead in a plastic circularity. Blue Polymers will utilize recycled olefins from our Polymer Centers to create blended pellets for use in manufacturing sustainable packaging. We expect to open four facilities beginning in late 2024 with earning contribution beginning in 2026. Development of our Polymer Centers in Las Vegas and the Midwest remain on track, with the centers becoming operational in late 2023 and late 2024, respectively. Demand for recycled plastics remains strong as the consumer goods industry continues to work toward achieving their sustainability goals. For example, we are partnering with a Coca-Cola Company to supply recycled PET from our Polymer Centers for use in sustainable packaging. The 57 renewable natural gas projects being co-developed with our partners are advancing. We expect four of these projects to be operational by the end of the third quarter. Finally, we continue to believe that creating a more sustainable world is our responsibility and a platform for growth. We recently published our latest sustainability report, highlighting the progress we are making on our 2030 goals. These goals are supported by investments we are making in Polymer Centers, the Blue Polymers joint venture, renewable natural gas projects and fleet electrification. I'll now turn the call over to Brian who will provide details for the quarter. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.3%. Core price on related revenue was 8.8%, which included open market pricing of 11% and restricted pricing of 5.3%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.3%, large container of 8.8% and residential of 8.3%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.9% and average yield on related revenue was 7.1%. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business. Volume on total revenue increased 40 basis points, while volume on related revenue increased 50 basis points. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 1.4%, an increase in residential of 80 basis points, and an increase in landfill of 3.7%. Landfill was primarily driven by an 8.3% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.3%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. Moving on to Recycling. Commodity prices were $119 per ton during the quarter. This compared to $218 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 1.1% during the quarter. Current commodity prices are approximately $115 per ton. We believe commodity prices will remain relatively flat with current levels in the second half of the year and we now expect average recycled commodity prices in a range of $110 to $115 per ton for the full-year. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Second quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $104 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of U.S. Ecology. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 22.5%, a sequential increase of more than 150 basis points. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 30% during the quarter. Margin performance included a 50 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which was fully overcome by a 100 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 20 basis points. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.26 billion. Our performance through the first half benefited from the timing of capital expenditures and cash taxes. Year-to-date, capital expenditures of $550 million represents 33% of our projected full-year spend and year-to-date adjusted cash taxes of $99 million, represents 40% of our projected full-year spend. Total debt was $12.2 billion and total liquidity was $2.1 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter returned to approximately 3x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.8% during the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 25% in the second half of the year, resulting in a full-year equivalent tax impact of approximately 25.5%. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bryan Burgmeier of Citi. Please go ahead. Bryan Burgmeier : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. On the Blue Polymer announcement this morning, is that something that's already captured in the pro forma earnings from Polymer Centers that you've spoken about previously? Or is this going to be incremental? And if it is incremental, could you give the full sense of the potential impact? Jon Vander Ark : No, it's incremental. So think about that Polymer Center producing two things, PET on one side and olefins on the other side. At the PET, we take into a flake, basically, a hot wash clean flake that's food grade that can go right back into water bottle manufacturing or other types of PET applications. On the olefins, it takes a slightly different path. So we sort, get full collection of that olefins and then we feed the Polymer Center. So this basically guarantees the demand on the back end of our Polymer Center for the olefin side of it. And then Ravago was world-class at compounding and blending olefins to create unique products. And so that's why we partnered with them. We think we can provide the right applications to the market. We get to participate \u2013 not only do we get the supply, so it affects the supply agreement on one side, we get to participate in the benefit and the upside as a 45% minority JV partner. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. From an economics perspective, we look at our equity pickup, that one line pickup, beginning in 2026 two centers somewhat contributing in that year with about $15 million. So you can think $7 million to $8 million per center. And then getting $7 million to $8 million incremental in both 2027 and 2028. Ultimately, we see $30 million to $32 million worth of EBITDA for all four at run rate in 2029. Bryan Burgmeier : Understood. Thanks for that detail. And if I can just maybe follow-up on the recycling business. I think your filings say your volume is about 80% fiber. Once the Polymer Centers are online, do you think that 80% fiber exposure drops a bit? Or is there maybe a different way we should start to think about value versus volume? Thanks, and I will turn it over. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Look, initially, it won't drop much, at least from a volume standpoint, because what we're really doing with Polymer Center is taking things that are down cycle today and some material along the way in that down cycling is lost and landfilled to get full volume recovery out of that plastic and get much higher yield because they're driving true circularity. Now these Polymer Centers are built actually to take third-party product over time. So over time, we'll flow third-party product in there. That will put more plastic into the system and then dilute the fiber percentage right at a certain level, but you're probably talking more like going from 80 to 75 versus a major change in the mix. Operator : The next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. You mentioned a couple of comments on volume, and I was just wondering if volume was sort of in line with what you were expecting or if it was a little bit lighter. And I know you mentioned the construction activity and the special waste was something mentioned by one of your competitors is slowing. I know here, you got the 8.3% increase in special waste revenue. But just anything on volume trends and where things are above or below what you were expecting and how you think for the rest of the year? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. I'd say broadly kind of in line with expectation, probably slightly ahead in certain areas. So construction, we anticipated that being down. We saw residential and commercial starts obviously start to soften the second half of last year. And there's a lag effect as we have jobs that are getting completed. And so we're down 3.8%, but we have really strong pricing there. So we've taken the opportunity there to be disciplined on price and making sure that we're getting a positive mix even in that environment. And then other special waste, right, is attractive. Part of that special waste clearly is our cross-sell initiatives. With the U.S. Ecology acquisition, we have now a unique offering in the marketplace, and we're seeing customers demand to that unique offering. So that's certainly helping us. Small container was a bright spot, right, in terms of volume growth for the quarter. So I feel really good about that as well. And again, I'd say broadly in line with what we expected. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. And Toni, if you remember, in our original guidance, the range on volume was 50 basis points to 1% positive. And now we're thinking it's at that \u2013 still within the range, but at the lower end. But at the same time, we increased our guidance on average yields, right? So the flow-through and the contribution of a 50 basis point increase on yield is much more significant to the enterprise in our results than the 50 basis point decrease on the volume side. Toni Kaplan : Yes, understood. And then you mentioned the partnership with Coca-Cola. Can you talk about potential impacts from that? It might be a little bit longer term, but just any thoughts on how to quantify how you're thinking about that partnership and the benefits to you? Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, Coca-Cola has been a great partner. I would say this, demand for our product out of the Polymer Center outstrip supply by a lot, right? So we were able to talk to a number of parties. We could have sold the Las Vegas center out three or four times over without challenges because the market is so short supplied for this type of ARPA that's food grade. And we're taking it right now, the single site over time, we'll take the Midwest side. And then these partnerships will evolve, and I'm certain they'll grow, right, as we expand the network, but that's all we're disclosing at this point. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Jon Vander Ark : Hey, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey, Brian, just real quick from a modeling perspective, what is the expected contribution from M&A in the new revenue guidance? I think it was supposed to be maybe a 3% contributor coming into the year. Is it maybe closer to 3.5% to 4%? And then how much rolls into 2024 based on what we know today? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So the in-year contribution rollover from 2022 transactions as well as the in-year impact from 2023 transactions, we're thinking 4.25%, right? And the rollover impact into 2024, right, from the deals that were completed in 2023, we think adds 50 basis points to our 2024 revenue growth. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. That's helpful. And then \u2013 so I just kind of want to think about the EBITDA a little bit. So it looks like you raised EBITDA by, call it, $50 million. But if I'm not mistaken, you actually lowered your commodity assumption, but then you added in some M&A. So basically, I'm trying to bridge that change. How much of the EBITDA change was basically core versus some other moving pieces, if that makes sense at all. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Let me answer the question. The short story is that the entire increase is essentially the underlying business. So let me go through some of the puts and takes. So to your point, right, we've added EBITDA associated with acquisitions, but most of those acquisitions were completed mid-year. So you're going to have half the contribution. We've also got deal and integration costs. Two of these deals require regulatory filings, so we had heavy legal costs. We also have a fairly significant integration costs just because one of those deals requires that we rebrand the trucks within the first six months. So the contributions from acquisitions in here is still positive, but it's somewhat muted. To your point, that's been further offset by the reduction in recycled commodity prices. So if you think about taking all those things I just mentioned relative to our original guide, it's a relative push. The $50 million increase in EBITDA at the midpoint is essentially the increase in price flowing through to the bottom line. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. Yes, okay, that's what I thought. Okay, just real quick on the last one here. So if we just exclude Blue Polymer and we just look at the Vegas facility, what is the expected EBITDA impact of that facility in 2024? And then how dependent will it be on recycled plastic prices because we have seen some weakness there recently. And basically, sorry, does this Blue Polymer JV, does it kind of inoculate that offtake risk longer term? Am I thinking about all that right? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Let me go ahead and start. You had a couple of questions there, so we'll kind of unpack some of those. So the expected contribution from just the Polymer Center, right, so this is the one in Vegas in 2024 is $15 million, right, of EBITDA contribution in 2024. You can then think of about an incremental $20 million per year thereafter, right, as we bring other centers online, ultimately getting to about $80 million worth of EBITDA at run rate in 2028. To your other point, right, on the Blue Polymers, yes, we are going to be selling all of the olefins coming out of the Polymer Center 2, the Blue Polymers JV, right? And when you start thinking about the offtake agreement there that guarantees, right, a contractual rate for all of those units leaving Blue Polymers on the olefin side \u2013 or I'm sorry, Polymer Center on the olefin side. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. Yes, so it kind of helps inoculate the offtake longer-term. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Tyler Brown : If I read it right. Jon Vander Ark : Correct. Tyler Brown : Okay. All right. Thank you guys so much. Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Jon, I'm wondering if you could just expand on comments you recently made to the Wall Street Journal. You spoke about having visibility on double-digit topline growth here in the medium term. I'm wondering if you could just unpack what gives visibility on that between Polymer, M&A yield, other moving pieces? And in that type of topline environment, do you think you can still deliver the 2x leverage between revenue and earnings that Republic has done over the past decade? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We're certainly starting with price, right? That's always the first component, right? We have to price ahead of our costs. You've seen the organic growth picture. And the underlying solid waste and recycling business is a slow growth business, right? And we expect to grow slightly faster than the market, only slightly because it's a highly contracted market and shares don't move easily. And again, we're always going to stay disciplined on price first. As we've expanded into Environmental Solutions, the underlying growth from an organic standpoint is certainly a little stronger. So that's a tailwind. On the growth side, we're doing more M&A than we ever had. It was six or seven years ago, we talked about spending $100 million a year in M&A. And then that's been ramped up to $500 million to $700 million, and obviously, we had announced last year the U.S. Ecology acquisition and got to $3 billion. But even outside of U.S. Ecology, it's $800 million of deals outside of U.S. Ecology. And this year, we've said more than $1 billion, and we're already sniffing up against that number. So M&A is certainly contributing. And then our other sustainability investments, right, are nice contributors and probably a little less on the topline in terms of really moving the needle given the scale of the business. But on the bottom line, right, these are kind of high EBITDA margin investment opportunity, very high return. So we feel great about that over time. Jerry Revich : Super. And Brian, can I ask separately? In the quarter, really strong margin performance. Your COGS per unit were up just 3%. In terms of lumpy items that contributed to the results in the quarter? Or were the results pretty clean? It sounds like attrition was pretty low, but I'm wondering, were there any other moving pieces that helped margins or costs in the quarter that we should keep in mind before run rating the really strong results? Brian DelGhiaccio : Look, I would say there's always some puts and takes. But I would say if you aggregate those from a net number perspective, it was a fairly clean quarter. Jerry Revich : Well done. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Brian, could we walk through a dollar reconciliation of last year's EBITDA to this year's EBITDA on a dollar basis, so not just that aggregate change, the 50, but what are all the puts and takes? Because I think have the sense that we're understating the power of solid waste by just saying 50. This is on the guide. Sorry, I meant the guide. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, the guide. So, Michael, as I mentioned, I mean, we're not going to get into the individual components of the EBITDA contribution of our acquisitions and other things. But what I can tell you is, as I just said with Tyler on the phone, if you take a look at the in-year acquisition contribution net of those deal and integration costs, right, that is a positive number, which is almost entirely offset by the reduction in recycled commodities. That reduction in recycled commodities is about $15 million to $20 million negative compared to our original expectations. So if you look at guide to guide right at the midpoint, our EBITDA is up $50 million, which is the underlying business made up primarily of relatively higher price. We took our yield from 5.5% on total revenue to 6%. We took it from 6.5% on related to 7%. So that's that 50 basis points as well as just outperformance within the Environmental Solutions business. That's what's contributing, right, to the overall increase in EBITDA. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Could we then talk about Environmental Solutions, and would you talk about the price volume mix there because I think it's important for everybody to see that there's a combination of both in the pricing of a scarce asset continues. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, let me start there, Michael. We're working through that. Obviously, it's a little bit like special waste in terms of there's a mix issue that there's a lot of unique products and services. So we haven't nailed yet what we might report externally in terms of price or yield metric there, certainly our aspiration over time, whether that's large parts of the business, like yield per drum or things like that, work through it. But a huge portion of the outperformance there is price. We've taken multiple double-digit price increases, and we will lead from a pricing standpoint. And that's caused a few units to be shed in certain places. So we found the ceiling, but we're unafraid. These are valuable assets, impossible to replicate and customers are valuing what we're offering. So we're going to continue to push on that front. And that, also combined with the cross-sell, which is where we're driving a lot of the volume, has been a really good story and picture for that business. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. I mean just to put some numbers on that, Michael. If you take a look at the Environmental Solutions business, this time last year, was 17.1% EBITDA margin. This quarter, 22.5%. So that 540 basis points of margin improvement is essentially most of that being price-driven, but also just better overall utilization as well. We're becoming more efficient, and we're optimizing from a labor perspective. So when we do get those units, not just because of the price alone, but as far as the overall profitability of each one of those jobs, we're just becoming overall more efficient as we have better utilization of the assets and the resources that are providing those services. Michael Hoffman : Okay. If I could just tease out one thing. We've had negative trends in ISM PMI were below 50 on the index. It looks like it's floor bottoming. But is there a positive volume even if I don't get the split, there's positive volume plus a lot of price? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. I think, yes. And so we look at all those indices, too, Michael. And I think what we're not fully accounting for is a lot of the infrastructure spend and the government spending is flowing through. And we're certainly getting a lot of opportunity there. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Brian DelGhiaccio : And I think the other thing, too, Michael, that we're also seeing right now as well is the benefit of the cross-sell. As we said, we've now increased \u2013 or reported more than $110 million in new sales, which is positively impacting both the Environmental Solutions business as well as the Recycling and Solid Waste business. But more of that positively impacting the Environmental Solutions business just because when you take a look at the revenue per customer tends to just be higher than we see in recycling and solid waste. Michael Hoffman : All right. Let me squeeze one more, if I can. You raised price in 4Q, you raised it in 1Q. Did you raise it in 2Q as well? Jon Vander Ark : We are actually in the process of raising prices here early in 3Q. Michael Hoffman : Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Just on the volume, good job on growing that volume amid some of your peers seeing it contract a little bit. But I'm just curious as to whether we're hearing a little bit on the price competition from smaller players that are somewhat less disciplined in that regard and some of your peers walk away from that is. Are you seeing any evidence that smaller players are acting a little bit more aggressive here? And do you suspect that this will ultimately translate in either pressure on pricing or on volumes for your business going forward? Jon Vander Ark : No, we haven't seen it. Now again, there's always an ankle biter and a market here or there who's going to take advantage of try to grow volume and figure out pretty quickly, right? That's a tough way to make a business and earn your cost of capital. With a small container, right, 9.5% yield, 1.4% volume. Really, really strong numbers for us this quarter. And that's a place we often see the price competition come in. That's where they try to attack because that's a profitable part of the business and people try to build their business there. They might start out on resi script or start out and temporal off and then they quickly get into that because that's the higher margin stuff. And so we've not seen the market broadly turn into a negative direction at all. Brian DelGhiaccio : And the other thing, too, you have to remember is that there are still supply chain constraints on getting new trucks. So in order to sit there into, again, have that type of behavior, you'd have to have capacity in your system or be able to secure a new truck in order to service those new accounts. And we are not seeing those supply chain constraints easing anytime soon. Walter Spracklin : Right. Being a little bit of a natural limiter there. On the CapEx spend, we saw a few of your competitors, again, increase CapEx a little bit unexpectedly in certain cases. And just curious how you review your CapEx spend is \u2013 and new projects as they develop? Are you \u2013 have you looked at your budget for this year? Is that something you do on an ongoing basis? Is it upcoming? Are you seeing evidence of projects that perhaps weren't on the horizon or perhaps not in your purview that are starting to pop up? Just curious as to, on a time frame, when you might update your CapEx budget based on what projects may or may not have come into the fold. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. No, we're doing that on an ongoing basis, right? We're looking at opportunities and Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer are good examples of things that we think. If they're value-creating, sustainable investments over time, we're going to make those investments. But we think also about, hey, normal course of business, what is the budget and not having any big CapEx bubble. So in this year, for example, the supply chain is challenged on the truck side. And so we're able to pull forward a little bit of spend on heavy equipment this year and some of that truck spend then will flow into next year. So across the two years, it will be relatively balanced. So there's always a little bit of push, pull on the margin, but we're looking at it all the time. And then thinking about into next year, if there's things that are really value creating, we'll put those into the budget next year. But we're kind of giving you what we see in terms of Blue Polymer and Polymer Centers in terms of investments outside of that, including the landfill gas energy projects we've already talked about. Brian DelGhiaccio : And if you look in the details of the guidance, when we do the reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow, included in that is a guide for the capital expenditures. And the number that's in there in the revised guide is exactly the same as what we guided back in February. Walter Spracklin : Got it. And last question here is on acquisitions. You had a couple of lumpy \u2013 chunky ones in the quarter. Is it your intention now to digest a little bit as you go into 2024? Or is this something that you think you could keep up a fairly solid clip that even ex those chunkier acquisitions you would have done otherwise? Brian DelGhiaccio : No, pipeline remains strong, both on the Recycling and Solid Waste and the Environmental Solutions side of the business. We're mindful of not loading up a specific geography, right, if they've done a big deal. We want to make sure that they can digest that and get that operational. But we've got a good pipeline of deals of all sizes, and we look forward to a strong second half and then into 2024 as well. Walter Spracklin : That's fantastic. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. So particularly in light of the way the EBITDA guidance raise was framed in terms of that pricing falling through to the bottom line and relative to the comments in response to Michael's question about raising prices successively each quarter. Just in light of those \u2013 with those as context, could you just talk about what you're seeing in the underlying inflation in the business, how those trended through the quarter, how you're responding, how these pricing programs are responding to those trends? Jon Vander Ark : Sure. Yes. Different picture obviously. Labor has been a really good story for us in terms of we brought the turnover down, starting to see that inflation certainly modulate. Maintenance has been a little more of a challenge and it's twofold. Some of it's just the underlying tires or things and true inflation. The other is the challenge of the supply chain, right, while we're growing the business, right, and we're not getting the replacement trucks or the growth trucks we need at the exact clip, that's causing us to drive older trucks, and we're going to do that to service our customer and capture the opportunity. So it's still value creating, but it is going to show up in that maintenance line in terms of older trucks at higher maintenance cost on that front. But we expect broadly all the cost categories, we're starting to see that inflation modulate in the second half of the year. And so we should see pretty good price cost spread at the remainder of the year. Sean Eastman : Okay. And then maybe taking that a little bit further. Just trying to think about the jumping off point for margins into next year, just assuming kind of status quo on some of the commodity-related inputs. I'm trying to think about the typical 30 to 50 basis points. Should we be building that number off of the second half outlook? As much information or thoughts as you can provide on that bridge would be really appreciated. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Look, we're not providing guidance right now for 2024. Sean Eastman : Totally understand. Brian DelGhiaccio : But again, if you \u2013 when we talk about that kind of 30 to 40 basis points per year, we're doing off of a full-year comp. So again, if you take a look at the midpoint of the EBITDA and the midpoint of the revenue, you can get a baseline adjusted EBITDA margin and think of it off of that because we're saying this year is a relative \u2013 we're expecting a relatively normal level of seasonality. We always expected it to follow the normal seasonal pattern from a margin profile perspective by quarter. So I think if you look at the full-year number, that's a good baseline. Sean Eastman : Okay. Thanks a lot, gentlemen, and nice update here. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from [Lydia Yang] of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Hi, sorry. This is Noah Kaye on Lydia. Jon Vander Ark : Hey, Noah. Noah Kaye : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe we \u2013 can just to make sure we understand, to put a finer point on the last question, how you think about kind of the yield and margin cadence for the back half. There's some odd comps, obviously, last year to consider versus what feels this year. As you said, more like normal seasonality. So can you maybe help us put a little bit of a finer point on it for modeling purposes? Brian DelGhiaccio : And again, I would say it had more to do with the prior year than the current year. We always said this year, we expect more of a normal seasonality sequentially. And so again, when you take a look at \u2013 in a normal year, your two best quarters tend to be Q2 and Q3 because you're capturing those summer months, right? And then again, you start pulling in some of the \u2013 in the colder climates where some of the units start to step down, and that's why you see comparably lower margin performance, lower revenue, lower EBITDA in Qs four and one. But as you kind of see this year and you kind of do the math, it looks like second half will be slightly more contribution than the first half, kind of a 49.5%, 50.5% type contribution. And again, we would say that that's relatively in line with our original expectations. Noah Kaye : Okay, great. And I think \u2013 by the way, I take your point around higher flow-through on price versus volume and agree with it all day. And so part of just trying to better understand because I think there's been a theme to this earnings around what the volume environment actually looks like. So I just want to make sure I can reconcile something. I think that the guide basically implies flat volumes, right, for the back half. And as you said in your commentary, you're not really looking at a flat volume environment, you're still looking at growth. So just how do I reconcile those? Are you maybe just being a little bit conservative given some of the indicators? Just help us to make sense. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. It's just caution and conservatism, given the construction market, given obviously the manufacturing industry we talk about and just there's some general uncertainty out there have we really stuck the soft landing or not. So we want to be cognizant of that. Listen, we're still raising, right? We've got a great story to tell and very, very positive. But on the volume standpoint, we're just being conservative. Noah Kaye : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead. David Manthey : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Question on Environmental Solutions. In broad strokes, can you outline what that segment might look like in five years based on your strategy today? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, we expect to keep growing. And this question comes up often, what percentage of the mix is going to be, right? We don't have a target percentage mix. I can tell you that we also plan on growing the recycling and solid waste side of the business. And so whether that is 12%, 14%, 15%, 16%, one year might be outsized one or the other, but we expect it to contribute. And the most important thing for us is it's related, right? It's the thing that's helping us drive cross-sell and stickiness with our customers, not just on the ES side of the business, but in the recycling and solid waste side of the business. So same formula there. We're going to start with price, right? We're going to look to gain organic growth, right, and grow some basis points ahead of the market, but not wildly ahead of the market. And then have a strong M&A pipeline, but stay very disciplined in terms of double-digit returns and make sure that any deal we do there fits our strategy. David Manthey : Okay. Thank you. And second, I guess someone has to ask about PFAS. So with your current environmental solutions capabilities, is PFAS remediation a net positive opportunity today for Republic? Or do you need other pieces to make it that way? Jon Vander Ark : So we see it as a positive. And again, this is not \u2013 there's \u2013 laws are still evolving here and the regulations are. And so we're actively having discussions at a federal, state and local level, right, to make sure that we're not \u2013 and the industry broadly, right, isn't the one holding the bag or they should want us to take care of PFAS because we're the one collecting it. We didn't generate it or create it. So we're going to be mindful that we're not penalized because we're doing the right thing from the environment. And then you flip that on the ES side of the business, lots of opportunities already emerging and lots of customer discussions for how we remediate. We have some solutions today, that portfolio is going to grow. So we think this is a net positive for us. David Manthey : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tobey Sommer of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. Can you keep this pace of margin expansion in ES into 2024? And where is the ultimate end goal? Maybe speak to the drivers from this low 20% range. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. The ultimate end goal is to harmonize the financial profile of this business with the recycling solid waste side of the business. We think we first will get their free cash flow conversion because over the cycle, this side of the business has a little less capital intensity and then ultimately margin. We're going to get there in a very disciplined way, right? You won't see the pace of the margin expansion, right, 540 basis points, that's leaps and bounds. We're not going to keep this pace. But I think you're going to see steady progress on that front. And listen, there will be some movement in this business like there is as the economy ebbs and flows, but we're going to take a through-cycle mindset, continue to serve customers, stay disciplined, focus on people who are generating recurring revenue over time. And I think you'll see the financial profile harmonize over time in the two sides of the business. Tobey Sommer : How much higher can you drive retention above the 94% level and still have it sort of be economically advantageous? And what's driving service delivery improvement now? Jon Vander Ark : I'll start with the end of your question. Certainly, technology is helping us on that front. As we put in the RISE platform is just allowing \u2013 positioning our frontline people to succeed every day. All the information with the customer is in front of them. When things come up like a block stop, they can immediately communicate digitally to our logistics department through our customer service. So we've got a full visibility and can communicate with the customer quickly. Turnover coming down is certainly helping that, and we feel good about that on the front line of the business. And I don't think we can drive loyalty to 100 because at some point, that's unattractive for certain customers who aren't willing to go or want to go from a price increase. And there is some natural movement of movement of homes, closures of business, et cetera. But we don't think we're done yet. We aspire to take that 94 up higher. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. Last one for me. What are the puts and takes of multiple price hikes per annum as opposed to larger, less frequent price hikes? Jon Vander Ark : Well, one would be test and learn, right? So when you put out the price increase, right, you can understand exactly how customers react and are we able to retain that work? And so that's the flexibility we have. Over time, you're not going to see us do that. Our normal case in recycling and solid waste business is typically annual increases when extraordinary things happen like the commodity issue four, five years ago, multiple price increases in a year, but that's not normal course. So over time, the ES business will matriculate to that model as well. Tobey Sommer : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Good afternoon. Stephanie Moore : Sticking on the move to the ES side and particularly the U.S. Ecology deal. I mean, I think kind of everything that was laid out tonight kind of speaks to the strength you've seen, whether it's pricing or the cross-selling. So suffice it to say, is that $75 million to $100 million revenue synergy target, presumably, we've blown past that at this point? Do you have a new target? Or how would you think about kind of ultimately the opportunity you can continue to garner from a cross-selling and pricing standpoint and what that means for that original target? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Listen, the pipeline is strong. Ultimately, this will manifest itself in our guidance for 2024, which we're not talking about today, but that will roll right. And again, U.S. Ecology, which was a great company. We were lucky to acquire, most importantly, the people, but also those assets. They're now part of the Republic Services in the Environmental Solutions business, so we've anniversaried that going forward. And so you'll see that roll through our volume numbers as we forecast 2024. Stephanie Moore : Okay, got it. And then maybe switching gears. Can you provide us an update on the joint venture with the BP and on the RNG front, maybe any updates or how it's progressing thus far? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. It's progressing about 57 projects and partnership. The largest chunk of that is with BP. It's 40-plus projects of those are with BP. And listen, we're hitting our marks broadly. Now there's certainly been some push-pull across individual locations where we've had some capital delays in being able to get facilities built. But then we've had other places where we've been able to redirect and pull forward faster and get that permitting in place. So ultimately, we're meeting our expectations for what's going to come online by the end of this year. And I think that's a helpful part of our portfolio, given the number of sites where you have one or two sites that might run into a little bit of delays. You've got the opportunity to look to accelerate other places. Stephanie Moore : Okay. Got it. So maybe any volatility we've seen with RINs this year and nothing \u2013 that really doesn't have any significant impact with kind of your expectations for this year and next just given the structure of the JV? Is that kind of a fair assessment? Or how would you talk about company volatility? Brian DelGhiaccio : From a long-term planning, and we talked about how we were valuing these investments, we assume $2 RIN prices through cycle. So the more recent uptick in RINs prices will actually be upside to our original expectations. Stephanie Moore : All right. Thank you so much. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just, Brian, the M&A rollover you said next year is 50 basis points. I think typically, M&A ends up being margin dilutive, but some of the acquisitions look like nice assets like Colorado. Just on that 50 bps next year, is there any chance that M&A isn't margin diluted that it could be neutral or even accretive based on some of the assets you guys were able to purchase? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. On a majority of that 50 basis point rollover, we would expect that to be at the margin plus. Michael Feniger : Great. And I guess just for my second question, free cash flow is tracking well. I think the conversion is going to be that 44% range in line with last year. I guess with all the conversations about sustainability investments and these projects, just do you think that free cash flow conversion is going to plateau? Or is there an opportunity for next year, for 2024, to see that break out a little bit and step up? What are some things that we should consider that might maybe hold that back or potential upside for that into next year? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Well, a couple of things. So I mean your observation of relatively flat with 2022. Be mindful though that we're overcoming over 300 basis points worth of headwinds between higher cash interest rates, commodity prices and the impact of bonus depreciation. So the underlying business is actually offsetting all of that to drive a result that looks relatively flat. That said, the contribution as we start thinking about the RNG plants and we think about Polymer Centers, Blue Polymers, all of which would be accretive to current company performance, that should all be additive. And as long as we don't continue to experience these year-over-year headwinds like we did this year in those three areas I just mentioned, you should start to see that flow through. Michael Feniger : Great. And Brian, just maybe just the last one. Just when I look at the open versus restricted pricing, obviously very healthy. How do we kind of think of those moving parts as we go into second half? And any visibility we kind of have in the first half next year just based on how we do the look backs? Thank you. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So again, when we think about open market pricing, and we've said this all along that we expected relatively higher pricing in the first half as compared to the second half, not really a function of what we're doing in the current year, it just we'd start getting into tougher comps. And again, it's a year-over-year comparison, so expressed as a percentage. You start to see that modulate a little bit. But again, all staying within, call it, 50 basis points of the full-year guide. So it steps down a little bit. Within the restricted, as we look forward, depends really on the pricing mechanism. So while we see potentially some of the CPI escalators, right, sequentially start to step down, water sewer trash and garbage trash are doing the exact opposite. Each month, they tend to improve. So again, we see it being relatively consistent in the restricted portion of the book just because what we see in step downs in CPI being offset again by those alternative indices. Michael Feniger : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Chiang of CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Yes. Thanks for squeezing. Maybe just one for me. I'm just wondering when you think of ES margins from the low 20s to eventually 30%, it sounds like pricing is tracking well. You've got the cross-selling opportunities. Just you had good success rolling on technology, automation, a bunch of things that have helped improve your solid waste margins. Just wondering how many of those initiatives you've rolled into ES. Or maybe how many of those initiatives would be applicable in the ES segment that could help bridge that gap? And is there a way to maybe quantify how much that could be to margins if you roll out some of that technology to the Environmental Solutions business? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. No, it's a great question. Right now, that's all costs, no benefit. So we're investing a lot in IT and doing a lot of hard integration work. U.S. Ecology, but also ACV and a lot of the other legacy assets we have all in the common platform, starting with a customer, how do we make that service offering even more compelling by getting digitally integrated with them. And then there's certainly some things on the operating side of the business, which will also help us drive labor utilization, more efficiency in terms of material flow, et cetera. We haven't quantified exactly what that's worth yet, but that will be part of the path to get to the 30. And when we get a little further down the road, we'll talk about those initiatives in more detail. Kevin Chiang : Okay. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. It's been a long call. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Yee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Stephanie Yee : Hi, good afternoon. I want to ask about the Polymer Centers. So the Las Vegas, Midwest and the two others that you're planning to build, is four kind of the gating factor because of how much plastics you're actually collecting in your recycling routes? Or if there is a lot of demand, would you consider investing in more than four facilities? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Four was \u2013 the business case we based it off of was all the material we collect today. So we don't have supply risk, which is great. Now we built those centers with a capacity to take third-party volume, and we're already getting some of that. So we've created a brokered asset that's already starting to capture some third-party volume, and it's a great value proposition. For example, if you have a municipally owned recycling center, we can take labor out of your facility, right, give you a few more penny for that load, and it's part of your sustainability story as well. So you share in the environmental benefits of that. Over time, right, as that demand for third party continues to grow, we could imagine five or six centers. It's regionally based, all hub-and-spoke model. So we've got the flexibility in the network over time that if the demand outstrips the capacity of the four, that we'll continue to invest. Stephanie Yee : Okay. That's very helpful. And just on the Blue Polymers JV, can you give us an idea of the CapEx spend that would be coming from Republic? Or is it too early at this point? Brian DelGhiaccio : Remember, it's more \u2013 we're a minority owner, so it's more an investment then it will come through CapEx. But we're thinking that our allocable share would be about $40 million per facility or $160 million in total over the next five to six years. Stephanie Yee : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jon Vander Ark for any closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Andrea. This month marks the 25th anniversary of Republic Services' stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange. I would like to thank all of our stakeholders, including customers, employees, communities and shareholders for their commitment and support in building this great organization. Have a good evening and be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending, and you may now disconnect.",

Our strong third quarter results reflect our focus on profitably growing the business. We produced revenue growth both organically and through acquisitions, while generating healthy margin expansion across our business. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 6%, including 2% from acquisitions, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% and expanded EBITDA margin by 70 basis points, report adjusted earnings per share of $1.54 and produced $1.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in acquisitions to create long-term value. Year-to-date, we have invested $947 million in acquisitions. All transactions were in the recycling and waste space. The M&A environment remains active with opportunities in both the recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. We remain confident that we will exceed $1 billion of investment for the year. Year-to-date, we returned $671 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes $201 million of share repurchases completed during the third quarter as our leverage ratio returned to target levels. We continue to make progress, demonstrating the value of our complete set of products and offerings to customers while increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. Pricing realization in the Environmental Solutions business remains strong, and we continue to drive organic growth through cross-selling. EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business improved sequentially to 22.7% in the third quarter and expanded 390 basis points over the prior year. The results we are delivering are made possible by executing our strategy in support of our differentiated capabilities. Regarding customer zeal, our efforts to deliver industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained over 94% and we continue to see favorable trends in our Net Promoter Score, supported by our valuable service offerings and quality service delivery. Organic revenue growth remained strong during the quarter, with simultaneous increases in both price and volume. Core price and related revenue was 8.6% and average yield on related revenue was 7.2%, and organic volume growth and related revenue was 10 basis points. Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and employees. The next phase of our digital operations is expected to drive additional productivity savings through route optimization, further improved safety performance, and provide more predictable service delivery to our customers. For example, we now have the ability to provide real-time customer notifications regarding expected service time on a given day. We are in the early stages of deploying advanced contamination over time and drive incremental revenue. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in areas such as plastic circularity and renewable natural gas or a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers remains on track. Construction of our Las Vegas Polymer Center is substantially complete, and we expect full scale operations to begin in November. Our Midwest Polymer center will be located in India. This center will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility with operations expected to begin in late 2024. The renewable natural gas projects being codeveloped with our partners are continuing to advance. I projects were online by the end of the third quarter, and we expect eight additional projects to be completed in 2024. We are making progress in our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We expect to have 12 electric vehicles in operation by year-end and more than 60 EVs to be added to our recycling and waste collection fleet in 2024. We now have 6 facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure with more than 40 additional sites in various stages of development. We continue to be recognized as an employer of choice and are proud to be certified as a great place to work for the seventh consecutive year. Our team members remain highly engaged to ensure that we are delivering high-quality essential services that are valued by our customers. I now turn the call over to Brian, who'll provide more details for the quarter. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7%. Core price on related revenue was 8.6% and which included open market pricing of 10.4% and restricted pricing of 5.7%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12% and large container of 8.6% and residential of 8%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.2%. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business. Volume on total revenue and related revenue increased 10 basis points. The component of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 50 basis points and an increase in landfill of 3.5%. Landfill was primarily driven by an 8.2% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.7% and a decrease in landfill C&D volumes of 6.2%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $112 per ton during the quarter. This compares to $162 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 20 basis points during the quarter. We continue to see a steady recovery in fiber markets and plastics pricing has improved from recent lows. Our current average commodity price is approximately $120 per ton. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $8 million over the prior year. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 40 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 22.7% and an increase of 390 basis points compared to the prior year. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points to 29.9%. Margin performance during the quarter included margin expansion in the underlying business of 100 basis points and a 30 basis point increase from one less workday. This was partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease from acquisitions, a 20 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point decrease from net fuel. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.8 billion. Similar to prior years, we expect to spend a disproportionate amount of our full year capital expenditures and cash taxes during the fourth quarter. Year-to-date net capital expenditures of $935 million represents 56% of our projected full year spend and year-to-date adjusted cash taxes of $152 million represents approximately 60% of our projected full year spend. Total debt was $12 billion, and total liquidity was $2.3 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 21.4% during the third quarter. The relatively lower tax rate included a $20 million favorable tax settlement from previous tax years, which added $0.06 of EPS during the quarter. We now expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 24.5% for the full year. As noted in our earnings press release, we upwardly revised our full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.46 to $5.49 primarily as a result of the lower tax rate. We remain comfortable achieving the other components of full year financial guidance that we provided in July. I will now turn the call back to Jon. Actually, we're going to open it up for Q&A. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, let me do one more section, please. We are proud of the results we delivered during the third quarter. Healthy contribution from our pricing strategy more than offset recycled commodity headwinds and cost inflation, which continues to moderate. Looking forward to 2024, we expect continued outsized growth in the recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions businesses, supported by pricing ahead of underlying costs, cross-selling our complete set of products and services and capitalizing on value-creating acquisition opportunities. We also expect financial contribution from the investments made in sustainability innovation, including plastic circularity and renewable natural gas projects. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and supportive of continued growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow along with margin expansion. We plan to provide detailed guidance on our earnings call in February. Now with that, operator, I would like to turn it over for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much. Not looking for guidance in 2024, but just maybe, if you could just provide some initial thoughts on pricing, maybe on the separated into open market and restricted, how those should hold up? Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. We're not providing guidance today, obviously, on 2024, but we expect \u2013 the outlook is positive. So I think about high to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, and we'll grow free cash flow and EBITDA margin faster than that, and that gets to your pricing question, we just -- pricing will come down nominally as inflation comes down, but we'll still be pricing ahead of our cost inflation, which should lead to that formula where we're going to grow the bottom line a little faster than the top line. Toni Kaplan : Great. And then just thinking about some of the expense drivers. We've heard from peers and from you as well in prior quarters that the equipment availability has been a little bit better, that retention has been improving. Is there any way to size some of those benefits? Just trying to think about those on a go-forward basis. Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : We're certainly \u2013 we talked about cost inflation modulating in the second half, and we're certainly seeing that. So you can see that in some of the cost categories, labor, maintenance, certainly a bright spot. The supply chain there, maybe getting incrementally better, but still, we're not going to get all the trucks we want this year. But I think if you see the improvement in the maintenance, that really speaks to the underlying cost of parts inflation has certainly improved versus the first half. And we expect those costs to continue to modulate into next year as well. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Please go ahead. Bryan Burgmeier : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Jon, Brian, apologies if I missed this, but when I look at the EBITDA and free cash flow bridge is provided in the press release, it seems like net income kind of steps up consistent with the tax rate changes we've talked about. But it maybe doesn't flow through to cash. Just wondering what I might be missing? Is it maybe a change to an adjusted number on how your cash taxes, is there changes to working capital? Any detail you could provide would be great. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Look, as you mentioned, we raised the full year EPS guidance predominantly due to the relatively lower tax rate. There is a cash component to that as well. That is somewhat offset by relatively higher interest rates than we normally thought, which is flowing through to cash interest, and that's why your adjusted free cash flow remains relatively consistent with what we previously provided. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it. Thanks for that detail And last question for me. I'm just wondering if you can maybe try to characterize the M&A market within Environmental Solutions. You've obviously been very busy with acquisitions, but we haven't seen any deals and yes yet. I'm just wondering if M&A is a little bit slower than you developed or if everything is moving along and maybe it just comes down to timing? Thanks gentlemen. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, it really comes down to timing. The pipeline is strong, lots of opportunities, lots of conversations. And we remain incredibly disciplined in terms of our financial strategic lens and our financial lens on that, but we feel certainly optimistic through the remainder of the year and into the first half of next year that there's a number of attractive opportunities in that space. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Jon Vander Ark : Hey, Tyler. Tyler Brown : So Brian, I think restricted pricing actually accelerated again to 5 7 here in Q3. Do you think that this is going to prove the high watermark, or do you think we get maybe one more quarter of acceleration? And then we kind of hit that second derivative? Jon Vander Ark : I think we're near it, quite honestly, Tyler here. Again, we talked about the relationship between CPI-based pricing starting to step down, but water sewer trash and garbage trash stepping up. And right now, I think they're somewhat offsetting each other. We think that to the question earlier about as you look forward, we do think that the restricted base pricing does step down sequentially 2024 from 2023, but again, it still stays above that longer-term average. Tyler Brown : Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And then -- so Jon, I think last quarter, there was some talk about kind of hitting a ceiling in certain places in ES with some of the pricing actions. It said that you were -- you kind of said that you were moving forward on that front. But just curious if you can give us an update there. Is pricing good in ES? Are you starting to see some churn. And just are you seeing any impacts from the economy in that business specifically? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. No, pricing remains strong. We certainly remain committed on that. There's sort of that's a customer churn on that portfolio. Some of that's permanent work, some of that is event work, and we're trading off some low-margin work, and we're adding to that very attractive cross-sell work. And so lots of really attractive growth opportunities in that space, but we're never going to do work for free, and we're always going to start out with price on that. So in the macro environment in manufacturing and ES broadly is a bit mixed. So the upstream oil and gas has been slower. Hopefully, a couple of big deals announced here that, that will ignite some increased activity there in Q4 and into next year. Automotive, obviously, has been a little bit challenged here with the labor activity. But then other parts of the petrochemical complex have been very, very strong. And overall, we're happy with the results and still feel very positive going into 2024 in terms of the demand environment. Tyler Brown : Yes. Okay. And just my last one here, a couple of housekeeping items. But based on what we know today, what is the expected M&A rollover benefit next year? And then based on what we know today with the RNG and the polymers, what is the incremental benefit to 2024 EBITDA from those? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So first on the rollover, based on transactions that have closed to date, that'd be about 50 basis points of rollover into 2024. And then just on polymer centers and the renewable natural gas, you can think of polymer centers kind of the $12 million or so incremental contribution next year from an EBITDA perspective. and things circa $15 million to $20 million on the RNG portfolio. That EBITDA. Tyler Brown : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. So if the prints are right, then the economy grew 4.9% real GDP annualized for the third quarter, and it's really the consumer leading that. Can you talk about your view of the broader macro right now? And specifically, and I know you're not guiding for 2024, what kind of a volume environment we are in, on an underlying basis? Are we still in a positive volume growth environment from your view? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Listen, there's tons of uncertainty in the economy. You can look back 18 months. And then even if you look forward, do you think about 2 wars going on and lots of different dynamics, election coming up next year. The underlying -- but I think we're closer to a soft landing than we certainly were a quarter ago. if you look at the outlook, and we're planning on a positive year next year, and you heard that in our numbers and forecasts with a lot of humility baked into that in terms of things could change as uncertainty and we'll adjust according to that. . The recycling and solid waste business, the underlying volume growth in that business is kind of 50 to 100 bps. We're on the lower end of that with where construction is at. That's certainly been a soft spot. And we saw that with residential and commercial starts even last year and then earlier into this year is -- slowing down. And we're hoping that starts to anniversary and rebound. -- here. So I'd say positive environment. We're not firing on every cylinder, but we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to grow out of this thing coming into next year. Noah Kaye : Very helpful. Given the progress that you and the industry have made in reducing some of the volatility around recycling commodities and the impact of the business. Just Curious to know how to think about whether as it relates to the polymer center or any of the vertical integration efforts you have, what the level of exposure is to commodities in that business? . In other words, is this largely a processing and fee-based model for you? And is there any increased sensitivity to be expected from that? Jon Vander Ark : No. The model is constructed. We're really making money on the spread and so that's one thing that we -- when we did this investment, we were very sensitive to that we're not adding to the volatility of the overall profile. So could there be spots on the margin, of course. But in general, this isn't something where we're increasing our exposure. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, because you have that underlying commodity risk, as you get the value of the upside tackling you capture that spread, you have the same amount of volatility in dollars with incremental revenue. So as a percentage of volatility actually goes down. Noah Kaye : Right, right. So it's really an infrastructure and spread play. Okay. That's really helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much. On the ES side, US Ecology used to have a decent exposure to the auto industry given its Michigan density. So how are we sort of weathering what's going on with the strikes and that business? Jon Vander Ark : Reasonably well. There's been some slowdown in activity in certain spots. But as you can kind of read from the headlines, right? It's been walkouts on certain facilities to the point where if it was a mass shutdown, right, we'd have a much deeper impact because it would be all the automotive plants that we serve directly, but then it goes straight into the Tier 1, Tier 2 and even Tier 3 supply base. It's been such a case, I mean, we're a very, very small portion of the overall cost structure. So you're not seeing people going to get down to canceling service or even reducing service intervals outside of a few facilities that have been directly impacted. Michael Hoffman : And then, dwell on the RNG accounting since you're doing mostly partnerships. Is this going to be an add back into the EBITDA, or how are you going to account for this as we see printed financial statements? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. As we do the reconciliation, Michael, moving from net income to the definition of EBITDA, we will include our pickup in those joint ventures. Remember that, this first round of facilities that are coming online, most of those are going to be predominantly royalty, so you're not going to see a lot of that in 2024. That will start being 2025 and beyond, that you'll really start to see the accounting that includes the pickup in those JVs. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Great. That's what I needed. And just one last, you had a great margin expansion and yet you're reaffirming the guidance. It seems like you're then expecting a lot more seasonality in 4Q given the strength of the margins or we're at least at the very top end of the range. That's sort of where I - ? Jon Vander Ark : I'd say, we have a positive outlook. Yeah, we're already in Q4, obviously, and we've got a positive outlook for that. But given that there is some seasonality of the business, where you do get some weather to start to impact the business this time of year, given there are some moving pieces in the broader economy, we thought it would be prudent to reaffirm and we'll give you the results here in February, how we finish. Brian DelGhiaccio : But to that point, Michael, if you remember, even when we began the year, said the cadence of margin expansion was going to actually start negative, which we saw in the first quarter. And sequentially, year-over-year margin expansion was going to improve every quarter throughout the year, and we still expect that. So we still expect to see the most amount of margin expansion in the fourth quarter, ultimately driving margin expansion for the full year. Michael Hoffman : But margins might be down sequentially just because of seasonality. Jon Vander Ark : That is correct. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That's what I want to clarify. All right. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead. David Manthey : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. So acquisitions were 1.7% in the third quarter. You said 50 basis points for 2024. It looks like maybe couple of hundred million rolled off third quarter to fourth quarter last year. So we're looking at, what, maybe 150 basis points in the fourth quarter this year? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. Remember, when we talked about most of the rollover that we had for full year 2023 was the portion of US Ecology that we completed May of 2022 right? Coming in, which was a majority of the rollover for the full year. As we think about the actual impact within the fourth quarter, we're looking about 180 basis points. David Manthey : Okay. All right. Thank you for that. And second, on the RNG development. I think around now is when these facilities were scheduled to come online and maybe you could just remind me the financial targets and how those 39 RNG facilities with the BP joint venture are expected to ramp from here? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. So let me just talk about the entire portfolio rather than just the subset, right? So again, five have already come online here that are going to start contributing here nominally in the fourth quarter, but really start to contribute in 2024. You can kind of think about the cadence in the $20 million to $25 million per year of incremental EBITDA beginning in 2024 and ultimately hitting run rate $28 million at which point we expect $100 million cumulative of additional EBITDA in the portfolio compared to our current baseline. . David Manthey : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. I'm wondering if we could just talk about the margin opportunity over the course of 2024, Brian, as you pointed out, margin momentum on a seasonally adjusted basis is accelerating this year. So you're already on track to expand margins by, call it, a full 30, 40 basis points just on a run rate 3Q versus the full year average. And so as we think about the moving pieces in 2024, I guess it's not hard to get to double your normal margin expansion targets, especially given the moves in -- potential moves in OCC. And I'm wondering, anything that we need to keep in mind as we look at those moving pieces and the cadence of margins that you pointed out in an answer to an earlier question? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. So Jerry, the one thing I would point out is just remember from the point in time in which we acquired US Ecology and we took several pricing actions, right? And as we sit there and move forward, we're going to get more in the cadence of more of an annual price increase on that portion of the business. So while we still expect margin expansion in the Environmental Solutions business and at a rate north or higher than what we expect in recycling and waste. We would expect that margin expansion to decelerate from what you saw in 2023. So you can look in -- just in the quarter alone, margin was up almost 400 basis points year-over-year. We would not expect that level of contribution going forward. Jerry Revich : Got it. But the base business, the momentum, it sounds like is accelerating, excluding ES. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, correct. I mean if you take a look just right now, we're kind of in the 30 basis points. We talked long term in that 30 to 50, and you start to get some of the contribution from some of the other sustainability investments that we're making. So it's a little bit of push and pull and net-net, we would expect margin expansion in 2024 over 2023. Jerry Revich : Okay. Super. And can we talk about capital deployment with the buyback announcement. Can you just update us on how much more runway do you think you have to deploy more capital towards polymers, opportunities to redevelop gas electric plants into gas plants and stock buyback from there? Can you just calibrate us on how to think about the opportunities in each of those areas? Brian DelGhiaccio : Sure. Just to give you an idea, if we've talked about, right, several investments, you've got the RNG portfolio, you've got polymer center and you have Blue Polymers, some of which is going to come through capital, some of which is going to be the investment in the JVs just to kind of think it from a cumulative perspective here, maybe I'll walk through each from polymer centers, we see a total investment of around $300 million, okay, for the four centers. right? And that's going to happen, right? It's happened, and we think that's over a four-year time frame of about $70 million a year. Blue Polymers, you can think of that being about $160 million investment. And again, those are going to be JVs. So that will come through as an investment in those joint ventures. And then the investment in the RNG portfolio is all around $375 million, okay? So those are the cumulative investments, but we've been making those investments. So those are somewhat in our run rate. Now -- and we talked about that after the US Ecology acquisition, where leverage elevates to 3.4 times, we were going to focus on deleveraging, getting back to that three times before we resume the share repurchase, got back to 2.9 times. We have since resumed, right, that share repurchase program. And as you just saw in the announcement, right, the Board just authorized another $3 billion program that extends over the next three years beginning in 2024 through the end of 2026. Jerry Revich : Super. Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : You bet. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Good afternoon. Stephanie Moore : Hey, guys. I appreciate the color so far in kind of 2024 outlook and just now on kind of the margin opportunity, too. But, maybe could you talk a little bit about your views on inflation in 2024? Not necessarily hard numbers, but kind of buckets of areas where you think some inflationary pressures maybe could linger from 2023, or -- on the other side of that, should abate versus 2023. Just trying to think of those puts and takes would be helpful. Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. I think for most categories, kind of thinking about macro metric like CPPI kind of puts you in the right zone. Maintenance will be elevated off of that, just historically, it's inflated a little faster than that. And we don't expect the supply chain to be fully caught up or reconcile in 2024, which means we're going to be driving some older equipment, and that's going to be at the end of the curve where maintenance cost is higher than it normally would be. So that would be the one, I think, is going to be elevated. Everything else kind of think about that, where you see inflation going? And if that's 4%, 4.5%, whatever that plans, that's kind of where we'll build a budget against that. Stephanie Moore : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the commodity basket exposure. Can you talk a little bit about how that basket is trending today? Maybe how that compares to 4Q of last year? I know there's some puts and takes to the various components. So that would be helpful. Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, sure. So as we said, our average commodity price for the third quarter was $112 per ton. Right now, we're expecting about $10 in the fourth quarter. That compared in the prior year for the fourth quarter, we were at $88 per ton. So we're expecting a year-over-year increase of about $30 a ton in the fourth quarter. Stephanie Moore : Guy, I'll leave it at that. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist. Please go ahead. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. To kind of follow-up on a recent question, but ask it from a different angle. If you think about some of the pressures on margins smaller players that might be potential acquisition targets. How do you anticipate trends in a few buckets impacting their financial performance and maybe desire to sell? And I kind of -- I'm thinking of inflation in terms of their costs, the ongoing requirement and necessity to invest in technology. And then as you just mentioned, I think fleet and supply chain won't fully be normalized. But if you apply those things to sort of the other side of the equation, not your own business, but those that you may look to incorporate in your business, what do you see? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. The pipeline for acquisitions is strong, both in recycling and Waste and Environmental Solutions. This is the cost pressure, which is started to abate for the smaller players is on the labor side. So they're starting to get less pressure there as we've seen turnover come down and labor availability go up. It's still elevated versus historical norm, but it's gotten easier relative to a year ago. The supply chain hasn't and that's certainly becoming constrained. And anybody who was a spot buyer of vehicles is really in a challenged spot certainly through the end of next year and probably in 2025 or 2026, depending on how they -- how fast the supply chain can recover because they're prioritizing all of their base customers who buy a large number and a similar number of trucks every year. So we certainly see that as an advantage. And then digital, I'd say, has just been a building trend over the last five-plus years that I think is going to be with us for at least the next five and probably a much longer period than that, which is that we're making over a series of years, between capital and OpEx hundreds of millions of dollars of investment to our digital footprint to make the experience better for our customers and employees, and that certainly has a scale advantage for us. and also a skill advantage of investing in the resources we want to take those technologies and apply them in a way that make our customers' lives and employees lives better. Tobey Sommer : And then just as my follow-up. I know it's been in the news, maybe even too much ad nauseam. But GLP-1s in the market, looking for second, third, fourth, all the way to nth derivative impacts. Have you looked at that in have any sort of preliminary view on what that could mean for volumes over what would probably be a very long-term? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : No. We've not done a lot of work on that yet, plenty in front of us right now, obviously, is that continues to be a major trend. We'll think about that. But I'd say we're in the tertiary or beyond in terms of the impact of those. Tobey Sommer : I appreciate the response. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Just in regards to the M&A pipeline within Environmental Services, I think up here in Canada, there's been the Competition Bureau is trying to prevent the merger to I guess, I'll call them energy waste service companies here. So it looks like there'll be some assets. Just wondering how the pipeline looks up here in Canada. And -- and is energy waste services in an area of growth for you or accelerated growth for you when you look at your opportunities in Canada? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We're certainly looking at opportunities in both U.S. and Canada. That probably isn't at the top of the list. We'd be more opportunistic in that side of environmental services. Kevin Chiang : Okay. And just I get the pricing, I guess, it sounds like the pricing opportunities that you're going to move from something that you're doing it three, four times a year within environmental services to once a year, which is maybe more regular as inflation starts to or continues to subside here. But just given the pricing opportunities that you've talked about and the ability to get pricing more aligned with how you think about pricing within solid waste, just why not push that lever more if you can, or did you feel the customers were starting to push back on maybe the frequency in which you are coming to them with price increases within ES? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah. No. I mean, yes, it's a big and diverse space. So there's been places where we've pushed past the price line we would have wanted to. We've lost some volume, which I congratulate the team, obviously. You don't understand the sealing on price until you take it there. And listen, in certain parts of the business, we'll get into more of an annual increase for our bigger customers that's contracted, for example. In other parts of the business, particularly the more field facing field services, those are things where it's really dynamic pricing, because every opportunity event job, you've got a lot more flexibility there. And we'll certainly test the market and see what the market bears in terms of opportunity. I'd say underneath that, too, there's a big mix opportunity, which is just looking at the types of jobs we do, looking at the customer mix and making sure we're prioritizing our sales team around the most attractive customers and then conversely deprioritizing around customers who aren't willing to pay what we think is a very fair value for what we deliver. Kevin Chiang : That makes a ton of sense. Thanks for taking my question, and best of luck as you get through this year. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Betsy. I would like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their continued commitment to providing our customers with first-class service to create a more sustainable world. Have a good evening and be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending, you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Evans, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Aaron Evans : I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services fourth quarter and full year 2023 conference call. Jon Vander Ark, our CEO; and Brian DelGhiaccio, our CFO, are on the call today to discuss our performance.

I want to point out that our SEC filings, our earnings press release, which includes GAAP reconciliation tables and a discussion of business activities, along with the recording of this call are available on Republic's website at republicservices.com. I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Republic team finished the year strong by executing our strategy designed to profitably grow the business. We outpaced expectations throughout the year and deliver results that exceeded our full year guidance. During 2023, we achieved revenue growth of 11%, including 5% from acquisitions; generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 60 basis points, including margin expansion in the underlying business of 100 basis points; reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.61; and produced $1.99 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to believe that investing in value-creating acquisitions to further expand our business is the best use of our free cash flow. We invested $1.8 billion in acquisitions in 2023, including transactions in both the recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The results we are generating are made possible by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiated capabilities. Regarding customer zeal. Our efforts to provide industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained high at over 94% and we continue to see favorable trends in our Net Promoter Score due to the value of our offerings and quality of our service delivery. We delivered outsized organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter with simultaneous increases in price and volume. Core price and related revenue was 8.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.7%. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 40 basis points. Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continued to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and employees. Development of our new asset management system is underway, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhanced warranty recovery. We expect to begin utilizing the new system in late 2024. The continued operational enhancements supported by our RISE digital operations platform are expected to drive additional productivity through improved route optimization and safety performance and provide more predictable service delivery to our customers. We anticipate the RISE platform will drive approximately $100 million of total annual earnings contribution, of which approximately $65 million has been realized to date. We continue to implement advanced technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfill containers and contamination and recycling containers. This technology is reducing contamination and driving incremental revenue. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewable natural gas are a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities remain on track. We are finalizing commissioning at our Las Vegas Polymer Center this week. Delivery of plastic flake to our offtake partners is expected in the coming weeks. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Power Center. This development will be co-located with Blue Polymers production facility and construction at the site is expected to be completed in late 2024. The renewable gas projects being co-developed with our partners continue to advance. Five projects came online in 2023, and we expect at least eight additional projects to be completed in 2024. We continue to advance our efforts to support decarbonization, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 11 electric collection vehicles in operation. We expect more than 50 additional EVs will be added to our recycling and waste collection fleet in 2024. We have six facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure, with more than 40 additional sites in various stages of development. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continue to strive to be a workplace with the best people from all background who want to work. In 2023, employee engagement improved a score of 86 with 90% -- 99% of employees participating in the survey. Turnover rates continue to turn lower with full year turnover improving 400 basis points compared to the prior year. As a result, we are better staffed to optimize our operations and capitalize on growth opportunities in the market Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the eighth consecutive year. Our 2023 results clearly demonstrate our ability to create sustainable value and our ongoing investments to strengthen the foundation from which we will continue to grow our business. With respect to 2024, we expect to deliver outsized profitable growth while continuing to make investments in the business to drive lasting value creation. More specifically, we expect full year revenue in a range of $16.1 billion to $16.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $4.825 billion to $4.875 billion. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.94 to $6, generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion. Our pipeline supports continued acquisition activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions. We are targeting at least $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2024. Our 2024 financial guidance includes the rollover contribution from acquisitions that closed in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter and year. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.2% in the fourth quarter. Core price on related revenue was 8.8%, which included open market pricing of 10.6% and restricted pricing of 6%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.3%, large container of 8.6% and residential of 8.2%. Average yield on total revenue was 6.3% and average yield on related revenue was 7.7%. In 2024, we expect average yield on total revenue in a range of 5.5% to 6%. We expect average yield on related revenue in a range of 6.5% to 7%. Yield is expected to step down sequentially during 2024 due to relatively lower index-based pricing and certain fees implemented throughout 2023, which begin to anniversary. Fourth quarter volume on total revenue increased 30 basis points and volume on related revenue increased 40 basis points. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 20 basis points and an increase in landfill of 7.4%. Landfill was primarily driven by a 12.7% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.4% and a decrease in landfill C&D volume of 2.1%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. In 2024, we expect organic volume growth in a range of flat to positive 50 basis points. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $131 per ton during the fourth quarter. This compared to $88 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 50 basis points during the quarter. 2023 full year commodity prices were $117 per ton. This compared to $170 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $135 per ton, which is the baseline used in our 2024 guidance. Now turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 19.7%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 260 basis points to 29.9%, which was driven by margin expansion in the underlying business of 230 basis points. Other changes in margin performance during the quarter included a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point increase from net fuel, which was partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease from acquisitions. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.7%, which represents margin expansion of 60 basis points, compared to the prior year. In 2024, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 30%. We expect to more than overcome a 30 basis point headwind from acquisitions. Depreciation, amortization and accretion, was 10.7% of revenue in 2023 and is expected to be approximately 11% of revenue in 2024. Full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow was $1.99 billion, an increase of 14%, compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business and the positive contribution from changes in working capital. Total debt at the end of the year was $13 billion and total liquidity was $2.7 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 2.9 times. We expect net interest expense of approximately $545 million in 2024. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.1% during the fourth quarter and 24.8% for the full year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 26% in 2024, made-up of an adjusted tax rate of 20% and approximately $190 million of non-cash charges from equity investments in renewable energy. The expected increase in interest expense and taxes would result in a $0.20 EPS headwind in 2024. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about margins. In the fourth quarter, I know you mentioned a couple of factors, the commodities and fuel costs. But maybe just talk about how margins were so far ahead of the guide and what factors could continue into 2024, that could provide upside to the guidance there? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Sure. Yes. Team had a really strong fourth quarter. Lots of things went in our favor, managed the middle of the P&L well. There were some one-time opportunities both on MSW and a very strong special waste fourth quarter. On that, that we felt good with, weather was actually very positive in the fourth quarter, which has slipped here in the first quarter of the year. So I feel great about that. And then, we've got a lot of momentum headed into 2023. Some of the event-based work, you can't build a budget against that, right? You've got to look at that as a potential upside, which we're going to go after those opportunities. But oftentimes, an election year, some of those jobs end up pushing and rolling forward. So we're not going to build a plan based on that outsized performance that we got in Q4, but still looking at a very positive year in 2024. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. And Toni, we had mentioned all year long that we expected margin expansion to sequentially improve quarter-on-quarter, ending the year with the highest level of margin expansion compared to the prior year. So, that played out exactly as we thought. Now, the margin expansion itself was a little bit stronger than we originally anticipated. But ending the year with that type of performance and the type of margin expansion in the - over 200 basis points was in line with the way we thought it would end. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. Wanted to ask about environmental services. Maybe just talk about what you're seeing in the different pieces there. And I think there's a little bit flattish in the quarter. So, does that turn around next year? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Most of the flatness is based on the comp. We had a really, really strong Q4 and 2022 that we were covering. Look, there is some slowdown in parts of that business, so rig counts are down, and that part of the opportunity in there. We've had a facility that we shut down to turnaround that we're going to reopen here in the middle of the year. So, that will provide some incremental lift, and that was closed in the fourth quarter. And then we continue to -- we'll trade price over volume where we need to. So, we've turned out some less profitable customers on that and feel really good about the book and the pipeline going forward. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong end of the year there. Maybe just on the 2024 guidance, the implied kind of 30, 40 basis points of margin expansion, reported market expansion you're guiding to. Is there a way to think about how that splits between solid waste and ES? Is it pretty balanced between the two? Or would you expect 1 to maybe outperform the other end as you look at into 2024 here? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Look, overall, I would sit there and say that we expect margin expansion in both of the business types. We're expecting just as -- when you take a look in basis points, a little bit more on the ES side, the Environmental Solutions side, but it is still relatively balanced between the two. Just given the sheer size of the recycling and waste business relative to the Environmental Solutions business, it will drive a majority of the overall expansion when you think about the enterprise taken as a whole. Kevin Chiang : That's helpful. And maybe just my follow-up question. Just looking at the - your yield volume table that you provided in your disclosure. Just I noticed the strong yield in residential volumes, maybe a little bit worse than recent terms. Just wondering if you could provide some color in terms of what's happening there? And if you're -- as you mentioned earlier, are you maybe being more purposeful in shedding maybe lower quality volume to the benefit of good yield in the fourth quarter? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, we're always purposeful in trading our price versus volume. I'd say in this quarter, there was a couple of contracts that went out to bid that we did -- a rate that we thought was going to cover our costs and give us a fair return. We lost those opportunities. And then in previous quarters, we've had some nice wins, right? And these things come in fits and spurts. So, we didn't have anything in that quarter. That's really the combination of those two things drives the volume picture. On the pricing side, this is the manifestation of high CPI and the alternative indices over the last couple of years really flowing through our pricing, which is great to see. That's challenged part of the yield story historically and to see that number we were really pleased with. Kevin Chiang : Excellent. I'll leave it there. Again, congrats on a good sets of results there. Jon Vander Ark : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Please go ahead. Bryan Burgmeier : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just following up on Tony's question. I think margins typically expect kind of quarter-over-quarter from 4Q to 1Q. I imagine that will be a little bit more flattish this year. Just if you can identify maybe some of the factors weighing 1Q margins or more broadly like why historical seasonality might not apply? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Bryan, what I would say is that when you talk about historical seasonality, I think you have to go back before just the last several years kind of post-pandemic. I think you have to look at a broader data set there. So -- when we came into this year, we said this year, we thought it was going to have what we would call a normal level of seasonality. And when you take a look at what that means, that would -- typically, when you look at margin performance, you would have peak margin performance in Q2 and Q3 during the summer months where you're getting some more of those seasonal volumes, in particular, on the landfill side followed by Q4. And then finally, the first quarter would seasonally be your lowest margin performance, and that's what we've seen for decades. And so we said that at the beginning of the year, that's kind of what played out. And that's what I would say we would also expect going into 2024 based on what we see right now. So, we would expect a sequential step down in margin from Q4 to Q1, in part, you've got more winter months when you're dealing with the first quarter as well as when you just think about some of the taxes, you have your highest burden from a labor perspective in the first quarter, and those tend to max out and as you move through the balance of the year, again, some of more of those state and local taxes, then those basically reach their max in the first quarter. Jon Vander Ark : And we had weather, right? We had mild weather in Q4 of last year. We had pretty intense weather in January, where we've lost some certainly some haulage and some tons. Some of that will come back, but some of that will get pushed out through the remainder of the year. So that's what will lead to Q4 number that probably looks -- our Q1 number, that product is more flat than historically might have. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it. Got it. Thanks for all that detail. And then just following up on M&A, with the deals you completed in 4Q, did you provide a rough split for how that is divided up between the two segments? And did you provide a rollover contribution to 2024 revenue in guidance? Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Roll over contribution will be about 200 basis points from deals closed in 2023 that will have a rollover impact into 2024. Just on the split from a revenue active, it was about $200 million on the environmental solutions of the annualized revenue acquired in the fourth quarter, and about $140 million on the recycling waste side. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it. Thanks a lot. I'll turn it over. Operator : The next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to follow-up on M&A here. A big year for you in terms of deals done, I think, $1.86 billion they're acquired. And I was wondering if you could give us an update on, first of all, what the pipeline looks like going forward, particularly relative to such a large year this past year. And then second is in terms of integration, will you be focusing a bit more given how big the year was in 2023 on integration and perhaps put a little bit on -- touch a little bit on how that integration is going? Or do you see room and capacity to continue at a fairly heavy space pace here in terms of M&A for 2024. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, we look at two things. Obviously, the strategic fit and the financial return on any type of deal, and we're going to stay disciplined on both of those things. Are we the natural owner? And does it meet our expectation in terms of cash and cash returns. And then we do think about our ability to absorb it unless we have a lot of capacity across the enterprise. We wouldn't necessarily do a couple of big deals in the in the same part of the country at the same time because the local team does play a pretty strong role in that day-to-day integration activity.  Last year was the product of our normal tuck-ins, which we've done forever, and those are very value creating. It's hard to do those deals poorly because we've done it for so long. And then some nice kind of medium-sized deals. we build a plan, right, anticipated what those medium-sized dealers are going to be there, not that we're not pursuing it, but you just don't know when they're going to move or when they're going to come. So, that's predicated on step down in our expectation this year for what we\u2019ve done. It's not because the pipeline is weaker -- pipeline is strong, but we never know exactly what we're going to close, and we're going to stay disciplined. Walter Spracklin : Got it. That's great color. And just for my follow-up, turning to recycling. I know your Las Vegas Polymer Center opened in December. Can you talk a bit about the build-out on the polymer center -- and I don't know if you've had enough time now to assess, but do you see this as a better investment than kind of -- or not better, but how do you -- how does that compare to EPR projects in terms of the return profile of that one? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We're very satisfied with both the execution and the return. We're pretty conservative in terms of our financial modeling leaving ourselves room and we feel very good about the demand in the marketplace, we could have sold out Las Vegas five times over upfront. And the pricing expectations are ahead of what we modeled. So the returns are going to come in, again, ahead of our expectations on that front. And that's certainly given us confidence as we talked about in the prepared remarks to go to Indy, and then we're planning on at least two more across the country. Walter Spracklin : Fantastic. Appreciate the time. Operator : The next question is from John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Mazzoni : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick one on pricing. Could you just remind us how the restricted book will layer through 2024especially with sort of the lag effects in CPI? Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, one of the things I mentioned with respect to the cadence from a pricing perspective in my prepared remarks is we do expect a sequential step down in the level of pricing throughout the year, primarily due to the impact that, that index pricing will have. So again, we expect to report the highest level of average yield in Q1 and the lowest level in Q4 with a step down in between. Just to give you a little bit of perspective, when you take a look at the two primary components that may make up our basket that are related to some sort of index, one being headline CPI and then the other being the alternative indices. And when you take a look at headline CPI, right, it saw its peak in June of 2022, and has been stepping down sequentially since. Water, sewer, trash and garbage trash saw peak levels in August of 23 and have been stepping down since then. Now, that said, the water sewer trash and garbage trash still remain at elevated levels, water sewer trash the recent print was 5.5% and garbage trash was 6.4%. So we're still pretty pleased about the level, but it is going to sit there and step down just due to the math. John Mazzoni : Great. Thank you. And maybe for a quick follow-up. Could you just talk to the strength in small container, especially with the 11.2% yield? It seems like that's kind of update the average? And any other thing you're seeing within that kind of end market and any other commentary around anything different that you've done compared to peers? Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Sure. Yes, we rolled out some new technology around AI, which helps us spot contamination and also helps us assess overages when the containers are overfilled. And that certainly contributed to the small container performance. Again, underlying pricing was great, but that put it on top. And that's why we talked about our 2024 number. We expect to anniversary that in the second half of the year, so that will come down a bit. John Mazzoni : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hey, guys. I've always challenged for that full cycle, people, whatever. So free cash flow and the guide is at about 7% in the midpoint versus the top line at 7.9% and EBITDA is at $9.1 million. I'm presuming we've got higher interest expense and probably higher cash taxes because you're not counting on bonus depreciation being retroactively reverted back to 100%. Is that how I think about the bridge between the growth rates through the P&L? Brian DelGhiaccio : That's correct, Michael. If you just take taxes alone, when you take a look at two components. So one, we are assuming that the current loss stays in place, which means bonus depreciation we'll sit there and have a further headwind 2024 compared to 2023. Combined with the settlement we had with the IRS in 2023, where we received $20 million of cash back to a matter that dates back to 2017. Combined, those two create a $45 million headwind in cash taxes, that alone is a 2.3% headwind to year-over-year growth on free cash flow. So you just take taxes alone and you'd sit there and say you'd be kind of 9.5% growth in free cash flow or not for the impact of taxes. Interest, to your point, would just is going to be a further. Michael Hoffman : All right. And that was what I was trying to get at. Is the underlying cash growth is there and you've got some timing issues related to What we just discussed? Okay. On margin\u2026 Brian DelGhiaccio : And Michael, to that point, from an underlying business perspective, the growth in free cash flow is double digit. Michael Hoffman : Right. Okay. That's, I think, important. And then on margins, I think there's another sort of message to potentially to be drawn out. So your pattern in your solid waste business, given the shield scale of managing price costs as you're being pretty ratably able to deliver all 30 basis points. So, if the whole company is doing 30 and you've got an M&A headwind and act environmental comes in is a nice add in ES, but it's probably pretty dilutive. So how do we think about that EES to dilution? It's much better structurally ex that dilution is what I think, which-- Brian DelGhiaccio : Just to give you a perspective, if you look across, right, both business types, we're expecting 30 basis points of dilution from acquisitions. And we would expect dilution from an acquisition perspective in both recycling and waste and Environmental Solutions. If you're looking at the underlying business itself within ES, we're expecting over 100 basis points of margin expansion in the Environmental Solutions business due to the underlying business itself. Michael Hoffman : Right. And about 30 in solid waste and then a net in the total company dilution, but it's greater in ES than it is in solid waste. It's just one size of the deal relative to the base? Brian DelGhiaccio : That's correct. Michael Hoffman : Yes. Okay. I think that's important to draw that, you're still on that track of 25% or better margins at ES, ex acquisitions and the acquisitions will then contribute to that as you integrate them? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Michael Hoffman : Yes. Okay. Cool. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks Jon. Can you talk to us about this new asset management system that you're putting in place? What are you functionally doing? And where does that ultimately show up in the P&L? Is it maintenance and repairs? What kind of savings are we talking about with the system? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. It's really the RISE platform. Think about digitizing our operations from our logistic operation all the way through our fleet and how our drivers operate every day. But this brings this to the maintenance shop. And so, now rather than moving paper around, right, when the driver does their vehicle condition report before they take off in the morning that digitally flows and is recorded into the maintenance organization. So they're dealing with tablets as well. So they're getting out of the paper-based business. And a big driver of that is the productivity benefit to that for sure, but then there's also the warranty recovery element of that. Because when you're chasing paper that becomes a very manual process, when you could do this digitally, it allows you to quickly understand but warranty is available? Are you fully claiming all the parts that are warranty eligible and allowing us to get full recovery? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. When you think about the linkage, so a couple of years ago, we started on our journey of modernizing our core systems, and that started with our general ledger and procurement systems. This is an extension of that. So the asset management system will be directly linked and integrated on a common platform with our procurement system. So, now you can sit there and say, from the point of PO all the way to putting something on a truck, you can sit there and you can track that part. So to Jon's point on warranty management, this is something before we had to do very manually, which means that we had a lot of leakage in the system. Now, we feel very confident that we're going to get every single portion of that warranty that we're entitled to. Noah Kaye : Very nice. Just a quick housekeeping one. You've already detailed the expectations for yield through 2024. But just your comments around weather, tough volume comps for 1Q and you just mentioned the weather flipped to be a little bit of a drag here to start we all felt that cold. So how do we think about kind of the volume trends Q-to-date and how that trends through the year? Brian DelGhiaccio : Look, I mean, the good news, right, is that while January, we did experience quite a bit of weather, we have seen most of that volume return, not a total recovery, but we saw what we would expected in February so far to-date. We're guiding to flat to 50 basis point positive Q1, may be kind of the low point of that because of the weather. But I would think of it relatively ratable that type of cadence throughout the year. Noah Kaye : Okay. And in an environment where your yield is decelerating year-over-year at a pretty, pretty shallow step down, you can get the market expansion that we're looking for without a lot of volume contribution. So, you let the value of the upside to where margins came from? So, the basic take way. Jon Vander Ark : Correct. Noah Kaye : All right. Thanks very much. I will hand over. Operator : The next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Jon Vander Ark : Hi, Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : Hey, there. I wanted to touch a bit on maybe the underlying macro environment, probably a decent follow-up to the prior question. You called out some weakness in the quarter on landfill C&D volumes. I don't think any of us would be really surprised to hear that. But maybe any other areas you might be seeing weakness or other levels of strength of the opposite? And then what is the kind of the underlying macro assumption embedded in the 2024 guidance? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I think the picture is mixed. So again, we're planning on having a strong year. If you think about the direct things, we talked about weather, certainly housing, interest rates being high, mortgage rates being high, housing activity is certainly a byproduct or depressed housing activity as a byproduct to that. So, we would have hoped for a quicker recovery there, both for our business and because we need more homes in the United States, but we think that will be more delayed towards the later end of the year. So we're not planning a robust recovery on that front. And then if you think about the other macros, the manufacturing, I think, is a mixed picture. We see pockets where while we're winning business, there's some service declines in certain subsectors of manufacturing, but other places in terms of remediation projects and other things have been very, very strong. PFAS is a nice contributor to the business in 2023, and we've got a good pipeline in 2024. And then the macro have two wars going on, right, one in Israel, one in the doorstep of Europe. Credit card debt is high with consumers. So we have a cautious kind of macro perspective on that but the underlying demand signals for our business are largely positive. Stephanie Moore : Great. No, that's helpful. And then you touched on this a little bit, but if you could kind of walk through kind of what you've seen from the cost inflation standpoint, clearly getting better, but some of those clear headwinds that we saw through most of 2023, kind of how those are trending now to start 2024? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, certainly stepping down operating labor, clearly stepping down year-over-year. Transportation is stepping down. Maintenance has been a little bit stickier and most of that is the fact that we're growing and we're driving a fleet that's aging just because the supply chain is still a little congested and we're not getting all the trucks that we wanted. And it's really been a three-year phenomenon in that front. So, we're going to catch up some in this year, but we're not going to fully catch up on that. And all that is when you're driving a 12, 13-year-old truck, right, with a kind of a peak cycle in terms of its maintenance versus a new truck that has relatively high warranty recovery, and so therefore, very low maintenance cost, that's going to show up in the underlying maintenance bucket. So that spend will be, we think, elevated throughout the year. We hope we do a little better, but we'll speak. Stephanie Moore : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I would just love to continue the conversation on the cost side. I mean, really impressive in the quarter, your cost per unit were up just 1% year-over-year. So, I'm wondering where are you starting to see deflation. It sounds like the tailwind from better equipment availability still in front of us. So I'm wondering what's gotten better for you folks already in the fourth quarter numbers? And then Brian, I'm wondering if you just put a finer point on the comments that you made about yield slowing over the course of the year on comps. Do you expect to exit the year with price cost spread still favorable fourth quarter versus fourth quarter? Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Yes, Jerry, so Jon mentioned one of them already is our labor has continued to improve, right, really throughout the year. In part, that's just due to a reduction in turnover, right, that we've seen. And so again, when you just take a look at the impact that turnover has, there's a hiring cost of bringing someone else, well, which is a productivity impact. A newer driver just tends not to be as productive as those that have some tenure. And so we're starting to see as the turnover rates have come down. We're seeing that kind of come through that labor line item, which has had a positive impact. So I would say that's where we've seen some of the biggest improvements. Together, we mentioned throughout the year, some of the impact that transportation cost it had, these were things where we had multiyear agreements. They came up for renewal in the second half of 2022. And we said that we took some pretty big price increases and that they were going to comp out in the second half of 2023. And we've certainly seen that. So I would say those are some of the tailwinds we've seen it from a cost perspective. The maintenance has stayed relatively sticky in kind of that 7% to 8% type cost increase range year-over-year. To your question just on the price/cost spread, I would say the say we expect the biggest or the most positive impact between that in the first quarter. We expect that to modulate throughout the year, but still price exceeding cost by the time we exit 2024. Jerry Revich : Okay. Super. And then nice progress on a $100 million efficiency program, how much progress did you make in 2023 specifically and the remaining $35 million of productivity improvement -- when do you expect -- how much of an improvement do you expect in 2024 relative to that remaining $35 million? Brian DelGhiaccio : Approximately about $10 million or the main $35 million. Jerry Revich : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Tobey Sommer with Truist. Please go ahead. Jack Wilson : Yes. Good evening. This is Jack Wilson on for Tobey. Can we double click on sort of the state of the fleet and specifically fleet electrification in the long-term and sort of where you see that going? Jon Vander Ark : Sure. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that -- we right now, we'll have a $50 million to that this year. We'll be at several hundred next year and climbing our path, that's going to start in residential, and then it will move into small container overtime. And we've got a really thoughtful strategy in terms of how we roll that out. I mentioned the infrastructure side of that as well it's not just a truck, right? It's a system. So you need to understand the infrastructure. You need to understand the incentives. You need to understand the customer or willingness to pay for the vehicle. And if we feel the trucks that we've had delivered out of our partnership with OshKosh, those trucks are working very, very well. So we're excited to see the next 50 come into the fleet. Jack Wilson : Okay. Thank you for that color there. And then just as a follow-up, can we sort of dig into the moving parts of volume? Are there any sort of specific geographies or market segments that are especially volatile or changing? Jon Vander Ark : No, I mentioned the housing piece, large-container temp. That's been certainly soft, as we're not putting up as many new houses as we need and even for Movement, People are kind of keeping their existing mortgage rates and are reluctant to move. And oftentimes, we see move we see remodeling activity or other ancillary opportunities and large container temp, and that's been muted. We don't think that will last forever here, but we're planning on a relatively benign year this year, looking to 2025 to see that accelerate. Jack Wilson : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds. Please go ahead. Tony Bancroft : Thanks for the question. Nice job on the quarter. Just some more color maybe you mentioned PFAS remediation. Could you just maybe talk about what is going on currently at your landfills or whatever you're doing regarding PFAS and what could that maybe just a general idea what could that business look like opportunity-wise going forward?. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We think we've got a very compelling offering for customers in an end-to-end solution. So we can hand all the way from the assessment to the frontline remediation doing our field service work and then a range of disposal options on the back end, whether that's into hazardous landfill, whether that's in deep well, some of that waste can be profiled and then put into a solid waste landfill as well, and you're seeing some of that flow through our special ways. So that's measured in the tens of millions. If you look at last year -- this year, it will be the high end of tens of millions or potentially tipping into a nine-digit number in terms of revenue. So this is a real growth opportunity for us. And this is all mostly people self-selecting in advance of the EPA regulations coming down as well as some of the Department of Defense work that's been accelerated on that front. So we feel like our national footprint positions us well to -- in our strategic accounts organization positions us very well to serve customers on this issue. Tony Bancroft : That's great. And then maybe switching to trucks. You talked about what's going on with EVs and the amount of deliveries coming, which sounds great. Any issues with maybe on traditional trucks and EVs on supply chain, getting those deliveries? And then just to piggyback on that one. It surprises you see any surprises in EV performance. You hear read a lot of things about how it's performing. Obviously, you're pretty well situated just based on the routing system. But just some real-time color on how those -- I guess there's only a few right now, but that's going to be growing, and I'm sure you've done a lot of testing. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. The supply chain is -- again, we're probably getting about 80% of the trucks we want over the last couple of years. And that includes the rollover from the previous year, right? So we're not continuing to fall way behind, but we haven't fully caught up yet either. But keep in mind, we've grown a lot. We're coming off our third straight year of double-digit revenue growth on that. So as we grow and do these acquisitions, that creates more demand and need for new trucks. So we see that slightly improving. I think we'll get -- we'll sort and that we'll shrink that gap as we exit 2024. I don't expect that we'll close that gap until 2025 on that front And then the EV specifically, the McNeilus truck is the first purpose-built refuse truck ever and it's electrified. And that truck is driving a full route. Most of the other EVs that we've piloted that you spend the first 60 days with a lot of software issues that you're working through, we've been really, really surprised by the performance level and the uptime of this vehicle. Working through some bugs. We're still in a test and learn environment but really promising in terms of what this is going to be able to do to operate at scale with EV. Tony Bancroft : Thank you so much. Great job. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jon Vander Ark for any closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Debbie. I would like to recognize and thank our more than 40,000 employees for their great work and commitment to serving our customers. Their efforts enabled our strong 2023 results and the continued growth of our company. Have a good evening and be safe. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our strong first quarter results demonstrate our focus on profitably growing the business. We produced revenue growth, both organically and through acquisitions, while enhancing profitability across the enterprise. During the quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 8%, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 12%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 120 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.45 and produced $535 million of adjusted free cash flow. The results we delivered are made possible by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiated capabilities. Regarding customer zeal, our efforts to provide best-in-class essential services and sustainability offerings continue to drive customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained high at over 94%, and we continue to see favorable trends in our net promoter score as customers value our broad service offerings and the quality of our service delivery. Strong organic revenue growth during the first quarter was underpinned by core price on related revenue of 8.5% and average yield on related revenue of 7.3%. This level of pricing exceeded our internal cost inflation and resulted in over 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Organic volume on related revenue declined 1.1%. Large-container and disposal volumes were negatively impacted by severe weather across most of our geographies during the first quarter. Most of the weather impact occurred in January, and we saw a notable rebound in volume performance in February and March as weather conditions normalized. Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and our employees. Our RISE digital operations platform is driving improved route optimization and safety performance and providing more predictable service delivery to our customers. Development of our new asset management system is underway, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhance warranty recovery. We expect to begin deploying the new system later this year using a phased approach, which we estimate will result in $20 million of annual cost savings by 2026. We continue to benefit from advanced technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfilled containers and contamination in recycling containers. This technology will reduce contamination in our recycling centers and is expected to generate approximately $60 million incremental annual revenue. To date, we have already achieved $30 million of annual benefit. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewable natural gas are a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities remains on track. Our Las Vegas polymer center is operational and delivery of plastic flake to our offtake partners began in March. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis polymer center with equipment installation planned to begin in June. This operation will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility. The renewable natural gas projects being codeveloped with our partners continue to advance. One project came online during the first quarter, and we expect at least 7 additional projects to be completed in 2024. We continue to advance our efforts to support decarbonization, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 15 collection vehicles in operations. We expect to have more than 50 additional EVs to be added to our fleet in 2024. We now have 7 facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure. Development of 40 additional locations is underway with more than 10 new sites expected to be completed in 2024. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be the employer of choice in the markets that we serve. Employee turnover continues to improve with our first quarter turnover rate improving 70 basis points compared to the prior year. As a result, we are better staffed to optimize our operations and capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was recently named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies List, Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies List and Fortune's Most Innovative Companies List. With respect to capital allocation, we invested $41 million in acquisitions during the first quarter. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of continued activity in both the recycling and waste and environmental solutions businesses. We continue to see opportunity for $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2024. Additionally, we returned $168 million to shareholders through dividends in the first quarter. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter. Brian Delghiaccio : Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7%. Core price on related revenue was 8.5%, which included open market pricing of 10.2% and restricted pricing of 5.7%. The components of core price on related revenue included small-container of 12.2%, large-container of 7.7% and residential of 8.1%. Average yield on total revenue was 6% and average yield on related revenue was 7.3%. First quarter volume on total revenue decreased 90 basis points and volume on related revenue decreased 1.1%. The components of our volume performance included a decrease in large-container of 4.4%, primarily due to severe weather in January, along with continued softness in construction-related activity, and a decrease in residential of 2.6%. During the quarter, landfill MSW volume was up 1.6% and small-container volume increased 30 basis points. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $153 per ton during the first quarter. This compared to $105 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 40 basis points during the quarter. Commodity prices are exceeding our initial expectations as current commodity prices are approximately $160 per ton. Now turning to our environmental solutions business. First quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $15 million compared to the prior year. The growth was due to the rollover impact from an acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the environmental solutions business was 20.5%, which compared to 21% in the prior year. After considering the dilutive impact from a recent acquisition of 110 basis points, EBITDA margin in the environmental solutions business increased 60 basis points. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter expanded 120 basis points to 30.2%, which was driven by margin expansion in the underlying business of 110 basis points. Other changes in margin performance during the quarter included a 20 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point increase from net fuel. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions. Adjusted free cash flow was $535 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow conversion was 45.9%. Total debt was $13 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.8x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments and renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.4% during the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We also received a $12 million state grant associated with renewable energy investment. This benefit was recorded in other income and added $0.03 of EPS. This did not impact EBITDA or EBITDA margin during the quarter. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Unknown Analyst : This is Adam on for Jerry today. So your first polymer center recently opened. Just wondering how that plan is tracking versus your initial expectations. Any surprises there? Jon Vander Ark : No. It probably opened a month later than we thought all around related permitting and infrastructure issues. The core operations are actually exceeding our expectation.  Shipping to customers, they think it is some of the, if not the, cleanest recycled PET flake in the world. So the facilities, the team are executing really, really well. And again, happy with our equipment providers, happy with everything, and we're up and running in Indianapolis, and we're probably -- should shortly announce our third location on the East Coast. Unknown Analyst : Terrific. And then shifting to US Ecology. Just wondering if you can update us on how you're thinking about what level of margin upside is feasible for that business once you fully integrated  the systems, just based on your experience on optimizing route profitability and pricing for your base business. What's the level of margin upside potential there? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We're targeting a 25% EBITDA margin there in the midterm and it's really going to be a series of levers, right? We're going to think about customer mix and making sure that we have customers that are willing to pay. We'll obviously think about pricing for the value we deliver on that. We'll drive additional revenue through cross-sell, which we've talked about. And the IT investments help there. They also help us manage the middle, just better labor utilization, more efficiency in terms of disposal, optimizing disposal assets and getting the material into the right spot. And then as we grow, we'll certainly get more leverage on our SG&A. So we've got a series of levers that we think get us to 25% in the midterm. Operator : The next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : You mentioned the weakness in volume related to weather. I was hoping that you could give the weather impact in the quarter? Brian Delghiaccio : We think, overall, that was about a 50 basis point drag on total volume performance. So you can think about that being down circa 1%. Half of which was weather-related and then just half more in those cyclical volumes as we talked about, construction activity and the like. Toni Kaplan : Yes. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then just wanted to ask about pricing. Strong core price again this quarter, maybe a little bit above expectation. I think you mentioned it exceeded your expectation as well. I think last quarter, you talked about trajectory of 1Q being the high point, 4Q likely being the low end. Is that still your expectation? And has anything in the inflationary backdrop changed your view on how price plays out or how good price was in the first quarter? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I think it modestly exceeded our expectations. And I think that cadence we laid out is still right as we see the -- it will sort of come down. Could we extend that a little higher as the interest rates remain high and I think inflation has been a little stickier than people expected? Yes, I think there's certainly potential for that. Operator : The next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : So I guess, one on ES would be the cross-sell. When you bought it, you didn't expect -- you didn't put that into the plan, but it's been proving to be a positive contributor. How do we track against where you -- we are now in that cross-sell? What's that incremental total dollar we picked up? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. I think we're making great progress on that, Michael. Listen, that ES was a little softer in the quarter where certainly, weather impacted them. And they were also coming off a pretty tough comp because we had a great first quarter last year. But that pipeline remains strong. I think we stopped talking about the pipeline at $150 million. That pipeline has grown from there. Now that pipeline is over a couple of years. It builds out as these opportunities develop.  Either the work initiates from a recurring generator or sometimes, it's a project that has a scheduled start that has pushed out a few months. So we feel really good about that. And frankly, there's another wave of upside as we get integrated on the IT side and then we get our sales organization kind of optimized against those customer lists and that information. We think there's strong pull-through. I think what's been undeniable for us is that customers want and desire a single-source solution. And this integrated offering is something that we could sell very profitably in the marketplace. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then switching gears back to the solid waste business. So that opportunity to capture surcharges and overages through the digital platform, what's the point of conversion of that into a permanent revenue? So you got the -- eventually, a salesperson shows up and says, hey, your container is always overflowing, and you convert it into a permanent upgrade? What's that look like? How do we think about that? Brian Delghiaccio : Michael, to your point, the obvious solution to that is to sit there and either get an increased level of service, whether it be the size of the container or just the number of times, the frequency that we're providing that service. But when you take a look just at those incremental revenues, they've been fairly sticky, meaning even though we've had these, because they're not consistent, they tend to be somewhat episodic as well. So again, when we're providing the service based on a certain amount of volume within that container, if there's those overages, we're going to charge for that and same with the contamination. Ultimately, could that change behavior over time? Yes, and we would want that. And at which point then, that probably just results in increased frequency, which positively impacts the top line as well. Jon Vander Ark : And that is the protocol, right? If somebody's got multiple overages, right, the protocol is it's pushed through Salesforce and the salesperson calls on that customer says, hey, it's time to go from twice a week to 3 times a week or a larger container or whatever the right solution is. To Del's point, I think it's still early days, and we've seen it's across a variety of customers, right? It's not like we're getting all this from the same small set of customers. It's kind of one-sie, two-sie on that front, so it's a little early to tell in terms of what that conversion looks like in the kind of permanent upgrades. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Bryan Burgmeier : In the prepared remarks, you touched on a revenue opportunity in recycling. I guess, just what's kind of driving the biggest tailwinds there right now? Is it capturing maybe different materials such as plastic? Are you increasing the throughput speed? And is there any opportunity maybe on the labor side as well? Brian Delghiaccio : Well, I think what we talked about, Bryan, on the recycling side a little bit, was on those fees. We were just talking about more on the contamination side. So again, when you take a look at how we're deploying AI into the business, we're doing it on overages, right, on the traditional waste. And then on the recycling, it's more about contamination. So that's what we're talking about there.  When you just talk about where you saw the uplift in recycling, that was really a function of just the recycled commodity prices and the lift in the overall basket. So our overall basket was $153 per ton in the first quarter. We exited the year at around $130 so that's that uplift, which is really what's driving that increase in recycled commodities. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it. Got it. That makes sense. Yes, I was inquiring about the $60 million opportunity there. And then maybe just on solid waste, like really nice margin performance in 1Q. What are your expectations for cost now versus the start of the year? Based on the public data, maybe wages are cooling a little bit. I'm not sure if that's really accurate for you, guys. And any view on kind of M&R costs? I'll turn it over. Jon Vander Ark : Sure. Yes. I think we're -- the team is executing well in the middle. The outlook is favorable in terms of cost. But on the wage side, that cake is already baked. We give our colleagues all their annual increase at the end of February, right? And even if inflation cools, we don't call them up in September and say, we want some of that back. So that forms -- it's more of a step function in terms of cost. Same thing on third-party transportation. I'd say the most dynamic parts of the cost structure are landfill operating and maintenance. And just on maintenance, again, team is executing well. We're taking more truck deliveries, and that will certainly have a positive aspect as we park some older trucks and replace those with newer trucks. The maintenance cost is obviously substantially lower on those newer trucks, so that should provide a nice benefit toward the second half of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Really nice OpEx leverage here as others have alluded to. And at this point, 30 bps margin expansion at midpoint for the full year looks pretty conservative to us, at least in light of 1Q results and the trends. So can you kind of comment on margin expectations and at least how we should be thinking about the typical step-up in margins as we get into the stronger seasonal quarters? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We certainly feel comfortable with how the team is executing in our plan for the rest of the year on that front. And look, for the overall environment, keep in mind, we're in a pretty much a zero-growth volume environment on recycling and waste over the last couple of years, if you think about housing starts and the correlation of that to volume on that front. And certain parts of the economy are a little slower like construction for sure, with interest rates remaining elevated, both commercial and residential construction has been softer on that front. Manufacturing has certainly been soft as well. Now there's some certainly positive signs that, that activity is picking up at the plant level, which is encouraging. So we remain pretty confident in our plan, but also mindful of the external environment. Election years, sometimes, special waste volume can push out a little bit on that front. So we'll update you more as we get into the seasonal upswing here after Q2. Noah Kaye : Absolutely. I think the spirit of the question is that despite volumes being down more than expected, I mean, margin performance in 1Q was definitely stronger, I think, perhaps, maybe even in your internal forecast, certainly, than the Street. Is there any reason why some of the underlying tailwinds to margins, excluding volumes, shouldn't continue into future quarters? So as you said, you have pretty good visibility on things like labor costs. Is there anything on the cost side of the equation that should give us pause? Brian Delghiaccio : No, it's -- to your question, right, we got off to a nice strong start, but it's the first quarter, right? So again, we like to see that continue, that seasonal uptick. We've got some strength right now in recycled commodity prices, but we're 1/4 of the way through. So to your observation, we've gotten us to a really good start to the year, which would suggest there's some modest upside. But we've got to sit there and see it play through the remainder of the year. But we're very pleased with our results in the first quarter. Noah Kaye : Yes. Very fair. And then just a quick housekeeping item. The release and your comments mentioned $41 million spend on acquisitions in the period. The line item in the cash flow statement, obviously, well north of that. And I assume that delta is primarily related to the sustainability investments, maybe some renewable energy projects. Can you maybe just help us with that bridge and how to think about full year spending, even excluding the M&A that you hope to do in the balance of the year? Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. Most of that is the investments that we're making in those JVs. So we would expect between what we're doing on the landfill gas to energy as well as the investments in Blue Polymers to be about $230 million of investments in those JVs in '24. Noah Kaye : Okay, $230 million. And so it sounds like you spent a good chunk of that then already, just doing some quick math here. So that tapers off as we move to the back half? Brian Delghiaccio : It does. Yes. Operator : The next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. David Manthey : Could you provide us with some details on the timing, size and type of acquisition that you did in environmental solutions? It looks like volume growth was about 3.2% this quarter. I'm wondering how much of that was the acquisition. Brian Delghiaccio : Well, the acquisition that we completed was in the fourth quarter of '23. So most of what you're seeing there on the environmental solutions side is the rollover impact of a company that we bought out on the West Coast. And we talked about that in our fourth quarter release. But when you think about the total rollover impact right now of acquisitions, so that which closed in '23, together with the deals that closed in the first quarter, it's about 220 basis points of rollover impact to revenue in '24. David Manthey : Okay. And this enterprise asset management initiative you have, you talked about maintenance productivity and warranty recovery. Could you explain to me what that means and maybe size the opportunity there? Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. Well, now you've got a system which is going to be seamlessly integrated. So when you think about the platform that we put on both the financial and the procurement side, now being seamlessly integrated with an asset management system, so our ability to track parts and to be able to sit there and make sure that we're getting warranty recovery on every single part that we take off a truck, greatly enhanced. Right now, it's a very manual exercise in order to sit there and to get those warranty dollars as well as just greater efficiency for the technician. So what that means is with that extra time and that capacity that's created, we can in-source more of those repairs. So instead of outsourcing at a multiple, in order to sit there and have those repairs done with a third-party shop, we can do those in-house. Operator : The next question comes from Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Sabahat Khan : Great. Just maybe if we could get a little bit of color on sort of the volume cadence you expect for the rest of the year. A couple of your peers have called out bit of a softer Q2 there. Maybe just your expectation on cadence and if that's changed versus what you might have expected at Q4 reporting a bit earlier. Brian Delghiaccio : Yes, we would expect obviously a sequential improvement from what we saw in Q1 just because we don't -- we're not expecting the weather impact again. Q2, yes, we would expect it to be a little bit negative, given what we're seeing with some of the construction-related activity. We're not seeing a rebound there yet. As we get into the second half of the year, we start to anniversary some of those construction-related declines. So we would expect that to be flat to even potentially slightly positive. Sabahat Khan : Okay. Great. And then on the PFAS front, you guys have obviously a bit of a unique exposure with the environmental business. Maybe if you look at the puts and the takes across your entire business, obviously, it's a bit early. But just curious how you're sort of approaching that opportunity and kind of the net impact of any additional costs? Just how do you view that entire opportunity given your 2 business lines? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We're -- it's a net positive for sure. We talked about kind of $70 million to $90 million last year of PFAS-related revenue. We'll have that number better this year with the pipeline that's building. So we offer a very unique set of products and services to our customers to help them remediate, all the way from the service to multiple opportunities for disposal, solid waste, landfill, obviously. For low levels of PFAS [ as these ] landfills, deep well, and that solution is certainly resonating with our customers. But on the other side of the business, that's a multiyear opportunity that's going to play out over time. And there's -- certainly, the size and scale of that opportunity is hard to size yet because it does depend a bit on the regulatory environment. And likewise, on the waste and recycling side, there certainly could be some headwinds there if this thing is poorly executed. I think the industry is doing a good job of pushing back and making sure that we don't get penalized as being a passive receiver. And I would say, from a litigation standpoint and more broadly, as regulation increases in the industry, if you think about the last 25, 30 years, we've done a really good job of passing on that cost of regulation and not making that hurt returns. And I think over time, given the nature and complexity, it favors the larger players. So we want regulation to be thoughtful and intelligent. But we see that, again, over time, we're in that [ winter ] through PFAS. Operator : The next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds. George Bancroft : Regarding the plastics, maybe just a step up -- climbing to 30,000 feet and just sort of long-term view on it. With these -- with regulations that have been implemented on plastics like the ones that went into effect in Canada, I maybe assume as it goes to Canada or in California, so goes the rest. How do you see those maybe stricter regulations in what can be made and thrown out versus the need to be recycled and the restrictions on that? How does that impact in the long term your polymer centers? And maybe how it -- if it changes producer behavior in what they'll produce? And how does that maybe impact your long-term net return on investment for those facilities? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Listen, consumer packaged goods companies for a long time have talked about minimum content goals. I think when the regulatory environment came online with California and that the other states have followed, that's really what's driven different activity in the marketplace. So we had pretty clear expectations for returns when we built the Las Vegas polymer center. As we always do, we're going to be good stewards of capital, and we've certainly exceeded our expectations there. And I think there's more upward opportunity as we go. We could sell out that facility 5x over. And the same will be true in Indianapolis and the other centers. The market is structurally short supplied of recycled PET, and we've got the unique capability of collecting something 5 million times a day, right? And so we can be the anchor tenant of our own facility on that front. So over time, I think we'll think about innovating on collection. So how do we get more PET and more olefins into the system? And then that might spark the opportunity to create a fifth or a sixth polymer center, and we'll take that on as we go. Operator : The next question is from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Tobey Sommer : A question for you on the hazardous side. How is sort of pipeline and overall demand? And do you think it's sufficient to easily absorb new incinerator capacity coming towards the end of this calendar year? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Pipeline is strong. It's activity, like I said, was certainly weather-related impact in the first quarter. Pipeline is strong. We got a number of attractive things, again, both on recurring streams and some event work in the pipeline. The market is structurally short supplied on incineration. And even with the new capacity coming online, I think it's likely to be tight for the foreseeable future on that front.  And then you think about any kind of medium to even a bearish case on PFAS is going to push more volume in liquid side into incineration. So we see that, again, market being tight supplied for the foreseeable future. Tobey Sommer : Appreciate that. And then if I could ask a question on the expense side beyond wages. In terms of hiring, training and the safety events that tend to happen more frequently with new employees, are those other elements around direct compensation also sort of seeing less growth and sort of a benefit to margins this year? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We're seeing certainly great trucking safety numbers. We talked about turnover. We talked about NPS. And listen, all these things are connected. We've done this a long time, and we know that when you are fully staffed and you've got trained and tenured drivers, they provide great customer service, right? It lowers your risk costs. Those customers are happy with the product offering, and they're willing to pay more and stay longer. So we're certainly seeing some of the benefits of a reduced turnover as well. Operator : The next question is from James Schumm with TD Cowen. James Schumm : Just curious if you guys are seeing any trends in the residential business with respect to competition or pricing? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Listen, I think that market, we've talked about this at length that's -- over the last decade as the business has improved and transformed in lots of ways, that's one of the parts of the business that hasn't made as much progress. And we have a very strong belief that we need to raise returns in that part of the business. And on balance, I'd say, competitive conduct is improving in terms of people getting a fair return for the work they do. It still has room to improve. And we're going to be disciplined in that space, and we're not going to do work for low returns. And if  a city wants a different provider who might be cheaper but doesn't provide as much benefit, so be it. We're going to put our -- allocate our capital to places where we get a very attractive return. James Schumm : Got it. And then I'm assuming turnover is trending lower, but did you give any specifics there? And what's your target for turnover, if you have one? And apologies if I missed it. Jon Vander Ark : No problem. We haven't talked about it probably. It's sub-20%. And there's a seasonal curve to turnover, obviously. Again, it goes up in Q2 and Q3, just like volumes do, and comes down in Q4 and Q1. Listen, running the business sub-20%, right, this gets very attractive in terms of all the operating metrics I talked about earlier, including the financial performance of the business. Operator : The next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Harold Antor : This is Harold Antor on for Stephanie Moore. I guess just on the M&A side, do you expect this year to be above average M&A? We've heard some of your other competitors say, M&A this year may be a little bit more active. And I guess in terms of your verticals, which verticals would you look to see -- would you look to make the biggest gains in M&A? Jon Vander Ark : Listen, we had a really outsized -- we're coming off $5.5 billion of M&A spend over the last 3 years. There's also -- there's always some episodic nature to that. We closed 2 really big transactions last year in the fourth quarter. And I think last year, there was a $1.8 billion spend. $1.4 billion of it was in recycling and waste, so there's a natural ebb and flow of just when those deals close. And we don't time any of those things around a quarter or a year, right? We do that when the seller is ready to sell on that front. The pipeline remains strong in recycling and waste and environmental solutions. The only place, I'd say, we're slightly self-constrained is on the environmental solutions field services side of the business only because we're doing so much IT integration work that we're letting that team get focused there. And again, the pipeline is certainly building, and we could close more opportunities right now. We're pausing until 2025 on that, when we have a really solid foundation to integrate companies into because that's when we think we maximize the synergies of those acquisitions. Harold Antor : And I believe that you said recycled commodities are trending at $160 per ton. Is that what you're baking in for 2Q? And if not, I guess, what are you baking in there? And I guess one housekeeping is, what is internal inflation running right now? Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. I mean right now, we're just pegging to what we see, which is running right around that $160 per ton. But back to my earlier comment, we want to see that stay for a longer period of time before we sit there and say that, that's where it's going to be for the remainder of the year. Operator : The next question is from Mike Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Just a quick one, I apologize if you already addressed it. But I think EBITDA was a little bit down in environmental solutions or environmental services. Margin was down a little bit. You might have addressed it earlier, but apologies if there was something you would want to call out of why that happened and how we kind of think about how that plays through the full year. Jon Vander Ark : Sure. Yes. No, most of that is the acquisition we did in the fourth quarter, ACT. And as you know, when we do acquisitions, we always invest heavily in Q1 -- or in the first year rather, the pro forma, to integrate on that front. So that's what's the drag on that. But again, our margin outlook for ES is certainly positive for the year. Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. And we would expect that to abate, that margin headwind on the acquisition, and we ultimately expect to see margin expansion in that business on a full year basis. Michael Feniger : And would it be probably above what you would expect for the solid waste business? Brian Delghiaccio : Well, look, solid waste ran at 120 basis points in our first quarter.  As we say again, we talked about that cadence on environmental solutions moving in that 75 to 100 basis points per year, right? And we see that on a sustained basis in the medium term until we hit that medium-term target of circa 25%. So I think you can think of it in that ZIP code. Michael Feniger : And lastly, guys, just to wrap up, Brian, obviously, there's a lot of focus on CPI, either inflation staying sticky, rolling over, moderating. Can you just remind us when we think of CPI, there's obviously the headline CPI. There's what you guys have kind of converted over time. Can you just remind us where we are in that process? That would be helpful. Brian Delghiaccio : Yes. So if you just take a look, again, if you look at our entire revenue stream, about 45% of our revenue has some sort of contractual pricing restriction, 55% in the open market. So of that 45% that has that contractual pricing mechanism, 23% is directly linked to CPI, headline CPI. 27% are alternative indices like water, sewer trash, garbage trash. And then the remaining 50% are either a fixed rate increase, some sort of rate review, things of that nature. So we've continued to move, right, the book away from headline CPI to alternative indices, where now we have more on alternative indices than we do on headline. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : I just wanted to play a little cleanup. So one, to roll off this temporary container business, is it not correct that you would park equipment pretty quickly, reposition drivers, raise price? So while this may show up as a volume calculation, it's not that big of an impact to profitability because you can pivot so quickly? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, certainly, Michael. I mean, we're dynamic in that in the market. And if you look at the quarter, volume was down 10.8%, but price was up 7.1%. And I just think that speaks to the strength of the execution, frankly, that strength of the industry, right, in an environment where volume is declining. If you go back a decade or 2, you might see behavior change and pricing be flat or even pricing go negative. And I think people understand the value of the products and services they're delivering. And the ability to flex and scale in that business is quicker than almost any and certainly, our team has done a great job of that. Michael Hoffman : And then the other would be -- well, the incineration comment, I concur with. This will remain tight for a while. US Ecology was predominantly an inorganic chemistry play on the disposal side and the incineration world is predominantly organic, so it's less impactful to you anyway. It's not that you don't have any organics, but you're much more of an inorganic play. Jon Vander Ark : Historically, that was true, Michael. But as we provide, again, a broader set of products and services, we certainly expanded the offering, right? And we're a significant player in that place, in that space in terms of liquids because we're going to recurring revenue generators and handling 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 products in their facilities. And it can certainly be on the organic and inorganic side. Michael Hoffman : Right. Okay. But the disposal -- landfill disposal side is still predominantly in inorganic. So this is the fuel blending and liquids side is getting you into the organics. Jon Vander Ark : Correct. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, MJ. I would like to thank the entire Republic Services team for their efforts and commitment to driving lasting value for all of our stakeholders. I'd also like to make a special acknowledgment to Michael Hoffman, a senior statesmen on the call. He's been with the industry for decades. And as he's announced, he's starting a new chapter, certainly supporting the industry in a different capacity. But over the last number of decades, he's certainly seen a lot of transformation in the industry and has handled this environment and this community with a lot of excellence and professionalism. So congratulations, Michael, in your next chapter. Have a good evening, everyone, and be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our strong second quarter results reflect the continued positive momentum in our business and are a direct outcome of executing our strategic priorities. We continue to successfully grow our business while enhancing profitability by providing world-class service and solutions to our customers. During the quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 9%, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 110 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.61, and produced $1.15 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. The results we are delivering are made possible by executing our strategy supported by our differentiated capabilities, customer zeal, digital, and sustainability. Regarding customer zeal, our commitment to delivering world-class essential services and sustainability offerings continues to drive customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained high at more than 94% and net promoter scores continue to improve. Customers value our comprehensive service offerings and the quality of our service delivery. Organic revenue growth during the second quarter was driven by strong pricing across the business. Average yield on total revenue was 5.5% and average yield on related revenue was 6.6%. This level of pricing exceeded our cost inflation and drove 110 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Organic volume on total revenue declined 80 basis points or 1% on related revenue. Volume losses were heavily concentrated to the cyclical portions of our business, including construction activity. Turning to our expanding digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools that improves the experience for both customers and our employees. Our RISE digital operations platform is driving improved route optimization and safety performance and providing more predictable service delivery to our customers. MPower, our new fleet and equipment management system, was introduced to pilot locations earlier this month. MPower is expected to increase maintenance, technician productivity, and enhance warranty recovery. We expect to continue deploying the new system to all locations under a phased approach through the end of 2025. We estimate MPower will drive $20 million of annual cost savings once fully implemented. We continue to benefit from innovative technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfilled containers and contamination in recycling containers. This technology reduces contamination at our recycling centers and is expected to generate approximately $60 million in incremental annual revenue. To date, we have already achieved $45 million of benefit. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that creating a more sustainable world is both our responsibility and a platform for growth. Earlier today, we released our latest sustainability report highlighting the progress we are making toward our 2030 goals and the positive impact we're delivering to our customers and the communities we serve. Our 2030 goals are supported by investments we are making in polymer centers, the Blue Polymers joint venture, renewable natural gas projects, and fleet electrification. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities continues to move forward. Major customers have certified the plastic flake produced at our Las Vegas Polymer Center. Production volumes continue to ramp and we expect to achieve our run-rate output targets in the fourth quarter of this year. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Polymer Center with equipment installation underway. The operation will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility. We expect construction on this facility to be complete by the end of the year with earnings contributions beginning in mid-2025. The renewable natural gas projects we're developing with our partners continue to advance. One project came online during the second quarter. Additionally, we completed construction at our RNG project in Fort Wayne, Indiana. This will be the first project to come online in our joint venture with BP. We expect five additional projects to be completed in the second half of this year. We continue to bring decarbonization solutions to the market, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 16 electric collection vehicles in operation. We expect to have more than 50 EVs in our collection fleet by the end of the year. We now have nine facilities with commercial-scale EV charging infrastructure, and we expect five additional new sites to be completed in 2024. Customers are looking for solutions to support their sustainability goals. We recently announced an agreement with the City of Louisville, Colorado, making it the first municipality to adopt a fully electric residential collection service. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be the employer of choice in the markets we serve. Employee turnover continues to improve with second quarter turnover rate improving 70 basis points compared to the prior year. With respect to capital allocation, year-to-date we have invested $68 million in acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of continued activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions businesses. We currently have more than $300 million of transactions in advanced stages of diligence and are expected to close by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we returned $504 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we recently announced an increase to the dividend for the 21st consecutive year. Strong results we produced through the first half of the year support a full-year earnings outlook that exceeds our original expectations. We now expect revenue in the range of $16.075 billion to $16.125 billion, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $4.9 billion to $4.925 billion, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.15 to $6.20, and adjusted free cash flow in a range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion. Our updated financial guidance includes the contributions from acquisitions closed through June 30th. I will now turn the call over to Brian who will provide more details on the quarter. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks, John. Core price on total revenue was 6.8%. Core price on related revenue was 8.1% which included open market pricing of 9.8% and restricted pricing of 5.4%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 11.8%, large container of 7.4%, and residential of 7.8%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.5% and average yield on related revenue was 6.6%. Second quarter volume on total revenue decreased 80 basis points and volume on related revenue decreased 1%. Our volume results included a decrease in large container of 3.3%, primarily due to continued softness in construction-related activity, and a decrease in residential of 2.5%, primarily due to municipal contracts lost in 2023, that anniversary in the fourth quarter of this year. During the quarter, small container volume decreased 60 basis points, while landfill MSW increased 1.1%. Small container volume loss is a direct result of intentionally shedding broker-related business obtained through M&A transactions. We continue to adhere to our longstanding strategy of prioritizing direct relationships with our customers. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $173 per ton during the second quarter. This compared to $119 per ton in the prior year. Recycling, processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 50 basis points during the quarter. Our updated full year guidance assumes commodity prices remain at approximately $170 per ton for the remainder of the year. And now turning to our environmental solutions business. Second quarter environmental solutions revenue increased $74 million compared to the prior year fueled by price-led organic growth and contribution from acquisitions. On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 40 basis points to total company internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the environmental solutions business expanded 130 basis points to 23.8% in the second quarter. Environmental solutions EBITDA margin was 22.5% in the prior year. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 31.1%. Margin performance during the quarter included margin expansion in the underlying business of 130 basis points and a 20 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices. This was partially offset by a 40 basis point decrease from acquisitions. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.15 billion. The decrease from the prior year is primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures. Year-to-date net capital expenditures of $767 million represents an increase of $234 million or 44% compared to the prior year. Capital spending is more ratable in 2024, whereas \u201823 was heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Prior year capital expenditures were impacted by vendor-related delays in truck and equipment deliveries. Total debt was $13.1 billion, and total liquidity was $3.5 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.8 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.5% during the quarter. We expect a full year equivalent tax impact of approximately 25.5%. With that operator, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I was hoping to ask about sustainability projects in the wake of the Chevron decision. It sounds like you're still going strong with your projects. Just wondering if you think there will be any impacts affecting the market, for example, supply and demand for RINs as a result of the decision? and then maybe separately, in light of the US election coming up, would that impact timing of any projects, M&A or anything else not related to sustainability, just anything in general that that you'd call out? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Sure. Yeah, listen, we feel good about the project and our approach specifically on landfill gas to energy. As you know, we're in a joint venture model and there's a series of independent decisions around projects. And so, to be said that, the RINs market changes and that takes some of those projects kind of below our return threshold, those are projects that we won't do on that front. But keep in mind also that we had a very conservative set of assumptions on $2 RINS and we built out the initial set of assumptions and what we talked to you about financial impact. So we still feel really confident, which ties into the second point. There'll be puts and takes, whether there's an administration change and there'll certainly be a new President, whether that's a party change or not. I think in general the conventional wisdom as a Republican administration is going to be more business friendly and a Democratic one maybe less business friendly. I think if you look at the last three years, our business has performed really well in the context of a Democratic administration. So I think in any environment we feel confident there'll be some puts or takes on the margin for sure but we'll -- our team will navigate that. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And then as a follow-up, just want to ask about volume. Bit of a late quarter again I think you called out the large container and then also some of the resi contracts from 2023 on the muni side. Are you still thinking that this year will be flat to modestly positive on volume and just anything to flesh out the sort of slightly lower top line guide? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Sure. Yeah, I think from a volume standpoint, we'll be slightly below our original expectations and that's a function of, listen, the construction market's still pretty challenged. With high interest rates, commercial construction activity and residential construction activity have been very muted and you see that our volume numbers in [temp] (ph) large container the great news is that pricing is holding up and I think the industry is behaving very responsibly in that context. And I also am relatively optimistic that that is somewhat of a short-term phenomenon. We need more housing stock in the United States. I think you're starting to see rays of hope here on interest rates cuts, which I think will be the catalyst for that to happen, whether that happens three months from now or six or nine months from now. I do think that's more transitory versus permanent on that front. And then there's also been, again, you talked about the residential contracts. We've accelerated some of the broker exits that we acquired in our M&A deals we always talk about, we require somebody we never value to work on brokers because we know it's going to matriculate out of the system. We've accelerated that, so that drove a little bit of outsized volume decline in the quarter. And then for the overall revenue guide, part of that is the volume outlook, which I just gave you. Part of that is the sustainability projects, landfill gas to energy. We're going to hit our number. The timing of the starts of those is going to be a little bit later in the year. I think ourselves and the industry have faced a little bit of delays in terms of permitting, getting the equipment in place, et cetera. So that's not a big surprise. And then our polymer center, well, we\u2019ve teams executing phenomenally in terms of the product we're producing. We got to a little bit of a later start than we expected through all kinds of things ancillary to the system like permitting for the facility and other things, so that caused a little delay in the timing on that front. Again, that's transitory and we'll be on full run rate as I discussed in my prepared remarks. Toni Kaplan : Super. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good afternoon. Jon Vander Ark : Afternoon. Tyler Brown : Hey, Brian, any color on the shape of pricing into the back half? Should we expect it to sequentially decelerate in Q3 and Q4? And just any color on how that might impact margins, because it does feel like the margin expansion is expected to slow. My hunch is that's largely in Q4 but any color there would be helpful. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. And Tyler, good observation. We talked about -- in Q1 we thought that would be our highest level of pricing of this year and then it would sequentially decline in part just because of some of the index-based pricing and just the impact that has throughout the year. As you've seen, though, we've also seen cost moderate, cost inflation moderate, so our spread we've maintained. So we have a similar level of margin expansion in Q1 and Q2. We would expect that spread to decrease a little bit as we move into the second half of the year. But again, if you take a look, driving outsized margin expansion and well above our initial expectations. Tyler Brown : Right, okay, that's very helpful. So I believe, if my math is correct, this was the first quarter that you guys had put up a 32% core solid waste margin, if my math is right. But if we go back, you guys have always said that this could be a 32% EBITDA margin business, price compounds, recycling normalizers, and both have. So, since 32% was the new 30%, just any high-level thoughts on what the new 32% could be over the next few years? I mean, is there any reason to believe that a mid-30% margin in core solid waste couldn't be achievable in time if price-cost dynamics cooperate? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, and Tyler, I think our words were that we saw that in the near term, we saw 32% as achievable. Really what we're looking at is the consistent cadence of margin expansion across our business and we talked about that in the 30 to 40 basis point of margin expansion, the recycling waste business a little bit more in the environment solutions, call it, 75 basis points plus just given where it is in its maturity. And so we continue to see that opportunity as we move forward. So we're not going to call what the theoretical cap is, but again, it's about pricing in excess of cost inflation. It's about realizing the benefits from our initiatives, including our digital initiatives, and driving costs out of the system. And we see that runway for years to come. Tyler Brown : Excellent. My last one real quick. So, Jon, there have been a number of deals, excuse me, and call it hazardous waste/industrial waste/nontraditional waste markets. Some are big, some are small. But can you just talk about your appetite specifically in that market? Will it be slow and steady or would you entertain something that would be much chunkier? Jon Vander Ark : Listen, we look at everything. We have made a perspective on any type of transaction and if it's going to create value for our shareholders and fits with us strategically, we'll certainly be at the table on that front. So, plus that we do about 20 deals a year on average over the last decade. Most of those are the small tuck-ins, which we're great at and we've got a good pipeline looking forward. And then the bigger ones become more opportunistic, just in terms of is it a fit for us time-wise? Does it create value? Are we the natural owner of that? Again, you'll see us be active in that space over time. Tyler Brown : Perfect. Thank you all. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe if I can follow up on that, just given some of the activity we've seen in kind of this hazardous waste environmental service space on the M&A front, are you seeing any changes in the transaction multiples or the type of assets coming to sale that might give you an opportunity to fill in service areas you want to pursue or white space on the map that might come available? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, there's plenty of opportunities, no question. On the small tuck-ins on the environmental solutions side of the business, we've been intentionally a little bit slow on that this year because the team is doing a lot of integration work from an IT standpoint. And again, it's very analogous to recycling and waste. We create value in that space because we've got well-run systems, highly integrated, and we can take a smaller company and layer that operationally right into our density and just draft right off of our systems. Until we get that on the environmental solutions side, you're just adding to your complexities, you're not getting that synergy. And so you'll see us, again, that pipeline is building, you'll see us be much more active next year in the space. Kevin Chiang : And just anything on the transaction multiples you're seeing, has that changed at all, versus, let's say, 18 months to 24 months ago? Jon Vander Ark : I think it's consistent, which is there's variation in deals that may be of a little lower quality from our perspective. I think the high quality deals, right, you're going to pay certainly a higher multiple for. But then I think we've done -- got a good example of that with the US Ecology acquisition. If you buy something quality and you've got a plan against it, you can certainly drive value post-acquisition. Kevin Chiang : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just on the EV comments you made in your prepared remarks, you talked about the nine EV infrastructure sites you have. You'll have five new ones or five additional ones by the end of 2024 and you'll have, I guess, a target of 50 EVs. Are those -- when you think of those 14 sites at year-end, I guess how many electric vehicles could you support based on the, I guess, the exit rate infrastructure platform you will have invested in? Is it significantly more than 50 or is it, kind of 50 is the right number and if you want to grow more than that you'd have to make more investments into your charging infrastructure? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, no, it's hundreds. So think about putting in the initial infrastructure and getting connected to the grid and then you think about charging stations which become modular once that infrastructure is put in. And so the strategy is we're going a five-year outplan on each of these sites to understand that we'll be layering more vehicles in. And so you're bearing the upfront cost right now and then it's just an incremental cost to put in the charging station as the fleet grows in that space. Kevin Chiang : Okay, that's what's happening. Okay, perfect. Thanks for the clarification there. That's all from me. Congrats on a good quarter. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ll start with environmental services. Just on the organic performance of the business, pretty big sequential improvement in the trends quarter-over-quarter, you had a headwind organically in the segment last quarter, and I know you called out some weather events and the like, but then to go to kind of this sort of mid-single-digit organic growth in the segment this quarter. Can you just maybe help us understand what you saw from the business on an organic basis and how to think about organic growth going forward through the balance of the year? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, strongly -- we're still in the growth mode in that business, right? And so we're -- recycling and waste is a very mature business and we could kind of give you a really clear and clean outlook, right? There's going to be a little more up and down in this business as we grow and build it out and part of that is on the customer side. On one hand we are churning out customers on one end of the business who weren't willing to pay returns and -- to beat our returns and we're going to put upward pressure on industry pricing as we always do. And on the flip side, we're layering cross-sell opportunities that we've talked about. And so those don't all come in kind of ratably month to month. Those come in kind of in different timing and waves. So really pleased with the progress. I'd encourage you on that business, if you're measuring it by the quarter, right, you're probably not going to get the best signal quarter to quarter if that's over the next one to two years certainly. Measuring it over the year, I think, gives you a much better view of the trajectory and we're really pleased on both the top line and certainly bottom line performance of that business. Brian DelGhiaccio : And Noah, just based on when we put in our annual price increase, we didn't see the full impact of that until the second quarter. And so I think that's also reflective of what you're seeing in EBITDA margin performance of that business at the same time. Noah Kaye : Very good points. Do you feel comfortable underwriting organic growth, [turn to] (ph) the PIs for the balance of the year? Jon Vander Ark : I'm sorry, do we expect organic growth for the balance of the year? Noah Kaye : Are you expecting, like embedded in the outlook, are you expecting organic growth in -- for the balance of the year? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, yeah, we are. And if you know that business and nature of it, because it's so mix sensitive, there isn't a very clear kind of unit versus price, the kind of pair apart or peel apart volume versus price like we do in recycling and waste. And it hasn't been for lack of trying, but there's just too many variables that don't allow us to do that, but underlying organic unit growth will be there. Noah Kaye : Very helpful. Just on the margins, really strong performance here. I wondered if we could maybe unpack a little bit that underlying 130 bps as you provided some nuggets in the past that would be helpful. And then I think to put additional color on the response to Tyler's question, it seems like we could be looking at margins up maybe 100 bps or so year-over-year in 3Q and kind of flattish in 4Q. If there's any kind of nuance you would give in terms of how to shape that, that would be helpful for modeling purposes. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, let me start with your -- the last part of your question first. I think the shape, you're on the right path there. Maybe a little bit less in Q3 and a little bit more in Q4, but I think the shape, you're directionally correct. Looking at the performance in the underlying business, we saw 120 basis points in recycling waste. We saw actually more than that in the environmental solutions business because for the 130 basis points for the company taken as a whole, remember we had to overcome 80 to 100 basis points of dilution from acquisition we completed in the environmental solutions business in Q4 of \u201823. So, when you take a look at the underlying business within environmental solutions, it was close to 200 basis points. Noah Kaye : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Please go ahead. Bryan Burgmeier : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking questions. In the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned a little bit of intentional shedding in the small container business. I was maybe just wondering if you could expand on that, give us a sense of the size of the brokerage business you're running there, or maybe it's possible to say maybe what inning the volume shedding is in at this point? Jon Vander Ark : Well, I'd say the good news is, from an ongoing standpoint, right, we had a bigger broker business a decade ago, and we made a very clear choice that we believe customers are people who generate recycling waste, and we want to have direct relationships with them. So, we're very intentional. What's happened is over the last four or five years, as we've become much more acquisitive, we've seen that portion of the business increase because when we acquire companies, we see that 10% of their book, for example, might be serving brokers. And we don't value $0.01, right, when we pay the purchase price of the deal, because we know that business is going to come out of the system. Typically, we do that over the course of six to maybe even 12 or 18 months honoring contracts in a very ratable fashion, right? In this case, we accelerated it because we felt like with one broker, in particular, we had a receivables risk. And so we took more accelerated action. But there'll always be a small portion of the business that's going to be a drag on our revenue that we're shedding because it's coming in through M&A. Brian DelGhiaccio : And a point that I'd make there as well is that if you take a look at the volume decline in small container, it was almost exclusively due to these broker-related losses. If you take a look in the open market, we're actually seeing positive unit growth in that business. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it, got it, that makes total sense. Just kind of last question for me, it's just on the guidance increase, apologies if I missed this. Is it possible to maybe just bucket maybe what is going better on the net price side or just kind of touch on it anecdotally, is it prices coming in higher, cost coming in lower? Is it labor? Is it repair? Just any finer points you can kind of put on what's really been better throughout the first six months. Thank you and I'll turn it over. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, I would say overall we're looking at price in a similar way that we did in the beginning of the year. I would say the spread between price and cost inflation is favorable. So that's one of the reasons why we're seeing the better than expected margin expansion. And then I would say the other big piece is really just favorable commodity prices and the flowthrough that has to the bottom line. But an overwhelming majority, again, is going to be in that price-cost spread. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I'm wondering if we could talk about... Jon Vander Ark : Hey, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Hi. I'm wondering if we could just talk about free cash flow conversion. So, you folks are now up to the mid-40s in EBITDA, the free cash flow conversion, and that's while making the growth investments that you spoke about earlier. As we think about what the free cash flow conversion will look like once the growth investments are producing EBITDA and cash flow, is it reasonable to think about free cash conversion ultimately rising to the high 40s or what kind of [guidepost] (ph) would you think about over the next couple of years as you complete those CapEx and get the cash flow coming in? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, what I would say, Jerry, is that, again, back to we're not looking at a theoretical cap, we're just looking for that consistent improvement in performance. So our expectations is that just, because again, when you think about some of the things that we can do on the balance sheet as far as improving working capital, being more efficient with the CapEx, start with the, 30 to 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion we expect, growing free cash flow conversion a little bit more. Now that said, we've got to overcome things like the expiration of bonus depreciation and some other things that we've had to sit there and overcome that are a little bit outside of our control. So you got to overcome that. From the base business though, you can think of that, call it 50 to 75 basis points of improvement. And then you got to net out the impact of bonus depreciation, which is different by year. Jerry Revich : Got it. Thanks, Brian. And then on the US Ecol ERP rollout, it was an area of opportunity for you folks. Can you just update us on the timing and, which point will we get the sort of route level intelligence that you folks are used to for your overall business that could drive some further margin opportunities? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, we'd see being on a common platform, right, on that business, on the environmental solutions business in early \u201825, then we can then iterate the system itself in order to be able to get smarter with respect to the information that we have. So we can be more strategic with respect to pricing, get better as far as productivity, and just become more profitable over time. But right now, we still have a number of systems that we're trying just first to consolidate, then we can continue to enhance and improve the system that we're operating on. Jerry Revich : Super, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sabahat Khan : Hey, great. Thanks and good afternoon. You provided a bit of color on sort of the M&A landscape. I guess within this guidance, are you still sort of on pace for this $500 million for the full year? Maybe we can just talk about the availability of transactions at the right multiples. Obviously, some big transactions out there, but trying to see what you're facing out there on the smaller tuck-in acquisition types and just sort of pace for the rest of the year. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, the pipeline looks good. Keep in mind, we don't operate the business for the quarter. We operate it forever. So we did $800 million of acquisitions in Q4 last year. So there's some natural lumpiness, especially the M&A pipeline. So a little quieter for the first quarter. This year, listen, we could end up at $500 million. We could end up between, $400 million to $500 million or we could end up north of $500 million if other stuff kicks in here. I think we'll be north of $400 million just based on what we have in front of us. And then do we get closer to $500 million or above that, we'll see kind of what happens. Sometimes deals hit you and they're in an accelerated fashion. Most of the time at this point, we're kind of looking at a Q1 and Q2 for close for those transactions. So anything bigger would certainly be at a little bit of a longer timeframe in terms of a close in next year, wouldn't close this year anything more substantial. Sabahat Khan : Okay, great. And then maybe if you could just share a little bit of color on some of the cost line items as you think about the back end of this year and heading into \u201825, how are some of the costs that you're seeing on the ground level comparing to some of the headline inflation numbers maybe across labor and some of the other bigger line items? Thank you. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, we certainly saw good sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 across maintenance, transportation, labor that -- the cake is already baked on labor for the year, but the comp year-over-year is certainly improving on that. So, as Brian mentioned, that's certainly what's fueling, along with price, our margin expansion. And we seek a continued modulation of that in the second half of the year. So feel really good about the team's execution on cost control. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead. David Manthey : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. I was hoping you'd give us an update on the $100 million digital opportunity that you previously outlined, and the MPower asset management system that you talked about, the $20 million benefit there, is that included or separate from the $100 million? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, so I think, David, I think you're talking about our RISE digital platform. So we said there was $100 million of opportunity. They're cumulative and we've realized about $65 million to date and we would expect to continue to sit there and realize those benefits in future periods, which is embedded in that 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion that we're calling for on a regular cadence, that would certainly be part of that over the next couple years. David Manthey : But the new asset management system, that's not in the $100 million, it's separate. Brian DelGhiaccio : Sure that\u2019s -- sorry, I think [indiscernible] that's an additional $20 million. Now, it's going to be deployed in a phased approach. So we actually just hit our first pilot locations. We're going to be deploying that through the end of 2025. So we really don't expect to get that full run rate benefit until 2026. David Manthey : Got it. Okay. And then if I heard you right on the margin improvement in environmental solutions, are there areas of the legacy US ecology business that you've leaned into or maybe de-emphasized over the past two years that have helped improve the mix of that business or is the pricing and efficiency that you're getting just by using the legacy systems and seeing some improvement there? Jon Vander Ark : No, it's all of the above. It's certainly pricing for the value we're delivering. It is challenging then the mix, right? We make more money in certain, especially in the field services side of the business, you make more money in certain areas and less in others. And then even within some of those categories of in field service challenging each customer account. What isn't really earning their cost of capital and therefore those are things we're pricing or replacing over time and the team's done a great job of that. I'd say as we get our IT systems in place, which Del talked about, that gives us an opportunity to get even more refined and drive even more value from a pricing standpoint. David Manthey : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to take maybe a high-level view here. I [Technical Difficulty] margin expansion opportunity over the next, I think this year you've given them color, but I think about 2025 and maybe even early 2026. I think if you put together everything that you've outlined, whether continuing nice price costs for solid waste, nice ES expansion, some of your R&G or polymer centers coming online here at the end of the year, it kind of makes it seem like we could see another outsized year of margin expansion, all things considered, for the foreseeable future beyond 2024. Is there anything I'm missing there, or how would you kind of frame the margin opportunity here beyond 2024? Jon Vander Ark : Well, I think Del highlighted earlier, think about recycling of waste 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion a year. We talked about environmental solutions, getting to 25%. Now again, we're reaching there, getting there probably a little quicker than we thought. But again, there'll be some ups and downs in any given quarter. But over the sequence, certainly have line of sight to 25% margin for the year on that category. And then that's not the ending point, right? We'll continue to move. I think in the long term, we would aspire to have EBITDA margins across the two different parts of our business that converge over time, because we think there's that much opportunity and value that's delivered in the environmental solutions space. And again, that's a long-term target on that, but I've given you kind of a marker for kind of what kind of ratable improvement. And we're reticent to kind of choose an individual year because again, that's not how we run the business. We run it forever. Stephanie Moore : Great, that's helpful. And then maybe as you think about the pricing environment as the year progresses and more so next year, just kind of your mix across various index-based pricing, kind of your thoughts about potentially above historical average pricing, even as inflation comes down? Thanks. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah. So, again, we've talked about our initiative in order to move to those favorable indices, water sewer trash, garbage trash, and those tend to run higher than CPI. So if you're going back and comparing to five or six years ago, yes, we would expect the restricted portion of our book to perform better than it had historically. But, we've made really good progress and movement against that. So, again, we're close to 60% of that book that was historically linked to CPI now on a favorable index or a fixed rate increase. So that's already reflected in the numbers that you saw in, or that you're seeing in 2024. But certainly, yes, we would expect to be better than where we were historically. Stephanie Moore : Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Butler with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brian Butler : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Let's start with just on the small container side. When you think about the service intervals, maybe some color on how that's trending and what you kind of have built into the back half of \u201924? Maybe if you exclude the brokerage piece, how positive was the small container volume side? Jon Vander Ark : Yeah, so service increases continue to exceed decreases. And as I mentioned, for net new business within our open market small container is positive. So if you just take the open market, it would have been modestly positive. I would sit there and say, in the quarter, which was completely offset by what we saw from the broker-related business. Brian Butler : Okay. And then the second question, when you think about the midpoint guidance kind of going up on EBITDA, kind of $60 million, $65 million, And you break that out, you talked about price cost being the biggest chunk of that. Can you give some color just on how big maybe the recycling is on a dollar amount for that kind of increase? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah, so it's, call it, 25 to 30 with the balance all being in the underlying business. Brian Butler : All right, and if I could squeeze one last one in there, is your sensitivity to the RIN prices really changed at all? I mean, RINs have been kind of elevated for a while now, but maybe just if you have any color on kind of where that sensitivity kind of stands. Brian DelGhiaccio : Our sensitivity hasn't changed that much just because we haven't added that much to the portfolio. It will certainly -- that sensitivity will increase over time as more projects come online. But right now, if you think about just rough math, a $0.10 change in RIN prices is approximately $1 million of operating income annual for us. Brian Butler : Great, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. On the acquisition front, over time, is $500 million a good number for annual spend, or does that change as we go out in the future because the company clearly is growing and perhaps that needs to increase to maintain the same impact? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yeah we don't really have a target on the acquisition number. And so we kind of give you a rough guide because it's helpful, I think, for your modeling purposes. But as we think about opportunities, right, we want to buy companies that can first fit our strategic filter. We think we're the natural owner there and we can create value for our customers and then the financial filter, which is -- are we going to exceed our cost of capital and create economic profit for our shareholders. Those are the two things we look at. And so we're not opportunity -- we're not capital constrained in that respect. And so [to the extent] (ph) we find those opportunities, we're going to go do that. So, we've spent as much as $3 billion in a given year, and this year is going to be a little more muted, obviously, partly, again, for the internal constraint of we want to make sure that we can digest and execute what we buy over time. So we'll give you an update as we go get into 2025 what we think the outlook is, but it's going to be more of a year-to-year look than some longer-term outlook of what we're going to spend. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. On the employee attrition front, I know it's down from the peak of several years ago and that helps labor expense and margin expansion, but if I look at it from a different angle and say how low has it gotten before during economic slowdowns and downturns, how far away are we from that at this juncture? Brian DelGhiaccio : Well, I'd say if you think about we're at, right, kind of our benchmark level, if you think about any normal run of period. Now, if you take a very short look, like, April and May of 2020, after COVID hit, right, it dropped near zero because everyone was just trying to hold on and figure out what's happening in the world. But if you think about any longer run across a set of quarters, we're certainly at our best performance and we're not stopping. We think there's further opportunity for improvement. Obviously, the rate of improvement will slow. Zero is never the right answer in this category, but we think we can get better. Operator : At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Nick. I would like to thank the entire Republic Services team for their focus on exceeding customer expectations and commitment to driving value for all of our stakeholders. Have a wonderful rest of the summer and be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the date times and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered strong third quarter results by effectively executing our strategy that supports profitable growth and value creation. The Republic Services team continues to deliver world-class service and innovative solutions to meet the needs of our customers. During the quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 7% and generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 14%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 210 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.81 and produce $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. Through our differentiated capabilities, customers yield, digital and sustainability, we continue to be well positioned to capture new opportunities and create long-term value for our stakeholders. Regarding customer zeal, our focus on delivering world-class essential services continues to support organic growth and enhance customer loyalty. Our customer retention rate remained strong at more than 94%. Third quarter organic revenue growth was driven by strong pricing across the business. Average yield on total revenue was 4.6%, and average yield on related revenue was 5.5%. This level of pricing continued to exceed our cost inflation and help drive 210 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Organic volume on total revenue declined 1.2%. Volume losses were heavily concentrated to the cyclical portions of our business, including special waste and construction activity. Turning to our expanding digital capabilities. We continue to advance the implementation of digital tools to improve the experience for both customers and employees. Deployment of MPower, our new fleet and equipment management system is underway. MPower is designed to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhance warranty recovery. Deployment of the new system is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2025. We estimate MPower will deliver $20 million annual cost savings once fully implemented. We continue to benefit from innovative technology on our recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfill containers and recycling contamination. This technology generated more than $60 million in incremental revenue in the first year of operation. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewal natural gas position us to continue grow and create long-term value creation. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities continues to move forward. Las Vegas Polymer Center production volumes continued to increase throughout the quarter. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Polymer Center with initial equipment commissioning underway. This operation will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility. We expect construction on this facility to be complete by the year of this year, with earnings contribution in the second half of 2025. We recently broke ground on a Blue Polymers production facility in Buckeye, Arizona, this facility will complement the Las Vegas Polymer Center. We expect the completion of this facility in late 2025. We continue to bring decarbonization solutions to the market that will unlock value for all of our stakeholders including the communities we serve. The renewable natural gas projects we're developing with our partners continue to advance. Two projects came online during the third quarter, bringing the total completed this year to four projects. We expect four additional RNG projects to be completed during the fourth quarter. We continue to advance our commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 28 electric collection vehicles in operation and expect to have more than 50 EVs in our fleet by the end of the year. We have 18 facilities with commercial scale EV charging infrastructure. As part of our approach to sustainability, we are committed to being an employer of choice in the markets we serve. Our third quarter employee turnover rate improved more than 100 basis points compared to the prior year and we are proud to be certified as a great place to work for the eighth consecutive year. With respect to capital allocation, year-to-date, we have invested $104 million in strategic acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of continued activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions. We currently have more than $200 million of transactions that are expected to close by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we returned $834 million to shareholders, which includes $330 million of share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter. Brian DelGhiaccio : Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 6.2%, core price on related revenue was 7.4%, which included open market pricing of 9.1% and restricted pricing of 4.8%. The components of core price on related revenue included : small container of 10.3%, large container of 6.9% and residential of 7.2%. Average yield on total revenue was 4.6%, and average yield on related revenue was 5.5%. As expected, average yields stepped down sequentially as we began to anniversary the impact of new fees implemented last year. The fees relate to overfilled containers and recycling contamination and were enabled by our digital platform. Third quarter volume on total revenue decreased 1.2% and volume on related revenue decreased 1.5%. Volume results included a decrease in large container of 3.6%, primarily due to continued softness in construction-related activities a decrease in residential of 2.9%, primarily due to municipal contracts lost in 2023 then anniversary in the fourth quarter of this year. During the quarter, small center volume decreased 40 basis points, while landfill MSW increased 30 basis points. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $177 per ton during the third quarter. This compares to $112 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 70 basis points during the quarter. Commodity prices are currently $106 per ton reflecting a recent decline in the price for recovered cardboard, or OCC. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 210 basis points to 32%. Margin performance during the quarter : margin expansion in the underlying business of 120 basis points, a 40 basis point increase from net fuel, a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 50 basis point benefit from an insurance recovery related to a prior year claim. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions completed in the prior year. Now turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $60 million compared to the prior year, driven by the rollover contribution from prior year acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business expanded 290 basis points to 25.5% in the third quarter. Environmental Solutions EBITDA margin was 22.6% and in the prior year. Environmental Solutions margin included a positive 110 basis points from an adjustment to an allowance for bad debt established in a prior year. Excluding this benefit, Environmental Solutions margin would have been 24.4%. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.74 billion. The decrease from the prior year is primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures. Year to date net capital expenditures of $1.19 billion represents an increase of $250 million or 27% compared to the prior year. Capital spending is more ratable in 2024, whereas 2023 was heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Prior year capital expenditures were impacted by vendor-related delay in truck and equipment deliveries. Total debt $12.6 billion and total liquidity $2.6 billion. Our leverage rate at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.6 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 21.6% during the quarter. This favorable tax rate driven primarily by the timing of equity investments in renewable energy contributed $0.09 of EPS benefit during the quarter. I will now hand back over to Jon. Jon Vander Ark : Thanks, Brian. With respect to 2024, we believe we are trending toward the low end of our full year revenue guidance due to continued softness in cyclical volumes. That said, we expect to more than overcome this revenue headwind and achieved the high end of our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance. As a result, we expect EBITDA margin to outperform our expectations. Looking forward to 2025, we expect continued growth across the business supported by pricing ahead of underlying costs, cross-selling our complete set of products and services and capitalizing on value-creating acquisition opportunities. We also expect financial contribution from the investments made in sustainability innovation, including plastic circularity and renewable natural gas projects. We believe that the fundamentals of our business remain strong and supportive of continued growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow along with margin expansion in the underlying business. Over the long term, we believe our business can consistently deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and grow EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow faster than revenue. Our initial perspective on full year 2025 is consistent with this long-term growth algorithm. We plan to provide detailed 2025 guidance on our earnings call in February. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Hi, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Nice quarter. Brian, I'm wondering if you could just expand if there are any other onetime type items in the quarter, really impressive performance. And as I look at the fourth quarter guidance, it looks like you're guiding to margins to step down a couple of points more than normal seasonality 4Q versus 3Q. I'm wondering is that just conservatism? Or were there any other embedded tailwinds in the third quarter beyond that debt item that you spoke about environmental services. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Thanks, Jerry. Taking a look at the third quarter, we called out the two big pieces that you would sit there and in say, we're somewhat large and unusual for the quarter. So the insurance recovery, which had an impact of a positive 50 basis points to the quarter itself. We called out the bad debt as well. So it was 110 basis points to Environmental Solutions, about 10 basis point contribution to the enterprise taken as a whole. So 60 basis points, we would say, ex that, the rest, I mean, I called out the theses about what fuel and commodity prices were doing, but the underlying business, you saw the strength of that 100 bps. Jerry Revich : Really impressive performance. And then if I can shift gears, and ask you to talk about on the polymer center rollout, can you just expand on the performance so far? How has the production ramp played out versus the initial plan? And any updates to the time lines that you folks previously shared. Jon Vander Ark : Sure. Yes. We're really happy in terms of the pricing we're getting. We're beating our pro forma math. Certainly happy on the volume ramp in terms of how that equipment is building. We got off to a little later start than we would have liked for things all unrelated to the equipment. So permitting of the facility, getting electricity in, just getting all the things around the construction on the building envelope. Those things take time. Maybe we were a little aggressive in our time line to begin with. [indiscernible] delayed from the start there, but the underlying assumptions other than a delayed start, we still feel very confident in. And India is hitting its marks, including the construction time line there. So we feel really good about that. Listen, we think we're producing some of the cleanest [lake] (ph) in the world. And so that's what the market needs. It's good for circularity and certainly going to be good for our shareholders as well. Jerry Revich : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question today comes from Trevor Romeo with William Blair. Please go ahead. Trevor Romeo : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Had one kind of on the -- on pricing, thinking about open market versus restricted. I think the last several quarters, your open market core price has been 400 basis points or more above restricted. Is that kind of a good spread for us to still think about going forward, even if some of the inflation indices kind of continue to ramp down. And then in your shift away from CPI to more of those open market and alternative entities, how much further room do you think you have to continue that shift at this point? Brian DelGhiaccio : When you take a look at the spread, and we certainly talked about the fact that we thought we were in an elevated pricing environment in part due to the fact that there was the backdrop of elevated inflation. And we've said that throughout this year, that would step down sequentially. And as we look forward into 2025, we would expect that to step down as well. Now, if you take a look back historically, open market pricing has tend to run above that which you can achieve on the restricted portion of the business. I would say right now that spread is probably a little bit more than what I would think about through the cycle. But all that said, we would expect to price in excess of our cost inflation consistent with what we've done over the last couple of years and drive margin expansion in the business. Trevor Romeo : Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Jon Vander Ark : And then in terms of moving away from the [industries] (ph) or rotating away from CPI, we continue to maintain incremental progress on that. So couple of big contracts moving to water sewer trash, and it's really some moving to fixed and above them, it's really the portfolio that we think positions us well across the cycle. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, we're about 61% of those contracts that were historically pegged to headline CPI that have moved to something that we would consider favorable. Trevor Romeo : Got it. Okay. Thank you both. That's helpful. And then just quickly, wondering if we could talk about labor availability a bit. I think based on the BLS data, wage inflation in your industry is kind of mid-single digits. Curious if that's still what you're seeing as well. And then just kind of as the overall labor market has maybe cooled a bit the past few months? Have you seen any changes in labor availability? Jon Vander Ark : We mentioned turnover down 100 basis points year-over-year. We continue to trend in a really positive direction there. Labor cost inflation is 4.5-ish percent, we're hanging out right there. And again, that cake is largely baked because we start -- we give our people a wage increase at the end of February. On that front, we expect that to step down marginally as we move into next year based on where the current numbers are pointing. And then yes, labor availability is improving. There's still categories like technicians, which have been historically tough in this industry and that you're getting tougher. That's why we vertically integrated into technical education and sort of our own tech Institute and are growing our own and having a lot of success fielding entry-level techs out of that center. Trevor Romeo : Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate the color. Operator : And your next question today comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thank you so much. I was hoping to ask for some additional color on the core price deceleration this quarter? I know you mentioned the anniversarying of the new fees from last year. Obviously, that was expected. Anything else that you would point to in the quarter to call out that was notable in terms of the price environment and how we should be thinking about it as we progress through the year. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. If you take a look at the sequential step down from Q2 to Q4, I also point out that the restricted portion of our business went from 5.6% to 4.9%. And that's just on the price increase perspective. So again, that's just reflective of the indices themselves. And again, and as expected, right? We knew that it would step down sequentially, as I mentioned previously, so is our cost inflation. And as long as we can maintain that spread, that's how we drive margin expansion in the business. Toni Kaplan : Great. And I did want to ask about volume as well. I know you mentioned the special waste and the construction softness. Should we continue to expect those trends to continue in the upcoming quarters? And anything else to call out on the volume side would be helpful. Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. Look, I think across the industry in the last 12 to 18 months, we're in a flat to slightly negative demand environment from a unit standpoint. So it probably hasn't been talked about or well understood. On that front, and it's a cyclical portions driving that. It's also true a little bit in the industrial side of the business, it's where a large container permanent, right, we're gaining customers. So we're gaining share there, but we're seeing activity that has continued to be relatively soft at individual customers on that front. Look, on the construction side, whether this happens in three to six months or it happens in nine to 12 months, I'm optimistic on that side of the business for both commercial and residential. Interest rates coming down certainly helps with that. You've got both sides of the aisle talking about housing policy. We've underbuilt single-family homes in the United States in the last 15 years. And so, there's a lot of pent-up demand on that front. And then we're starting to see some really interesting signs here on special waste and the industrial activity, and there's always a little bit of paralysis in an election year, and we're starting to see a pipeline that's been actually quite strong all year, but jobs haven't moved and those jobs are starting to move here in the fourth quarter. So we're pretty optimistic for the remainder of the year and certainly into 2025. Toni Kaplan : Super. Thank you. Operator : And your next question today comes from Kevin Chang with CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon and congrats on some good results. I think on the Q2 call, you mentioned just on M&A here. You had mentioned, I think, about a $300 million pipeline that are in advanced stages. It looks like you booked about $200 million in Q3 here. Just wondering as we think of that incremental $100 million, is that something you think you can close by year-end. Or is there an update to that pipeline as you kind of work through that pipeline? Jon Vander Ark : Maybe broader backdrop, coming off three really great years of M&A. Our commitment to M&A has certainly not dwindled and our outlook and our optimism going forward hasn't changed. There's always some ebb and flow. So we closed a couple of really big deals in Q4 last year, first half got off to a little bit of a slower start this year. I think if you put together what we've already done this year and what we expect to close in the fourth quarter, we're more like $300 million where we gave you an indicator of closer to $500 million at the start of the year. A lot of those deals are starting to build here, and so I expect us to have a really good first half next year on that front. So that gives you a sense of kind of the movement on that front. But our -- our outlook and our enthusiasm for M&A remains strong, and we expect that to be a meaningful contributor next year. Kevin Chiang : No, that's helpful. And just my second one here, I think about a month ago, you put place an order for about 100 EVs. And I think you're targeting, I think, half of new purchases in 2028 will be electric vehicle -- electric vehicles. I guess when we hear other commercial fleet operators, there seems to be a growing pushback on, I guess, adopting this technology, whether the arguments of technology is not ready yet or infrastructure is not ready. Just as you think of your EV strategy in that 2028 time line, just I guess how you see the OEMs their ability to keep pace, I guess, with the targets you have, I guess, just looking out kind of four years from now? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, definitely there will be people that move faster and people that move slower. I mean we've learned from all kinds of experience that EV isn't just a truck, it's a system, so you need to understand how to put in the infrastructure and get after that early. You need to understand the incentive environment on that front because that certainly accelerates adoption and shortens the payback period, and we've had teams working on that for three years. And given the unlock is somebody building a truly studs up EV vehicle. No one's ever done that in our space before until Oshkosh for their McNeils vehicle. And that's a game changer because that allows you to get enough battery power on the vehicle that you can run a full day without sacrificing payload. And that was always the design parameter we had, which is we're not going to sacrifice productivity to do that. So we're thrilled with the product that we are running. I think there'll be other OEMs. Hopefully, they get there. This [indiscernible] sense people to move, but there's certainly going to be winners and losers in the short to medium term in terms of pace of adoption. Kevin Chiang : Thanks for taking my question. Operator : And your next question today comes from Konark Gupta with Scotia Capital. Please go ahead. Konark Gupta : Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to catch up on the housekeeping items first on the M&A side. Do you talk about the rollover effect in 2025 based on what you have closed today? Brian DelGhiaccio : The rollover impact. Yes. So we would expect right now to see relatively negligible to 2025 growth. It's 10 to 20 basis points at this point. Konark Gupta : Okay. And obviously, there's probably upside if you are out to close some of the acquisitions you're talking about in Q4, maybe then. Brian DelGhiaccio : That is correct. Because that only includes that, which is actually closed through the third quarter, there would be a rollover impact of anything that closes in the fourth quarter. Konark Gupta : Makes sense. Thank you. And then my question is on the margin side. So if I look at the trend this year so far, your margins have sequentially expanded and you talked to some of the kind of nuances on Q3 for sure. But then Q4, the margin kind of drops on an implied basis. Heading into 2025, I'm just thinking like what are some of the puts and takes you're thinking about margin as some of the circularity projects are ramping up, maybe and then some of these headwinds might fade away next year. What's the best sort of proxy for thinking about margin expansion next year? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We're certainly not giving 2025 guidance, but an outlook that we've talked about in the prepared remarks and we mentioned often to investors is that, we want to grow revenue mid-single digits and then grow EBITDA margin or EBITDA slightly faster than that, which implies EBITDA margin expansion and free cash flow was slightly faster than that. And EBITDA margin across the cycle, kind of, I think, 30 to 50 basis points. Obviously, this year is going to be stronger than that, but we would certainly go into next year kind of in that ZIP code in terms of our expectations of how we're going to expand margin in the business. Konark Gupta : Okay. That\u2019s fair and great color. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : And your next question today comes from David Manthey with Barrett. Please go ahead. David Manthey : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. It's less than three years since the Ecol acquisition and I believe you said that EBITDA in Environmental Solutions is about 24%. Going back to 2021, Ecol stand-alone targets were like $17 million and I think $40 million of synergies probably picks you up 300 basis points, 400 basis points. Is the delta there, the remainder? Is that just improved pricing? Or is there any kind of acquisition mix benefit in that improvement as well? Any help you can give us there? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, all above, it's in every lever. So starting out with -- on the revenue side, it's customer mix. So we're going through verticals and understanding willingness to pay and where we have pricing power and what the more profitable verticals are and less profitable verticals. So you've seen some customer churn in that space this year as we've certainly pushed price because our services are valuable and found lots of willingness to pay and a few people that want to experience lower quality for a period of time in that front. And then just the pricing of -- is the top pricing, very tactical account level pricing, kind of looking at every lever there still more upside, certainly there going forward as we put in the systems and technology to give our team members better tools on that front. And then good cost management, cost discipline, right, better labor utilization. As we get bigger, especially in the field services side of the business, you're able to deploy labor in different markets and therefore, get better utilization rates on that labor. So really proud of the team and the work we've done there. We said we thought we could get to 25% of the midterm target, and there's an ebb and flow across quarters, of course, but we've made faster progress than I think we originally anticipated and have high aspirations for that business to grow both units and margin going forward. David Manthey : I appreciate it. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question today comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Tobey Sommer : Just following up on the Environmental Services and US Ecology business. What's your -- is your changes in your view on the long-term margins that you think you can approach over sort of many years in that business? And I'd love to get your perspective on the disposal market digesting incremental capacity, I think there's an incinerator coming online. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, about 25% free cash flow converges with the recycling and waste business across the cycle, just given the lower capital intensity of that business. Over time, the longer term, we don't see a constraint of why EBITDA margin in that business couldn't be very similar to the recycling waste business. Just given the nature of the products, right? These are very technical complicated waste streams. The limited number of outlets requires a lot of environmental compliance to handle those appropriately on that front. And so, we think that\u2019s very valuable service, and we're going to continue to price for that over time. In terms of new incineration coming online, it's welcomed. The industry has been short supplied for a long period of time, and we don't see that as a challenge or a constraint. We see that as an opportunity, because there's pent-up demand that, that new capacity will be able to fulfill. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. In terms of the pace of M&A, it's been a little bit slower than I had anticipated year-to-date. I was wondering if you could speak to that as well as the margin profile of the targets generally? I'm wondering to the extent supply chain fleet, wage growth, technology and other factors have actually what sort of pressured the margins of the targets that you're looking at. Jon Vander Ark : Yes, I mentioned the ebb and flow of pace of M&A. Again, it's not -- we're going to stay disciplined. I think in fact, we just looked at this, we're eight to one, right? For every eight opportunities that we look at, eventually we close one of those. Because we're going to be very disciplined. First is going to have to meet our strategic hurdles and we are the national owners for this. So is it A, fit and B, does it meet our financial stream on that. And so we're looking for cash-on-cash returns double digit post synergy on that. So we're going to remain very disciplined. And again, there's ebb and flow lots of conversations. Sometimes those things break quickly and sometimes they take a little longer, right, in that front. And that's the period we're in right now, but again, our enthusiasm has not changed. In terms of the margin profile, it's less about what it has today and more about what it can become because oftentimes in these businesses, we're going to park the trucks, right? We're going to recapitalize the fleet. We are going to layer into our IT systems, right? Some of those drivers will come over, some won't because we layer it right into our [density] (ph) and so we can take routes out of the system and do the same amount of work and that\u2019s why we drive so much value in these deals. Tobey Sommer : Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question today comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Jon Vander Ark : Good afternoon, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey, I got a couple of questions here. So first, I want to kind of come back to the implied Q4 guide. But if I use the high end, it implies that Q4 is around $1.2 billion, which I think is down high single digit from Q3, which is just worse than normal seasonality. And I get that you've got the 60 basis points from bad debt and insurance, but it still feels a little conservative? Or am I missing something? Jon Vander Ark : I would say -- in the opening remarks, we talked about low end of the revenue guide, high end of the EBITDA margin guide. That's -- we're getting towards the end of the year. We're focusing our plans on 2025 on that front. We don't put a lot of time, attention and energy in getting decimal level accurate, right, on updating the guide. We gave you the markers we had and we\u2019re feeling really good about where we're going to end up Q4 and 2025. Tyler Brown : Okay. That's fair. And then just to be kind of clear on the implied volume guidance in Q4, is there any benefit from hurricane cleanup efforts in there? Jon Vander Ark : There may be a little bit. Again, we don't plan on that, certainly. Sometimes you get actually a quite a nice lift coming out of these. Sometimes you get a little less than you think about. Our primary focus is, first, taking care of our people. Some of them have been deeply impacted, especially in Helene. And so we're going to get them back on their feet. And when they're back on their feet, they can get back to work on that front. And then on the back end, oftentimes, we end up making some money that helps pay for that more. But if that comes, that's just icing on the gate. Tyler Brown : And then I want to kind of come at 2025 a little bit different, because I think there's actually quite a bit going on next year. There's actually a number of moving pieces, discrete pieces, if I'm not mistaken, because I think you have polymer, Blue Polymer plants coming online, you mentioned that. I think your RISE platform still has some incremental benefit that you should get, I think you have maybe $40 million of savings to go there. I think MPower comes on, that's going to be a modest benefit, you should have at least some benefit from RNG. So Brian, I don't know if you can, but can you kind of maybe bucket all that together. But how much do those incremental drivers help 2025? Is it $50 million, $100 million? Just any broad buckets would be very helpful, if you can. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. Let's take those. Let's just talk about sustainability innovation, which would include the RNG portfolio, polymer center and blue polymers, right? So next year, if you think about what we're expecting from an incremental, so this would be 2025 over 2024. It's about $75 million of revenue and $30 million to $35 million worth of EBITDA. So again, coming in at a nice incremental accretive margin to the portfolio, primarily driven by the RNG side of that. As you mentioned, we do expect some benefits from MPower. But remember, we're going to deploy that in a phased approach. And we just started the initial business units that are getting that system, so that will be deployed throughout the year. And as we exit 2025, we would expect to be fully deployed. So we called out $20 million of benefit at run rate. So you can kind of think about half of that or so being realized in 2025 with the other half then in 2026. And to your question on the RISE platform and some of the fees that we're generating, we talked about from a fee perspective that we've realized over $60 million of those fees, but that's already in the run rate. right? So we've had that throughout the year, and we're starting to comp that in Q3 of this year. From a product perspective, you can think we've got about $25 million more to go. You can think about half of that coming in 2025, half in 2026. Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay, perfect. So there's some in 2025 into 2026. Now the other thing is, will there be, based on what we know today an alternative tax credit onset headwind? Brian DelGhiaccio : You're talking about the CNG tax credit? Tyler Brown : Correct. Correct. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. We are not assuming that in 2025, and we just follow the law. And so again, right now, that's set to expire. So that is not included in our projection for 2025. Jon Vander Ark : And that's about -- for us, that runs about $15 million. Tyler Brown : Sorry, 15? Brian DelGhiaccio : 15. Tyler Brown : Yes. Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you, guys. Operator : And your next question today comes from Brian Butler with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brian Butler : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first one, can we talk maybe about where internal inflation has been running as compared to the CPI headline kind of what was that trending in the third quarter? And how does that look in the fourth quarter and then, I guess, 2025, if you have any color? Jon Vander Ark : Yes, a good story, right? You're seeing that inflation come down. So I mentioned labor about 4.5%, and that's a pretty good indication of the overall cost inflation. There's some puts and takes in our categories. Maintenance has been a real highlight in terms of that was the category certainly is running hot the last couple of years, and that's improved from lots of different reasons. One, we're getting truck deliveries. So putting out our parking older trucks and taking on new trucks with less maintenance intensity. And then also turnover continues to decline. We're doing more work internally versus outsourcing it to third parties, and that's a cheaper labor rate. Parts inflation certainly modulated as well, so all those pieces are helping on that side. And we expect that continue to improve modestly into 2025, so continued deceleration. Brian Butler : Okay. Great. And then when you went through the buckets kind of on what rolls into 2025 for sustainability [ePower] (ph), right? How should we think about the capital spending that's attached to that versus what was spent in 2024? Brian DelGhiaccio : Relatively consistent. If you remember, when you think about what we're doing when we're investing in RNG, when we're making those investments, that's in a JV structure. So that comes through more like an acquisition than it does CapEx. But when you think about polymer center and when you think about what we're going to do from an EV perspective, we would expect those to be on par what we did this year, slightly higher, but nothing of note to change the CapEx as a percent of revenue. Brian Butler : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question today comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Hi. Thanks, folks. I think in the last quarter, 32% EBITDA margins could be achievable over time. And [indiscernible]. So well done. I want to ask about Environmental Solutions. I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned it was largely due to the acquisition, but there revenue growth. Can you just talk a little bit about the organic trends in the quarter, maybe how you see the pipeline for the year shaping up? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. There's certainly -- there also been some churn, which I mentioned, right? And we are going to continue to test the bounds of customer willingness to pay. We believe you have to do that as a leader in the marketplace when the services are highly valued. And we also know that customers come back around. They experience with a different provider. And with high-quality service, where we're engaged with them from a safety standpoint, sustainability standpoint, digital standpoint, that has value. Ultimately, those customers oftentimes come back on that front. So little flat -- more flat this year from a volume standpoint than we would have hopped, pricing obviously exceeded our expectations. And when forced to choose, I'll take that trade-off all day. Now I push the team that we want to grow above units and price, and we'll have a plan to do that in 2025. Noah Kaye : And to that point, you talked about maybe some faster pace of margin [indiscernible] reasonable to think about for ES versus overall, you talked about the 30 bps for the overall business. Sort of like 100 bps is kind of the right level on an annual basis to be thinking about the segment? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. I think we've talked about 80 to 100 basis points kind of across the cycle and some years out a little faster and some years may be slower. But if you look at the trend, I think that's a ratable pace where we could take margins. Noah Kaye : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question today comes from Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sabahat Khan : Great. Just a follow-up on the last question there. Just in terms of the discussions you're having with your customers as the absolute level of headline inflation is moderating, just their willingness to sort of give that spread over the cost base? And are you finding it easier or harder than it was maybe a year ago and is sort of the directional rate cuts and things like that helping at all? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : I would say broadly, if we're in a world of 2.5%, 3%. 3.5%, 4% inflation, that's a pretty good spot for us to be, right? We've seen what really high inflation looks like, and that was certainly sustainable and are workable for a period of time. Over time, that's very unworkable because of what the Fed will do and as they'll end up crashing the economy to bring that down. We've lived in a period of incredibly low inflation, and that's really hard because we're going to give our people a wage increase every year as we know that their real costs are going to go up on that front. So living in, again, that kind of 3%, 3.5% zone is a really good spot for us to be. Sabahat Khan : Great. And then just on the volume front, maybe if you can just give some perspective on. I think as these rates get cut, I think you're indicating you want pricing and unit volume growth next year, ideally, maybe just some perspective on your -- what you're seeing on the economic activity of the cyclical units? And then secondly, where you are on the volume churn front, if there's any more, that's still to come in 2025? Thanks. Jon Vander Ark : Yes. I think I mentioned in the past that from a churn standpoint, every time we do M&A, there's always going to be some work that we're going to churn out of the portfolio. There's going to be some municipal contracts. We know that we are going to upgrade or replace in terms of price, and we know that there's likely some broker work that we don't treat those as customers. We treat people who generate recycling and waste as customers. So that's going to get churned out of the portfolio. We're seeing that this year for sure, on that front. And the on cyclical volume, listen, the construction is down [indiscernible] business is certainly down year-over-year 10% from a unit standpoint quarter-over-quarter. And so that's just a reflection of what's happening in the underlying construction activity. And I think what the really good news is, given, again, this broader demand environment, which is when you put all the pieces together, right, something south of flat, right? You're seeing really good pricing behavior and conduct and performance. And I think if you take a look 20 years back, you just would not have seen that. You would have seen people chasing units to try to keep trucks utilized. And what we're doing and others apparently are parking vehicles and understanding that your people need to have a wage increase every year, and it's important to go out and price. And so, I think you're seeing a market that's behaving rationally and that's really beneficial. And as we see, again, really good growth indicators on the horizon, whether that's three months, six months, nine months, but we're pretty optimistic on that front. A little bit of volume will be a really good place to be. Brian DelGhiaccio : Some of the contract losses as well as Jon mentioned, right, some of this is just comping out some losses that happened earlier in the year. So for example, residential, we were down 2.9% year-over-year in the third quarter. Most of that is going to anniversary as we exit the year. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re necessarily expecting any sort of robust growth in residential. It\u2019s just the absence of a headwind that we\u2019ve been experiencing all year long. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Operator : And your next question today comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi, thanks you. I wanted to go back to the 3Q versus 4Q margin trend. And it seems like I get the 60 basis points of potentially onetime benefit. But is that just taking a step back, is it just commodity prices that are coming down in the fourth quarter that reflects the change in year-over-year margins? Or was there something in the prior year comp to be aware of? Or is there any other factor? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes, I would say, look, as you look at last year, from a prior year comp perspective, historically, you've seen margin step down from Q3 to Q4 and last year, they were flat, right? They were equal to each other. So there's certainly a tougher comp. But as Jon mentioned earlier, we feel really good about our prospects and how we're going to finish up this year, and we'll be able to sit there and tell you how we finish out the year in February. Faiza Alwy : Understood. And then just a housekeeping question for 2025, if you can. First, I just want to confirm if there's any level of rollover acquisitions that we should be keeping in mind for 2025. And then like anything below the line, whether its interest expense, I know you have some notes that are coming up or the tax rate or any of those below-the-line type of things that we should keep in mind? Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. From a rollover perspective, as we said earlier, about 10 basis points to 20 basis points of rollover based on that, which is already closed. Obviously, that would increase for any deals that we closed in the fourth quarter, right? So we -- again, we can give you some of that flavor when we get back together in February. As far as some of the other components, I mean, if you can take a look at the maturities of what's coming due next year, they are at lower rates than current rates. So we would expect some increase in overall interest expense just due to rate on the fixed rate debt, but nothing overly significant. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question today comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Maybe just to follow up to actually Tyler's question. I appreciate the -- maybe the quantifying the benefit of some of your digital efforts of the RISE platform. But maybe you could remind us what is left in terms of kind of rolling out some of those systems and capabilities. I know this year is putting a lot of tablets in the cabs and making sure you're capturing some of the overhang surcharges, what's next as we think about 2025 as you phase out -- I'm sorry, phase in the next batch of capabilities? Thank you. Brian DelGhiaccio : Yes. I mean now that you've got the platform in place really kind of ratcheting up what you do from a route sequencing in order to sit there and optimize those routes and then ultimately, adherence, right? To make sure that the drivers are running the routes as designed. So again, we put this flavor out there before is that a minute across our system is worth about $5 million annually. So it doesn\u2019t take a lot of seconds and minutes to add up to something meaningful, and that's what we think that the next rev of our digital platform can yield. Jon Vander Ark : And more broadly over the last four or five years, we've done a good job of just rapidly replacing and modernizing all of our systems without taking some big onetime CapEx event or creating any institutional risk, and so we've done it with our marketing and sales. We've done it with HR. We've done it with procurement. We've done it now with our assets. We've done it on the operating side of our business, and we're working on [indiscernible] cash, and there'll be another wave of benefits there as we think about still a lot of transactional work that we can automate on that front. So those will be opportunities that won't hit necessarily in 2025. We'll get some of those, but really into 2026 and 2027. So it's a great story and then it makes the employee value proposition stronger. It provides better customer service, and we're going to be able to operate the business more efficiently. Stephanie Moore : Got it. It makes a lot of sense. And then maybe switching gears, just to -- on the recycling side of your business, not the polymer centers or the like. So would you just think of your traditional [indiscernible], maybe talk about any kind of retrofitting or automation investments or anything that you might have planned? Or do you feel like you might be implemented here in 2025 for the coming years? Jon Vander Ark : Yes. We're doing that every year. Every year, we're putting in new optical sorters and taking out manual work and getting more automation. The primary investment we make in our recycling centers is to produce a better product. Now in order to do that, you put in new capital and you end up taking out some labor, but taking out jobs is never our goal. Our goal is to provide the -- to create the best product we can for the marketplace, which drives more circularity and drives a higher price per product on that front. And so -- and we also -- when we do M&A, we pick up some new recycling centers. There'll be a couple over the next few years that we're going to go studs up because there's markets where we need capacity on that front. But most of our investment is the continued upgrading of the existing 75 or 77. Stephanie Moore : Yes. Thank you so much. Operator : At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Jon Vander Ark : Thank you, Nick. I want to thank the entire Republic Services team for their commitment to exceeding customer expectations and the continued growth and success of our company. Have a good evening and be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
